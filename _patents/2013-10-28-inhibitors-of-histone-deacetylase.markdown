These compounds are useful for promoting cognitive function and enhancing learning and memory formation. These compounds are useful for treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing various conditions, including for example, neurological disorders, memory and cognitive function disorders\/impairments, extinction learning disorders, fungal diseases and infections, inflammatory diseases, hematological diseases, and neoplastic diseases in humans and animals.","Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) have been shown to modulate transcription and to induce cell growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis. HDAC inhibitors also enhance the cytotoxic effects of therapeutic agents used in cancer treatment, including radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Marks, P., Rifkind, R. A., Richon, V. M., Breslow, R., Miller, T., Kelly, W. K. Histone deacetylases and cancer: causes and therapies. Nat Rev Cancer, 1, 194-202, (2001); and Marks, P. A., Richon, V. M., Miller, T., Kelly, W. K. Histone deacetylase inhibitors. Adv Cancer Res, 91, 137-168, (2004). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that transcriptional dysregulation may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, and ischemia.

Remodeling chromatin and stress resistance in the central nervous system: histone deacetylase inhibitors as novel and broadly effective neuroprotective agents. Curr Drug Targets CNS Neurol Disord, 4, 41-50, (2005). A recent review has summarized the evidence that aberrant histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC) activity may represent a common underlying mechanism contributing to neurodegeneration. Moreover, using a mouse model of depression, Nestler has recently highlighted the therapeutic potential of histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDAC5) in depression. Tsankova, N. M., Berton, O., Renthal, W., Kumar, A., Neve, R. L., Nestler, E. J. Sustained hippocampal chromatin regulation in a mouse model of depression and antidepressant action. Nat Neurosci, 9, 519-525, (2006).","There are 18 known human histone deacetylases, grouped into four classes based on the structure of their accessory domains. Class I includes HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 and have homology to yeast RPD3. HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 belong to class IIa and have homology to yeast. HDAC6 and HDAC10 contain two catalytic sites and are classified as class IIb. Class III (the sirtuins) includes SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6, and SIRT7. HDAC11 is another recently identified member of the HDAC family and has conserved residues in its catalytic center that are shared by both class I and class II deacetylases and is sometimes placed in class IV.","There is still much to be understood about the family of HDACs, including the varying functions of different HDACs and the range of HDAC substrates. In order to learn more about the role that the individual HDACs play, it is important to develop compounds showing selectivity for individual isoforms or small subsets of these isoforms. While some degree of isoform selectivity has been shown by a few compounds, this problem of identifying selective inhibitors is far from solved, and the problem is complicated by the interactions of the HDACs with each other as well as other proteins (cofactors) that can possibly alter their interaction with various inhibitors (Glaser, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 325, 683-690 (2004). Clinically, the optimal dose, timing and duration of therapy, as well as the most appropriate agents to combine with HDAC inhibitors, are also still to be defined.","The findings to date suggest that HDAC inhibitors have great therapeutic potential in promoting cognitive function, enhancing learning and memory, and treating disease. There is a need to identify specific\/selective HDAC inhibitors and to identify the structural features required for potent HDAC inhibitory activity.","The present invention provides compounds useful for the inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC).

For exemplification of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts see, e.g., Berge, S. M, Bighley, L. D., and Monkhouse, D. C., 66:1, 1977. Compounds of this invention which are amines, are basic in nature and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.","Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the invention can be formed by reacting a compound of the invention with an equimolar or excess amount of acid. Alternatively, hemi-salts can be formed by reacting a compound of the invention with the desired acid in a 2:1 ratio, compound to acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzene, or the like. The salts normally precipitate out of solution within about one hour to about ten days and can be isolated by filtration or other conventional methods.","Inorganic acids commonly employed to form such salts include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.

Thus, the present invention is intended to cover prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, methods of delivering the same and compositions containing the same. \u201cProdrugs\u201d are intended to include any covalently bonded carriers that release an active parent drug of the present invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the invention wherein a hydroxyl or amino, group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the present invention is administered to a mammalian subject, it cleaves to form a free hydroxyl or free amino group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate, and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the present invention.","\u201cSolvate\u201d means a solvent addition form that contains either a stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as HO, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.","The term \u201csuitable solvent\u201d refers to any solvent, or mixture of solvents, inert to the ongoing reaction that sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to afford a medium within which to effect the desired reaction.","The compounds described herein can have asymmetric centers. Compounds of the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C\u2550N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and can be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separate isomeric forms. All chiral, diastereomeric, racemic, and geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. All tautomers of shown or described compounds are also considered to be part of the present invention. Furthermore, the invention also includes metabolites of the compounds described herein.","The invention also comprehends isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the formulae of the invention, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, such as 3H, C, C, H and F.","Compounds of the present invention and salts, hydrates, solvates or prodrugs of said compounds that contain the aforementioned isotopes and\/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of the present invention. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H, C are incorporated, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. C and F isotopes are particularly useful in PET (positron emission tomography). PET is useful in brain imaging. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances, isotopically labeled compounds of this invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention, salts, hydrates, solvates, or prodrugs thereof are not isotopically labelled.","When any variable (e.g., R) occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with one or more Rmoieties, then Rat each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R. Also, combinations of substituents and\/or variables are permissible, but only if such combinations result in stable compounds within a designated atom's normal valency.","As used herein, the term \u201ctreat,\u201d \u201ctreating,\u201d \u201calleviate,\u201d or \u201calleviating\u201d herein, is meant decreasing the symptoms, markers, and\/or any negative effects of a condition in any appreciable degree in a patient who currently has the condition. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered to a subject who exhibits only early signs of the condition for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing the disease, disorder, and\/or condition.","As used herein, the term \u201cprevent,\u201d \u201cprevention,\u201d or \u201cpreventing\u201d refers to any method to partially or completely prevent or delay the onset of one or more symptoms or features of a disease, disorder, and\/or condition. Prevention may be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease, disorder, and\/or condition.","As used herein, \u201csubject\u201d means a human or animal (in the case of an animal, more typically a mammal). In one aspect, the subject is a human. Such subject can be considered to be in need of treatment with an HDAC inhibitor.","As used herein, \u201cunsaturated\u201d refers to compounds or structures having at least one degree of unsaturation (e.g., at least one double or triple bond).

As a result, these compounds are useful in treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing various conditions, including e.g., neurological disorders, memory and cognitive function disorders\/impairments, extinction learning disorders, fungal diseases, inflammatory diseases, hematological diseases, and neoplastic diseases in humans and animals.","Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase","The compounds of the present invention are useful in a variety of applications for human and animal health. The compounds of the invention are histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. A histone deacetylase inhibitor as used herein is a compound that inhibits, reduces, or otherwise modulates the activity of histone deacetylase. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues on proteins, including histones. HDAC inhibitors also show diverse biological functions including effecting gene expression, cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, growth arrest, and\/or apoptosis. (J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46:5097 and Curr. Med. Chem. 2003, 10:2343). In various embodiments, the compounds of the invention reduce HDAC activity by at least about 50%, at least about 75%, or at least about 90% or more. In further embodiments, HDAC activity is reduced by at least about 95% or at least about 99% or more.","One aspect of the invention provides a method of inhibiting histone deacetylase in a cell, comprising contacting a cell in which inhibition of histone deacetylase is desired with an inhibition effective amount of a compound of the invention or a composition thereof. Because compounds of the invention inhibit histone deacetylase(s), they are useful research tools for in vitro study of the role of histone deacetylase in biological processes. Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention, the step of contacting the cell is performed in vitro.","The term an \u201cinhibiting effective amount\u201d is meant to denote a dosage sufficient to cause inhibition of activity of one or more histone deacetylase in a cell, which cell can be in a multicellular organism. The multicellular organism can be a plant, a fungus, or an animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. The fungus may be infecting a plant or a mammal, preferably a human, and could therefore be located in and\/or on the plant or mammal. If the histone deacetylase is in a multicellular organism, the method according to this aspect of the invention comprises administering to the organism a compound or composition of the invention. Measurement of the effect of a compound of the invention on the enzymatic activity of a histone deacetylase is achieved using known methodologies. For example, Bradner, J. et al. Nature Chemical Biology, Vol. 6, March 2010, 238-243.","The potential of HDAC inhibitors is tremendous, but the development of clinical compounds will likely require the design of isoform selective compounds to minimize side effect issues e.g., fatigue, anorexia, hematological and GI-toxicity. Isoform specific HDAC inhibitors provide advantages by reducing toxicities associated with inhibition of other HDACs. Specific HDAC inhibitors provide a higher therapeutic index, resulting in better tolerance by patients during chronic or long term treatment. While several HDAC inhibitors are now in the clinic, most of these do not show significant selectivity for individual HDAC isoforms.","HDACs are classified into four classes depending on sequence identity, domain, organization, and function. Compounds of the invention are predominately inhibitors of class I histone deacetylases. Class I enzymes (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8) range in size from 42-55 kDa, and are homologs of yeast Rpd3. They are ubiquitously expressed, predominantly nuclear and mainly function as transcriptional corepressors.","In some other embodiments, the compound reduces the activity of fewer than all histone deacetylases in the cell. In certain embodiments, the compound reduces the activity of one histone deacetylase (e.g., HDAC1) or a sub-group of histone deacetylases (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3) to a greater extent than other histone deacetylases. Where the compound preferentially reduces the activity of a sub-group of histone deacetylases, the reduction in activity of each member of the sub-group may be the same or different.","In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to the aforementioned compound, wherein the compounds of the invention are selective HDAC class 1 inhibitors.

Bull. 2003, 37, Suppl. 2, 74-88; Johannessen, CNS Drug Rev. 2003, 9, 199-216; Tsankova et al., 2006, Nat. Neurosci. 9, 519-525).","In one aspect, the invention provides methods and compositions for treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing neurological disorders. The term \u201cneurological disorder\u201d as used herein includes neurological diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurological disorder is a condition having as a component a central or peripheral nervous system malfunction. Neurological disorders may cause a disturbance in the structure or function of the nervous system resulting from developmental abnormalities, disease, genetic defects, injury or toxin. These disorders may affect the central nervous system (e.g., the brain, brainstem and cerebellum), the peripheral nervous system (e.g., the cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems) and\/or the autonomic nervous system (e.g., the part of the nervous system that regulates involuntary action and that is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems).","As used herein, the term \u201cneurodegenerative disease\u201d implies any disorder that might be reversed, deterred, managed, treated, improved, or eliminated with agents that stimulate the generation of new neurons. Examples of neurodegenerative disorders include: (i) chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS and ALS, respectively), familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, multiple system atrophy, Wilson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, diffuse Lewy body disease, corticodentatonigral degeneration, progressive familial myoclonic epilepsy, strionigral degeneration, torsion dystonia, familial tremor, Down's Syndrome, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, Hallervorden-Spatz disease, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, dementia pugilistica, AIDS Dementia, age related dementia, age associated memory impairment, and amyloidosis-related neurodegenerative diseases such as those caused by the prion protein (PrP) which is associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, scrapic, and kuru), and those caused by excess cystatin C accumulation (hereditary cystatin C angiopathy); and (ii) acute neurodegenerative disorders such as traumatic brain injury (e.g., surgery-related brain injury), cerebral edema, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord injury, Leigh's disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, lysosomal storage disorders such as lipofuscinosis, Alper's disease, restless leg syndrome, vertigo as result of CNS degeneration; pathologies arising with chronic alcohol or drug abuse including, for example, the degeneration of neurons in locus coeruleus and cerebellum, drug-induced movement disorders; pathologies arising with aging including degeneration of cerebellar neurons and cortical neurons leading to cognitive and motor impairments; and pathologies arising with chronic amphetamine abuse to including degeneration of basal ganglia neurons leading to motor impairments; pathological changes resulting from focal trauma such as stroke, focal ischemia, vascular insufficiency, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia or direct trauma; pathologies arising as a negative side-effect of therapeutic drugs and treatments (e.g., degeneration of cingulate and entorhinal cortex neurons in response to anticonvulsant doses of antagonists of the NMDA class of glutamate receptor) and Wernicke-Korsakoff's related dementia. Neurodegenerative diseases affecting sensory neurons include Friedreich's ataxia, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and retinal neuronal degeneration. Other neurodegenerative diseases include nerve injury or trauma associated with spinal cord injury. Neurodegenerative diseases of limbic and cortical systems include cerebral amyloidosis, Pick's atrophy, and Retts syndrome. The foregoing examples are not meant to be comprehensive but serve merely as an illustration of the term \u201cneurodegenerative disorder.\u201d","In some instances the neurological disorder is a neuropsychiatric disorder, which refers to conditions or disorders that relate to the functioning of the brain and the cognitive processes or behavior. Neuropsychiatric disorders may be further classified based on the type of neurological disturbance affecting the mental faculties. The term \u201cneuropsychiatric disorder,\u201d considered here as a subset of \u201cneurological disorders,\u201d refers to a disorder which may be generally characterized by one or more breakdowns in the adaptation process. Such disorders are therefore expressed primarily in abnormalities of thought, feeling and\/or behavior producing either distress or impairment of function (i.e., impairment of mental function such with dementia or senility). Currently, individuals may be evaluated for various neuropsychiatric disorders using criteria set forth in the most recent version of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health (DSM-IV).","One group of neuropsychiatric disorders includes disorders of thinking and cognition, such as schizophrenia and delirium. A second group of neuropsychiatric disorders includes disorders of mood, such as affective disorders and anxiety. A third group of neuropsychiatric disorders includes disorders of social behavior, such as character defects and personality disorders. A fourth group of neuropsychiatric disorders includes disorders of learning, memory, and intelligence, such as mental retardation and dementia. Accordingly, neuropsychiatric disorders encompass schizophrenia, delirium, attention deficit disorder (ADD), schizoaffective disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, depression, mania, attention deficit disorders, drug addiction, dementia, agitation, apathy, anxiety, psychoses, personality disorders, bipolar disorders, unipolar affective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, irritability, adolescent conduct disorder and disinhibition.","In one embodiment, the neurological disorder is Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, seizure-induced memory loss, schizophrenia, Rubinstein Taybi syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Fragile X, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, ADHD, ADD, dyslexia, bipolar disorder and social, cognitive and learning disorders associated with autism, traumatic head injury, or attention deficit disorder.","In another embodiment, the neurological disorder is an anxiety disorder, conditioned fear response, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobia, social anxiety disorder, or substance dependence recovery.","In some embodiments neurological disorders are treated or prevented by decreasing the amount of DNA damage within the neuronal cell. In some embodiments neurological disorders are treated or prevented by increasing histone deacetylase activity within the neuronal cell. In some embodiments neurological disorders are treated or prevented by decreasing histone acetyl transferase activity within the neuronal cell. In some embodiments neurological disorders are treated or prevented by increasing the activity of class I histone deacetylases.","Enhancing Cognitive Function","In one aspect, the invention provides methods and compositions for promoting cognitive function and enhancing learning and memory formation in both normal subjects as well as those suffering from memory loss and cognitive function disorders\/impairments. A normal subject, as used herein, is a subject that has not been diagnosed with a disorder associated with impaired cognitive function. \u201cCognitive function\u201d refers to mental processes of a subject relating to information gathering and\/or processing; the understanding, reasoning, and\/or application of information and\/or ideas; the abstraction or specification of ideas and\/or information; acts of creativity, problem-solving, and possibly intuition; and mental processes such as learning, perception, and\/or awareness of ideas and\/or information. The mental processes are distinct from those of beliefs, desires, and the like.","Memory Disorders\/Impairment","Transcription is thought to be a key step for long-term memory processes (Alberini, 2009, Physiol. Rev. 89, 121-145). Transcription is promoted by specific chromatin modifications, such as histone acetylation, which modulate histone-DNA interactions (Kouzarides, 2007, Cell, 128:693-705). Modifying enzymes, such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), regulate the state of acetylation on histone tails. In general, histone acetylation promotes gene expression, whereas histone deacetylation leads to gene silencing. Numerous studies have shown that a potent HAT, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), is necessary for long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and long term memory (for review, see Barrett, 2008, Learn Mem 15:460-467).","In contrast, HDACs have been shown to be powerful negative regulators of long-term memory processes. Nonspecific HDAC inhibitors enhance synaptic plasticity as well as long-term memory (Levenson et al., 2004, J. Biol. Chem. 279:40545-40559; Lattal et al., 2007, Behav Neurosci 121:1125-1131; Vecsey et al., 2007, J. Neurosci 27:6128; Bredy, 2008, Learn Mem 15:460-467; Guan et al., 2009, Nature 459:55-60; Malvaez et al., 2010, Biol. Psychiatry 67:36-43; Roozendaal et al., 2010, J. Neurosci. 30:5037-5046). For example, HDAC inhibition can transform a learning event that does not lead to long-term memory into a learning event that does result in significant long-term memory (Stefanko et al., 2009, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 106:9447-9452). Furthermore, HDAC inhibition can also generate a form of long-term memory that persists beyond the point at which normal memory fails. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate cognitive deficits in genetic models of Alzheimer's disease (Fischer et al., 2007, Nature 447:178-182; Kilgore et al., 2010, Neuropsychopharmacology 35:870-880). These demonstrations suggest that modulating memory via HDAC inhibition have considerable therapeutic potential for many memory and cognitive disorders.","Currently, the role of individual HDACs in long-term memory has been explored in two recent studies. Kilgore et al. 2010, Neuropsychopharmacology 35:870-880 revealed that nonspecific HDAC inhibitors, such as sodium butyrate, inhibit class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8) with little effect on the class IIa HDAC family members (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, HDAC9). This suggests that inhibition of class I HDACs may be critical for the enhancement of cognition observed in many studies. Indeed, forebrain and neuron specific over expression of HDAC2, but not HDAC1, decreased dendritic spine density, synaptic density, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. (Guan et al., 2009, Nature, 459:55-60). In contrast, HDAC2 knockout mice exhibited increased synaptic density, increased synaptic plasticity and increased dendritic density in neurons. These HDAC2 deficient mice also exhibited enhanced learning and memory in a battery of learning behavioral paradigms. This work demonstrates that HDAC2 is a key regulator of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, Guan et al. showed that chronic treatment of mice with SAHA (an HDAC 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 inhibitor) reproduced the effects seen in the HDAC2 deficient mice and recused the cognitive impairment in the HDAC2 overexpression mice. The inhibition of the HDAC2 (selectively or in combination with other class I HDACs) is an attractive target for enhancing cognition and facilitating the learning process through increasing synaptic and dendritic density in neuronal cell populations.","HDAC3 is the most highly expressed class I HDAC throughout the brain, including the hippocampus (Broide et al., 2007, J. Mol. Neurosci. 31:47-58). HDAC3 alters gene expression as part of a large complex that contains corepressors, nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid-hormone receptors (SMRT), as well as class IIa HDACs, such as HDAC4 (Guenther et al. 2000, Genes Dev. 14:1048-1057; Li et al., 2000, EMBO J. 19:4342-4350) (for review, see Karagianni, 2007, Oncogene 26:5439-5449). NCoR associates with HDAC3 through the deacetylase activation domain (DAD) of NCoR and a single amino acid substitution (Y478A) in the NCoR DAD results in a mutant protein that is unable to associate with or activate HDAC3 (Alenghat et al., 2008, Nature 456:997-1000). In addition, class IIa HDACs may require interaction with HDAC3 for their HDAC activity (Fischle et al., 2002, Mol. Cell 9:45-57). It has been demonstrated that HDAC3 is a critical negative regulator of long-term memory formation. Specifically, focal deletion of HDAC3 as well as selective inhibition of HDAC3 significantly enhanced long-term memory in a persistent manner (McQuown, 2011, 31(2)764-774).","A \u201cmemory\u201d as used herein refers to the ability to recover information about past events or knowledge. Memories include short-term memory (also referred to as working or recent memory) and long-term memory. Short-term memories involve recent events, while long-term memories relate to the recall of events of the more distant past. Methods of assessing the ability to recall a memory are known to those of skill in the art and may involve routine cognitive tests. Enhancing or retrieving memories is distinct from learning. However, in some instances in the art learning is referred to as memory. Learning, unlike memory enhancement, refers to the ability to create new memories that had not previously existed. Thus in order to test the ability of a compound to effect the ability of a subject to learn rather than recall old memories, the compound would be administered prior to or at the same time as the memory is created. In order to test the ability of a compound to affect recall of a previously created memory the compound is administered after the memory is created and preferably after the memory is lost.","As used herein \u201cage related memory loss\u201d refers to any of a continuum of conditions characterized by a deterioration of neurological functioning that does not rise to the level of a dementia, as further defined herein and\/or as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: 4th Edition of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV, 1994). Age related memory loss is characterized by objective loss of memory in an older subject compared to his or her younger years, but cognitive test performance that is within normal limits for the subject's age. Age related memory loss subjects score within a normal range on standardized diagnostic tests for dementias, as set forth by the DSM-IV. Moreover, the DSM-IV provides separate diagnostic criteria for a condition termed Age-Related Cognitive Decline. In the context of the present invention, as well as the terms \u201cAge-Associated Memory Impairment\u201d and \u201cAge-Consistent Memory Decline\u201d are understood to be synonymous with the age related memory loss. Age-related memory loss may include decreased brain weight, gyral atrophy, ventricular dilation, and selective loss of neurons within different brain regions. For purposes of some embodiments of the present invention, more progressive forms of memory loss are also included under the definition of age-related memory disorder. Thus persons having greater than age-normal memory loss and cognitive impairment, yet scoring below the diagnostic threshold for frank dementia, may be referred to as having a mild neurocognitive disorder, mild cognitive impairment, late-life forgetfulness, benign senescent forgetfulness, incipient dementia, provisional dementia, and the like. Such subjects may be slightly more susceptible to developing frank dementia in later life (See also US patent application 2006\/008517 (Vasogen Ireland limited) which is incorporated by reference). Symptoms associated with age-related memory loss include but are not limited to alterations in biochemical markers associated with the aging brain, such as IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, p-JNK, p-ERK, reduction in synaptic activity or function, such as synaptic plasticity, evidenced by reduction in long term potentiation, diminution of memory and learning.","As used herein \u201cinjury related memory loss\u201d refers to a loss of memory wherein there is damage to the brain, and there may have also been neurological damage. Sources of brain injury include traumatic brain injury such as concussive injuries or penetrating head wounds, brain tumors, alcoholism, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, heart attack and other conditions that deprive the brain of oxygen, meningitis, AIDS, viral encephalitis, and hydrocephalus.","Methods for enhancing memories can include reestablishing access to memories as well as recapturing memories. The term re-establishing access as used herein refers to increasing retrieval of a memory. Although Applicants are not bound by a mechanism of action, it is believed that the compounds of the invention are effective in increasing retrieval of memories by re-establishing a synaptic network. The process of re-establishing a synaptic network may include an increase in the number of active brain synapses and or a reversal of neuronal loss.","Neurogenesis, or the birth of new neuronal cells, was thought to occur only in developing organisms. However, recent research has demonstrated that neurogenesis does indeed continue into and throughout adult life. On going neurogenesis is thought to be an important mechanism underlying neuronal plasticity, enabling organisms to adapt to environmental changes and influencing learning and memory throughout life. In one aspect, the invention includes a method of increasing synaptic density in a subject comprising administering to the subject in need of such increase a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, or prodrug thereof. In one aspect, the invention includes a method of increasing synaptic plasticity in a subject comprising administering to the subject in need of such increase a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, or prodrug thereof. In one aspect, the invention includes a method of increasing dendritic density in neurons in a subject comprising administering to the subject in need of such increase a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, or prodrug thereof.","The invention provides methods for enhancing memory in a subject having a memory disorder. Examples of types of memory disorders include Alzheimer's disease, absent-minded professor, absent-mindedness, amnesia, anterograde amnesia, blackout (alcohol-related amnesia), bromism, childhood amnesia, false memory syndrome, fugue state, hyperthymesia, Korsakoff's syndrome, lacunar amnesia, memory distrust syndrome, memory loss, post-traumatic amnesia, prosopamnesia, psychogenic amnesia, repressed memory, retrograde amnesia, Ribot's Law, selective memory loss, sywald skeid, source amnesia, source-monitoring error, the seven sins of memory, tip of the tongue, transient epileptic amensia, transient global amnesia, and twilight sleep.","In one embodiment, Alzheimer's disease is the memory disorder. Such methods optionally involve administering the inhibitor and monitoring the subject to identify recapture of a memory that was previously lost. Subjects may be monitored by routine tests known in the art.","In other embodiments the alzheimer's subject is one that has late stage Alzheimer's disease. Many of the drugs suggested for treating Alzheimer's disease are designed to treat the early stages of the disease by preventing plaque buildup. The compounds of the invention are useful for treating both early stages and late stages of dementia because they actually improve memory and cognition rather than preventing only plaque accumulation.","Cognitive Function Disorders\/Impairment","The invention relates to methods of treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing cognitive function disorders\/impairments.","Impaired cognitive function refers to cognitive function that is not as robust as that observed in an age-matched normal subject and includes states in which cognitive function is reduced. In some cases, cognitive function is reduced by about 5%, about 10%, about 30%, or more, compared to cognitive function measured in an age-matched normal subject. Cognitive function may be promoted to any detectable degree, but in humans preferably is promoted sufficiently to allow an impaired subject to carry out daily activities of normal life.","In some embodiments, the cognitive function disorders or impairments are associated with, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, seizure induced memory loss, schizophrenia, Rubinstein Taybi syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Fragile X, Lewey body dementia, Vascular dementia, bipolar disorder and social, cognitive and learning disorders associated with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyselexia, learning disorders, traumatic head injury, stroke induced cognitive and motor impairment, traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and neuronal loss mediated cognitive impairment, and attention deficit disorder.","In some embodiments, the cognitive function disorders or impairments are associated with, but not limited to, anxiety disorders, conditioned fear response, panic disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, phobias, social anxiety disorders, substance dependence recovery or Age Associated Memory Impairment (AAMI), and Age Related Cognitive Decline (ARCD).","In some embodiments, the invention relates to methods of treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing vascular dementia. Vascular dementia, also referred to as \u201cmulti-infarct dementia\u201d, refers to a group of syndromes caused by different mechanisms all resulting in vascular lesions in the brain. The main subtypes of vascular dementia are, for example vascular mild cognitive impairment, multi-infarct dementia, vascular dementia due to a strategic single infarct (affecting the thalamus, the anterior cerebral artery, the parietal lobes or the cingulate gyms), vascular dementia due to hemorrhagic lesions, small vessel disease (including, e.g. vascular dementia due to lacunar lesions and Binswanger disease), and mixed Alzheimer's Disease with vascular dementia.","In some embodiments, the invention relates to treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing Huntington's Disease. Huntington's Disease is a neurological disease which results in cognitive decline associated with inexorable progression to death. Cognitive symptoms associated with Huntington's Disease include loss of intellectual speed, attention, and short term memory and\/or behavioral symptoms.","Cognitive function may be assessed, and thus optionally defined, via one or more tests or assays for cognitive function. Non-limiting examples of a test or assay for cognitive function include CANTAB (see for example Fray et al. \u201cCANTAB battery: proposed utility in neurotoxicology.\u201d Neurotoxicol Teratol 1996; 18(4):499-504), Stroop Test, Trail Making, Wechsler Digit Span, or the CogState computerized cognitive test (see also Dehaene et al. \u201cReward-dependent learning in neuronal networks for planning and decision making.\u201d Brain Res. 2000; 126:21729; Iverson et al. \u201cInterpreting change on the WAIS-III\/WMS-III in clinical samples.\u201d Arch Clin Neuropsychol. 2001; 16(2):183-91; and Weaver et al. \u201cMild memory impairment in healthy older adults is distinct from normal aging.\u201d Cogn. 2006; 60(2):146-55). The methods of the invention may be used to promote cognitive function in a normal subject or to treat, alleviate and\/or prevent a subject from having a cognitive dysfunction. A normal subject, as used herein, is a subject that has not been diagnosed with a disorder associated with impaired cognitive function.","Extinction Learning Disorders","In one aspect, the invention relates to methods of treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing extinction learning disorders e.g., a fear extinction deficit.","It has been demonstrated that administration of the HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate or trichostatin A facilitates fear extinction in mice and this enhancement mirrors that caused by commonly used behavioral manipulation and is consistent with other studies demonstrating a role for the hippocampus in the extinction of contextual fear (Lattal, et al., 2007, Behav. Neurosci. 121, 5, 1125-1131).","Compounds of the invention can be used to facilitate the psychological process of extinction learning and thus are useful for treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing neuropsychiatric disorders and other related disorders. Unlike traditional anti-anxiety drugs that are administered on a chronic basis and address physiological symptoms of anxiety, the compounds of the invention can be used on a chronic or acute basis in conjunction with a second therapy e.g., psychotherapy.","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to methods for treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing a subject from having a neuropsychiatric disorder. The methods comprise subjecting the subject to one or more sessions of a combination therapy protocol, where the combination therapy protocol comprises an acute administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention that enhances learning or conditioning in combination with a session of psychotherapy. By \u201cacute administration\u201d is intended a single exposure of the subject to the therapeutically effective amount of the compound that enhances learning or conditioning. In one aspect, the exposure to the compound occurs within about 24 hours prior to initiating the session of psychotherapy, preferably within about 12 hours, and more preferably within about 6 hours prior to initiating the session of psychotherapy. A full course of treatment for the neuropsychiatric disorder entails at least one session of this combination therapy protocol.","For purposes of the present invention, a subject may have a single disorder, or may have a constellation of disorders that are to be treated, alleviated, and\/or prevented by the methods described herein.","The neuropsychiatric disorders contemplated in the present invention include, but are not limited to, fear and anxiety disorders, addictive disorders including substance-abuse disorders, and mood disorders. Within the fear and anxiety disorder category, the invention encompasses the treatment or prevention of panic disorder, specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and movement disorders such as Tourette's syndrome. The disorders contemplated herein are defined in, for example, the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., American Psychiatric Association, Washington D.C., 1994)), which is herein incorporated by reference.","Anxiety-related disorders relate to those disorders characterized by fear, anxiety, addiction, and the like. Patients with anxiety-related disorders can have a single such disorder, or can have a constellation of disorders. The anxiety-related disorders contemplated in the present invention include, but are not limited to, anxiety disorders, addictive disorders including substance-abuse disorders, mood disorders (e.g., depression and\/or bipolar disorder), movement disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, psychogenic erectile dysfunction (impotence resulting from a man's inability to obtain or maintain an erection of his penis), insomnia (e.g. chronic insomnia), and eating disorders (e.g. anorexia).","Anxiety disorders include, but are not limited to, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. The disorders contemplated herein are defined in, for example, the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., American Psychiatric Association, Washington D.C., 1994)).","Movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect the speed, fluency, quality, and ease of movement. Representative movement disorders include but are not limited to ataxia, chorea, myoclonus, dystonia, Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome, tics, and Tourette's syndrome. Movement disorders typically occur as a result of damage or disease in the basal ganglia region of the brain. Movement disorders can result from age-related changes, medications, genetic disorders, metabolic disorders, disease, stroke, or injury. Recovery of movement after stroke or injury may be facilitated when treated according to the methods of the invention.","Addictive disorders are disorders characterized by addiction to an activity or substance, and include, for example, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, and gambling addiction.","Depression refers to the clinical condition known as major depressive disorder, and is characterized by a state of intense sadness, melancholia, or despair that has advanced to the point of being disruptive to an individual's social functioning and\/or activities of daily living. Depression is alleviated if either (or both) the severity or frequency of a symptom of the depression is reduced. However, a subject can be treated for depression in accordance with the methods of the invention irrespective of whether the treatment actually was successful in alleviating the depression.","Insomnia is defined herein as the inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep for a sufficient amount of time during regular sleeping hours. It includes acute insomnia, which occurs in either a transient or short term form, and chronic insomnia. It also includes initial insomnia, defined as difficulty in falling asleep; middle insomnia, defined as awakening in the middle of the night followed by eventually falling back to sleep, but with difficulty; and terminal insomnia, defined as awakening before one's usual waking time and being unable to return to sleep.","As defined by the National Institute of Mental Health, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), also widely known as Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs), cause severe and pervasive impairment in thinking, feeling, language, and the ability to relate to others. These disorders are usually first diagnosed in early childhood and range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, through pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), to a much milder form, Asperger syndrome. They also include two rare disorders, Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder.","Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders that develop in children. Children with ADHD typically have impaired functioning in multiple settings, including home, school, and in relationships with peers. Symptoms of ADHD include impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and inattention.","Typical treatments encompassed by the present invention include combination therapies. For instance, the combination therapy may be a pharmacotherapy (i.e., a compound of the invention) and a behavioral therapy. Behavioral therapy comprises, but is not limited to, electroconvulsive seizure therapy, exercise, group therapy, talk therapy, or conditioning. In another embodiment, the behavioral therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy. Examples of behavioral therapy that may be used in the ongoing methods are described, for example, in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies by K. Dobson, ed., Guilford Publications, Inc., 2002; The new Handbook of Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond by Judith S. S. Beck, Guilford Publications, Inc. 1995 herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Any pharmaceutical active ingredient that is recognized by the skilled artisan as being a pharmacologic agent that enhances learning or conditioning can be used in the methods of the invention. For example, one such class of pharmaceutical active ingredients contemplated herein comprises compounds that increase the level of norepinephrine in the brain. Such compounds include those acting as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, for example tomoxetine, reboxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran, and those compounds that cause release of norepinephrine, for example amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, pemoline, and methylphenidate. Another class of such pharmaceutical active ingredients is those compounds that increase the level of acetylcholine in the brain, including, for example, compounds that block its breakdown. Examples of such compounds include, but are not limited to, donepezil HCl or Aricept\u2122 and tacrine, which inhibit cholinesterase activity.","Methods of the invention also encompass the use in combination with a compound of the invention of any type of psychotherapy that is suitable for the particular psychiatric disorder for which the subject is undergoing treatment. Suitable methods of psychotherapy include exposure based psychotherapy, cognitive psychotherapy, and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy. Methods of the invention also encompass exposing the subject to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), behavioral exposure treatments, virtual reality exposure (VRE) or cognitive remediation therapy.","Methods of the invention also encompass extinction training. The goal of extinction training is to pair a stimulus that previously provoked a deleterious, unwanted response with a new learning that will not lead to a negative outcome, thereby generating in a subject a new, more appropriate response to the stimulus to compete with and ideally replace the previous undesirable response. Extinction training frequently exposes a subject to a stimulus or situation in the absence of an aversive consequence, e.g., a subject that has deleterious, high anxiety responses to a given stimulus or situation is exposed to that stimulus or situation in the absence of an aversive consequence. A typical goal of extinction training is to produce new learning in the subject that results from the pairing of the original stimulus or situation with a non-deleterious outcome, thereby generating, in subsequent exposures to the stimulus, a more appropriate response in place of the unwanted response. An extinction learning event refers to a completed stimulus\/response extinction training cycle.","One form of extinction training entails psychotherapy. For example, the methods of the invention contemplate treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing anxiety disorders by: (i) administering psychotherapy to treat, alleviate, and\/or prevent an anxiety-related disorder in a suitable human subject, and (ii) administering a therapeutically effective dose a compound of the invention to said subject on an achronic, post-training, pre-sleep basis. Suitable methods of psychotherapy include but are not limited to exposure-based psychotherapy, cognitive psychotherapy, and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy.","One method of psychotherapy that is specifically contemplated is the use of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy to treat, alleviate, and\/or prevent an anxiety disorder using the methods of the invention.","Another method of psychotherapy that is particularly beneficial when utilized in combination with a compound or composition of the present invention is cognitive behavioral therapy (\u201cCBT\u201d). CBT is a form of psychotherapy that combines cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, and emphasizes the critical role of thinking in causing people to act and feel as they do. Therefore, if an individual is experiencing unwanted feelings and behaviors, CBT teaches that it is important to identify the thinking that is causing the undesirable feelings and\/or behaviors and to learn how to replace this deleterious thinking with thoughts that lead to more desirable reactions. CBT is widely used to help people who are experiencing a range of mental health difficulties, some of which do not conveniently fit definitions of a particular medical affliction. CBT has been used to treat anxiety disorders, mood disorders, addictive disorders, eating disorders, insomnia, chronic pain, schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorders, among others. Post-extinction training pre-sleep administration of a compound of the invention, subsequent to CBT treatment, can be used to augment the effectiveness of the CBT treatment for these medical conditions.","In one embodiment, subjects suffering from social anxiety disorder undergo weekly cognitive behavioral therapy sessions to treat the affliction. After each therapy session, subjects are administered a therapeutically effective formulation of compounds of the invention on a post-extinction training pre-sleep basis. Relative to subjects treated only via cognitive behavioral therapy, or to subjects treated via cognitive behavioral therapy and a placebo, anxiety associated with social anxiety disorder is expected to be reduced to a greater extent in subjects treated with a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and achronic administration of a compound of the invention on a post-extinction training pre-sleep basis.","In another embodiment of the invention, a compound of the invention is administered after extinction training only if the extinction training yields positive results on that day. For example, a subject undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD is administered a compound of the invention on a post-extinction training only if the cognitive behavioral therapy was deemed to be successful, as determined by the subject and\/or therapist. In one aspect, the compound is administered on a post-extinction, pre-sleep basis. In another aspect, a subject undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD is administered a compound of the invention on a pre-extinction training. In one aspect, the compound is administered on a pre-extinction, pre-sleep basis. This method may also be useful when applied to treatment of autism spectrum disorders or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.","In another embodiment of the invention, subjects afflicted with anxiety disorders such as PTSD receive extinction training using Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), and subsequently are administered a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of the invention on a post-extinction training pre-sleep basis. Another form of extinction training is provided by biofeedback, which is particularly useful in enabling subjects to learn to control physiological processes that normally occur involuntarily, such as blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and skin temperature. As used herein, \u201cbiofeedback\u201d refers to a technique in which subjects are trained to improve their health by using signals from their own bodies to control their own physiological responses.","In one embodiment of the invention, a subject suffering from chronic pain undergoes biofeedback sessions to help alleviate the pain. Upon the conclusion of each session wherein the subject has made progress in learning\/developing responses that reduce the chronic pain, the subject is administered a compound of the invention on a post-extinction training pre-sleep basis in order to consolidate the desired learning.","In another embodiment, a subject suffering from phantom limb syndrome undergoes thermal biofeedback sessions to reduce and hopefully eliminate the symptoms. After each session, the subject is administered a therapeutically effective formulation of a compound of the invention on a post-extinction training pre-sleep basis.","In another embodiment, extinction training can be provided by physical therapy, or virtual reality physical therapy such as virtual reality gait therapy. For example, a stroke victim re-learning how to walk can undergo virtual reality gait therapy, and then be administered a compound of the invention on an achronic, post-extinction training pre-sleep basis.","Another form of extinction training can be provided by pharmacotherapy. For example, a man afflicted with erectile dysfunction can have an extinction learning event based on a positive sexual outcome, including instances wherein the positive sexual outcome was achieved with the pharmacological assistance of a PDE-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and\/or udenafil. By administering a compound of the invention on a post-extinction training pre-sleep basis to a subject with erectile dysfunction, following a successful sexual outcome wherein the subject utilized sildenafil, the heightened confidence and reduced sexual performance anxiety resulting from a successful outcome can be consolidated in said subject's psyche, thereby facilitating extinction of any deleterious performance anxiety associated with sexual intercourse.","Extinction training does not always require intervention of a trained specialist. Individuals can carry out extinction training on themselves.","Fungal Diseases or Infections","In some aspects, the invention relates to a method for treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing a fungal disease or infection comprising administering to a subject a compound of the invention. The invention provides a method for treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing a hospital-acquired fungal infections that attack immunocompromised patients including those with HIV and cancer. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing a fungal disease in a subject not suffering from cancer.","Inflammatory Disease","In some aspects, the invention relates to a method for treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing an inflammatory disease, including but not limited to stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis and traumatic brain injuries (Leoni et al., PNAS, 99(5); 2995-3000 (2002); Suuronen et al. J. Neurochem. 87; 407-416 (2003) and Drug Discovery Today, 10: 197-204 (2005).","Neoplastic Diseases","In some aspects, the invention relates to methods of selectively inducing terminal differentiation, and arresting cell growth and\/or apoptosis of neoplastic cells, thereby inhibiting proliferation of such cells. The compounds of the present invention are useful in treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing cancer in a subject.","The term \u201ccancer\u201d refers to any cancer caused by the proliferation of neoplastic cells, such as solid tumors, neoplasms, carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, lymphomas and the like. In particular, cancers that may be treated, alleviated and\/or prevented by the compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to: cardiac cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, genitourinary tract cancer, liver cancer, nervous system cancer, gynecological cancer, hematologic cancer, skin cancer, and adrenal gland cancer.","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating, or preventing cardiac cancers selected from sarcoma (angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma), myxoma, rhabdomyoma, fibroma, lipoma and teratoma.","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating, or preventing lung cancer selected from bronchogenic carcinoma (squamous cell, undifferentiated small cell, undifferentiated large cell, adenocarcinoma), alveolar (bronchiolar) carcinoma, bronchial adenoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, chondromatous hamartoma, and mesothelioma.","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating or preventing gastrointestinal cancer selected from esophagus (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma), stomach (carcinoma, lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma), pancreas (ductal adenocarcinoma, insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma, carcinoid tumors, vipoma), small bowel (adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, carcinoid tumors, Karposi's sarcoma, leiomyoma, hemangioma, lipoma, neurofibroma, fibroma), and large bowel (adenocarcinoma, tubular adenoma, villous adenoma, hamartoma, leiomyoma).","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing genitourinary tract cancer selected from kidney (adenocarcinoma, Wilm's tumor [nephroblastoma], lymphoma, leukemia), bladder and urethra (squamous cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma), prostate (adenocarcinoma, sarcoma), and testis (seminoma, teratoma, embryonal carcinoma, teratocarcinoma, choriocarcinoma, sarcoma, interstitial cell carcinoma, fibroma, fibroadenoma, adenomatoid tumors, lipoma).","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing liver cancer selected from hepatoma (hepatocellular carcinoma), cholangiocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, angiosarcoma, hepatocellular adenoma, and hemangioma.","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing bone cancer selected from osteogenic sarcoma (osteosarcoma), fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, malignant lymphoma (reticulum cell sarcoma), multiple myeloma, malignant giant cell tumor chordoma, osteochronfroma (osteocartilaginous exostoses), benign chondroma, chondroblastoma, chondromyxofibroma, osteoid osteoma and giant cell tumors.","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing nervous system cancer selected from skull (osteoma, hemangioma, granuloma, xanthoma, osteitis deformans), meninges (meningioma, meningiosarcoma, gliomatosis), brain (astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, glioma, ependymoma, germinoma [pinealoma], glioblastoma multiform, oligodendroglioma, schwannoma, retinoblastoma, congenital tumors), and spinal cord (neurofibroma, meningioma, glioma, sarcoma).","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing gynecological cancer selected from uterus (endometrial carcinoma), cervix (cervical carcinoma, pre-tumor cervical dysplasia), ovaries (ovarian carcinoma [serous cystadenocarcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, unclassified carcinoma], granulosa-thecal cell tumors, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, dysgerminoma, malignant teratoma), vulva (squamous cell carcinoma, intraepithelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, fibrosarcoma, melanoma), vagina (clear cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, botryoid sarcoma (embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma), and fallopian tubes (carcinoma).","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing skin cancer selected from malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Karposi's sarcoma, moles dysplastic nevi, lipoma, angioma, dermatofibroma, keloids, and psoriasis.","In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention relate to methods of treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing adrenal gland cancer selected from neuroblastoma.","In some embodiments, the instant compounds are useful in the treatment, alleviation, and\/or preventing of cancers that include, but are not limited to: leukemias including acute leukemias and chronic leukemias such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Hairy Cell Leukemia;

Hematologic diseases include abnormal growth of blood cells which can lead to dysplastic changes in blood cells and hematologic malignancies such as various leukemias. Examples of hematologic diseases include but are not limited to acute myeloid leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, the myelodysplastic syndromes, and sickle cell anemia.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia that occurs in adults. Several inherited genetic disorders and immunodeficiency states are associated with an increased risk of AML. These include disorders with defects in DNA stability, leading to random chormosomal breakage, such as Bloom's syndrome, Fanconi's anemia, Li-Fraumeni kindreds, ataxia-telangiectasia, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia.","Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) represents a distinct subgroup of AML. This subtype is characterized by promyelocytic blasts containing the 15; 17 chromosomal translocation. This translocation leads to the generation of the fusion transcript comprised of the retinoic acid receptor and a sequence PML.","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogenerous disease with distinct clinical features displayed by various subtypes. Reoccurring cytogenetic abnormalities have been demonstrated in ALL. The most common cytogenetic abnormality is the 9; 22 translocation. The resultant Philadelphia chromosome represents poor prognosis of the patient.","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. CML is characterized by a specific chromosomal abnormality involving the translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, creating the Philadelphia chromosome. Ionizing radiation is associated with the development of CML.","The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders grouped together because of the presence of dysplastic changes in one or more of the hematopoietic lineages including dysplastic changes in the myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic series. These changes result in cytopenias in one or more of the three lineages. Patients afflicted with MDS typically develop complications related to anemia, neutropenia (infections), or thrombocytopenia (bleeding). Generally, from about 10% to about 70% of patients with MDS develop acute leukemia.","Sickle cell disease is attributable to homozygous inheritance of a single amino acid substitution in the \u03b2-globin gene that leads to polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin, deformation of red blood cells, microvascular occlusion, hemolysis, and consequent disease manifestations, including pain, strokes, and pulmonary complications (Bunn H F, 1997, J. Med. 337:762-769). Abundant biochemical, epidemiological, and clinical evidence have shown that a high level of \u03b3 globin, the fetal form of \u03b2 globin, inhibits the aberrant polymerization of sickle hemoglobin and ameliorates the disease phenotype. The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea, causes significant induction of fetal hemoglobin, decreased disease severity, and benefits overall mortality (Letvin et al., 1984, N Engl J Med 310:869-873; Platt O S, et al., 1984, J Clin Invest 74:652-656; Charache S, et al., 1995, N Engl J. Med 332: 317-1322; Steinberg M H, et al., 2003, JAMA 289:1645-1651). Nevertheless, hydroxyurea has bone marrow-suppressive effects and is ineffective in a significant portion of patients (Charache S, et al.; Steinberg M H, et al., 2003; Steinberg M H, 1999, N Engl J. Med 340:1021-1030). A drug that induces fetal hemoglobin more substantially with less myelosuppression would be expected to have greater therapeutic utility in sickle cell disease.","Transcriptional regulation of the human globin gene locus has been investigated intensively. Gamma-globin gene expression is influenced by transcription factors (GATA-1, EKLF, NF-E4p22, Ikaros) and chromatin modifying enzymes [SWI\/SNF complex, HATs, and histone deacetylase (HDACs)] as part of multiprotein complexes, and a unique, dynamic chromatin structure termed the \u03b2-globin active chromatin hub (\u03b2ACH) (8-11).","Polymorphisms in BCL11A, a transcriptional repressor, alter baseline fetal hemoglobin levels, and a multiprotein complex containing BCL11a binds to the \u03b2-globin locus, resulting in repression of \u03b3-globin expression (Menzel S, et al., 2007, Nat Genet 39:1197-1199; Lettre G, et al., 2008, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:11869-11874;\n\nSankaran V G, et al., 2008, Science 322:1839-1842; Uda M, et al., 2008, Proc NATL Acad Sci USA 105:1620-1625; Sankaran V G, et al., 2009, Nature 460:1093-1097). Despite this granularity, discrete targets amenable to ligand discovery efforts have not been identified and functionally validated.\n","The induction of fetal hemoglobin is a validated strategy to improve symptoms and complications of sickle cell disease. The development of targeted therapies has been limited by the absence of discrete druggable targets. Bradner et al., 2010, PNAS, 107:28, 12617-12622 has developed a unique bead-based strategy for the identification of inducers of fetal hemoglobin transcripts in primary human erythroid cells, which includes a small-molecule screen of bioactive compounds that have been identified to have remarkable class-associated activity among histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Using a chemical genetic strategy combining focused libraries of biased chemical probes and reverse genetics by RNA interference, Bradner et al. identified HDAC1 and HDAC2 as molecular targets mediating fetal hemoglobin induction. Isoform-selective inhibitors of HDAC1 and HDAC2 are targets for the treatment of sickle cell disease.","Formulations","The compounds of the invention may be administered alone (e.g., in saline or buffer) or using any delivery vehicles known in the art. For instance the following delivery vehicles have been described: Cochleates; Emulsomes, ISCOMs; Liposomes; Live bacterial vectors (e.g., -); Live viral vectors (e.g., Vaccinia, adenovirus, Herpes Simplex); Microspheres; Nucleic acid vaccines; Polymers; Polymer rings; Proteosomes; Sodium Fluoride; Transgenic plants; Virosomes; Virus-like particles. Other delivery vehicles are known in the art and some additional examples are provided below.","The term an \u201ceffective amount\u201d of a compound of the invention refers to the amount necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. For example, an effective amount of a compound of the invention is that amount sufficient to treat a condition. In another aspect, an effective amount of a compound is that amount sufficient to alleviate a condition. In another aspect, an effective amount of a compound is that amount sufficient to prevent a condition. Combined with the teachings provided herein, by choosing among the various active compounds and weighing factors such as potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, severity of adverse side-effects and preferred mode of administration, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned which does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is entirely effective to treat the particular subject. The effective amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the condition being treated, the particular compounds being administered the size of the subject, or the severity of the condition.","The compounds of the invention may be administered by any route known, such as, for example, orally, transdermally, intravenously, cutaneously, subcutaneously, nasally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intracranially, and intracerebroventricularly.","In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention are administered at dosage levels greater than about 0.001 mg\/kg, such as greater than about 0.01 mg\/kg or greater than about 0.1 mg\/kg. For example, the dosage level may be from about 0.001 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg such as from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, from about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, or from about 1 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. It will also be appreciated that dosages smaller than 0.001 mg\/kg or greater than 50 mg\/kg (for example 50-100 mg\/kg) can also be administered to a subject.","In one embodiment, the compound of the invention is administered once-daily, twice-daily, or three-times daily. In one embodiment, the compound of the invention is administered continuously (i.e., every day) or intermittently (e.g., 3-5 days a week). In another embodiment, administration could be on an intermittent schedule.","Further, administration less frequently than daily, such as, for example, every other day may be chosen. In additional embodiments, administration with at least 2 days between doses may be chosen. By way of example only, dosing may be every third day, bi-weekly or weekly. As another example, a single, acute dose may be administered. Alternatively, compounds of the invention can be administered on a non-regular basis e.g., whenever symptoms begin. For any compound described herein the effective amount can be initially determined from animal models.","Toxicity and efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50\/ED50. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.","Data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the compounds of the invention for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions may comprise, for example, at least about 0.1% of an active compound. In other embodiments, the an active compound may comprise between about 2% to about 75% of the weight of the unit, or between about 25% to about 60%, for example, and any range derivable therein. Multiple doses of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated.","The formulations of the invention are administered in pharmaceutically acceptable solutions, which may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable concentrations of salt, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.","For use in therapy, an effective amount of one or more compounds of the invention can be administered to a subject by any mode that delivers the compound(s) to the desired surface, e.g., mucosal, systemic. Administering the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be accomplished by any means known to the skilled artisan. Compounds of the invention may be administered orally, transdermally, intravenously, cutaneously, subcutaneously, nasally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intracranially, or intracerebroventricularly.","For oral administration, one or more compounds of the invention can be formulated readily by combining the active compound(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject to be treated.","Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and\/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Optionally the oral formulations may also be formulated in saline or buffers, i.e. EDTA for neutralizing internal acid conditions or may be administered without any carriers.","Also specifically contemplated are oral dosage forms of one or more compounds of the invention. The compound(s) may be chemically modified so that oral delivery of the derivative is efficacious. Generally, the chemical modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the compound itself, where said moiety permits (a) inhibition of proteolysis; and (b) uptake into the blood stream from the stomach or intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the compound(s) and increase in circulation time in the body. Examples of such moieties include: polyethylene glycol, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyproline. Abuchowski and Davis, 1981, \u201cSoluble Polymer-Enzyme Adducts\u201d In: Enzymes as Drugs, Hocenberg and Roberts, eds., Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., pp. 367-383; Newmark, et al., 1982, J. Appl. Biochem. 4: 185-189. Other polymers that could be used are poly-1,3-dioxolane and poly-1,3,6-tioxocane. Preferred for pharmaceutical usage, as indicated above, are polyethylene glycol moieties.","The location of release may be the stomach, the small intestine (the duodenum, the jejunum, or the ileum), or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available formulations which will not dissolve in the stomach, yet will release the material in the duodenum or elsewhere in the intestine. Preferably, the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach environment, either by protection of the compound or by release of the biologically active material beyond the stomach environment, such as in the intestine.","To ensure full gastric resistance a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is important. Examples of the more common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D, Aquateric, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit L, Eudragit S, and Shellac. These coatings may be used as mixed films.","A coating or mixture of coatings can also be used on tablets, which are not intended for protection against the stomach. This can include sugar coatings, or coatings which make the tablet easier to swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell (such as gelatin) for delivery of dry therapeutic i.e. powder; for liquid forms, a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick starch or other edible paper. For pills, lozenges, molded tablets or tablet triturates, moist massing techniques can be used.","The compound of the invention can be included in the formulation as fine multiparticulates in the form of granules or pellets of particle size about 1 mm. The formulation of the material for capsule administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs or even as tablets. The compound of the invention could be prepared by compression.","Colorants and flavoring agents may all be included. For example, the compound of the invention may be formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation) and then further contained within an edible product, such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.","One may dilute or increase the volume of compound delivered with an inert material. These diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, a-lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose, sucrose, modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may be also be used as fillers including calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents are Fast-Flo, Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Avicell. Disintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic into a solid dosage form. Materials used as disintegrates include but are not limited to starch, including the commercial disintegrant based on starch, Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlite, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ultramylopectin, sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethyl cellulose, natural sponge and bentonite may all be used. Another form of the disintegrants is the insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered gums may be used as disintegrants and as binders and these can include powdered gums such as agar, Karaya or tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants.","Binders may be used to hold the therapeutic together to form a hard tablet and include materials from natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate the therapeutic.","An anti-frictional agent may be included in the formulation of the compound of the invention to prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the compound and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax 4000 and 6000. Glidants that might improve the flow properties of the drug during formulation and to aid rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogenic silica and hydrated silicoaluminate.","To aid dissolution of the compound into the aqueous environment a surfactant might be added as a wetting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could include benzalkonium chloride or benzethomium chloride. The list of potential non-ionic detergents that could be included in the formulation as surfactants are lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, polysorbate 40, 60, 65 and 80, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be present in the formulation of the compound either alone or as a mixture in different ratios.","Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and\/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Microspheres formulated for oral administration may also be used. Such microspheres have been well defined in the art. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration.","For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.","For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.","Also contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of the compounds of the invention. The compound is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream.

Immunol. 140:3482-3488 (interferon-g and tumor necrosis factor alpha) and Platz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,656 (granulocyte colony stimulating factor). A method and composition for pulmonary delivery of drugs for systemic effect is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,569, issued Sep. 19, 1995 to Wong et al.","Contemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, metered dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultravent nebulizer, manufactured by Mallinckrodt, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.; the Acorn II nebulizer, manufactured by Marquest Medical Products, Englewood, Colo.; the Ventolin metered dose inhaler, manufactured by Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, N.C.; and the Spinhaler powder inhaler, manufactured by Fisons Corp., Bedford, Mass.","All such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing of compound. Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of an appropriate propellant material, in addition to the usual diluents, and\/or carriers useful in therapy. Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other types of carriers is contemplated. Chemically modified compound may also be prepared in different formulations depending on the type of chemical modification or the type of device employed. Formulations suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, will typically comprise compound dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 mg of biologically active compound per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer and a simple sugar (e.g., for stabilization and regulation of osmotic pressure). The nebulizer formulation may also contain a surfactant, to reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the compound caused by atomization of the solution in forming the aerosol.","Formulations for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided powder containing the compound suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, or combinations thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as a surfactant.","Formulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry powder containing compound and may also include a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol, sucrose, or mannitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device, e.g., 50 to 90% by weight of the formulation. The compound should most advantageously be prepared in particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 mm (or microns), most preferably 0.5 to 5 mm, for most effective delivery to the distal lung.","Nasal delivery of a compound of the invention is also contemplated. Nasal delivery allows the passage of a compound of the present invention to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic product to the nose, without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for nasal delivery include those with dextran or cyclodextran.","For nasal administration, a useful device is a small, hard bottle to which a metered dose sprayer is attached. In one embodiment, the metered dose is delivered by drawing the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention solution into a chamber of defined volume, which chamber has an aperture dimensioned to aerosolize and aerosol formulation by forming a spray when a liquid in the chamber is compressed. The chamber is compressed to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In a specific embodiment, the chamber is a piston arrangement. Such devices are commercially available.","Alternatively, a plastic squeeze bottle with an aperture or opening dimensioned to aerosolize an aerosol formulation by forming a spray when squeezed is used. The opening is usually found in the top of the bottle, and the top is generally tapered to partially fit in the nasal passages for efficient administration of the aerosol formulation. Preferably, the nasal inhaler will provide a metered amount of the aerosol formulation, for administration of a measured dose of the drug.","The compound, when it is desirable to deliver them systemically, may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and\/or dispersing agents.","Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions.","Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.","Alternatively, the active compounds may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.","The compounds may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.","In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.","The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.","Suitable liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, aqueous or saline solutions for inhalation, microencapsulated, encochleated, coated onto microscopic gold particles, contained in liposomes, nebulized, aerosols, pellets for implantation into the skin, or dried onto a sharp object to be scratched into the skin. The pharmaceutical compositions also include granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, creams, drops or preparations with protracted release of active compounds, in whose preparation excipients and additives and\/or auxiliaries such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. For a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see Langer, Science 249: 1527-1533, 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The compounds of the invention may be administered per se (neat) or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group.","Suitable buffering agents include: acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w\/v); citric acid and a salt (1-3% w\/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5% w\/v); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2% w\/v). Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03% w\/v); chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w\/v); parabens (0.01-0.25% w\/v) and thimerosal (0.004-0.02% w\/v).","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain an effective amount of a compound of the invention optionally included in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler, diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or other vertebrate animal. The term carrier denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being commingled with the compounds of the invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficiency.","The compounds of the invention may be delivered to the brain using a formulation capable of delivering a compound across the blood brain barrier. One obstacle to delivering compounds to the brain is the physiology and structure of the brain. The blood-brain barrier is made up of specialized capillaries lined with a single layer of endothelial cells. The region between cells is sealed with a tight junction, so the only access to the brain from the blood is through the endothelial cells. The barrier allows only certain substances, such as lipophilic molecules through and keeps other harmful compounds and pathogens out. Thus, lipophilic carriers are useful for delivering non-lipohilic compounds to the brain. For instance, DHA, a fatty acid naturally occurring in the human brain has been found to be useful for delivering drugs covalently attached thereto to the brain (Such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,137). U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,727 describes a dihydropyridine pyridinium salt carrier redox system for the specific and sustained delivery of drug species to the brain. U.S. Pat. No. 5,618,803 describes targeted drug delivery with phosphonate derivatives. U.S. Pat. No. 7,119,074 describes amphiphilic prodrugs of a therapeutic compound conjugated to an PEG-oligomer\/polymer for delivering the compound across the blood brain barrier. The compounds described herein may be modified by covalent attachment to a lipophilic carrier or co-formulation with a lipophilic carrier. Others are known to those of skill in the art.","The compounds of the invention may be delivered with other methods for enhancing memory retrieval or treating other symptoms or causes of disorders associated with the memory loss. For instance, environmental enrichment (EE) has been used for enhancing memories. EE involves creating a stimulating environment around a subject. Other therapeutics may also be combined to treat the underlying disorder or to enhance memory.","Combination Therapies","The invention includes combination therapies including the methods of treating, alleviating, and\/or preventing conditions described herein. Combination therapy includes administering one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically active ingredients or exposing the subject to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, behavioral exposure treatments, virtual reality exposure (VRE) or cognitive remediation therapy.","In one aspect, the combination therapy is for a method of treating, alleviating, or preventing a neurological disorder. In one aspect, the combination therapy is for methods of treating, alleviating, or preventing Alzheimer's disease.

The article may include instructions or labels promoting or describing the use of the compounds of the invention.","Compounds of the invention can be evaluated using a variety of methods known in the art. For example, the following methods can be used to evaluate compounds of the invention: the inhibition of HDAC activity can be determined using a trypsin-coupled protocol and\/or a non-trypsin-coupled Caliper protocol (Schultz, B. E. Biochemistry, 2004, 43, 11083 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 61\/628,562 entitled \u201cFluorescent Substrates for Determining Lysine Deacetylase Activity\u201d filed Nov. 2, 2011); the inhibition of HDAC activity can be determined in cells e.g., imaging of primary neuronal culture; learning tests such as behavioral tests e.g., fear-conditioning can be performed as described in Fischer et al., Neuron 48, 825-838 (2005); the ability of the compounds to reinstate learning behavior and to recover access to long-term memories can be tested in CK-p25 Tg mice that have developed synaptic and neuronal loss (Cruz, J., et al., Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 14, 390-394 (2004); Fisher, A. et al., Neuron 48, 471-83 (2003); Cruz, J. et al., Neuron 40, 471-83 (2003)); the effect of compounds on plasticity factors in CK-p25 Tg mice with severe neurodegeneration can be determined by looking at hiippocampal neuronal loss, for example, by comparing images showing hippocampal NeuN and MAP-2 staining and using immunoblots from the hippocampus and cortex of all groups; one or more specific acetylation marks elicited by the compounds can be determined which are relevant to the treatment of disease (e.g., Rubinstein Taybi); mass spectrometry can be used to identify changes in histone acetylation and methylation states induced in neurons by treatment with the compounds; the identification of gene expression changes upon treatment with compounds of the invention in neurons can be determined using RNA for transcript profile analysis on Illumina microarrays; and the ability of the compounds to selectively inhibit HDACs1\/2 to effect unique conformational changes in the enzymes induced by assembly into these multi-protein complexes can be evaluated by immunoprecipitating HDAC2 complexes from mouse forebrain and by determining the presence and activity of complex members (e.g., CoREST, mSin3a, and Mta3) using in vitro assays.","The following Examples are illustrative and should not be interpreted in any way so as to limit the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0332","num":"0330"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00295","num":"00295"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00295","he":"36.75mm","wi":"57.15mm","file":"US09447030-20160920-C00295.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0333","num":"0331"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00296","num":"00296"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00296","he":"26.33mm","wi":"73.91mm","file":"US09447030-20160920-C00296.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"To a solution of 4-bromo-2-nitroaniline (1, 10.0 g, 46.1 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in DMF (50 mL) at 0\u00b0 C. was added sodium hydride (1.8 g, 73.7 mmol, 1.6 eq.) slowly.

Tests:","All behavioral testing is described in Fischer et al., Neuron 48, 825-838 (2005).","Fear Conditioning Tests:","Context-dependent fear conditioning. Training consists of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box (context) followed by a foot shock (2 sec, 0.5\/0.8\/1.0 mA, constant current). The memory test is performed 24 hr later by re-exposing the mice for 3 min into the conditioning context. Freezing, defined as a lack of movement except for heart beat and respiration associated with a crouching posture, is recorded every 10 sec by two trained observers (one is unaware of the experimental conditions) during 3 min (a total of 18 sampling intervals). The number of observations indicating freezing obtained as a mean from both observers is expressed as a percentage of the total number of observations. For short term memory test, the memory test is performed 3 hrs after the foot shock training.","Tone-dependent fear conditioning. Training consists of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box (context), followed by a tone [30 sec, 20 kHz, 75 dB sound pressure level (SPL)] and a foot shock (2 sec, 0.8 tnA, constant current). The memory test is performed 24 hr later by exposing the mice for 3 min to a novel context followed by an additional 3 min exposure to a tone (10 kHz, 75 dB SPL). Freezing is recorded every 10 sec by two nonbiased observers as described above.","Morris water maze test. The water maze paradigm is performed in a circular tank (diameter 1.8 m) filled with opaque water. A platform (11\u00d711 cm) is submerged below the water's surface in the center of the target quadrant. The swimming path of the mice is recorded by a video camera and analyzed by the Videomot 2 software (TSE). For each training session, the mice are placed into the maze consecutively from four random points of the tank. Mice are allowed to search for the platform for 60 s. If the mice do not find the platform within 60 s, they are gently guided to it. Mice are allowed to remain on the platform for 15 s. Two training trials are given every day; the latency for each trial is recorded for analysis. During the memory test (probe test), the platform is removed from the tank, and the mice are allowed to swim in the maze for 60 s.","Spatial working memory on elevated T-maze. Mice are maintained on a restricted feeding schedule at 85% of their free-feeding weight. Spatial working memory is first assessed on an elevated plastic T-maze. This consists of a start arm (47\u00d710 cm) and two identical goal arms (35\u00d710 cm), surrounded by a 10 cm high wall. A plastic food well is located 3 cm from the end of each goal arm. The maze is located 1 m above the floor in a well lit laboratory that contained various prominent distal extra maze cues. The mice are habituated to the maze, and to drinking sweetened, condensed milk, over several days before spatial non-matching-to-place testing.","Each trial consists of a sample run and a choice run. On the sample run, the mice are forced either left or right by the presence of a plastic block, according to a pseudorandom sequence (with equal numbers of left and right turns per session, and with no more than two consecutive turns in the same direction). A reward consisting of 0.07 ml of sweetened, condensed milk (diluted 50\/50 with water) is available in the food well at the end of the arm. The block is then removed, and the mouse is placed, facing the experimenter, at the end of the start arm and allowed a free choice of either arm. The time interval between the sample run and the choice run is approximately 15 s. The animal is rewarded for choosing the previously unvisited arm (that is, for alternating). Mice are run one trial at a time with an inter-trial interval (ITI) of approximately 10 min. Each daily session consists of 4 trials, and mice receive 24 trials in total.","Cannulation and injection: Microcannula are inserted into the lateral brain ventricles as described by Fischer et al., J. Neurosci 22, 3700-7 (2002).","Immunoblotting and staining: Lysates for immunoblotting are prepared as described by Fischer et al. Neuron 48, 825-838 (2005). To isolate histones, brain tissue is homogenized in TX-buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-100) and incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 15 min prior to centrifugation at 200 rpm for 10 min. After a wash-step in TX-buffer the pellet is dissolved in TX-buffer containing 0.2M HCl and incubated on ice for 30 min, before a second centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant is either dialysed or directly used for immunoblotting. Antibodies are used in 1:1000 concentrations. All antibodies detecting histones and anti-PSD-95 are from e.g., Upstate (Lake Placid, N.Y.). Anti-synaptophysin (SVP38) is from e.g., Sigma. Anti-neuronal nuclei (neuN) and anti-growth associated protein (Gap43) are from e.g., Chemicon (Temecula, Calif.) and anti-N-cadherin, anti-beta-catenin are from e.g., Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, Calif.). Immunostaining is performed as described by Fischer et al., Neuron 48, 825-838 (2005). Antibodies mentioned above are used in a 1:500 dilution. Anti-MAP-2 antibody (e.g., Sigma) is used in a 1:200 dilution.","Statistical analysis: The data are analyzed by unpaired student's t test and one-way ANOVA (ANalyis Of VAriance). One-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Scheffe's test is employed to compare means from several groups.","Compounds of the invention are tested for their ability to reinstatement learning behavior through inhibition of HDAC. Brain atrophy occurs during normal aging and is an early feature of neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired learning and memory. Only recently have mouse models with extensive neurodegeneration in the forebrain been reported. One of these models is the bi-transgenic CK-p25 Tg mice where expression of p25, a protein implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases (Cruz, J., et al., Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 14, 390-394 (2004)), is under the control of the CamKII promoter and can be switched on or off with a doxycycline diet (Fisher, A. et al., Neuron 48, 471-83 (2003); Cruz, J. et al., Neuron 40, 471-83 (2003)). Post-natal induction of p25 expression for 6 weeks causes learning impairment that is accompanied by severe synaptic and neuronal loss in the forebrain.","Specifically, compounds of the invention are tested for their ability to reinstate learning behavior and to recover access to long-term memories in CK-p25 Tg mice that had developed synaptic and neuronal loss. p25 is induced in 11 month old CK-p25 Tg mice for 6 weeks. Afterwards p25 expression is repressed and one group of CK-p25 Tg mice are subjected to daily or intermittent (e.g. every other day) injection of a compound of the invention for a period of time (e.g. 1-4 weeks), whereas the other group receives saline injection. Subsequently all mice, including a control group that do not express p25, are subjected to fear conditioning and water maze learning. To this end, p25 expression is induced in 11-month old CK-p25 mice for 6 weeks, before one group is injected daily or intermittently (e.g. every other day) for a period of time (e.g. 1-4 weeks) with a compound of the invention whereas the control group receives saline. The freezing behavior and spatial learning of vehicle vs. compound treated groups are compared and levels of synaptic marker proteins are measured. Freezing is defined as a lack of movement except for heart beat and respiration associated with a crouching position. Brain atrophy and hippocampal neuronal loss are also evaluated.","The effect of HDAC inhibition using a compound of the invention on the recovery of inaccessible long-term memories is evaluated. Eleven month old CK-p25 Tg mice are trained in the fear conditioning paradigm and returned to their home cages for 4 weeks. Subsequently p25 is induced for 6 weeks before the mice are injected with either saline (vehicle) or a compound of the invention for a period of time. Afterwards all mice, including a vehicle injected control groups that did not express p25 and a group of compound-injected control mice that were not trained, are subjected the memory test. The freezing behavior and spatial learning of vehicle vs. compound treated groups are compared and levels of synaptic marker proteins are measured. Brain atrophy and hippocampal neuronal loss are also evaluated. A significant reduction in freezing behavior during the memory test (P<0.0001) test, suggests the loss of consolidated long-term memories.","Compounds of the invention are tested to determine their effect on plasticity factors in CK-p25 Tg mice that developed severe neurodegeneration. p25 is induced in 11 month old CK-p25 Tg mice for 6 weeks. Afterwards p25 expression is repressed and one group of CK-p25 Tg mice is subjected to daily or intermittent (e.g. every other day) compound injections for a period of time (e.g. 1-4 weeks), whereas the other group receives saline injection. Hippocampal neuronal loss is evaluated for compound and vehicle treated mice for example, by comparing images showing hippocampal NeuN and MAP-2 staining and using immunoblots from the hippocampus and cortex of all groups.","Compounds of the invention are tested to determine their effect on learning, basal anxiety, explorative behavior and brain plasticity. C57BL\/6J mice are subjected to fear conditioning and are injected intraperitoneally [ip] with a compound of the invention or saline immediately afterwards. Freezing behavior is evaluated during a memory test performed 24 h later.","C57BL\/6J mice are implanted with microcannulae into the lateral brain ventricles (icy) and are injected with either a compound of the invention or vehicle immediately after fear conditioning. Freezing behavior is evaluated during a memory test performed 24 h later.","C57BL\/6J mice are injected [ip] daily or intermittmently with a compound of the invention or saline for a period of time (e.g. 1-4 weeks) before all mice are subjected to the elevated plus maze and open field test. MAP-2 immunoreactivity (IR) in the hippocampus is evaluated and compound treated and vehicle treated mice compared. Markers for brain plasticity are measured.","Compound of the invention are tested to determine their ability to recover spatial memories. CK-p25 Tg mice in which p25 expression is repressed and control mice are trained in the water maze paradigm until all mice reliably find the hidden platform. Afterwards all mice are returned to their home cages for 4 weeks to allow the consolidation of hippocampus independent long-term memories. Afterwards p25 expression is induced for 6 weeks, followed by p25 repression. One group of CK-p25 Tg mice are injected daily or intermittently (e.g. every other day) with a compound of the invention, whereas the other group is injected with vehicle.","Pilot studies have shown that a probe test, commonly used to analyze memory retrieval in the water maze paradigm, is not a reliable read out to analyze long-term memory retrieval. In fact, without extensive re-training even wild type mice show no significant preference for the target quadrant when tested 10 weeks after the training in a probe test. To measure the retrieval of long-term memory mice are instead exposed to only 2 reminder-training sessions on a single day. The mean escape latency during the reminder-training sessions is compared to control mice that did not receive the initial training. Escape latency is evaluated for compound treated and control mice.","Compounds of the invention are tested to determine the specific acetylation mark elicited by the compound which is relevant to the treatment of Rubinstein Taybi. Sagittal brain sections of Rubinstein Taybi CBP+\/\u2212 mice are immunostained to detect levels of ACH2B in hippocampal neurons. Western blot analysis of hippocampal protein extracts from CBP+\/\u2212 and WT mice using antibodies against 13-actin, H2B (nonacetylated), ACH2A, ACH3 and ACH4 is used to reveal ACH2B level. Quantification of Western blot analysis shows the differences in the level of p-actin, total H2B, ACH2A, and ACH3.","Compounds of the invention were evaluated in primary neuronal culture for determining HDAC inhibitor effects in cells. E17 embryonic mouse forebrain was dissociated into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration following trypsin\/DNAse digestion. Cells were plated at a density of 12,500 cells per well in poly-D-lysine\/laminin-coated black\/clear bottom 96-well plates (BD Biosciences #BD356692) in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27, and 1% pen\/strep. Cultures were treated with HDAC inhibitors for 24 h starting on the third day after plating at varying inhibitor concentrations.","Compounds of the invention were evaluated to determine the functional measures of compounds' cellular HDAC activity (Immunoflourescent analysis). Imaging of neurons was performed using automated microscopy. After 24 h of HDAC inhibitor treatment, formaldehyde dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added directly to the wells for a final concentration of 4%. Cells were fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were permeabilized and blocked with blocking buffer composed of 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% BSA in PBS. For immunofluorescence imaging of histone modifications, cells were stained with anti-acetyl H3K9 (Millipore, cat#07-352) or anti-Ac-H4K12 (Millipore, cat#04-119) antibodies, and Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cellular nuclei were identified by staining with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, H3570). Cell nuclei and histone acetylation signal intensity were detected and measured using a laser-scanning microcytometer (Acumen eX3, TTP Laptech). Acumen Explorer software was used to identify a threshold of histone acetylation signal intensity such that, in the absence of HDAC inhibitor, >99.5% of cells had intensity levels below the threshold. In the presence of HDAC inhibitors, cells with histone acetylation signal intensities above the threshold were scored as \u201cbright green nuclei\u201d. The percentage of nuclei scoring as bright green was quantitated for each HDAC inhibitor. This percentage was then normalized to DMSO controls. Representative images of histone acetylation staining in neurons (with dendrites stained by anti-Map2B antibody (EnCor) and Alexa-555-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes); shown in red) in the absence and presence of HDAC inhibitors were taken on a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope.","Materials and Methods: CBP mutant mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-Crebbp*)1364Tabe\/J) are obtained from, for example, the Jackson lab. Expression of this FLAG-epitope tagged, dominant negative truncation of the CREB-binding protein (FLAG-CBPA1, lacking the coding sequence for amino acids 1084-2441) is spatially directed to neurons in the forebrain (hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, and cortex) and temporally directed to postnatal development by the CaMKIIa promoter. This dominant negative mutant form of CBP (designed to interrupt transcription factors utilizing CBP as a co-activator for the expression of their target genes) is expressed from the transgene at 95% of endogenous CBP levels in the hippocampus and 84% of endogenous CBP levels in the cortex. Hemizygous mice exhibit hippocampus-dependent memory deficits (such as reduced long-term potentiation, defective spatial learning, and impaired contextual fear conditioning) with none of the developmental impairments observed in CBP-deficient mutant models. The CBP mutant hemizygous mice and their control littermates are injected daily of intermittently (e.g. every other day) with vehicle or a compound of the invention for a period of time (e.g. 10 days). On day 11, mice are trained in contextual fear conditioning paradigm (Training consists of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box (context, TSE) followed by a foot shock (2 sec, 0.8 mA, constant current). One hour after training, mice are injected with compounds of the invention or vehicle. On day 12 mice are returned to the training box and the freezing behavior were monitored and recorded.

The bi-transgenic mice are created by crossing the CamK2a-tTA and the tetO-p25 Tg mouse lines. In the presence of doxycyclin, the expression of p25 is suppressed. When doxycyclin is removed, the expression of p25 is strongly induced in the forebrain. Six weeks of p25 induction causes massive neuronal loss, elevated beta-amyloid peptide production, tau associated pathology, and impairment in learning and memory. For these experiments, doxycyclin is removed from 3-month old CK\/p25 mice and the control littermates for 6 weeks. The mice are subsequently injected with compounds of the invention or vehicle for a period of time (e.g. 10 days). After that time period (e.g., on day 11), mice are trained in contextual fear conditioning paradigm (training consisted of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box (context, TSE) followed by a foot shock (2 sec, 0.8 mA, constant current).

The control group consists of the tetO-p25 Tg mice fed on normal diet, which do not express p25. The compounds of the invention are tested for their ability to restore contextual fear conditioning learning. The brain pathology of p25 is reminiscent of human patients with neurodegeneration and memory impairment.","Mice are trained using contextual fear conditioning paradigm on day 0. For example, training consists of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box (context, TSE) followed by three foot shocks (2 sec, 0.8 mA, constant current with 15-seconds-intervals). From day 1, mice are trained in extinction trials. For each training day, mice are twice exposed to the conditioning box for 3 min without foot shock (two extinction trials\/day). One hour after the first trial, mice are injected with a compound of the invention (e.g., 30 mg\/l (g, i.p.). One hour after the injection, the second extinction trial is performed. The freezing time in each individual trial is measured.","For the memory reconsolidation paradigm, after the fear extinction training as described above, mice are re-housed in the home cage for one month. Mice are subsequently re-expose to the conditioning box for 3 min, their freezing behavior is measured. It is well established that after the fear memory extinction trials, fear memory will spontaneously recover after resting in the home cage for a period of time. The speculated mechanism for fear extinction is to trigger the formation of new memory which competes with fear memory and in turn reduces the fear response. Conversely, reconsolidation based fear memory extinction paradigm has been proposed to directly modify the activated fear memory, so that the reduced fear response does not spontaneously recover (Extinction-reconsolidation boundaries: key to per attenuation of fear memories.

protocol for genome-wide transcript profiling assays was carried out as follows. E17 embryonic mouse forebrain was dissociated into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration following trypsin\/DNAse digestion. Primary neuronal cultures grown in 6-well plates were treated for 24 hours with compound 215 at 10 \u03bcM. RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (e.g., Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using ArrayScript (e.g., Ambion). Triplicate samples were collected and analyzed using Illumina mouse whole-genome-6 microarrays. Total RNA from the samples was normalized to 20 ng\/\u03bcl, and the Illumina\u00ae TotalPrep\u2122-96 RNA Amplification Kit (e.g., Applied Biosystems, PN #4393543) protocol was used for amplification in a semi automated process. The total RNA underwent reverse transcription to synthesize first-strand cDNA. This cDNA was then converted into a double-stranded DNA template for transcription. In vitro transcription synthesized aRNA and incorporated a biotin-conjugated nucleotide. The aRNA was then purified to remove unincorporated NTPs, salts, enzymes, and inorganic phosphate. Labeled cRNA was normalized to 150 ng\/\u03bcl and hybridized to Illumina's MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip. The labeled RNA strand was hybridized to the bead on the BeadChip containing the complementary gene-specific sequence. After 16 hours of hybridization, the beadchips were washed and stained using a Cy3 streptavidin conjugate. Illumina's BeadArray Reader was used to measure the fluorescence intensity at each addressed bead location. Raw data were annotated with Genome Studio (Illumina), and then quantile normalized and baseline transformed to the median of the DMSO control samples using GeneSpring software (Agilent). Probes failing to score as \u201cpresent\u201d in 100% of samples from at least one treatment condition were removed. A statistical threshold (p<0.05, paired t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons correction) and a fold change criterion (\u22671.5) were then applied to generate lists of genes up- and down-regulated by compound 215.","In cells, HDACs1\/2 are assembled into large multi-protein complexes.
