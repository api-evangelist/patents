No. 61\/012,603 filed Dec. 10, 2007, entitled METHOD FOR SPLICING USING A DETACHABLE FIBER HOLDER PLATFORM, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present inventive concepts relate to the field of fiber optics, and more particularly to the field of fiber optic splicers and methods of accomplishing same.","In the broadcasting and television industry, most video cameras are capable of capturing high definition (HD) video and relaying the signal back to a central editing\/broadcast center or booth. At a large sporting event, these cameras are located at various distances from the editing booth. In order to transmit the signal back to the booth, each camera uses a hybrid HD cable composed of optical fibers and electrical wires.","In some instances, it would be advantageous to be able to splice a cable to a connector in the field, e.g., at a sporting event. One type of splicer that can be used for such purposes is the Fitel\u00ae S122 Series fusion placer by Furukawa Electric Co. Ltd. The fusion splicer requires a fiber holder to hold the fiber straight during the splicing process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14"]},"The fiber holder  is placed in a splicer that includes an \u201coven\u201d for performing the splice process. In typical splicers, the splicer does not secure the cable during splicing, only the optical fiber. That is, there is a presumption that the cable will be otherwise stably maintained during the splicing process and during the fiber protection process. In the field, maintaining the cable steady during the splicing process can be quite challenging, and instability can severely impact the final splice and, therefore, performance with the hybrid HD cable.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, provided is a fiber holder platform that includes a support, a clamp configured to secure a cable to the support, and a securing mechanism configured to detachably secure the platform to a fiber holder.","The securing mechanism can also be configured to detachably secure to a heat oven.","The securing mechanism can include at least one magnet.","The cable can be a high definition cable.","The fiber holder can be configured to couple to a splicer.","The fiber holder can be configured to secure at least one optical fiber from the cable.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, provided is a fiber holder assembly. The assembly includes a support, a clamp configured to secure a cable to the support, and a fiber holder coupled to the support and configured to secure at least one optical fiber from the cable.","The fiber holder can be detachably coupled to the support with a detachable securing mechanism.","The detachable securing mechanism can include at least one magnet.","The fiber holder platform can be configured to directly and detachably couple to a heat oven.","The fiber holder can be integral with the support to form a rigid unit.","The fiber holder can also be configured to directly and detachably couple to a heat oven.","The cable can be a high definition cable.","The fiber holder can include a channel configured to receive the at least one optical fiber and a lid configured to secure the at least one optical fiber in the channel.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, provided is a fiber holder having a main body with a channel formed therein that is configured to receive at least one optical fiber. The fiber holder also includes a lid to secure the at least one optical fiber in the channel. And a securing mechanism is configured to detachably engage a fiber holder platform that is configured to hold a cable comprising the at least one optical fiber.","The fiber holder platform can include an elongated support and a clamp configured to secure the cable.","The fiber holder can be configured to couple to a splicer.","The fiber holder can be configured to couple to a heat oven.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, provided is a method of preparing at least one optical fiber of a cable. The method includes securing the cable in a fiber holder platform and coupling a fiber holder to the fiber holder platform and securing the at least one fiber in the fiber holder. The at least one fiber is spliced to at least one other fiber. The fiber holder platform is coupled to a heat oven and a sleeve is shrunk over the splice, wherein the sleeve is positioned over a heating element of the heat oven when the fiber holder platform is coupled to the heat oven.","The method can further include, prior to coupling the fiber holder platform to the heat oven, detaching the fiber holder from the fiber holder platform, and then directly coupling the fiber holder platform to the heat oven.","Hereinafter, aspects of the present invention will be described by explaining illustrative embodiments in accordance therewith, with reference to the attached drawings. While describing these embodiments, detailed descriptions of well-known items, functions, or configurations are typically omitted for conciseness.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. are used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another, but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example, a first element can be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element can be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., \u201cbetween\u201d versus \u201cdirectly between,\u201d \u201cadjacent\u201d versus \u201cdirectly adjacent,\u201d etc.).","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d and\/or \u201cincluding,\u201d when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","Spatially relative terms, such as \u201cbeneath,\u201d \u201cbelow,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d \u201cabove,\u201d \u201cupper\u201d and the like may be used to describe an element and\/or feature's relationship to another element(s) and\/or feature(s) as, for example, illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and\/or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d and\/or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements or features would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","20","10","22","10","10","12","14","22","24","30","10","22","20","22","10","30"],"i":["a ","a ","a ","a "]},"In , hybrid HD cable  is secured to fiber holder assembly  via clamp , with an optical fiber  from cable  being held in channel  by closed lid .

In this embodiment the fiber holder assembly uses the detachable fiber holder platform . According to the method, a cable  is secured to the fiber holder platform  with clamp . The fiber holder is attached to the fiber holder platform , and the fiber  from cable  is placed in channel  and secured with closed lid . An exposed end of fiber  is abutted with another fiber and the two fibers are spliced together using a splicer.","Fiber holder and fiber holder platform  are detached from each other. The fiber holder platform  is then coupled to heat oven, with a sleeve  disposed over the splice and at about the center of the heating element of the heat oven . The heat oven  heats the sleeve from about the center outward to shrink the sleeve over the splice.","The fiber holder platform provides a secure grip of the HD cable , which is necessary for both preparing the cable for splicing and splicing itself. Fusion splicers have either a built in clamp or a fiber holder to secure the fiber during splicing. This method of using a platform with a detachable fiber holder is unique, and offers ease of use and compact size. A platform such as that shown in  allows the use of a common fusion splicer and a common heat oven.","In another embodiment, rather than the use of a heat oven, the detachable platform could mate to a recoating machine. A recoating machine uses a mould around the spliced fiber. UV curable liquid gets injected into the mould and cured to protect the splice area like a heat shrink sleeve. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the description above related to the detachable platform could equally apply to such a recoating machine, without need for further explanation of such recoating machines.","While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and\/or other preferred embodiments, it is understood that various modifications can be made therein and that the invention or inventions may be implemented in various forms and embodiments, and that they may be applied in numerous applications, only some of which have been described herein.
