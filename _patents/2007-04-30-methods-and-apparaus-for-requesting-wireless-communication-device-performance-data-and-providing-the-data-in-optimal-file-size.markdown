title: Methods and apparaus for requesting wireless communication device performance data and providing the data in optimal file size
abstract: Methods, systems, devices and computer program products are presented for requesting wireless device performance data and providing an optimal file size for the performance data. Present aspects provide for estimating the size of requested performance data, at the time of the request, and assessing other factors, such as requesting party preferences, to determine optimal performance data file size. In this regard, the performance data service provider is able to prepare and make accessible optimally sized performance data files, as the data becomes available as opposed to creating one comprehensive performance data file when all of the requested data is available. Additionally, some present aspects may provide for performance data requesting parties to implement Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the communication tool between the requesting device and the performance data-supplying network entity.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60\/868,657 entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus For Determining Optimal File Size For The Download And Process\u201d filed Dec. 5, 2006, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field","The disclosed aspects relate to wireless communication devices, and more particularly, to systems, methods and apparatus for requesting performance data from wireless communication devices and providing the data to the requesting party in optimal file size.","2. Background","Wireless networking connects one or more wireless devices to other computer devices without a direct electrical connection, such as a copper wire or optical cable. Wireless devices communicate data, typically in the form of packets, across a wireless or partially wireless computer network and open a \u201cdata\u201d or \u201ccommunication\u201d channel on the network such that the device can send and receive data packets. The wireless devices often have wireless device resources, such as programs and hardware components, which individually and cooperatively operate to use and generate data in accordance to their design and specific protocol or configuration, such as using open communication connections to transmit and receive data on the network","The current trend in the wireless communication device industry is to market devices that have a wide range of functionality. For example, a single wireless communication device may be capable of wireless telephone communication, digital photography, wireless Internet communication, electronic mail (email) and\/or Short Message Service (SMS) communication, wireless audio and\/or video downloading, other wireless network service communications and the like. In addition, the wireless communication device may be capable of storing or wirelessly accessing numerous applications that can then be executed on the wireless communication device.","As the functionality of these devices expands, the device users increasingly demand high performance and reliability. To insure such high performance and reliability, applications are being implemented to monitor performance so that service providers, device manufacturers and the like can respond to problems, or the potential for problems, in a timely fashion. Most of these monitoring-type applications require data to be collected at the wireless device and, in many instances, communicated to a network device for subsequent performance analysis. For example, a wireless telephone may log data related to calls or may capture data when an event, such as a \u201ccall failure\u201d or a \u201ccall drop\u201d occurs.","Currently, service providers, device manufacturers or any other third party entity that desires to have access to wireless device performance data will request performance data though a network service. For example, a requesting third party entity desiring performance data may access a network site run by the network service to request performance data from one or more wireless devices and provide performance data parameters. The performance data parameters may include, but are not limited to, identity of the wireless device or group of wireless devices from which data is to be collected, the events that are to be logged by the identified wireless device (s); the duration of time for collecting data; the percentage of data requested based on the total amount of data logged and the like. Once the network service has received a request, the network service configures the wireless device(s), retrieves the performance data from the wireless device(s), assembles a performance data file of the requested data for the requesting party and provides the requesting party access to the file.","In many instances the requesting third party will request performance data from numerous wireless devices and for extended periods of time, for example a month or thirty (30) day period. As such, the cumulative data that is collected from the wireless device(s) may form a large data file. For example, such performance data files may be as large as about 10 megabytes to about 1 gigabyte in terms of size. Network communication of such large data files poses a problem in terms of network efficiency and the use of network bandwidth. A large amount of network bandwidth must be available in order to communicate such large data files. In many instances, network communication of such large files may be delayed or otherwise fail due to network bandwidth constraints.","Additionally, in stances in which the requesting third party has requested performance data over an extended period of time, for example, a week, a month or the like, the requesting party may desire access to the performance data before all of the requested data has been generated and logged at the wireless device. For example, if the requesting third party has requested performance data for a month long period, the requesting period may benefit from having access to the data at weekly intervals.","Therefore, a need exists to develop methods, systems, apparatus and computer program products that alleviate problems related to large performance data files and, specifically, problems related to network communication of such large data files. As such, the desired methods, systems, apparatus and computer program products should provide for greater efficiency in terms of network bandwidth utilization. Additionally, a need exists to develop methods, systems, apparatus and computer program products that do not limit the requesting party to accessing the performance data only after the entire requested data has been generated and compiled. As such, the desired methods, systems, apparatus and computer program products should provide the user the ability to access to data while other data is still being generated, collected and compiled into performance data files.","Present aspects provide for methods, devices, systems and computer program products for requesting wireless device performance data and providing an optimal file size for the performance data. Specifically, present aspects provide for estimating the size of requested performance data, at the time of the request, and assessing other factors, such as requesting party preferences, to determine optimal performance data file size. The optimal file size will typically be less than the size of the requested performance data. As such, multiple files of optimal size can be created with each file including a portion of the requested performance data. In this regard, the performance data service provider is able to prepare and make accessible optimally sized performance data files, as the data becomes available as opposed to creating one comprehensive performance data file when all of the requested data is available. By making optimally sized performance data files accessible to the requesting party as the data becomes available, the requesting party is able to process and use the data at any earlier point in time. In addition, smaller optimally sized performance data files provide more efficiency in the communication network in terms of the bandwidth necessary for communication to occur.","Additionally, some present aspects may provide for performance data requesting parties and\/or the network device, such as a user manager, to implement Extensible Markup Language (XML) protocol as the communication tool between the requesting device and the performance data-supplying network entity. In this regard, XML provides the requesting party the ability to make performance data requests, configure the collection of performance data on wireless devices, receive access to optimally sized performance data files and make other performance data-related communications with the performance data supplier. By implementing XML as the communication interface, the performance data supplier is able to offer the requesting party a messaging mechanism that allows for reaching out and controlling the collection of performance data at the wireless devices via interface with the network device, such as a user manager server or the like.","In one aspect, a method is described for providing wireless communication device performance data of optimal file size. The method includes receiving a request for performance data monitored by one or more wireless communication devices, determining an optimal file size for segments of the requested performance data by estimating the overall size of the requested performance data based on a time span for the requested performance data, generating files of optimal size as segments of the requested performance data become available, storing the generated files in memory and providing a requester access to each generated file as the files become available. In some aspects, determining the optimal file size may additionally provide for determining a readjusted optimal file size, during the performance data collection process, based on network characteristics, such as network bandwidth. Additionally, determining the optimal file size may include determining a requester preference related optimal file size, for example, the requester may limit the file size or define a desired time period between accesses to generated files. In other aspects, determining an optimal file size further comprises determining available network bandwidth.","In some aspects of the method receiving the request for performance data monitored by one or more wireless communication devices includes receiving an Extensible Markup Language (XML) protocol formatted request for performance data. Additionally, in such aspects providing a requester access to each generated file as the files become available may include providing an XML formatted response to the requester that provides for access to each of the generated files as the files become available. In addition, receiving the request for performance data monitored by one or more wireless communication devices may additionally include receiving one or more requester preferences for determining optimal file size and\/or receiving performance data configuration for the one or more wireless communication devices.","In some aspects of the method, providing the requester access to each generated file as the files become available involves providing a requester the URL corresponding to a generated file for accessing the generated file as the file becomes available while in other aspects providing the requester access may involve communicating each generated file to the requester as the files become available.","Another related aspect is provided for by at least one processor.

In this regard, the optimal file size may dynamically change during the performance data collection period as dictated by network characteristics or any other factor influencing file size.

The performance data module  may include a performance data request queue  operable to hold performance data requests as a sequence of requests awaiting processing. The queue may be required as performance data requests are typically handled in batch mode.","The performance data module  includes optimal file size determiner logic  operable to determine the optimal file size for requested performance data based on one or more file size factors, such as the estimated size of the cumulative requested performance data, user preferences and network characteristics, such as network bandwidth. In this regard, optimal file size determiner logic  may rely of performance data parameters , such as the definition of the performance data to be collected and\/or the defined time period for accumulating performance data and any other requester defined performance data parameters to estimate the size of the cumulative requested performance data or any remaining portion of the requested performance data. In addition, optimal file size determiner logic may rely on stored performance data  to assess the size of historical performance data files having similar performance data parameters as the current request. In some aspects, user preferences , which may define a file size or the frequency for which files are required by the requesting party (for example, hourly performance files, daily performance files, weekly performance files and the like) may override the determination based on estimated cumulative file size and, thus, may dictate the size and\/or frequency of performance data files. Additionally, optimal file size determiner logic  may include a network bandwidth determiner  operable to determine the available network bandwidth that is available prior to making a file accessible. If the available bandwidth does not support the optimally determined performance data file size, the file size may be further diminished to accommodate the available bandwidth.

As such the performance data module  of the present aspects is able to provide the requester with access to portions of the cumulative performance data prior to the end of the defined time period for collecting the data. As previously noted the optimal file size determiner logic  may be executed in accordance with the file access logic , such that providing access to a performance data file may warrant reassessing network characteristics or other factors influencing file size to determine if readjusting the optimal size of the performance data file is needed.

Further, a data management server  may be in communication with network device  to provide post-processing capabilities, data flow control, etc. Network device , network database  and data management server  may be present on the cellular telephone network  with any other network components that are needed to provide cellular telecommunication services. Network device , and\/or data management server  communicate with carrier network  through a data links  and , which may be data links such as the Internet, a secure LAN, WAN, or other network. Carrier network  controls messages (generally being data packets) sent to a mobile switching center (MSC) . Further, carrier network  communicates with MSC  by a network , such as the Internet, and\/or POTS (plain old telephone service). Typically, in network , a network or Internet portion transfers data, and the POTS portion transfers voice information.

BTS  ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless communication devices  and , by short messaging service (SMS), or other over-the-air methods.","Referring to , a message flow diagram is depicted illustrating the communication between a requesting party communication device and the network device that receives the request, determines optimal file size, generates the optimally sized performance data files and provides access to the performance data files. At Event , a third party requester, such as a service provider, a device manufacturer or the like generates, at a computing device () a performance data request () and, at Event , the performance data request is communicated to a network device (), such as a user manager server.","At Event , the network device validates the performance data request and queues the request for subsequent batch processing. At Event , the network device communicates a response back to the third party requester informing that the request has been received, validated and placed in the queue for processing. Additionally, the response may include a token that allows the third party requester to track the progress of the performance data request.","At Event , the third party requester sends a status request that includes the token to check on the progress of the performance data request. At Event , the network device validates the status request, determines the progress of the performance data request and generates a response. In this instance, by way of example, the performance data request is still in the queue awaiting processing and, therefore the response back to the requester indicates such. At Event , the network communicates the status response to the requesting party informing the requester that the performance data request is still in the queue awaiting processing.","At Event , the performance data request exits the queue and a determination is made as the optimal size of the performance data files. As previously noted determine the optimal file size determination may be based on one or more file size factors, such as the estimated size of the cumulative requested performance data, requester preferences and network bandwidth. The estimated size of the cumulative requested performance data may be determined based on the defined performance data that is to be collected, the defined time period for accumulating performance data, collected performance data history and the like. Performance data collection parameters and\/or requester preferences, such as the desired size or desired frequency, may be communicated with the performance data request or they may be communicated in a separate communication.","At Event , the network device will send performance data configuration requests to the wireless devices (), which define the parameters for data collection, such as which events to capture, the percentage or frequency of events to capture, upload times for performance data and the like. At Event , the wireless device () uploads the requested performance data to the network device. At Event , the network device processes the raw performance data and generates a performance data file according to the requester preferences and the determined optimal file size requirements. Once the file has been generated, a URL is assigned to the file and the file is communicated to network storage for subsequent retrieval by the requesting party.","At Event , the requesting device sends a performance data file request to the network device. In alternate aspects, the request for the performance data file may not be required in order to obtain the performance data access response. In such alternate aspects, the performance data files may be made available to the requesting party without the need to send a performance data file request. At Event , the network device sends a performance data access response that provides with the requester with one or more URLs. Each URL corresponds to a performance data file. The number of performance data files and, thus, the number of URLs are defined by the outcome of the optimal file size determination. The individual URLs will be activated, thus allowing the requesting party to access the performance data files, as the performance data files are generated and stored. At Event , the requesting party activates the URL to request the download of the performance data file. At Event , the network device receives the request, retrieves the performance data associated with the URL, and, at Event , forwards the performance data file to the requesting party.","At Event , the wireless device () uploads additional requested performance data to the network device.

At Event , the network device sends a performance data access response that informs the requester that an additional URL is active; i.e., an additional performance data file had been generated and is available for access. At Event  the requesting party activates the URL to request the download of the performance data file.

operable with any codes, messages, and data packets of any protocol.","The various illustrative logics, logical blocks, modules, and circuits described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but, in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration. Additionally, at least one processor may comprise one or more modules operable to perform one or more of the steps and\/or actions described above.","Further, the steps and\/or actions of a method or algorithm described in connection with the aspects disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium may be coupled to the processor, such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. Further, in some aspects, the processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC. Additionally, the ASIC may reside in a user terminal. In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a user terminal. Additionally, in some aspects, the steps and\/or actions of a method or algorithm may reside as one or any combination or set of codes and\/or instructions on a machine readable medium and\/or computer readable medium, which may be incorporated into a computer program product.","While the foregoing disclosure shows illustrative aspects and\/or embodiments, it should be noted that various changes and modifications could be made herein without departing from the scope of the described aspects and\/or embodiments as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, although elements of the described embodiments may be described or claimed in the singular, the plural is contemplated unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated. Additionally, all or a portion of any aspect and\/or embodiment may be utilized with all or a portion of any other aspect and\/or embodiment, unless stated otherwise.","Thus, present aspects provide for methods, devices, systems and computer program products for requesting wireless device performance data and providing an optimal file size for the performance data. Specifically, present aspects provide for estimating the size of requested performance data, at the time of the request, and assessing other factors, such as requesting party preferences, to determine optimal performance data file size. Typically, multiple files of optimal size are created with each file including a portion of the requested performance data. In this regard, the performance data service provider is able to prepare and make accessible optimally sized performance data files, as the data becomes available as opposed to creating one comprehensive performance data file when all of the requested data is available. By making optimally sized performance data files accessible to the requesting party as the data becomes available, the requesting party is able to process and use the data at any earlier point in time. In addition, smaller optimally sized performance data files provide more efficiency in the communication network in terms of bandwidth utilization.","Additionally, some present aspects may provide for performance data requesting parties to implement Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the communication protocol between the requesting device and the performance data-supplying network entity. By implementing XML as the communication interface, the performance data supplier is able to offer the requesting party a messaging mechanism that allows for reaching out and controlling the collection of performance data at the wireless devices via interface with the network device, such as a user manager server or the like.","Many modifications and other aspects will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings.
