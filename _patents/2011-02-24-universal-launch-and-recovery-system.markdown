Once recovered by the parent ship, servicing operations such as fueling and general maintenance may be performed. Typically, the recovery of a smaller vessel is accomplished by driving the smaller vessel alongside a stationary parent ship and lifted by davit into the ship. Alternatively, the smaller water vessel may be driven up a ramp into the larger ship.","Traditional methods of launching and recovering\/receiving smaller surface water vessels can cause damage to the hull of the smaller vessel. For example, some USVs weigh about 20,000 lbs and are made from materials such as aluminum. A recovering method that for example, requires a USV to be driven into a parent ship or be lifted and dropped onto the parent ship can cause damage to the aluminum hull, resulting in expensive repairs. The prior art does not teach an operator-friendly method and apparatus that launches and recovers a smaller vessel in a cushioned and properly guided manner that prevents damage to the smaller vessel, in which the apparatus is capable of capturing smaller vessels having a range of different hull geometries.","In one aspect, the invention is a universal launch and recovery system. The system includes a pivotable ramp having a forward edge and a pivot edge, with the pivotable ramp pivotable at the pivot edge, the forward edge being movable between a stowed position and deployed position for receiving a water vessel. In this aspect, the pivotable ramp includes a substantially planar ramp surface with a first row of tire arrangements, and a second row of tire arrangements. The second row of tire arrangements is substantially parallel to the first row of tire arrangements. Each tire arrangement includes an adjustable pivotable joint attached to the substantially planar ramp surface. Each tire arrangement further includes an extendable arm having a lower portion and an upper portion, wherein the lower portion of the extendable arm is attached to the pivotable joint. Each tire arrangement also includes an axle attached to the upper portion of the extendable arm, and a tire for supporting a water vessel and for moving the water vessel along the ramp, the tire attached to the axle, wherein the tire is rotatable about the axle.","In another aspect, the invention is an arrangement for launching and receiving multiple water vessels of various geometries. The arrangement includes a pivotable ramp having a forward edge, a pivot edge, a first side edge, and a second side edge. The forward and the pivot edges are substantially perpendicular to the first and second side edges. In this aspect, the pivotable ramp is pivotable at the pivot edge so that the ramp moves between a stowed position and deployed position for receiving a water vessel. The pivotable ramp includes a first set of vertically arranged soft entry guide bars positioned along the first side edge of the ramp for guiding water vessels of various geometries onto and off of the ramp. The pivotable ramp also includes a second set of vertically arranged adjustable soft entry guide bars substantially parallel to the first set of vertically arranged soft entry guide bars for guiding water vessels of various geometries onto and off of the ramp. The second set of vertically arranged adjustable soft entry guide bars are positioned along the second side edge of the ramp, the first and second set of vertically arranged soft entry guide bars guiding water vessels onto and off the pivotable ramp.","In another aspect, the invention is an at sea method of launching and\/or receiving water vessels having different geometries. In this aspect, the method includes providing a ship having a ramp. The ship ramp includes a first set of vertically arranged laterally adjustable soft entry guide bars positioned along a first side edge of the ramp, and a second set of vertically arranged laterally adjustable soft entry guide bars substantially parallel to the first set of vertically arranged soft entry guide bars, and positioned along a second side edge of the ramp. The ship ramp also includes a first row of tire arrangements having tires mounted on a pivotable and extendable arm. The ship ramp further includes a second row of tire arrangements, substantially parallel to the first row of tire arrangements, comprising tires mounted on a pivotable and extendable arm, each of the first row and second row of tire arrangements positioned between the first and second set of vertically arranged soft entry guide bars. According to this aspect, the method further includes selecting one of a plurality of water vessels having different geometries for launching from the ship or for receiving onto the ship. The method further includes adjusting the lateral positioning of the first and second set of vertically arranged laterally adjustable soft entry guide bars to a position commensurate with the geometry of the selected water vessel. In this aspect, the method further includes adjusting the pivot angle and the extension length of each arm of first and second rows of tire arrangements to an angle and an extension length commensurate with the geometry of the selected water vessel. The at sea method of launching and\/or receiving water vessels having different geometries also includes moving the ramp to a deployed position in which a forward edge is submerged beneath the surrounding water, and using the ramp to cushion and guide the selected water vessel onto the ship during launching or off the ship during receiving.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","110","100","140","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","101","101","150","105","110","120","140","150","150","101","150","101","101","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["200","200","110","110","105","111","112","113","114","110","111","112","117","118","110","117","118","107","108","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 1"],"b":["120","120","110","120","120","150","101","110","120","120"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b ","a ","b"]},"As shown, a first set of the vertical guide bars are located generally in the vicinity of the outer ramp edge , and the second set of the vertical guide bars generally located in the vicinity of the outer ramp edge .

Each axle is attached at an upper portion of each respective extendable arm  at an angle of about 90 degrees, and rotatably supports a tire  thereon. Each tire  may be freely rotatable, or may be drivingly rotatable in both forward and reverse directions. The free rotation may be a reduced speed free rotation by incorporating a gearing system, capping rotation velocity only up to a desired low velocity, which is particularly advantageous when launching water vessels,  down the ramp . When driven, as shown in , the tire arrangements  may all be connected to a common reversible motor  that drives the tires  simultaneously by a known transmission arrangement. Each tire  includes a braking arrangement  to stop rotation of the tire . The braking arrangement  may be a tandem arrangement so that all brakes are applied in tandem to each tire . For example, the braking arrangement  may be a hydraulic braking arrangement having disc brakes on each tire, that simultaneously engage a tire surface upon actuation from a master cylinder. In operation, during launching or recovering\/receiving a water vessel , when the water vessel  is being carried on the tire arrangements , the application of the brakes assist in preventing the rollback of the water vessel  down the downwardly sloping ramp .","Returning to , a pair of emergency lugs  and  positioned towards the forward edge  of the ramp  are shown.

As outlined above, the lugs  and  are aligned to be substantially parallel to the first and second tire arrangement rows and , respectively. Thus if the braking arrangement  fails, and the water vessel  slides or rolls off the tires, the lugs  and  are positioned to intercept the water vessel and bring the water vessel to a stop, preventing damage to the vessel and\/or injury to personnel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A","b":["2","2","140","140","141","140","140","140","140","150","110","140","140","141","140","141","140","130","140","130","140"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b ","a ","b","a ","b","a ","b ","a ","b.

As stated above, the vessels  are provided merely as examples of a myriad of smaller vessels having different geometries, which could be launched or received by the parent ship .","Step  is the adjusting of the lateral positioning of the first and second set of vertically arranged laterally adjustable soft entry guide bars  to a position commensurate with the geometry of the selected water vessel. As outlined above, the soft entry guide bars  can be adjusted by moving within the guide rails . Step  is the adjusting of the pivot angle \u03b1 and the extension length of each arm  of first and second rows of tire arrangements and to an angle \u03b1 and an extension length commensurate with the geometry of the selected water vessel . These adjustments are made prior to loading the selected water vessel  onto the rows of tire arrangements and . Step  is the moving of the ramp to a deployed position in which a forward edge  is submerged beneath the surrounding water. As outlined above, the ramp  may be moved by using a hydraulic\/pneumatic arrangement. The deployed position in which the forward edge  is submerged allows for a smooth transition from the ramp  to the water during launching operations, or from the water to the ramp  during receiving operations.","Step  is the using of the ramp to cushion and guide the selected water vessel onto the ship during receiving operations, or off the ship during launching operations. As outlined above, because of the arrangement in which two vertical guide bars are positioned in each linear rail , at respective outer side edges  and , the two vertical guide bars  work in tandem to position the water vessel , towards the central portion of the ramp. According to an embodiment in which the parent ship  is receiving a water vessel  from the sea and transporting it onto a cargo deck , the vertical guide bars guide the water vessel , for proper alignment onto the tire arrangements . The first and second tire arrangement rows and then provide further cushioned guidance for the water vessel  as the tires  rotate to transport the water vessel  onto the cargo deck .","During receiving operations, the selected water vessel  is directed towards the ramp at a low velocity. When the parent ship  is at rest, the selected water vessel  is directed at a preferred speed of about 5 to 8 about knots. If the parent ship is moving, the preferred speed is about 5 to about 8 knots faster than the moving platform. If the water vessel  approaches the ramp at a speed slower than about 5 knots, an operator may attach a skiff hook to the bow eye and pull the water vessel  up onto the ramp . Water vessels  traveling at speeds greater than about 8 knots will engage internal brakes that will slow the vessel  to a manageable speed. The parent ship  may have a safety net that will stop the craft from launching itself forward over the ramp. The above stated velocities provide the initial momentum necessary to climb the ramp , but also allows for the safe reception of the water vessel  by the guide bar sets and . During receiving operations, after travelling up the ramp  on the tire arrangements and , the selected water vessel  may be pulled onto the cargo deck. As stated above, the elongated rungs  and  may be used to transition the water vessel  from the ramp  to the cargo deck . When launching a selected water vessel , the elongated rungs  and  may be used to transitionally guide the vessel  from the cargo deck  to the ramp .","According to another embodiment, in which the water vessel is being launched off the parent ship , the selected water vessel  is moved off the cargo deck  onto the ramp . Once on the ramp, the first and second tire arrangement rows and , via the rotating tires , cushion and guide the water vessel  downwards. As the water vessel  travels to a lower portion of the ramp , the water vessel  contacts the soft entry guide bar sets and , which further cushion and guide the water vessel  into the surrounding water.","What has been described and illustrated herein are preferred embodiments of the invention along with some variations.
