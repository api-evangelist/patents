title: M-Ary phase shift keying (PSK) bit-boundary turbo coded system
abstract: A turbo coded communication system includes a gray scale mapper in a transmitter for generating a symbol constellation of modulated signals points that can be separated by boundary lines in the constellation space into bitwise groups of zero bits and one bits where the shortest distance from a boundary line to received value in the constellation space indicates the bitwise soft metrics that is computed using a set of bitwise soft metric equations are a function of a minimum angle using closed form algebraic equations in turbo decoding receiver. In the case of phase shift keying (PSK) modulation, the bit boundary lines are predetermined by a minimum angle in the constellation space for a specified M-ary modulation, so that, the soft metric equations are only a function of the received signal value for providing efficient computation of the bitwise soft metric.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present application is related to applicant's copending application entitled M-Ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) Bit-Boundary Turbo Coded System Ser. No. 10\/462,962, filed Jun. 17, 2003, by the same inventor.","The invention relates to the field of turbo coded communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to gray code mapping during transmission and bit boundary metric determinations during reception for improved performance in phase shift keying (PSK) modulation and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) turbo coded communication systems.","Communication system performance is enhanced by both power and bandwidth efficiencies. Since 1993, turbo codes have been shown to be powerful forward error correction codes that enhance communication system performance. Many commercial communication systems use turbo codes as standards through the development of standard turbo codeces. Although a significant amount of coding gain can be achieved, the binary turbo codes do not have good bandwidth efficiency due to low code rates unless heavily punctured with additional coding bits. Heavily punctured turbo coding results in bit-error-rate (BER) performance degradation. Conventional approaches to improving bandwidth efficiencies are to adopt turbo trellis coded modulation (TTCM). For most TTCM structures, each modulated symbol corresponds to a state transition during modulation where a respective metric is computed for each received symbol during reception. A TTCM system can provide good turbo code performance without bandwidth expansion. However, a TTCM system requires a different code structure than a conventional binary turbo code. Each unique turbo code design results in an expensive new codec development.","One way to attain both power and bandwidth efficiencies is to adopt high-order modulation schemes with a binary turbo code. An alternative to a TTCM structure for obtaining both power and bandwidth efficiency is to adopt high-order nonbinary modulation such as M-ary phase shift keying (PSK) modulation or M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). High-order nonbinary modulation structures include, for examples, the commonly used 8-ary PSK or 16-ary PSK, with a commonly used binary turbo code, or for examples, the commonly used 16-ary QAM, or 64-ary QAM, with a commonly used binary turbo code. These high-order nonbinary modulation methods require a conversion of demodulator output that is associated with the nonbinary channel symbol into bit metrics as inputs to the binary turbo decoder. The advantage of M-ary nonbinary modulation is that no new codec development is required because the binary turbo codeces are commercially available. However, the problem with M-ary nonbinary modulation is the need to implement improved methods of forming the bitwise decoding metrics on binary bits from the nonbinary demodulator. For most TTCM structures, each modulated symbol has a state with a transition from one state to another state defining a metric distance. The maximum likelihood metric, which is associated with the minimum Euclidean distance, is formed at the demodulator and used for turbo decoding. However, for the binary turbo coding, the bitwise metrics must be formed for turbo decoding.","One way to form the bitwise decoding metrics from a PSK or a QAM demodulator is to use the maximum likelihood metric that is the optimum one for uncoded demodulation as widely used. Unfortunately, forming this metric requires complex circuitry and knowledge of channel condition, which is sometimes unavailable. More importantly, this decoding metric gives inferior bit-error-rate (BER) performance to the TTCM system. A puncturing approach is applied to a trellis coded modulation using a turbo coding, such as a rate (m\u22121)\/m binary convolutional code punctured from an optimum and widely used rate 1\/2 convolutional code followed by a 2-ary PSK or QAM modulation, where L is the number of bits in a symbol. A property of this puncturing approach is that a complicated mapping is used for the signal constellation. Common puncturing converts a commonly used turbo code into a rate turbo code of rate m\u2032\/m, where m\u2032<m, for an 2-ary high order binary modulation. A gray code approach can be used where gray code mapping defines a signal constellation space and can be used during turbo coding that also utilizes puncturing for improved bandwidth efficiency. However, when m\u2032\/m is greater than \u00bd, more than 50% of parity check bits need to be discarded, which can cause additional BER degradation. These and other disadvantages are solved or reduced using the invention.","An object of the invention is to provide a soft metric generator using boundary lines within the symbol constellation space for encoded symbols in a turbo code communication system.","Another object of the invention is to provide a soft metric generator using boundary lines within the symbol constellation space for gray code encoded symbols in a turbo code communication system using quadrature amplitude modulation.","Yet another object of the invention is to provide a soft metric generator using boundary lines within the symbol constellation space for gray code encoded symbols in a turbo code communication system using phase shift keying modulation.","The invention is directed to a turbo code communication system that forms bit boundary turbo decoding metrics for M-ary waveforms. A first aspect of the invention is directed to forming bit boundary turbo decoding metrics for M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) waveforms. A second aspect of the invention is directed to forming of bit boundary turbo decoding metrics for M-ary phase shift keying (PSK) waveforms. The bit boundary metrics determinations can be directly implemented without prior knowledge of channel condition. The bit boundary metrics provide improved bit error rate (BER) performance.","In the preferred form, an input data stream is passed through a conventional turbo encoder providing turbo encoded data that is then mapped through a mapper, such as a gray scale mapper, prior to M-ary modulation and communication of channel symbols over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. The received channel symbols are demodulated by an M-ary demodulator into demodulated received quadrature signals that are fed into a soft metric generator generating gray scale bit boundary soft metrics that are then fed into a turbo decoder for generating an estimate of the original bit stream for effective M-ary turbo coding communications.","In a preferred form, a rate 1\/2 binary punctured turbo code from the commonly used rate 1\/3 turbo code is used. The bandwidth efficiency is achieved by directly cascading a power-efficient rate 1\/2 binary turbo code with high-order PSK or QAM modulations. Conventionally, the maximum likelihood metric that is associated with the shortest Euclidean distance, is formed by the soft metric generator and then used for turbo decoding. The bitwise soft metrics are generated for conventional turbo decoding. The use of gray scale encoding in the transmitter enables a computationally efficient soft metrics generator in the receiver using bit boundaries in the signal constellation space. The computation of the soft metrics is reduced to a closed form algebraic computation. Gray scale encoding determines the bit boundaries within the symbol constellation space. The algebraic equations are used to determine shortest distances between the demodulated received signal to the bit boundaries for generating the bitwise soft metrics. The gray scale encoding defines signal symbol points within the symbol constellation space and defines a minimum distance \u03b4 for a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) turbo communication system in the first aspect of the invention, or provides a minimum angle \u03b1 for a phase shift keying (PSK) modulation turbo communication system in the second aspect of the invention. The use of gray scale mapping enables the generation of a plurality of bitwise predetermined algebraic equations in the soft metrics generator. In the first aspect of the invention using QAM, the soft metric generator receives the demodulated received signal and computes the bitwise soft metrics using the predetermined minimum distance \u03b4 and the predetermined bitwise algebraic equations. In a second aspect of the invention using PSK modulation, the bitwise soft metrics generator receives the demodulated received signal and computes the bitwise soft metrics using the predetermined minimum angle \u03b1 and predetermined bitwise algebraic equations.","In two preferred forms of the first aspect, 16-ary QAM and 64-ary QAM predetermined distances and the predetermined algebraic equations are specified for direct implementation into the soft metrics generator in a QAM turbo communication system, without loss of generality. In two other preferred forms of the second aspect of the invention, 8-ary PSK and 16-ary PSK predetermined minimum angles and the predetermined algebraic equations are specified for direct implementation into the soft metric generator in a PSK modulation turbo communication system, without loss of generality. The preferred gray scale encoding provides improved BER performance with efficient soft metrics computations. The invention can be applied to various communication systems, including direct broadcasting, personal communications, and satellite communications. These and other advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.","An embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the figures using reference designations as shown in the figures. Referring to , an M-ary phase shift keying (PSK) modulation or quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) gray-scale bit-boundary turbo-coded communication system has improved power and bandwidth efficiency for communicating an input data stream d. The input data stream dis fed into a conventional binary turbo encoder. The turbo encoder may include two recursive convolutional encoders concatenated in a parallel along with an internal interleaver, all not shown, on the source data bits as a conventional turbo encoder. For example, turbo encoding the original data bits dis preferably accomplished using a rate 1\/3 turbo encoder consisting of two recursive systematic encoders for generating polynomial (23,35)in a parallel concatenated configuration with an S-random interleaver that is used to separate the input bits in the recursive convolutional encoders. A puncturing pattern is used to alternately delete the parity check bits from two recursive systematic encoders to make the turbo code rate 1\/2, with an S-random interleaver size of 1024 with S=17, where S is the conventional S-random interleaver parameter.","The turbo encoder provides turbo encoded data U={a, a, a, a, . . . , a} of abits. The encoded data Uis then mapped through a mapper, such as a gray scale mapper, into turbo-coded mapped symbols Sthat is fed into an M-ary modulator for generating a channel signal that is communicated over an additive white Gaussian noise channel providing noise components n, where j in the input bit index and k is the symbol index. The received signal ris demodulated by an M-ary demodulator into I and Q quadrature received signals. The M-ary modulator is an M-ary PSK or QAM modulator, and the M-ary demodulator is an M-ary PSK or QAM demodulator, respectively. The M-ary demodulator demodulates the received signal rinto demodulated quadrature signals, including the demodulated inphase received signal rand the demodulated quadrature received signal rthat are both fed into a soft metric generator for generating gray-scale bit-boundary soft bitwise metrics \u039bthat are generated for each bit aof each k symbol such that \u039bis a sequence of bitwise metrics for each ksymbol, that is, \u039b=\u039b(i) for i=1, . . . , L, where L is the order of modulation, such that 2=M. The bit wise soft metrics \u039bare fed into a turbo decoder that provides an estimate {circumflex over (d)}of the original data stream dfor power and bandwidth efficient turbo coded communications.","In an 8-ary mapper, every three consecutive coded bits, including systematic and parity-check bits, are denoted as [a, a, a], where the order L equals 3 and bit index i equals, 1, 2 or 3, and are grouped together and gray scale mapped to one of eight symbols within a 8-ary symbol constellation space. Likewise and in a 16-ary mapper, every four consecutive coded bits, including systematic and parity-check bits, are denoted as [a, a, a, a], and are grouped together and gray scale mapped to one of 16 symbols within a 16-ary symbol constellation space. Likewise and in a 64-ary mapper, every six consecutive code bits, including systematic and parity-check bits, are denoted as [a, a, a, a, a, a], and are grouped together and gray scale mapped to one of 64 symbols within a 64-ary symbol constellation space. Any M-ary mapper can be used, though in the exemplar forms, 8-ary PSK, 16-ary PSK, 16-ary QAM, and 64-ary QAM gray scale mappers are preferred. A 16-ary gray scale QAM symbol constellation space is shown in . A 64-ary gray scale QAM symbol constellation space is shown in . A 8-ary gray scale PSK symbol constellation space is shown in  and a 16-ary gray scale PSK symbol constellation space is shown in .

Without loss of generality, the average transmitted power is set to be unity.

For the case of QAM, the symbol constellation space has points defined by rectangular x-y coordinates that directly translate into the I and Q received signal coordinates. In the signal constellation space defining the signal space for QAM shown in , for each bit position a, a, a, and a, there is a bitboundary, a bitboundary, a bitboundary, and bitboundary. Each bit boundary is a line that separates all pairs of points that have 0 and 1 at a respective bit position. These bit boundaries effectively group half of the points for each bit position a, one group including points with ones in the abit position and the other group including points with zeros in the abit position. For example, in , there are eight groupings, with the bitboundary between groups bitand bit, with an bitboundary between groups bitand bit, a bitboundary between groups bitand bit, and a bitboundary between groups bit, and bit. For the 64-ary QAM symbol constellation space shown in , only two groupings are shown, group bitand group bit, for convenience, for the abit position. For each pair of groups of signal points that are associated with a bit position, there always exists one a bit boundary in the signal space that separate the pairs of bit- and bit- groups of signal points. The bit boundary bisecting of zero and one groups using straight-line bitbit boundaries is a result of the preferred gray scale mapping. Hence, the signal constellation space points are separated into bit- and bit- groups by ibit boundaries. The straight line bitbit boundaries can be designated by a y value or an x value in the constellation space for the preferred gray scale mapping. For examples, in the QAM signal space, the inphase horizontal i-axis where q=0 bisects the bitand bitgroups, and quadrature vertical q-axis where i=0 bisects the bitand bitgroups. All bitand bitgroups for 16-ary QAM are shown in , and only one such group for 64-ary QAM is shown in .","To satisfy the probability equation and to generate soft metric equations, the smallest magnitude in symbol constellation space, that is, the minimum distance \u03b4, from any signal point to the inphase i-axis or quadrature q-axis in either I or Q channels, respectively, among all symbol points, is used. The minimum distance \u03b4 is 1\/\u221a10 for 16-ary QAM. The minimum distance \u03b4 is 1\/\u221a42 for 64-ary QAM. The minimum distance \u03b4 can be used to define a point position or a bit boundary in the constellation space. For example, the i and q position values of symbol point {0,1,1,0} is at i=3\u03b4 and q=\u03b4, and there is a bitboundary line at i=\u00b12\u03b4. That is, the gray scale mapping enables the division of the symbol constellation space by bit boundaries for respective bits a, for separating the constellation space into two groups of points having 0 or 1 bit values for the respective bit a, in the respective bit position, so that, for each bit a, the constellation space is separated into a group of 0 bit values and a group of 1 bit values. That is, the bit boundaries separate 0 and 1 bit value groups of points. Using the gray scale mapping, the bit boundary lines extend in parallel to either the i-axis at a q-axis at values being multiples of the minimum distance \u03b4. As such, the bit boundary always extends between adjacent point pairs of 0 and 1 values for the respective bit position. The received signals are the received points in terms of x-i and y-q constellation space values, and, the bitwise soft metric \u039b is computed as the minimum spatial distance from the receive point to a bit boundary that separates zero and one bit values for the respective bit position. The bitwise soft metrics \u039b is computed using soft metric equations, one for each bit position. As such, and significantly, the soft metric \u039b is only a function of the demodulated received signal value rand the minimum distance \u03b4 in the constellation space.","In the case of 16-ary QAM, for example as shown in , bitand bitgroups of points have a bitboundary line that extends along the inphase i-axis at q=0. That is, the bit, boundary, which extends between the 0 and 1 values of the first bit a, extends along the inphase i-axis. Hence, the distance from the received signal to the bitboundary line for the first bit ais the distance from the received signal in quadrature rto the inphase i-axis, and hence, the soft metric is \u039b(1)=\u2212r, that is, the negative value of the received signal in quadrature. All of the 1 values for bit aare below the i-axis, and hence, the receive value in quadrature is negative. The negative sign in the soft metric \u039b(1)=\u2212rchanges the sign of the received signal so that all 1 values have a positive value. Oppositely, all positive received values of rare above the i-axis, and the negative sign in the soft metric \u039b(1)=\u2212rwould provide a negative value, and hence, the sign of the soft metric \u039b(1)=\u2212rcomputed value would indicate a 0 or 1 bit value, whereas the absolute value of the soft metric provides an indication of the probability of being a 0 or 1 bit value. As such, the Euclidean distances of the received signal perpendicular to the boundary lines represent reliability information for the corresponding received bit value especially in the presence of a high SNR. Therefore, with proper signs, the computed distances to a bit boundary can be used as the decoding soft metric and is efficiently computed.","In the case of the second bit a, as another example, the bitboundary extends horizontally at q=\u00b12\u03b4, that is, between the top two rows and between the bottom two rows, where the second bit value changes between 0 and 1. The soft metric distance from a received point to the bit boundary is 2\u03b4 minus the received value in quadrature r, that is, the asoft metric is \u039b(2)=2\/\u221a10\u2212|r|, where \u03b4=1\/\u221a10. In the case of the third bit a, the bitboundary extends vertically along the quadrature q-axis at i=0. For the third bit a, the soft metric is the distance from the inphase received point rto the quadrature q-axis that is the bitboundary. The soft metric for bit ais \u039b(3)=r. The bitboundaries extend vertically at x=\u00b12\u03b4, that is, between the first and second columns and between the third and fourth columns. For the fourth bit a, the soft metric inphase distance is \u039b(4) =2\u03b4\u2212r|, that is, \u039b()=2\/\u221a10\u2212|r|. Hence, for 16-ary QAM, the soft metrics are computed as \u039b(1)=\u2212r, \u039b(2)=2\/\u221a10\u2212|r|, \u039b(3)=r, and, \u039b(4)=2\/\u221a10 \u2212|r|.","The simplicity of these soft bit metric equations extends from the preferred gray scale mapping defining bit boundaries and from the computation of the distance from the received point in quadrature to the i-axis or the received point inphase to the q-axis. Using gray scale mapping, the vertical bit boundaries are intersected by the inphase i-axis and horizontal bit boundaries are intersected by the quadrature q-axis, that then enables derivation of the soft metric equations based only on the minimum distance \u03b4 and the inphase or quadrature received signal value in the constellation space. The minimum distance of the constellation space and the inphase or quadrature value of the received signal are all that is needed to compute the soft metric. These soft bit metrics computations do not require complicated CSI computations nor approximations, and can be readily implemented in the soft metric generator.","In the case of 64-ary QAM having a signal space as shown in , the process of computing the soft metric remains the same in generating simple soft metric equations. The minimum distance \u03b4 and the inphase or quadrature value of the received signal are again applied to simple computation soft metric equations where the sign of the result indicates a zero or one value and the magnitude is the reliability indicator. The minimal spatial distance to the first point is \u03b4. For example, the point 010110 has a coordinate location of i=\u03b4 and q=\u03b4. The minimum absolute spatial distance from this point to either the i-axis or q-axis is \u03b4. Again, for each bit position a, there is a bitboundary separating groups of 0 and 1 bit values. For example, the bitboundaries extends between the second and third columns and between the sixth and seventh columns, separating the signal constellation space into two groups bitand bit, as conveniently shown in . The bitboundary is i\u00b14\u03b4. All bitboundaries can be specified in terms of i-axis and q-axis location as a function of the minimum distance \u03b4. For 64-ary QAM, the gray scale constellation space also indicates that the inphase i-axis bisects vertical boundaries and that the quadrature q-axis bisects horizontal boundaries. The inphase or quadrature value of the received signal and minimum distance \u03b4 is all that is needed for computing the soft metric using the soft metric equations.","For 64-ary QAM, the bit, boundary is between abit position for bitgroup and bitgroup, and extends along the i-axis at q=\u00b10\u03b4=0. The bitboundary line is between the abit position for 0 and 1 bit values, and extends horizontally at q=\u00b14\u03b4. The bitboundary is between the abit position for 0 and 1 bit values, and extends horizontally at q=\u00b12\u03b4 and q=+6\u03b4. The bitboundary is between the apoints whose abit positions have 0 and 1 values, and extends vertically at i=\u00b10\u03b4=0. The bitboundary is between the apoints whose abit positions have 0 and 1 values, and extends vertically at x=\u00b14\u03b4. The bitboundary is between the apoints whose abit positions have 0 and 1 values, and extends vertically at x=\u00b12\u03b4 and x=\u00b16\u03b4. Hence, for 64-ary QAM, \u039b(1)=\u2212r, \u039b(2)=\u221a42\u2212|r|, \u039b(3)=2\u221a42\u2212|(|r\u22124\u221a42)|, \u039b(4)=r, \u039b(5)=4\u221a42\u2212|r|, and, \u039b(6)=2\u221a42\u2212|(|r|\u22124\u221a42)|. Using the preferred gray scale mapping applied to QAM, the vertical bit boundaries are intersected by the inphase i-axis and horizontal bit boundaries are intersected by the quadrature q-axis, that then enables derivation of the soft metric equations based only on the minimum distance \u03b4 and the demodulated received signal value rfor ease of computation of the soft metric having a metric sign indicating a zero or one bit value and having a metric magnitude indicating the probability of being a zero or one bit, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sup":["\u22126","\u22126"]},"The new third bit boundary method can also be applied when using PSK modulation.

By way of example, for 8-ary PSK there are eight points, and for 16-ary PSK there are sixteen points, as shown. The angular boundary lines are shown in polar form as radiating from the center location and having a bit boundary angle \u03b2 that uniquely defines the angular boundary line. As such, all bit boundary lines extend from the center location at a respective angle \u03b2, Similar to using QAM, the angular boundary lines separate abits into bitand bitgroups of bits of zeros and ones. The boundary line angle \u03b2 is a function of a minimum angle \u03b1 where \u03b1=2\u03c0\/M and is the minimum angular separation between two adjacent signals on the signal constellation space. In the case of 8-ary PSK, where M=8, the minimum angle \u03b1 is 2\u03c0\/8 or \u03b1=\u03c0\/4=45\u00b0. In the case of 16-ary PSK, the minimum angle \u03b1=2\u03c0\/16 or \u03b1=\u03c0\/8=22.5\u00b0 degrees. The shortest Euclidean distance from a received signal point in the symbol constellation space to an angular boundary line again represents the soft metrics as reliability information for the corresponding bit especially in the high SNR case. With proper signs, the shortest distances can be efficiently computed as bitwise soft metrics. The shortest distance extends along a line that is perpendicular to the angular boundary line and extends between the received signal point to the closest angular boundary line.","For 8-ary PSK, the minimum angle \u03b1 is \u03c0\/4.

The bitboundary lines are at \u03b2=2\u03b1\u00b12\u03b1=(\u03c0\/2)\u00b1(\u03c0\/2)=\u03c0;0, for separating the bitgroup of zero bit values for the bit aand the bitgroup of one bit values for the bit a.

There are respective distances from the received point to respective boundary lines. The shortest distance to the closet boundary line is the distance used, that is, the soft metric. For generating closed form bitwise soft metric equations, the received point defines a phase angle \u03b3 where \u03b3=tan(r\/r). The phase angle \u03b3 is the phase angle of the received signal (r, r), that is, the polar angle of the received signal in the symbol constellation space.

The preferred third bit boundary method requires only the received signal and minimum angle \u03b1. Additionally, the first and second methods also require knowledge of CSI. An inaccurate value of CSI will result in an incorrect soft metric that will in turn cause additional performance degradation. This requirement of accurate CSI imposes a disadvantage not found in the third bit boundary method. Hence, the adoption of third bit boundary method does not require CSI knowledge and presents computational advantages. The spectral efficiencies can be achieved for symbol waveforms of 1.5 bits\/symbol when 8-ary PSK is used, and, 2.0 bits\/symbol when 15-ary PSK is used. A degradation of 1.0 dB occurs when using rate 2\/3 as opposed to rate 1\/2 turbo code. Applying this 1.0 dB degradation when rate 2\/3 turbo code is used, the required E\/Nis 4.3 dB for 8-ary PSK at 2.0 bits\/symbol, or 6.5 dB for 16-ary PSK at 3.0 bits\/symbol, respectively, in order to achieve a BER of 10.","The present invention is directed to bit boundary computation methods of computing turbo decoding soft metrics at the output of the QAM or PSK demodulator. The preferred third bit boundary method only requires the simple computation from the receive signal values and performs with improved BER. The turbo-coded gray scale mapped and modulated waveforms provide similar performances to turbo trellis coded modulation based on the same interleaver size, and the same bandwidth efficiency, and the number of information bits per channel symbol. While the preferred form is directed to normalized minimum distances \u03b4 and angles \u03b1, and directed to gray scale mapping, the invention is generally applicable to any signal constellation space, applicable to any M-ary QAM or PSK modulation, applicable to any arbitrary turbo code, applicable to any type of mapping, to any arbitrary boundary lines, provided that the boundary lines separate groups of zero and one bit values for bitwise metric computation based on the computed shortest distance from the received point to a boundary line that extends in whole or in part through the signal constellation space. The new third method does not require new development of a new turbo codec. Although some turbo trellis code modulation schemes use a code structure of eight states, which is less complicated than the one used in the new third method, it is well known that the commonly used turbo codes with 8 states and 16 states perform essentially the same at a BER above 10. Therefore, a new third bit boundary method turbo code system provides a viable alternative to a turbo trellis coded modulation system. Those skilled in the art can make enhancements, improvements, and modifications to the invention, and these enhancements, improvements, and modifications may nonetheless fall within the spirit and scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
