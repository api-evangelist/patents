{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of data processing, and particularly to a software system and associated method that provides an analysis process and interface for accessing data coded in a display markup language, such as HTML, and maintained in systems that are linked together over an associated network, such as the Internet. More specifically, this invention pertains to a computer software product that enables a client application to programmatically access a Web site.","The World Wide Web (WWW) is comprised of an expansive network of interconnected computers upon which businesses, governments, groups, and individuals throughout the world maintain inter-linked computer files known as Web pages. Users navigate these pages by means of computer software programs commonly known as Internet browsers.","The authors of Web pages provide information known as metadata, within the body of the markup language document that defines the Web pages; commonly the markup language used is HTML, hypertext markup language. A computer software product known as a Web crawler systematically accesses Web pages by sequentially following hypertext links from page to page. The crawler indexes the pages for use by the search engines using information about a Web page as provided by its address or universal resource locator (URL), metadata, and other criteria found within the page.","Much of the publicly available information on the Internet is intended to be viewed by humans using browsers. These Web sites are primarily designed using the HTTP transport protocol and HTML display markup language. The use of HTML for presentation of Web data makes it difficult for application developers to gain programmatic access to the data on those Web sites.","The World Wide Web is increasingly used as a critical information source for both businesses and consumers. Recent advances in business-to-business (BB) technologies have resulted in the definition of standard interfaces for data exchange between companies. Web services are standard mechanisms for applications to inter-operate using Web protocols, i.e., programs that access remote computers to access data or to render other services such as weather, etc. These Web services use a remote procedure call (RPC). The RPC mechanism is an established concept, but uses Web protocols and data formats such as HTTP, XML, SOAP, or UDDI. The design of application programming interfaces (API) to access Web data is relatively difficult because Web sites make data available in a presentation markup language such as HTML but not in a computer-friendly format like XML, SOAP, or UDDI.","As an example, a Web site provides data that a business is interested in, such as weather or stock quotes. Human users can view this site using their browser, but the business wishes to programmatically automate the retrieval of information from that site. There is currently no means to automatically create an API to access the data on the Web site of interest.","Access to the Web site includes the request for information by the user and the response of the Web site to that request. Currently, for every Web site or request to a specific Web site, the programmer must spend significant time and effort analyzing methods for sending the request and retrieving the desired information. This task takes a great deal of programming skill, wherein the business wishing to programmatically access the information on the desired Web site may not have an employee with sufficient skill.","Though the lack of application programming interfaces (API) for Web data is partially helped by recent advances in Web data extraction technologies, the problem remains that no solutions exist for creating a standard interface description for the Web at large. What is therefore needed is a system for Web site analysis and program development that aids programmers in the development of programs or applications to automatically request and retrieve data from Web sites on the Internet that use a variety of data forms and protocols. The need for such a system has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","In an exemplary embodiment, a processor-implemented method for creating a web service to programmatically access a network addressable location via an intermediate gateway. includes analyzing a network page at the network addressable location: generating, at the intermediate gateway, a service description file and an executable code for the network page; translating the service description file into an executable code; translating the service description file into a standard Web service format including at least one of WSDL, WDS, or ISD; deploying the web service to the intermediate gateway, wherein the web service includes the executable code and the service description file, making the web service available to a client application; providing a runtime process to enable the client application to automatically make a programmatic request of the network addressable location; wherein the programmatic reciuest includes a host language having a structure; translating the structure of the programmatic request to a syntax of the network addressable location using a simple object access protocol (SOAP); submitting the programmatic request that uses the translated structure to the network addressable location using SOAP; the network addressable location executing the submitted programmatic request to obtain a response; translating the response to extract data satisfying the programmatic request; wrapping the extracted data in a SOAP envelope; and translating the wrapped response to a host data structure of the client application; and compiling the executable code.","In another embodiment, computer program product having executable instruction codes that are stored on a computer usable medium, for creating a web service to programmatically access a network addressable location via an intermediate gateway includes a set of instruction codes for analyzing a network page at the network addressable location; a set of instruction codes for generating, at the intermediate gateway, a service description file and an executable code for the network page; a set of instruction codes for translating the service description file into an executable code; a set of instruction codes for translating the service description file into a standard Web service format including at least one of WSDL, WDS, or ISD; a set of instruction codes for deploying the web service to the intermediate gateway, wherein the web service includes the executable code and the service description file, making the web service available to a client application; a set of instruction codes for providing a runtime process to enable the client application to automatically make a programmatic request of the network addressable location; wherein the programmatic request includes a host language having a structure; a set of instruction codes for translating the structure of the Programmatic request to a syntax of the network addressable location using a simple object access protocol (SOAP); a set of instruction codes for submitting the programmatic request that uses the translated structure to the network addressable location using SOAP; the network addressable location executing the submitted programmatic request to obtain a response; a set of instruction codes for translating the response to extract data satisfying the programmatic request; a set of instruction codes for wrapping the extracted data in a SOAP envelope: a set of instruction codes for translating the wrapped response to a host data structure of the client application; and a set of instruction codes for compiling the executable code.","In still another embodiment, a processor-implemented system for creating a service interface to programmatically access a network addressable location via an intermediate gateway includes means for analyzing a network page at the network addressable location; means for generating, at the intermediate gateway, a service description file and an executable code for the network page; means for translating the service description file into an executable code; means for translating the service description file into a standard Web service format including at least one of WSDL, WDS, or ISD; means for deploying the web service to the intermediate gateway, wherein the web service includes the executable code and the service description file, making the web service available to a client application; means for providing a runtime process to enable the client application to automatically make a programmatic request of the network addressable location; wherein the programmatic request includes a host language having a structure;

In addition to specifying how the Web browser is to display the document, HTML tags can be used to create hyperlinks to other Web documents.","HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol): The communications protocol used to connect to servers on the World Wide Web. Its primary function is to establish a connection with a Web server and transmit HTML pages to the client browser.","Internet: A collection of interconnected public and private computer networks that are linked together with routers by a set of standards protocols to form a global, distributed network.","SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): A message-based protocol based on XML for accessing services on the Web employing XML syntax to send text comma","URL (Uniform Resource Locator): A unique address that fully specifies the location of a content object on the Internet.

The browser gives some means of viewing the contents of Web documents and of navigating from one document to another.","Web document or page: A collection of data available on the World Wide Web and identified by a URL. In the simplest, most common case, a Web page is a file written in HTML and stored on a Web server. It is possible for the server to generate pages dynamically in response to a request from the user. A Web page can be in any format that the browser or a helper application can display. The format is transmitted as part of the headers of the response as a MIME type, e.g. \u201ctext\/html\u201d, \u201cimage\/gif\u201d. An HTML Web page will typically refer to other Web pages and Internet resources by including hypertext links.","Web site: A database or other collection of inter-linked hypertext documents (\u201cWeb documents\u201d or \u201cWeb pages\u201d) and associated data entities, which is accessible via a computer network, and which forms part of a larger, distributed informational system such as the WWW.

The servers ,  and the gateway  provide the communication access to the WWW or Internet. Users, such as remote Internet users, are represented by a variety of computers such as computers , , , and clients applications that can be incorporated on the network servers, such as server , can query the host server  for desired information through the communication network . Computers , ,  each include software that will allow the user to browse the Internet and interface securely with the host server .","The host server  is connected to the network  via a communications link  such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link. The servers ,  can be connected via high-speed Internet network lines ,  to other computers and gateways. The servers ,  provide access to stored information such as hypertext or Web documents indicated generally at , , and . The hypertext documents , ,  most likely include embedded hypertext link to other locally stored pages, and hypertext links , , ,  to other webs sites or documents ,  that are stored by various Web servers such as the server ","The operation or use of system  comprises the following four phases that will be described later in more detail: the analysis phase, the publishing phase, the discovery and development phase, and the runtime phase.","The Web site analysis phase analyzes the Web page of interest and generates a service description (SD) file for each form. The SD file contains all the information necessary for producing the ultimate output of the system: API description in the form of Web services description language (WSDL) files, well-defined service (WDS) files, and interface service deployment (ISD) files.","The analysis phase is illustrated in  and by method  of . The analyzer  of system  is connected through a network , such as the Internet, to a crawler or toolkit . The crawler  is one source of Web pages  for the system , and it can be any one of the many currently available crawlers. Data extracted from the Web pages  by the analyzer  are stored in the service database .","Web pages  can also be accessed by a user toolkit . The user toolkit  incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) through which the user instructs system  which pages or forms to analyze. One method for implementing the GUI is to embed the toolkit  in a Web browser.","While the user is browsing the Web sites, a panel next to the main viewing area provides buttons or links that allow the user to mark the current page or form for further analysis. Pages or forms selected by the user are then transferred to the analyzer . The user toolkit  also includes a data extraction feature that instructs a data extractor component how to extract data from pages returned to system  when the forms are submitted for analysis.","With further reference to , the crawler  sends a request in step  to the Web site , fetching via the Internet or other network  one or more \u201cseed pages\u201d which are Web sites . These seed pages  contain hyperlinks, or URLs. The URLs are extracted and inserted into a URL pool.","The crawler  then iteratively fetches a URL from the pool and fetches the corresponding document from the Web site  in step . For example, if the Web page  is an HTML page, URLs of the Web site  are again extracted and inserted in the URL pool.","The crawler  is configured to crawl only to a certain \u201cdepth\u201d; i.e., it may only move a certain number of links away from the Web pages . The distance is measured in terms of the number of links followed, so if the depth is three, the crawler will not go farther than three links away from the Web pages . Other parameters may control the speed and frequency with which Web documents are accessed, and whether every link is followed or a filtering mechanism allows for only a subset of all possible links to be pursued.","The crawler  passes each page  retrieved from the Web to the page analyzer  in step . The functions of the page analyzer  are shown in more detail in .","The analyzer  is generally comprised of a page analyzer , a service extractor , an executable code generator , and a standard service format producer . The page analyzer  scans the code of a Web page such as HTML page  and finds sections of that page that constitute a Web form. One page may contain several forms. For example, a form is identified in HTML by a \u201c<FORM>\u201d tag and contains one or more data entry tags such as \u201c<INPUT>\u201d and \u201c<SELECT>\u201d. The service extractor  then translates these forms into service descriptions.","The service extractor  analyzes a set of forms that originally resided on a single Web page and prepares the data for subsequent output as a service description by the standard service format producer . The service extractor  performs the following tasks:\n\n","The service extractor packages the information it extracted into a service description (SD) file, and passes it on to the standard service format producer  and to the executable code generator . The service description (SD) file is a composite file that contains all the information needed to invoke the Web service. The service extractor  converts forms such as HTML page  into Web services that can operate on a gateway (or on the client or server computer). The SD file comprises instructions for construction of the gateway. The SD file is typically written in XML.","The executable code generator translates the SD file into an executable code  such as Java that implements a SOAP interface wrapper. The executable code  is stored in the service database . The standard service format producer  translates the SD file into standard Web service format such as WSDL (Web services description language), WDS (well defined service) and ISD (invocation service description). The WSDL, WDS, and ISD files are all stored in the service database .","The second phase of system  is the publishing phase, as illustrated by the high-level architecture of . The service publisher  gathers WSDL, WDS, ISD, and executable code files from the service database  and prepares them for deployment.","The service publisher  first invokes an executable code compiler on each executable code file and gets executable code class files as a result. The service publisher  then deploys each service to a gateway at block  by uploading the executable code to the gateway, using the executable code class file and ISD file.","This process (block ) makes the Web service available to the client. One method for adding Web service files to the gateway at block  is by invoking the appropriate method in a SOAP service manager. The SOAP service manager \u201chosts\u201d SOAP services on a gateway. It receives requests from a client application and invokes the appropriate executable code class file that implements the service. Any existing SOAP service manager can be used.","Next, the service publisher  registers each service at a UDDI (universal description, discovery, and integration) registry  by invoking the appropriate method in the UDDI registry  and providing the WSDL and WDS files as input. The UDDI registry  is a registration service for Web servers to advertise Web services; for system , the UDDI will list all services available in the SOAP service manager. A client application or programmer  can query the registry to find the SOAP addresses and other parameters of interesting services. Any existing UDDI registry can be used.","The third phase of the operation of system  is the discovery and development phase. In phase , the programmer  accesses the UDDI registry  and develops client programs and applications that invoke the Web server at the gateway in block .","In an alternative embodiment of system , the latter can include the Web service gateway code in the client's software, thus obviating the need for the UDDI registry  and the gateway at block .","The fourth phase of the operation of system  is the runtime phase, illustrated by the high-level architecture of . The client  accesses the Web sites  through the gateway  via the network . The client is comprised of an application code  developed by a programmer and a SOAP wrapper  created automatically from the WSDL file by standard software development tools. The client sends a request to the gateway, as shown by network link .","The gateway  then sends a request to Web site  via network link . The Web site  returns to the gateway  a response to the request, as shown by network link . The gateway  then transfers the response of Web site  to the client  via link .","Web sites such as Web site  are designed for viewing by humans. The gateway  makes Web sites such as Web site  appear as a Web service designed for program access. The client  never sees the original Web site  form that is most likely written in HTML using the HTTP protocol. The gateway  translates the human readable Web site interface and presents to the client a machine readable interface most likely written in XML using the SOAP protocol.","The runtime phase operation or method  is illustrated by the flowchart of . The client  wishes to make a programmatic request of the Web site . This process is initiated when the application code  calls the wrapper function in step . The SOAP wrapper  translates the host language structure, such as Java, to SOAP. The request of the client  is transferred in step  to the gateway via network link , using SOAP protocol. In step , the gateway  translates the SOAP request to the format required by the Web site ; i.e., HTTP post.","The gateway  submits the Web form to the Web site  in step  via network link  using, for example, HTTP protocol. In step , the Web site  performs the action requested by the user in step , i.e., execute a database query.","The Web site  returns the response to the gateway  via the network link  in step ; the data format for the response shown by network link  is typically HTML, using HTTP protocol. In the preferred method of system , the HTTP response (step ) is translated by the gateway  to extract data in step .","The result of the data extraction is shown in step  as XML data. The XML data  is wrapped in a SOAP envelope by the gateway  in step . The wrapped response is transmitted via network link  to the client  in step . The protocol for network link  is SOAP with data format of XML.","Then, in step  the wrapped response to the original Web site  request is received and translated to the host data structure (e.g. Java) by the SOAP wrapper . Alternatively, the HTTP response may not be translated to XML, but instead wrapped directly in a SOAP envelope as shown by optional path .","An alternative embodiment of the run-time phase of system  is shown in . In this embodiment, the functions of the gateway are included in the client , allowing the client to directly communicate through the network  to the Web site .","The client is comprised of an application code  developed by a programmer and an HTTP wrapper . The client sends a request to the Web site  via network link . The request is coded in HTML using HTTP protocol. The Web site  responds to the request in HTML using HTTP protocol and transmits it back to the client via network link . This format is recognized by the client  and translated as needed for the application code .","The runtime phase operation of the alternative embodiment is illustrated by the flowchart of . The client  wishes to make a programmatic request of the Web site . This process is initiated when the application code  calls the HTTP wrapper function in step . The wrapper function is generated by the executable code generator. The HTTP wrapper  translates the host language structure, such as Java, to HTTP using the executable code that is stored in the service database. The request of the client  is submitted in step  to the Web site  via network link , using the HTTP protocol.","In step , the Web site  performs the action requested by the user in step , i.e., execute a database query. The Web site  returns the response to the client  in step ; the data format for the response shown by network link  is typically HTML, using HTTP protocol. In a preferred method of system , the HTTP response (step ) is processed by the client  to extract data in step .","The result of the data extraction is shown in step  as XML data. In step , the client application code  translates the XML data to the host language data structure such as JAVA. Alternatively, the HTTP response is not translated to XML first, but is instead translated directly from HTTP to the host language data structure in step , as shown by optional link .","It is to be understood that the specific embodiments of the invention that have been described are merely illustrative of certain application of the principle of the present invention.
