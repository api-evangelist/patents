Online merchants sell services such as legal counsel, financial services, and airline tickets and other travel products that may be provided on a real time basis or subsequently provided to the customer. Online merchants also sell hard goods including books, appliances, furniture, apparel, and music and movies provided on compact disks or digital versatile discs. Customers of online merchants shop and make purchases from desktop computers and a plurality of portable electronic devices. Customers may pay for goods and services purchased online using a variety of methods including credit card accounts, bank demand deposit accounts using a debit card, and online payment services. Technical advances in portable electronic devices including larger display screens, richer graphics, and greater processing power enable these devices to view more detailed demonstrations of products provided by online merchants. Faster transmission speeds and flat data rate plans allow portable electronic devices to receive purchased software, music, and video content products almost instantaneously. Increase of overall bandwidth enables smaller vendors to access an expanding population of online shoppers.","In an embodiment, a mobile payment services integration system is provided. The system comprises a computer system and an application, that when executed on the computer system, maintains a list of payment options associated with a portable electronic device. The system also authenticates an identity of the portable electronic device in connection with a first online purchase transaction with a first online merchant. The system also orders payment using one of the payment options to the first online merchant. The system also authenticates the identity of the portable electronic device in connection with a second online purchase transaction with a second online merchant, where the first online merchant is unaffiliated with the second online merchant. The system also orders payment using one of the payment options to the second online merchant.","In another embodiment, a processor-implemented method of payment service and platform authentication integration is provided. The method comprises a portable electronic device sending a first message to an online merchant in association with an online transaction, the first message comprising identifying information linked to the portable electronic device. The method also comprises the online merchant sending a second message to a mobile payment server furnishing the identifying information. The method also comprises the mobile payment server using the identifying information to authenticate the portable electronic device. When the mobile payment server has successfully authenticated the portable electronic device, the method also comprises the mobile payment server sending a third message to the online merchant providing a list of prearranged payment options associated with the portable electronic device wherein the third message excludes account details associated with the prearranged payment options.","In an embodiment, a processor-implemented method of payment service and platform authentication integration is provided. The method comprises an online merchant sending a first message to a mobile payment server requesting available payment options for a portable electronic device to complete a transaction with the online merchant. The method also comprises the mobile payment server sending a second message to the portable electronic device containing available payment options to complete a transaction with the online merchant, wherein the second message does not contain secure account information associated with the payment options. The method also comprises the online merchant sending a third message to the mobile payment server containing the selected payment option and requesting payment for the transaction using the selected payment option. The method also comprises the mobile payment server sending a fourth message to a payment services provider associated with the selected payment option requesting payment to the online merchant for the transaction. The method also comprises the payment services provider processing payment to the online merchant. The method also comprises the payment services provider sending a fifth message to the mobile payment server providing a confirmation of payment to the online merchant. The method also comprises the mobile payment server sending a sixth message to the online merchant notifying the online merchant that the payment for the transaction by the payment services provider has been processed.","These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below, the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","Several embodiments of a mobile payment service integration system permit a portable electronic device, for example a mobile telephone, to be presented a previously registered list of payment options while making a remote purchase and\/or an online purchase with the portable electronic device, and with a single keystroke or click to choose a payment method and complete the transaction. During a sale, when an online merchant recognizes the portable electronic device as a subscriber to the system, it contacts a mobile payment server. The mobile payment server verifies the identity of the portable electronic device using the network access identifier or other designation associated with the portable electronic device. The mobile payment server replies to the online merchant with a qualified list of online payment options previously registered by subscriber that owns the portable electronic device with the system. The online merchant provides the list to the portable electronic device and requests the portable electronic device to choose the payment option from the list it intends to use for the transaction. The payment option selected by the portable electronic device is relayed by the online merchant to the mobile payment server which then contacts a payment services provider corresponding to the chosen payment option. The mobile payment server provides the transaction information to the payment services provider including the identity of the online merchant and the amount of the transaction. The payment services provider then makes payment to the online merchant and advises the mobile payment server of this action. The mobile payment server notifies the online merchant that it has been paid and the transaction is concluded.","The present disclosure addresses the integration of customer authentication services and payment services into the virtual storefront of the online merchant. The portable electronic device presents only the graphical interface of the online merchant. The online merchant in its interface embeds and abstracts from the portable electronic device the presentation and interactions of the mobile payment server and payment services providers. This provides the online merchant complete virtual control of the customer interface and direction of the customer experience. The user of the portable electronic device by previously registering its payment methods receives the benefits of choice, security, and control as well as the convenience of making online purchases with as little as a single keystroke.","The portable electronic device in making its purchase may be presented only a list of payment options. The other interactions described are not visible to the portable electronic device. The online merchant electronically recognizes that the portable electronic device is a subscriber to the service provided by the system, contacts the mobile payment server for available payment options, presents the payment options to the portable electronic device for its selection, and passes the selection made back to the mobile payment server. The online merchant shortly receives notice that it has been paid. The online merchant sees no account details for the choice made by the portable electronic device. Each of these steps may take place with minimal or no action by the online merchant and the portable electronic device and may complete in a matter of seconds. In an embodiment, the portable electronic device may designate a default payment method to use unless it specifically chooses otherwise. With each online transaction the portable electronic device is presented only the default payment method for selection but is given the option to be shown the full list of previously stored payment methods if the portable electronic device chooses not to use the default payment method for any reason.","Many of the system's interactions are transparent to both the portable electronic device and the online merchant. The online merchant may present the only interface visible to the portable electronic device and may control contact the portable electronic device has with the system. The existence and actions of the mobile payment server and payment service providers are not apparent to the portable electronic device. The subscriber using the portable electronic device normally does not need to specifically identify himself\/herself or provide authentication when shopping with the portable electronic device because the network access identifier of the portable electronic device or other identification passed to the mobile payment server can be used to matched the portable electronic device with the subscriber and his\/her registered payment options. Under some circumstances, for example when an online purchase is unusually large, credentials such as a password or personal identification number (PIN), may be requested of the portable electronic device. Credentials also may be requested when a delivery address for purchased goods is specified that does not match a billing address on file with the payment server or payment services provider for the portable electronic device or does not otherwise match entries in an address book associated with the portable electronic device.","When initially establishing its service relationship, the subscriber, via the portable electronic device, registers his\/her payment options. The mobile payment server securely stores and integrates the payment options for the use of the portable electronic device in making online transactions. The portable electronic device may provide alias designations for payment options to further secure its credit information, and an online merchant would only receive these aliases for presentation to the portable electronic device during a transaction. Communications between the mobile payment server and payment service providers are not accessible to online merchants, and, upon receiving payment in a transaction, online merchants receive only the funds and the identity of the transaction and no account information for the portable electronic device. When a transaction is concluded, the online merchant's session with the portable electronic device may remain open for additional transactions to be completed. Payment options stored by the mobile payment server for use by the portable electronic device in making online purchases may include credit card accounts, bank account debit accounts, and online payment services.","Turning now to , a system  for mobile payment service integration is provided. The system  comprises a mobile payment server , a mobile payment application , an identifiers database , an accounts database , a portable electronic device , an online merchant , a payment services provider , a base transceiver station , and a network .","The mobile payment server  may be a computer system. Computer systems are discussed in greater detail hereinafter. The mobile payment server  may comprise one computer or a plurality of computers, for example, a server farm wherein many server computers cooperate to share a processing load. The mobile payment server  may comprise a plurality of computers that are located at different places, for example, to provide geographical diversity and increased service reliability. The mobile payment server  executes one or more applications that provide services including hosting of the mobile payment application .","The mobile payment application  executes on the mobile payment server  and provides payment processing services for online merchants  and their customer's portable electronic devices . The mobile payment application  integrates and presents stored payment methods for use in completing online transactions. The mobile payment application  receives messages from online merchants  containing information identifying portable electronic devices  and details of purchase transactions the portable electronic devices  are seeking to complete using payment methods previously registered by the portable electronic devices  with the mobile payment application . The mobile payment application  uses the network access identifier (NAI) or other designation for a portable electronic device  to verify that the portable electronic device  is registered with the mobile payment application  and has one or more forms of payment on file with the mobile payment application . Once verification is complete, the mobile payment application  examines the information about the transaction the online merchant  is seeking to complete with the portable electronic device . The mobile payment application  examines the payment methods previously registered with it by the portable electronic device  and determines the payment methods that may be used by the portable electronic device  to complete the contemplated transaction. After providing these methods to the online merchant  and receiving in return from the online merchant  the choice of payment method made by the portable electronic device , the mobile payment application  contacts the payment services provider , for example an online payment services provider, associated with the chosen payment method. The mobile payment application  provides payment information to the payment services provider  and requests the payment services provider  to make payment to the account of the online merchant . Once this is complete, the mobile payment application  notifies the online merchant  that payment to it has been made and the transaction is completed.","The mobile payment application  comprises the verification component  that receives the network access identifier (NAI), mobile device number (MDN), international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), or other identifying information for the portable electronic device . This information was provided to the online merchant  by the portable electronic device , and the online merchant  relays the information to the verification component  when seeking payment for its sale transaction. In an embodiment, the identifying information may be conveyed automatically from the portable electronic device  to the online merchant  as a portion of the message sent by the portable electronic device  to initiate shopping at the online site. This automatic transmission of identifying information and the authentication and\/or verification of the portable electronic device  based on the automatically transmitted identifying information may relieve a user of the portable electronic device  of the burden of entering a user id and a password and perhaps stopping an in-progress purchase due to having forgotten a password. The verification component  compares the network access identifier or other information to information in the identifiers database  associated with the portable electronic device . The verification component  seeks to match the network access identifier provided by the online merchant  on behalf of the portable electronic device  with a network access identifier stored in the identifiers database  and thereby determine that the portable electronic device  has previously registered and is eligible to pay for goods using the mobile payment application . Using only the network access identifier or other information associated with the portable electronic device  to verify the identity of the party seeking to make an online purchase and not requiring further authentication may be sufficient in authorizing payment for a sale transaction.","If a transaction exceeds a predetermined amount or is determined to be significantly out of character for a portable electronic device , given its previous online purchasing history, in an embodiment, the verification component  may request a user name, password, and\/or personal identification number (PIN) from the portable electronic device . If the delivery address for purchased goods is specified that does not match a billing address on file for the portable electronic device  or does not otherwise match entries in an address book associated with the portable electronic device , additional credentials may be requested. If the verification component  is unable to locate a network access identifier in the identifiers database  that matches the network access identifier provided by the online merchant  on behalf of the portable electronic device , the verification component  may require authentication regardless of the specifics of the transaction. If the verification component  cannot verify the network access identifier or other information provided, and the portable electronic device  does not provide sufficient authentication, the mobile payment application  may decline the payment.","Providing its network access identifier to the online merchant  requires little action by the portable electronic device . When the portable electronic device  initiates contact with the online merchant  to begin shopping and perhaps make a purchase, the online merchant  may recognize the network access identifier associated with the portable electronic device . The online merchant  also may recognize that the portable electronic device  is registered with the mobile payment application  and hence able to purchase goods using a stored payment method. The actions by the online merchant  of reading the network access identifier associated with the portable electronic device , recognizing that the portable electronic device  may be registered with the mobile payment application , verifying with the verification component  the registration of the portable electronic device , and generating the available payment methods may all be taken with minimal action by the portable electronic device  and may occur in a short period, for example a few seconds.","The mobile payment application  also comprises the account access component  that accesses the accounts database  to determine the payment methods previously registered by the portable electronic device  with the mobile payment application . The payment methods may comprise credit card accounts, bank deposit accounts accessible by debit card or other method, online payment service providers, or other payment alternatives. After the verification component  has verified the identity of the portable electronic device , the account access component  then searches the accounts database  to determine which of the registered payment methods may be used to complete the transaction submitted by the online merchant . In an embodiment, not all of the registered payment methods for a portable electronic device  may be used to complete a certain transaction. Some online merchants  may accept payment from only certain payment services providers . Some payment services provider  may do business with only certain online merchants  or may have restrictions about the minimum and maximum sizes of transactions they may wish to process for online merchants . Some payment services providers  may have requirements regarding sales tax collection and remittance and jurisdictions in which sales may be made that some online merchants  may find commercially unacceptable.","The account access component  reviews the amount of the transaction submitted by the online merchant  and business requirements of the online merchant , the payment services provider , and perhaps the portable electronic device . After this review is complete, the account access component  compiles a list of the registered payment methods that may be used by the portable electronic device  to conclude the transaction. In an embodiment, the portable electronic device  may have specified a default payment method, for example a specific credit card or debit card account, that is to be used for all transactions, for transactions of a certain type, or for transactions exceeding or below a specific amount. In an embodiment, if the account access component  determines that the contemplated transaction may be completed using the default payment method, the account access component  does not compile a list of registered payment methods and instead provides advice that the default payment method may be used.","The account access component , as the primary component accessing the accounts database , also adds new payment methods to the accounts database  when provided by the portable electronic device  and deletes payment methods as directed. The account access component  may provide an application programming interface or other interface that permits direct access to the mobile payment application  by the portable electronic device  for making payment account changes when a transaction with an online merchant  is not involved. In an embodiment, a user of the portable electronic device  may make changes to a set of payment methods stored in the accounts database  from a remote computer.","The mobile payment application  also comprises the transaction component  that handles interactions related to the receipt, processing, and completion of, as well as messaging about requests for payment arising from online transactions. In an embodiment, the online merchant  communicates with the mobile payment application  via the transaction component . The transaction component  coordinates the interactions of the other components of the mobile payment application  with the online merchant . The transaction component  is the component with which the online merchant  interacts when it is completing a transaction with the mobile payment application . The transaction component  also may not generally interact directly with the identifiers database , the accounts database , or payment services providers  as interactions with these components are primarily the function of the verification component , the account access component , and the payment component , described below, respectively. The transaction component  receives the initial communication from the online merchant  indicating that a portable electronic device  may seek to use a payment method registered with the mobile payment application  to complete a purchase transaction. The transaction component  logs the initial contact and may request the verification component  to attempt to verify the identity of the portable electronic device  using the network access identifier received in the initial contact. The transaction component  may handle any requests for authentication made by the verification component . While the online merchant  controls the interface and interactions with the portable electronic device , components of the mobile payment application  may require information from the portable electronic device  during a transaction. The transaction component  communicates to the online merchant  the need for information from the portable electronic device  to complete payment.","The transaction component  also provides a list of available payment options for a given transaction to the online merchant  generated by the account access component . The payment options may be displayed in the form of alias designations created previously by the portable electronic device . The list of available payment options may be created by the account access component  and embedded by the transaction component  into the interface of the online merchant , for example stitched into the hypertext markup language (HTML) file associated with a purchase web page provided by the online merchant  to the portable electronic device . The transaction component  subsequently receives the choice of payment methods made by the portable electronic device  and finally communicates with the online merchant  when payment from the payment services provider  has been completed.","The mobile payment application  also comprises the payment component  that interacts with the chosen payment services provider  after the payment method has been selected by the portable electronic device  and the transaction is ready to be completed with payment made to the account of the online merchant . The payment component  provides information to the chosen payment services provider  about the identification of the online merchant  to whom payment should be directed, bank deposit account or other remittance information associated with the online merchant , and supplementary remittances for sales tax, shipping, insurance, and other amounts payable under the transaction. The payment component  maintains contact with the payment services provider  as it makes payments required to complete the transaction. The payment component  reports to the transaction component  when payment is complete. The payment component  may provide an official payment code, remittance advice, or confirmation generated by the payment services provider  to certify that payment was made to the account of the online merchant . The credit advice is passed on by the transaction component  to the online merchant  as confirmation that payment has been made. The online merchant  may not be advised of the identity of the payment services provider  or the payment method used by the portable electronic device . In an embodiment, the credit advice provided by the transaction component  on behalf of the payment services provider  may be the only information required by the online merchant .","The identifiers database  is associated with the mobile payment server  and stores network access identifiers, mobile device numbers, and other information that identifies portable electronic devices  that are registered with the mobile payment application  to complete online transactions using stored payment methods. The verification component  searches the identifiers database  and compares identifiers stored in the identifiers database  with information identifying a portable electronic device  received from an online merchant . The verification component  seeks to match identifying information about portable electronic devices  completing transactions with identifying information found in the identifiers database .","The accounts database  is associated with the mobile payment server  and stores payment account information previously furnished by portable electronic devices  to the mobile payment application  for use in making online transactions. The accounts database  may store information associated with credit card accounts, bank deposit accounts accessible by debit card numbers, online payment providers, and other electronic payment methods. When a portable electronic device  establishes a relationship with the mobile payment application  to enable making electronic payments for online transactions, it provides information for payment accounts it may intend to use and this information is stored in the accounts database . The information is accessed and analyzed by the account access component  when the transaction component  receives a request for processing of a transaction from an online merchant .","The portable electronic device  contacts online merchants  to electronically shop for goods and services. The portable electronic device  may be a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet computer, or a laptop computer. The portable electronic device  may contact online merchants  to engage in online shopping using a variety of methods including a web browser. The portable electronic device  also may make audible contact with online merchants  and make choices using voice-activated commands or by using the keypad or graphical user interface of the portable electronic device .","The online merchant  sells goods and services and executes other transactions with portable electronic devices . The online merchant  may sell software for use on the portable electronic device  that is instantaneously delivered to and installed on the portable electronic device . The online merchant  may sell software, electronic products such as music, literature, video, and graphic content, and other soft content that is delivered electronically for use on devices other than the portable electronic device . The online merchant  may sell hard goods such as electronic devices, appliances, books, furniture, clothing, and music and video content provided on digital versatile disks (DVD) or other media that are subsequently delivered to the user of the portable electronic device  or other party. The online merchant  may sell services such as airline or other travel arrangements and financial services. The online merchant  may be associated with retail merchants that operate physical retail locations.","The online merchant  may use custom software created to function with the components of the mobile payment application . The software may allow, for example, portions of an electronic document created by the mobile payment application  using hypertext markup language (HTML) to be embedded into a web page of the online merchant  and appear seamless such that the actions and identity of the mobile payment application  are not apparent. The embedded portion of the electronic document created by the mobile payment application  might contain the list of available payment options with instructions to the portable electronic device  to choose one. The embedded portion might contain dialogue boxes that permit the portable electronic device  to enter credentials when these are required. While in this instance the portable electronic device  is entering credentials into a web page presented and apparently created by the online merchant , in fact the credentials may be encrypted before they are passed through the infrastructure of the online merchant  and on to the mobile payment application .","Payment services providers  are credit card companies, banks, online payment services, and other payment entities that make payments to online merchants  at the direction of the mobile payment application . Payment services providers  are designated by portable electronic devices  when they establish a relationship with the mobile payment application  to enable payment for purchases and other transactions made with online merchants . Information about payment services providers  provided by portable electronic devices  is stored in the accounts database  and accessible by the account access component .","The base transceiver station  may be any of a cellular wireless base station, for example a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), and\/or Universal Mobile Communications System (UMTS) cellular wireless base station; a World-wide Interoperable Microwave Access (WiMAX) base station; a WiFi access point; Long-Term Evolution (LTE); or other wireless access device.","The portable electronic device  is depicted in  as communicating wirelessly via the base transceiver station  with the other components of the system . It is understood that in some embodiments the portable electronic device  may communicate with the other components of the system  using other communications technologies including wired links and the base transceiver station  may not be used. While one portable electronic device  and one base transceiver station  are illustrated in , it is understood that the system  may comprise any number of these devices.","The network  promotes communication between the components of the system . The network  may be any communication network including a public data network (PDN), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a private network, and\/or a combination thereof.","Turning now to , a processor-implemented method  of payment service and platform authentication integration is provided. Beginning at block , a portable electronic device  sends a first message to an online merchant  furnishing identifying information while engaging in a transaction with the online merchant . The identifying information, that may comprise the NAI, MBN, IMSI, or other identifying information for the portable electronic device , may be passed automatically to the online merchant  without intervention by the user of the portable electronic device . The conveying of the identifying information may occur when the portable electronic device  logs into the online merchant  and may not require a transaction to be initiated.","At block , the online merchant  sends a second message to the mobile payment server  furnishing the identifying information received from the portable electronic device  at block . The online merchant  sends the identifying information because the portable electronic device  has indicated that it may wish to consummate a purchase with the online merchant . The portable electronic device  may have stated or otherwise disclosed that it wishes to use a payment method on file with the mobile payment application , or the online merchant  may have detected that the portable electronic device  has an established relationship with the mobile payment application .","At block , the verification component  of the mobile payment application  uses the identifying information received at block  to search the identifiers database  to match the received identifying information with at least one of a NAI, MBN, or other identifying information stored in the identifiers database . The verification component , by positively matching the identifying information received at block  with a record in the identifiers database , determines that the portable electronic device  is registered with the system  and may have payment methods on file with the system in the accounts database . After the verification component  at block  makes this positive match and determination, the account access component  subsequently at block  searches the accounts database  for stored payment accounts that the portable electronic device  may use in completing a contemplated transaction with the online merchant . In an embodiment, the online merchant  may have provided information about the contemplated transaction earlier in the method  to enable the account access component  to qualify certain stored payment methods and disqualify other stored payment methods as candidate methods for use in completing the transaction. At block , the account access component  determines the stored payment method(s) that the portable electronic device  may use. If the portable electronic device  has designated a default payment method, the account access component  will determine if it may be used.","At block , the transaction component  of the mobile payment application  sends a third message to the online merchant  confirming that the portable electronic device  has been identified as eligible to complete the contemplated transaction using a payment method stored with the mobile payment application . The transaction component  provides the eligible payment method(s) to the online merchant .","Turning now to , a processor-implemented method  of payment service and platform authentication integration is provided. Beginning at block , an online merchant  sends a first message to a mobile payment server  requesting prearranged payment options that a portable electronic device  may use in completing an online transaction with the online merchant . At block , the mobile payment server  sends a second message to the portable electronic device  containing the payment options requested by the online merchant  at block . The second message includes payment options available to the portable electronic device  but does not include account information related to the payment options. For example, in an embodiment, the second message may identify a payment option as \u201cCredit Card X of Robert R Roberts\u201d but not include confidential account and\/or financial information such as an account number, an authorization number, or a PIN. Other account information that is not made visible is additional identifying information, for example the customer's social security number or the security code on the customer's credit card. Credit information, such as the customer's credit score or credit history that might be on file or otherwise accessible to the mobile payment server , would also not be transmitted. Additional names, account expiration dates, and credit limits on a customer account would also not be transmitted. Identifying account information also may be referred to as account designation information or account alias information. The exclusion of confidential information may reduce the risk of identity theft, for example reducing the risk of exposing confidential information associated with a user of the portable electronic device  in the event the online merchant  is attacked by an electronic criminal and\/or identity thief. The mobile payment application  will have previously determined through identifying information associated with the portable electronic device  that the portable electronic device  has previously registered payment methods with the mobile payment application . In an embodiment, the steps of the method  may be a continuation of the steps of the method  with the steps of the method  and the method  together describing the primary interactions of the components of the system  in an embodiment of the present disclosure.","At block , the online merchant  sends a third message to the mobile payment server  providing the prearranged payment options that the portable electronic device  selected to complete the transaction. The portable electronic device  prior to block  will have communicated its selected payment option to the online merchant . In an embodiment, the listing of payment options may not be sent in an actual message but may be embedded in a displayed web page of the online merchant  that the portable electronic device  may view.

It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally, a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software, because re-spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re-spinning a software design. Generally, a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware, for example in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed, by well known design rules, to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus, likewise a computer that has been programmed and\/or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.","The secondary storage  is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non-volatile storage of data and as an over-flow data storage device if RAM  is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage  may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM  when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM  is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM  is a non-volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM  is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM  and RAM  is typically faster than to secondary storage .","I\/O devices  may include printers, video monitors, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), touch screen displays, keyboards, keypads, switches, dials, mice, track balls, voice recognizers, card readers, paper tape readers, or other well-known input devices.","The network connectivity devices  may take the form of modems, modem banks, Ethernet cards, universal serial bus (USB) interface cards, serial interfaces, token ring cards, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) cards, wireless local area network (WLAN) cards, radio transceiver cards such as code division multiple access (CDMA), global system for mobile communications (GSM), long-term evolution (LTE), worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), and\/or other air interface protocol radio transceiver cards, and other well-known network devices.

Such information, which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor , may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.","Such information, which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor  for example, may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embodied in the carrier wave generated by the network connectivity devices  may propagate in or on the surface of electrical conductors, in coaxial cables, in waveguides, in an optical conduit, for example an optical fiber, or in the air or free space. The information contained in the baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be ordered according to different sequences, as may be desirable for either processing or generating the information or transmitting or receiving the information.
