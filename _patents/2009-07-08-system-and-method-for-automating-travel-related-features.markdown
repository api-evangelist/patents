{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Modern-electronic mail systems employ an out of office auto-reply feature for answering email or other messaging when a user is not available to answer a message, such as when a user is on vacation or on a business trip. Typically, when a user knows he is going to be unavailable, the user activates the out of office auto-reply feature, which causes it to generate a preconfigured message to other parties who write to the user during the period of unavailability. However, users often forget to activate the out of office auto-reply feature when they go on vacation and deactivate it when they return.","Embodiments of the disclosed invention include an apparatus, method, and computer program product for automating travel related features based on location information of a mobile device associated with a user. For example, in one embodiment, a computer executed method is disclosed for configuring an out of office auto-reply email message. The method comprises receiving an out of area message from a mobile device associated with a user; identifying a user associated with the mobile device; accessing an email account associated with the user; and configuring an out of office auto-reply email message based on configurations prespecified by the user.","In accordance with another embodiment, the method may include accessing an electronic calendar associated with the user to determine whether the user is scheduled to travel to a second office (i.e., the user works for a company that has multiple offices that are located in different locations). In one embodiment, the method reserves a work area for the user within the second office in response to a determination that the user is scheduled to travel to the second office.","The above embodiments and other embodiments are further described in the detailed description section of the present application.","The disclosed embodiments and advantages thereof are best understood by referring to  of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.
