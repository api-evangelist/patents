{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present disclosure relates to printing systems, and in particular, to a system and method of utilizing tab attributes as job ticket attributes for printing.","2. Description of Related Art","Page description language files (referred to herein as \u201cPDL files\u201d) are computer languages and\/or file formats that can be translated into printed documents. Many printing systems can accept a PDL file directly without pre-processing by another device such as a computer. PDL files are generally designed to describe how characters, graphics, and\/or images should be printed on a substrate by a printing system. PDL files generally store printing data in a more abstract manner than pixel-wise image files. For example: rather than describing a square pixel-by-pixel, a PDL file may describe the square in terms of position, size, color and the like. PDL files sometimes have advantages over bitmap files, such as generally reduced file sizes and increased platform independence. Additionally, some printing systems receive PDL files directly with minimal or no pre-processing necessary before the file is received by the printing system.","When setting up one or more PDL files for printing, specialized printing tools can assist a user in controlling the settings, printing flow, and\/or other parameters for setting up a printing job for a printing system. For example: it is common to apply exception level programming to a PDL file before printing commences. Generally, \u201cexceptions\u201d in this context are items not included in the original page content of the PDL file or contain different item level programming from the body of the job. These are considered to be \u201cexceptions\u201d to the job-level programming that defines the body of the job. Exceptions may be applied to one or more pages and generally do not modify the PDL file itself, but rather provide an effective way to make last minute changes and\/or specialized settings. Tools that apply exception level programming are called exception page programming tools.","Typically, exceptions are applied to paper stocks (covers, stock exceptions, page inserts), page sequencing (chapter starts), image quality and image shifting. Other exceptions may include subset finishing, imposition and page level annotation. For example, a PDL file may include image quality information, such as contrast settings, color settings and other settings associated with certain aspects of the PDL file; an exception may be applied to a particular page or a subset of pages that override these PDL properties.","Exception level programming may apply to the current stock (sometimes referred to as the paper stock). The stock is the type of medium or material that is to be printed on during processing by a printing system. Many modern printing systems have multiple sources of stock, separated by color, quality, weight, medium, material, finishing and\/or coating material. For example, a PDL file may have 30 pages of text and one photographic quality page, and an exception may be associated with that photographic quality page to operatively instruct the printing system to utilize a medium more suitable for printing a photographic level of detail and\/or to achieve another desired quality associated with printing photographic quality pages.","In addition, some exception level programming may include \u201csubset finishing\u201d features, where a subset of pages, sheets, or other aspects are modified. For example, a subset of pages may have certain attributes that are modified in the printing process, such as the use of high quality paper for a certain chapter of a PDL file. Also, an exception (or subset finishing) may be applied for stapling a range of pages within a print job. These changes are also considered exception level programming. Tools that engage in exception level programming are referred to as exception level programming tools.","Tabbed sheets are sometimes used to section various types of print media. For example, tabbed sheets may be used to indicate the beginning of chapters. These tabbed sheets have a raised area in which markings may be made by a printing system (e.g. \u201cchapter 1\u201d) to allow a reader to quickly turn to various sections of the printed media.","The present disclosure relates to printing systems, and in particular, to a system and method of utilizing tab attributes as job ticket attributes for printing.","In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a system for utilizing a tab attribute as a job ticket attribute is at least partially implemented by an operative set of processor executable instructions configured for execution by at least one processor. The system includes a communications component, a user interface component, a ticket generation component and a job submission component. The communications component can communicate one or more print documents (e.g. page description language files such as PDF files) with another component. The user interface communicates user data including tab data. The ticket generation component is in operative communication with the communications component and receives the one or more print documents therefrom. The ticket generation component is further in operative communications with the user interface component and receives user data from the user interface.","The ticket generation component generates a ticket. The ticket is associated with the one or more print documents. The ticket can include one or more tab attributes. The ticket generation component generates the one or more tab attribute as a function of the received tab data. The job submission component is adapted to operatively submit a job to a printing system. The job includes the ticket and the one or more print documents. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the system is an exception page programming tool configured to program a xerographic machine and\/or an electrostatographic machine. Additionally or alternatively, the one or more of the tab attributes may be a page exception.","In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the one or more tab attributes may include (or be one of) one or more of: a tab text, a tab font, a tab position, a tab position within a document, and\/or another tab position between the document and another document of the one or more documents. One or more of the tab attributes may include (or be one of) a tag-based attribute. The tag-based attribute may be a start tag, an end tag, and a tag content value. Additionally or alternatively, the one or more tab attributes may include one or more printing system-independent tab attributes.","In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a system for providing tab attributes as a job ticket attribute includes a job queue and a printer interface. The system is at least partially implemented by an operative set of processor executable instructions configured for execution by at least one processor. The system, the job queue and\/or the printer interface component may be an installable module installable in a printing system. The job queue is adapted to queue one or more jobs. A job of the one or more jobs includes a ticket and one or more print documents (e.g., a page description language file such as a pdf file). The ticket is associated with the one or more print documents. The ticket can include one or more tab attributes. A tab attribute of the one or more tab attributes may be printing system independent defining a printing system-independent tab attribute. Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the tab attributes may be a page exception. For example, the tab attributes may include one or more of: a tab text, a tab font, a tab position, a tab position within a document and a tab position between documents.","The printer interface component operatively communicates with the job queue. The printer interface component can communicate the printer instructions to a printer. The printer interface component generates printer instructions as a function of the job. The printer instructions includes a first printer instruction to print the one or more print document and a second printer instruction to insert at least one tabbed sheet along with the at least one print document. The second printer instruction includes another printer instruction to insert a tabbed sheet before a print document, after a print document and\/or between pages of a print document.","In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for utilizing a tab attribute as a job ticket attribute includes: communicating a job including a ticket and at least one print document. The ticket is associated with the at least one print document and includes at least one tab attribute. The method further includes: determining a position to place a tabbed sheet among the at least one print document based upon the at least one tab attribute; printing the at least one print document of the job; and\/or placing the tabbed sheet among the at least one print document in the determined position. The method may also include: determining tab text based upon the at least one tab attribute and\/or printing the tab text on a tab of the tabbed sheet.","Referring to the drawings,  is a perspective view showing some elements of a digital copier . The digital copier accepts original images on input sheets fed through a document handler generally indicated as . Input sheets fed in succession through document handler  pass over an input scanner , which records light from a series of small areas on each input sheet, yielding digital image data, in a manner generally familiar in the art. Because the input sheets move in an input process direction IP relative to the input scanner , there can be said to be a \u201clead edge\u201d associated with each input sheet, meaning the first edge \u201cseen\u201d by the input scanner . In this embodiment, a lead edge of an input sheet can be deemed a \u201cfirst line\u201d of a raster for reckoning image data recorded by the image scanner .","In a digital copier, there is also a print engine, here generally indicated as . In this embodiment, which is a xerographic printing system, the print engine  includes a rotatable image receptor, such as electrostatographic photoreceptor , on which images are created and subsequently transferred, in a manner generally familiar in the art (typical elements associated with xerography, such as development, exposure, transfer and cleaning stations, are not shown).","Output sheets, on which images are placed by the print engine , are initially placed in one of a set of paper supply stacks, from which they are drawn one at a time. One such paper supply stack is indicated as , although there are typically other stacks available for feeding into the print engine , each with a paper supply of a predetermined type. Paper supply stack  here includes \u201ctab stock,\u201d meaning, in this embodiment, sheets which have general dimensions similar to regular stock (such as letter, tabloid, A3, A4, etc.) but in addition have a tab T defined along one edge thereof. The tab T effectively increases the dimension of the tab stock, relative to a corresponding dimension in the regular stock: to take one example, for use in a book made from 8\u00bd\u00d711 inch sheets, a suitable piece of tab stock will have a width of about nine inches, of which 8\u00bd inches corresponds to the regular width of the sheets, plus an extra half inch associated with the tab.","As shown in , the stack  of tab stock is placed in a drawer or tray  in such a way that, when a sheet of tab stock is drawn from stack  and passed through print engine  along an output process direction OP, the tab on the sheet is disposed at the trail edge of the sheet. After the sheet passes out of the print engine , the sheet can be inverted in an inverter , which causes the tab stock to be flipped over so that the tab is at a lead edge as the sheet moves to output tray  (or into a finishing device, such as a stapler, stacker or booklet maker, not shown). The inverter , in the illustrated embodiment, also causes the image placed on the tab stock by photoreceptor , which is face-down when transferred to the sheet, to be face-up.","Referring to the drawings,  shows a block diagram of a system  having a ticket generation component  for generating a ticket . System  can generate a ticket  for inclusion within a job  for printing by a printer . Ticket  may also be referred to as a \u201cjob ticket\u201d, which may be described as the instructions that is submitted as part of job  (discussed below) for printing by printer . Ticket  includes tab attributes  which may include one or more attributes associated with tabbed sheets, tabs, printing tabs and the like (discussed in more detail below).","One type of prior art tab-printing required: (1) including an oversized page in the PDF or Postscript file (two types of PDL files) to be printed (2) such that the oversized page would have an oversized printing area, (3) and placing the tab text which corresponds to the printing region of the page such that the tab text aligns with the tab in the PDF or Postscript files when printed on a tabbed sheet. The tabbed sheets are sometimes part of a \u201cspecial\u201d paper stock and\/or are separate from other paper stock. System  includes tab attributes  as part of ticket , rather than as part of one or more of PDL files  as described above relating to the prior art tab-printing, e.g., tab attributes  may be page exceptions  (discussed in more detail below).","System  includes the ticket generation component , a communications component , a user interface component  and a job submission component . The ticket generation component  generates the ticket  that includes the tab attributes . System  may be implemented in hardware, software, software in execution, firmware, in virtualization, bytecode and the like. System  may be an exception page programming tool configured to program a printer . Printer  may be a xerographic machine and\/or an electrostatographic machine. Additionally or alternatively, system  may be part of (or may include) a print driver of a personal computer.","PDL files through are shown in  (the n designation indicates an arbitrary number of PDL files). PDL files  are communicated via communications component  to ticket generation component . Ticket generation component is in operative communications with communications component  and can receive the PDL files  therefrom. Communications component  may be implemented in memory such that communications component  temporarily stores all or part of one of PDL files  therein. For example, communications component  may retrieve PDL files  from a hard disk and temporarily store them in memory, such as a cache, a heap, a stack and the like. Additionally or alternatively, communications component  may simply point to the PDL files; for example, a RAM-based pointer may point to a memory address on a hard drive of a personal computer.","As previously mentioned, communications component  communicates the PDL files  to ticket generation component . The communications between communications component  and ticket generation component  may be over a network, intra- or inter-process communications, intra- or inter thread communications, application programming interfaces and\/or the like. Additionally or alternatively, any of components , ,  and\/or  may communicate using a network, intra- or inter-process communications, intra- or inter thread communications, application programming interfaces and\/or the like.","System  also includes user interface component . User interface component  communicates user data  including tab data . User interface component  is in operative communications with ticket generation component  and can communicate the user data  thereto. User interface component  may be a pop-up dialog box within a graphical user interface (referred to herein as \u201cGUI\u201d) based interface. User data  may include data relating to an event within the pop-up dialog. For example, a mouse click and\/or a text box entry may be included within user data . User data  may also include a desire to print one or more of PDL files , e.g., user interface component  may be part of a print driver and\/or a pop-up dialog box that appears after a user selects \u201cprint\u201d from a menu bar. Tab data  may include data relating to tabbed sheets, tabs, printing tabs and the like. Tab data  may include data relating to: (1) desired insertions of one or more tabbed sheets within one of PDL files  when printed, (2) desired placement of one or more of tabbed sheets between two of PDL files  when printed, (3) what type of tabbed sheets are desired, (4) what tab text is desired, (5) and the like.","As mentioned above, ticket generation component  generates ticket  including tab attributes . The ticket  may also be referred to as a job ticket. Ticket  is associated with PDL files . Tab attributes  include page exceptions , a tab text , a tab font , a tab position , a tab position within a document , a tab position between documents , tag-based attributes  and a printing system-independent tab attribute . Each of the tab attributes  may be interrelated and\/or may include each other. For example, tag-based attributes  may be implemented within page exceptions  or vice versa.","Tab Text  may be the text a user desires to print onto a tabbed sheet. Tab font  is the font desired to be printed when printing tab text . Tab position  may be a desired position to place a tabbed sheet within one of PDL files , between two of PDL files  or may be dimensional aspects of the tabbed sheet, e.g., where the raised tab should be located and the like. Tab position within a document  indicates which position to insert a tabbed sheet within one of PDL files . Tab position between documents  indicates a position to insert a tabbed sheet between two of PDL files .","Tag-based attributes  includes attributes that are based on tags, and include start tag , tag content value , and end tag . For example, a tag-based attributes  such as \u201c<INSERT_AFTER_PDL_PAGE>4<\/INSERT_AFTER_PDL_PAGE><TEXT>Chapter 2<\/TEXT><FONT>SansSerif<\/FONT>\u201d. The string of \u201c<INSERT_PDL_PAGE>4<\/INSERT_AFTER_PDL_PAGE>\u201d indicates to insert a tabbed sheet after page 4 of one of PDL files . The string of \u201c<TEXT>Chapter 2<TEXT>\u201d indicates that the text \u201cChapter 2\u201d should be printed in the tab area. The string of \u201c<FONT>SansSerif <\/FONT>\u201d indicates that the font of SansSerif is to be used to print in the tab area.","Also consider that the tag-based attributes  may be start tag , tag content value , and end tag . Consider the string \u201c<TEXT>Chapter 2<\/TEXT>\u201d. The start tag  may indicate the beginning of tab data, e.g., \u201c<TEXT>\u201d. The tag content value  indicates the tab value, e.g., \u201cChapter 2\u201d. The end tag  indicates the end of the tag data content, e.g., \u201c<\/TEXT>\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","206","204","210","300","302","304","300","206","200","300","206","302","302","306","310","302","304","208","304","208","212","210","204"]},"Printer  can process job  to print printed job . Printed job  includes printed PDL pages  and . Also, within printed job  there may be inserted tabbed sheet  having tab text . Inserted tabbed sheet  corresponds to tab attributes  of job .
