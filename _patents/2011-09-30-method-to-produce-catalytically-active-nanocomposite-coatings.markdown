title: Method to produce catalytically active nanocomposite coatings
abstract: A nanocomposite coating and method of making and using the coating. The nanocomposite coating is disposed on a base material, such as a metal or ceramic; and the nanocomposite consists essentially of a matrix of an alloy selected from the group of Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt and Re which are catalytically active for cracking of carbon bonds in oils and greases and a grain structure selected from the group of borides, carbides and nitrides.

More particularly the invention relates to catalytically active nanocomposite coatings and methods of manufacture to provide low friction surface layers for a variety of lubricant uses, such as for engines.","Current engine oils and greases typically include additives to enhance lubrication properties. Such additives include, for example, the well known additive ZDDP and MoTDC. However, these additives are very harmful to effective operation of catalytic converters and other after treatment devices for engines using such additive containing lubricants. The result is incomplete and ineffective operation of such devices which causes environmental pollution. Consequently, there is a substantial need to eliminate use of such additives in lubricants while still providing excellent engine operation and wear resistance while avoiding environmental pollution.","Compositions of coatings and methods of manufacture are directed to nanocomposite coatings with high catalytic reactivity to provide excellent lubrication properties between materials sliding relative to one another. These coatings cause catalytic activity which cracks long chain hydrocarbon molecules in base lubricating oils and greases to form a slick and highly protective (high wear and scuff resistance) carbon based film for sliding surfaces. Analyses show the film is carbon based and are structurally similar to ultra-low friction carbon films such as are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,173 which is incorporated by reference herein. The subject nanocomposite coatings are catalytically active metal alloys, including alloys of metals such as, for example, Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt and Re as the matrix and grains of transition metal and refractory metal nitrides, carbo-nitrides, carbides or borides. Various examples of preformed alloy compositions are described hereinafter. Such nanocomposite coatings provide excellent scuffing and wear resistance without need for the use of deleterious additives.","These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention, together with the organization and manner of operation thereof, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The invention is directed to methods of preparation of catalytically active nanocomposite coatings. Rather than add lubricant additives, which have substantial deleterious effects, the method of the invention concerns depositing of catalytically active metal based films on engine or machine parts which are in contact and moving while in contact. Various catalytically active coatings are therefore deposited by any one of various conventional deposition methodologies, such as, PVD, CVD and ALD. Such selected hard\/soft-phase nanocomposite coatings enable substantial improvement of scuff and wear resistance for engine or machinery with sliding contact.","In  is shown the scuffing performance of a steel on steel test pair in a conventional pure synthetic oil (PAO). As can be seen from the data, the steel\/steel pair undergoes substantial, rapid scuffing at a load of 400 Newtons \u201c(N)\u201d. In , it can be seen that the addition of a conventional additive, 0.5% ZDDP-containing PAO oil, causes the scuffing behavior to improve dramatically. In  is shown data for fully formulated engine oil, such as Mobil 1; and the scuffing load is increased to about 1400 N. Such an oil is fully formulated with several oil additives, including ZDDP and MoTDC. This can be compared to the performance in  showing a substantial improvement thereover.","In order to overcome the disadvantages of such additives, the engine or machine components can be coated at selected friction points, to provide a film which is a nanocomposite of catalytically active ingredients, generally including one or more of Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt and Re as a matrix and grains of a transition or refractory metal nitride, carbide, carbo-nitrides and borides. As shown in , a nanocomposite coating of formulation MoN\u2014Cu (with 2 wt. % Cu) results in greatly improved scuffing performance even compared to Mobile , generally acknowledged as the best engine oil available. As shown in , the coating has a preferred microstructure with nano-sized grains, such as, for example, a molybdenum nitride phase with grain boundaries of the catalytically active metal phase, such as, Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt, and Re, and alloy combinations thereof. The weight percentages of the most preferred nanocomposite includes about 1-10% by weight for the matrix and 90-99% by weight the nano-sized grains. Tests performed on various nanocomposites also determined that the alloy composition must be adjusted to compositions which achieve a threshold catalytic activity which enables cracking of the carbon chain in the oil used to create the diamond-like carbon material at the wear interface.","In order to evaluate the nature of the coating, tests were performed on a metal test component as shown in . Tests were performed on rubbing surfaces on a block side of a steel test pair which provided the performance data of . The surfaces of the sliding test pair exhibited a shiny film. Likewise, such a shiny film was formed in the test system of a sliding surface of a ball and disk shown in  in which pure PAO-10 oil was the lubricant used. The shiny film was examined using Raman spectroscopy, and the Raman features of  are quite similar to that of a diamond-like carbon film.","In , B60316 is an internal experiment number for reference purposes only. Low SHC is the coating tested. It is made out of Mo\u2014N\u2014Cu produced by the PVD method. The numbers ,  and  in the figures are for Raman spectrum taken from the black area after a block on ring tribology test, showing that the test produces Diamond Like Carbon species on the tested surfaces.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["1","1","4","6","7","5"],"sub":"4 "},"Diamond and graphite (graphite reference is for a disordered graphite in ) are used as a Raman reference in the graphs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10C","FIG. 10A"]},"This is an example of preparation of a nanocomposite coating of Mo\u2014N\u2014Cu done by Magnetron sputtering.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0028"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Remaining Time (seconds)","Main","Sub","Parameters"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Heating",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["25200","Heating_Startpress.[mPa]6",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Roughpump1",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Tablespeed[%]15",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Turbo1speed[%]100",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Heater[W]8000",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Press.lim.1[mPa]6",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Press.lim.2[mPa]6",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Testinterval[s]5400",{}]},{"entry":["20400","Heater[W]Heater[W]2500",{},{}]},{"entry":["20400","Turbo1speed[%]Turbo1speed[%]66",{},{}]},{"entry":["Etching",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["19800","Etching_Argon[mln]200",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Turbo1speed[%]66",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Tablespeed[%]30",{}]},{"entry":["19790",{},"MF-tableControlmode7",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Setpoint550"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Frequency[kHz]240"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Rev.time[ns]1600"]},{"entry":["Coating",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["16200","Coating_Argon[mln]150",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"N2[mln]0",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Heater[W]0",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Tablespeed[%]30",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Turbo1speed[%]66",{},{}]},{"entry":["16190","DC-tableControlmode7 (Voltage)",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Setpoint 200 V",{}]},{"entry":["16190","DCcathode2[W]DCcathode2[W]2500",{},{}]},{"entry":["16180","Rampcath.2Startvalue[W]2500",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Endvalue[W]8000",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Stepwidth[W]250",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Int.val.time[sec]20",{}]},{"entry":["15680","DCcathode1[W]DCcathode1[W]500",{},{}]},{"entry":["15670","Rampcath.1Startvalue[W]500",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Endvalue[W]4000",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Stepwidth[W]100",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Int.val.time[sec]15",{}]},{"entry":["15070","DC-tableControlmode7 (Voltage)",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Setpoint 100 V",{}]},{"entry":["15070","N2Startvalue[mln]150",{},{}]},{"entry":["15060","Nitrogen control","Set press[mPa] 600",{}]},{"entry":["Cooling",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["\u20021800","Cooling_Vent.temp[\u00b0 C.]145"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The foregoing description of embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
