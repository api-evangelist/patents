title: Power efficient object detection with selective polling
abstract: Detecting the absence of tagged objects near a computing device and attempting to locate the absent, tagged objects using other computing devices in a power-efficient manner. The computing device is monitored for triggering conditions. Upon occurrence of at least one of the triggering conditions, the computing device polls for the tagged objects expected to be proximate to the computing device. By polling responsive to occurrence of the triggering conditions, power consumption by the computing device is reduced. The triggering conditions include, for example, time-based transitions, movement of the computing device, or a geographic location of the computing device. Upon detecting the absence of at least one of the objects, the computing device, or a web service, identifies other computing devices to which the absent object may be proximate. The other computing devices determine whether the absent object is proximate, and notify the computing device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Existing technologies enable wireless detection of objects near a reader device. For example, the effective range of BLUETOOTH brand devices is about 10 meters, while some radio frequency identification (RFID) readers can detect RFID tags on objects as far as 100 meters away. Various polling schemes have been proposed for the BLUETOOTH brand devices to maintain contact, but the schemes require frequent polling of devices and thus carry a significant power cost. Similarly, some RFID readers frequently poll for the RFID tags to determine whether any of the expected RFID tags are not detected. In such systems, the RFID readers are typically mounted in a fixed array, and each of the RFID readers has a dedicated and continuous power source to satisfy the significant power requirements of the frequent polling.","Embodiments of the disclosure enable the monitoring of tagged items based on triggering conditions. One or more of the triggering conditions are defined for association with a first computing device. Responsive to an occurrence of at least one of the triggering conditions, the first computing device detects one or more items proximate to the first computing device. The detected items are compared to a list of items intended to be proximate to the first computing device to identify at least one absent item. The absent item is identified to a second computing device that attempts to detect the absent item proximate to the second computing device. The second computing device notifies the first computing device whether the absent item has been detected.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring to the figures, embodiments of the disclosure enable, at least, the power-efficient detection and location of missing items or objects. In a system according to some embodiments, objects  are selectively polled for presence based on triggering conditions  or events to reduce the power consumption of the system. Accordingly, aspects of the disclosure are operable with any computing device, including devices with limited power resources.","Referring again to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates a computing device  having objects  within a defined proximity . The elements illustrated in  operate to enable the detection and location of missing objects. The computing device  includes any device that is capable of detecting nearby objects  such as object # through object #M. In the example of , the objects  are associated with the computing device , referred to as \u201cgeotethering.\u201d In some embodiments, the computing device  represents a plurality of computing devices programmed to implement the functionality described herein. The computing device  is enabled with technology such as BLUETOOTH brand wireless communication services, radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), ZIGBEE brand wireless communication services, and other technologies that enable short-range wireless communication. For example, aspects of the disclosure contemplate thermal or ultrasound communication techniques where each of the \u201ctagged\u201d objects  has a unique signature (e.g., a thermal signature or an acoustic signature). Exemplary computing devices  include a mobile computing device  such as a mobile telephone, a laptop, a desktop computer, a gaming device, or a portable media player.","The size or extent of the proximity  is defined by the corresponding wireless communication technology. For example, BLUETOOTH brand wireless communication services typically have an effective range of 10 meters, while RFID may have a read range of up to 100 meters. While the defined proximity  in  is illustrated as a generally uniform oval, the shape of the actual proximity may vary at least based on the wireless communication technology and the environment in which the computing device  is located.","The computing device  communicates with a location service  via, for example, a network such as network  in . In the example of , the location service  is illustrated as physically separate from the computing device . In other embodiments, the location service , or a portion thereof, may execute on the computing device . For example, a client portion of the location service  executes on the computing device  while a server portion or web service portion of the location service  executes on another computing device remote from the computing device .","The location service  maintains the locations of the computing device  and other computing devices . The other computing devices  include one or more computing devices, each possibly having objects within a defined proximity. The location service  may maintain the locations in one or more of the following ways: by polling each of the computing devices, by receiving location updates from each of the computing devices, or by assigning locations to each of the computing devices expected to stay within a particular area.","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates a first computing device  storing triggering conditions  for monitoring the proximity of objects  to the first computing device . In the example of , the first computing device  communicates with the location service  via network  such as the Internet. The network  may be wired or wireless. The location service  communicates with at least one second computing device  to locate missing objects.","The first computing device  includes any device capable of wireless item detection such as computing device . The first computing device  includes at least a memory area  and a processor . The memory area , or other computer-readable media, stores identification of one or more triggering conditions  such as triggering condition # through triggering condition #N. Each of the triggering conditions  is associated with the first computing device  (e.g., mobile computing device ), a group of computing devices, a user such as user , a group of users, or the like. The triggering conditions  may be defined by the user , by the location service , by the manufacturer of the first computing device , or by other entities. In some embodiments, the triggering conditions  are associated with one or more hardware resources  of the first computing device . Exemplary hardware resources  include one or more of the following: an accelerometer, a battery, a camera, a thermometer, a barometer, a moisture sensor, a photosensor, and a microphone.","Exemplary triggering conditions  include one or more of the following: time-based transitions, movement of the first computing device  (e.g., after a period of inactivity, or orientation of the first computing device ), connection to a wireless access point, disconnection from a wireless access point, manual activation from the user  of the first computing device , a location of the first computing device  (e.g., a geographic location or an elevation), and a power level of a battery. Exemplary time-based transitions include transitions such as driving to or from work, driving to a particular meeting, or leaving a particular geographic area. The transitions may be stored as appointments or tasks by a calendar service such as online calendar service  in . Exemplary triggering conditions  that rely on connection or disconnection from a wireless access point include changing connections between cellular network towers. Other exemplary triggering conditions  rely on a change in any observed Global System for Mobile (GSM) communications data or code division multiple access (CDMA) data such as location area code (LAC), mobile network code (MNC), mobile country code (MMC), or cell ID.","Exemplary movement of the first computing device  includes movement after a period of inactivity (e.g., mobile computing device  is picked up by the user , or a key is pressed after 10 idle minutes), sudden and rapid movement such as the acceleration of an automobile, or a cessation of movement. Movement, or lack of movement, is detected by, for example, one or more accelerometers in the first computing device . Exemplary triggering conditions  that rely on location are defined by, for example, a geographic location as determined by a global positioning system (GPS), a user-defined point of interest (e.g., work, home, school, library), an elevation or change in elevation, or the like.","The memory area  further stores a list  of tagged objects  that the first computing device  expects to be proximate to the first computing device . In operation, the first computing device  attempts to detect the tagged objects  using a detection interface  or other form of sensing platform. The detection interface  includes, for example, an RFID reader, a BLUETOOTH brand wireless communication interface, or any other device, component, module, or the like for detecting proximate objects . Aspects of the disclosure are operable with any item having a tag that is capable of interrogation and identification by a reader or other detection interface .","The list  of tagged objects  includes objects  identified by the user  or other users, identified by the location service , and\/or discovered by the first computing device . For example, the user  may interact with the first computing device  to identify the tagged objects  to be included in the list  of tagged objects . Alternatively or in addition, the first computing device  may detect the proximity of one or more tagged objects , and prompt the user  to include or exclude the detected objects  in the list  of tagged objects . In some embodiments (not shown), the list  of tagged objects  is stored by an entity remote from the first computing device  such as the location service . The first computing device  may download the list  of tagged objects  from the remote entity. The memory area  may also store an identifier associated with each of the objects  in the list  of objects , and may further store an association between the user  and the list  of objects . The identifier may be defined by aspects of the disclosure, or may be obtained from the item. For example, an RFID tag on one of the objects  may already have a previously assigned identifier.","The memory area , or one or more computer-readable media, further stores computer-executable components for implementing aspects of the disclosure. Exemplary components include a tag component , an event component , a sensor component , and a locator component . These components operate to intelligently monitor tagged objects  based on triggering conditions  and are described below with reference to .","In general, the memory area  is associated with the first computing device . For example, in , the memory area  is within the first computing device . However, the memory area  includes any memory area internal to, external to, or accessible by the first computing device . Further, the memory area  or any of the data stored thereon may be associated with any server or other computer, local or remote from the first computing device  (e.g., accessible via a network).","The processor  includes any quantity of processing units, and is programmed to execute computer-executable instructions for implementing aspects of the disclosure. The instructions may be performed by the processor  or by multiple processors executing within the first computing device , or performed by a processor external to the first computing device  (e.g., by a cloud service). In some embodiments, the processor  is programmed to execute instructions such as those illustrated in the figures (e.g., ).","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates the detection and location of an absent item. One or more of the triggering conditions  associated with the computing device  are defined at . Upon detection of the occurrence of at least one of the triggering conditions  at , one or more proximate or nearby objects  are detected at . In some embodiments, the triggering conditions  may also be used to prevent detection of the objects . For example, if one of the triggering conditions  specifies that detection should not occur (or occur once more only) if the battery level drops below a particular threshold, the computing device  disables detection.","The detected objects  are compared to the list  of objects  intended or expected to be proximate to the computing device . As a result of the comparison, one or more absent objects  are identified at . The absent objects  are identified to another computing device  (e.g., the second computing device ) at . Responsive to receiving identification of the absent objects , the second computing device  attempts to detect the absent objects  proximate to the second computing device . The computing device  receives a notification at  from the second computing device  of whether any of the absent objects  are proximate to the second computing device . Alternatively, the computing device  receives a notification only if the second computing device  detects at least one of the absent objects . In some embodiments, the computing device  displays the received notification to the user .","In some embodiments, the computing device  identifies other computing devices  that may be near one of the absent objects  by determining possible and probable locations for the absent item. For example, the computing device  may determine the last known location of the absent item (e.g., the location during the last successful polling of the absent item), the current location of the computing device , and a route or path traveled by the computing device  between the last known location and the current location. The computing device  then identifies the computing devices that are near the last known location, the current location, and\/or along the route in-between, and notifies those computing devices of the absent item. In other embodiments, the computing device  (or location service ) maintains a history of locations where the absent item was found after previously being lost.","Users of the other computing devices  may opt in to participate in locating absent or missing objects from other users. In such an embodiment, the users register their participating computing devices with the location service . When the location service  (or computing device ) attempts to identify the other computing devices  that may be able to locate the absent objects , the location service  selects from the participating computing devices.","In some embodiments, the other computing device  includes a computing device executing the location service . In such embodiments, the location service  acts as an intermediary for the computing device  to identify and communicate with one or more of the second computing devices . The location service  may also identify, to the computing device , the second computing device  that has located the missing item. For example, the location service  may initiate a chat or instant message session between the computing device  and the second computing device .","In some embodiments, the operations illustrated in  are performed by the computing device . In other embodiments, at least one of the operations is performed by the location service  or another entity or device. In such embodiments, the computing device  may operate as a thin client that monitors itself for the triggering conditions  but otherwise receives data output from performance of the other operations in  by another device. For example, the computing device  may be a mobile computing device such as mobile computing device  with limited resources that interacts with the location service . In this example, the mobile computing device  detects proximate objects  and identifies the detected objects  to the location service  that stores the list  of objects  expected to be proximate to the mobile computing device . The location service  compares the detected objects  to the list  of objects  to identify at least one absent item. The location service  determines other computing devices  that may have the absent item nearby, and then identifies the absent item to the determined computing devices. If the determined computing devices detect the absent item, the determined computing device that detected the item, or the location service , notifies the mobile computing device .","In some embodiments, one or more computer-executable components, such as the components illustrated in , execute on the computing device  to perform the operations illustrated in . The tag component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to associate an identifier with one of the objects  intended to be within the defined proximity  of the computing device . The event component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to selectively monitor the object  based on the occurrence of one or more of the triggering conditions . In some embodiments, the event component  defines the triggering conditions  based in part on the location of the computing device . For example, the triggering conditions  may vary based on whether the computing device  is at a workplace of the user  (e.g., poll for the objects  every time the mobile computing device  senses movement) or at a residence of the user  (e.g., poll for the objects  only when the mobile computing device  leaves the house). In some embodiments, the event component  defines the triggering conditions  based in part on the quantity of objects  to be monitored. For example, if a small quantity of objects  are to be monitored, the event component  may define the triggering conditions  such that occurrence of the conditions is more frequent. Conversely, if a large quantity of objects  are to be monitored, the event component  may define the triggering conditions  such that occurrence of the conditions is less frequent. In this example, the event component  selectively monitors the objects  based in part on a remaining power level of the computing device .","The sensor component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to detect the absence of the monitored object  within the defined proximity . For example, the sensor component  monitors the object  via a radio frequency signal communicated between the computing device  and the object . The locator component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to identify the absence of the monitored object  to the location service . The location service  identifies a plurality of devices within, for example, a geographic area of the computing device . If at least one of the plurality of devices detects the monitored object , the location service  or the device notifies the locator component .","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates the creation of tag associations with objects  and the creation of time-based triggering conditions . In the example of , the user  interacts with a web site  that identifies and authenticates the user . After authentication, the user  interacts with a tag provisioning service . The user  identifies objects  for tagging, and the tag provisioning service  defines an identifier for association therewith. For example, the user  identifies a wallet, keys, laptop, purse, and\/or a portable music player. The tag provisioning service  creates identifiers for each of the objects , or obtains the identifiers by querying the objects  (e.g., some objects  may also have an identifier such as some RFID tags). The tag provisioning service  stores the identifiers and associations in a database  or other memory storage area. The user  may also interact with a detection configuration service  to define the triggering conditions . In the example of , the detection configuration service  interacts with the online calendar service  to store or obtain time-based triggering conditions . In some embodiments (not shown), the online calendar service  stores the time-based triggering conditions  in the database .","The database  may also store a state associated with each of the tagged objects . For example, the state may be \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cabsent\u201d depending on the results of the latest poll by the computing device .","Both the tag provisioning service  and the detection configuration service  execute in a services cloud (e.g., datacenter) in . In other embodiments (not shown), one or both of these services execute elsewhere. For example, either or both service may execute on the computing device  of the user . Alternatively or in addition, the services may provide application programming interfaces (APIs) enabling other application programs to provide the functionality of the services to the user . These application programs may execute on the computing device  of the user , or on other computing devices (e.g., kiosks, web servers, etc.).","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates initialization of an application program for monitoring objects  within a defined proximity of the mobile computing device . The application program executes on the mobile computing device  to access, from the tag provisioning service , the list  of tagged objects  expected to be proximate to the mobile computing device . The application program further executes to access the triggering conditions  from the detection configuration service .","While the mobile computing device  is illustrated in  as a mobile telephone, the mobile computing device  may be any mobile computing device as contemplated in the art.","In the example of  and , the tag provisioning service  and the detection configuration service  are shown as separate entities. In other embodiments, however, the functionality of the tag provisioning service  and the detection configuration service  is provided by a single entity (e.g., a single application programs or combined set of APIs).","Further Examples","Various implementations of the disclosure are contemplated. For example, embodiments of the disclosure include the user  defining the triggering conditions  to cover the following conditions: poll for the objects  when the user  leaves a residence, when the user  leaves a workplace, and when the user  enters an airport. In such examples, embodiments of the disclosure operate to remind the user  in a timely manner of any missing objects .","Embodiments of the disclosure operate to provide battery-efficient \u201cgeofencing\u201d relative to the computing device . When any of the objects  move beyond a perimeter relative to the computing device  and at least one of the triggering conditions  is triggered, the missing objects are detected and the user  is alerted.","In some embodiments, the power savings achieved by the selective polling depend upon a frequency of occurrence of the triggering conditions . The relationship between polling events and power savings may be linear, exponential, or otherwise related. In a prophetic example, by reducing the polling frequency by 25%, the corresponding power savings may be 25%. In another prophetic example, depending on the computing device  and hardware or software configuration therein, the power savings may be greater than 25% when the polling frequency is reduced by 25%.","Exemplary Operating Environment","By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media store information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. Combinations of any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.","Although described in connection with an exemplary computing system environment, embodiments of the invention are operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.
