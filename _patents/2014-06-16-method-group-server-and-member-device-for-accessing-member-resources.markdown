title: Method, group server, and member device for accessing member resources
abstract: The present invention provides a method, a group server, and a member device for accessing member resources. By using an established mapping relationship between a multicast address and a fanout URI in a group resource, a member resource access request may be sent by multicast to member devices having member resources in the group resource, and the fanout URI is included in the member resource access request, so that the member devices having the member resources execute, according to access paths of the member resources on the member devices as indicated by the fanout URI, an operation indicated by the member resource access request. Therefore, the group server does not need to unicast the access request to each member device, and network overheads are saved.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT\/CN2012\/078531, filed on Jul. 12, 2012, which claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 201210004135.6, filed on Jan. 6, 2012, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The present invention relates to the field of a machine-to-machine communications (Machine-to-Machine Communications, M2M) technology, and in particular, to a method, a group server, and a member device for accessing member resources.","Machine-to-machine communications (Machine-to-Machine Communications, M2M) is a network-based application and service focusing on intelligent machine-to-machine interaction. The M2M technology, by embedding a wireless or wired communication module and application processing logic within a machine, implements data communication without manual intervention, so as to meet informatization requirements of users on monitoring, commanding and scheduling, data collection and measurement, and the like. In an M2M system architecture, various M2M terminals (such as a sensor and a microcontroller) access an M2M service platform directly or remotely through an M2M gateway, while various M2M application servers (such as electricity meter reading and intelligent traffic) obtain, with a service capability provided by the M2M service platform, data collected by the M2M terminals, or perform remote control and management for the M2M terminals.","However, in some common M2M services, usually a same service operation needs to be performed for a large quantity of M2M terminals\/gateways simultaneously, for example, simultaneously reading electricity meters in all households within an area, or simultaneously controlling power-on and power-off of all lighting and air-conditioning facilities within a building. In this case, group communication becomes especially important because it can prevent an M2M application from repetitively sending a same service operation request to various M2M terminals\/gateways and save a lot of communication overheads.","The prior art provides a resource-oriented group communication method. In this method, an M2M application server, an M2M platform, an M2M terminal, an M2M gateway, and all data objects and local applications running on the M2M terminal and M2M gateway are all regarded as a RESTful (Representational State Transfer, representational state transfer) resource, and are uniquely identified by a URI (Universal Resource Identifier, universal resource identifier). By creating a group resource using the foregoing various resources as member resources, a group operation can be implemented for multiple member resources. That is, by creating a group resource, a group operation is implemented for multiple member resources, where the group resource includes information related to the member resources, for example, access paths of the member resources, names of devices having the member resources, and access addresses. For example, if meter reading resources on all target electricity meters (M2M devices) are used as member resources of a group, the M2M application server may send a read request with respect to a group resource to an entity (hereinafter referred to as a group server, which may be any one of an M2M platform, an M2M gateway, and an M2M terminal) maintaining the group resource, and the group server is responsible for forwarding the request to the target electricity meters one by one, and combining reading results into one response message returned to the M2M application server. Therefore, the M2M application server may obtain all member resources (namely, electricity meter reading content) by reading the group resource at a time. A specific communication protocol used by this method may be the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol, HyperText Transfer Protocol) or the CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol, Constrained Application Protocol).","However, the existing method applied to M2M group communication saves only communication between the M2M application server and the group server, but the group server still needs to send a request to each M2M device separately. If the group server has a limited capability (for example, an M2M gateway), or a network between the group server and the M2M device has a relatively small bandwidth or a relatively high communication cost, communication between the group server and the M2M device in the method is not economical.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a method, a group server, and a member device for accessing member resources, so that there is no need to unicast an access request to each member device, and that network overheads are saved.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for accessing member resources, including:","receiving a request for accessing member resources, where the request for accessing member resources carries a group resource identifier of a group resource to which the member resources belong;

Therefore, the group server does not need to unicast the access request to each member device, and network overheads are saved.","The following clearly describes the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present invention. Apparently, the described embodiments are merely a part rather than all of the embodiments of the present invention. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.","As shown in , a method for accessing member resources according to an embodiment of the present invention includes the following steps:","Step : Receive a request for accessing member resources, where the request for accessing member resources carries a group resource identifier of a group resource to which the member resources belong.","Specifically, a first group server receives a request for accessing member resources. For example, the first group server receives a request for accessing member resources whose group resource identifier is Grp4: GET http:\/\/g1.example.org\/groups\/grp4\/membersContent\/data HTTP\/1.1. Grp4 is a group resource identifier, the \u201cmembersContent\u201d part indicates that the request is an operation for all member resources in a group resource corresponding to Grp4, and \u201cdata\u201d is an instance of a suffix, and used to indicate that the request specifically should access \u201cdata\u201d data of each member resource.","Step : Obtain, according to the group resource identifier, a fanout URI corresponding to the member resources in the group resource and a multicast address corresponding to the fanout URI, where the fanout URI is used to indicate access paths of the member resources on member devices.","Specifically, when the first group server receives the request for accessing member resources, the first group server first checks, according to the group resource identifier in the request for accessing member resources, whether a mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI is established for the group resource and whether a mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the member resources is further established. If the mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI is established, the first group server sends a member resource access request to each member device according to the mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI; otherwise, the first group server sends a request for accessing member resources in a unicast mode one by one according to a method of the prior art.","In a case where the mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI is established, when the first group server sends a member resource access request to each member device according to the mapping relationship, a destination address of the request for accessing member resources should be set to the multicast address in the mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI (namely, the multicast address allocated by the group server to the member resources), and a destination URI should be set to the fanout URI. When the group resource includes multiple groups of mapping relationships between multicast addresses and fanout URIs, a member resource access request should be sent with respect to each group of mapping relationships between multicast addresses and fanout URIs according to the foregoing method. If the destination URI in the request for accessing member resources, which is received by the first group server, further includes any suffix (internal information such as a child resource, an attribute, and a parameter used to access the member resources), the corresponding suffix should also be added to the fanout URI according to the destination URI in the member resource access request sent by the first group server. Specifically, the first group server needs to determine that the destination URI in the request for accessing member resources further includes a suffix. Therefore, the first group server further needs to set the destination URI to the fanout URI corresponding to the member resources, and add the suffix included in the destination URI to the fanout URI to generate a member resource access request.","Specifically, the mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI and the mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the member resources, stored by the first group server or other group servers for each group resource, are as shown in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Group resource mapping table"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Group","Member",{},{}]},{"entry":["Resource","Resource","Multicast Address","Fanout URI"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Grp4","m41, m42","[FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1231]","\/x\/temp1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Grp4 is a group resource identifier; m41 and m42 are member resources; the multicast address [FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1231] is a multicast address allocated to the member resources m41 and m42 in the group resource Grp4; the fanout URI \/xxx\/temp1 is an access path of the member resources m41 and m42 on member devices having the member resources. Generally, as shown in Table 1, at least two member resources correspond to one multicast address and one fanout URI.","In the embodiment described in Table 1, if the group resource Grp4 is used as another example and includes only the member resources m41 and m42 according to the mapping relationships in Table 1 in the embodiment, the member resource column in Table 1 may also not include m41 and m42. In this case, only the mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the multicast address is included in Table 1.","Step : Send, according to the multicast address, a member resource access request to the member devices having the member resources, where a destination URI of the member resource access request includes the fanout URI corresponding to the member resources, so that the member devices having the member resources execute, according to the access paths of the member resources on the member devices as indicated by the fanout URI, an operation indicated by the member resource access request.","Specifically, the first group server sends the following member resource access request to the member devices according to the mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the multicast address as shown in Table 1:","GET \/xxx\/temp1\/data HTTP\/1.1","Host: [FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1231]","The URI carried in the GET command is the fanout URI \u201c\/xxx\/temp1\/data\u201d after a suffix \u201cdata\u201d is added, and the Host header field is used as the destination address to carry the multicast address (namely, an IPv6 multicast address allocated by the first group server to the member resources m41 and m42 in the group resource Grp4).","Therefore, after receiving the GET \/xxx\/temp1\/data HTTP\/1.1 request according to the multicast address [FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1231], the member devices having the member resources m41 and m42 (assumed to be D1 and D2) may send the data with the suffix \u201cdata\u201d in the \/xxx\/temp1 path on the member devices D1 and D2 to the first group server. Therefore, the first group server does not need to send a member resource access request to the member devices D1 and D2 in a unicast mode, and network traffic is saved.","In addition, before the first group server receives the request for accessing member resources, the first group server further receives a group resource creation request, where the group resource creation request carries each member resource, and the member resources include member devices having the member resources and access paths of the member resources on the member devices; and allocates, according to the member devices having the member resources and the access paths of the member resources on the member devices, at least one multicast address to the member devices having the member resources, and establishes a mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI according to the access paths of the member resources on the member devices, where the fanout URI is used to indicate the access paths of the member resources on the member devices. Specifically, for creating, by the first group server, a group resource, and establishing a mapping relationship between a multicast address and the fanout URI, reference may be made to the description of . The following steps are included:","Step : The first group server receives a group resource creation request, where the group resource creation request carries each member resource, and the member resources include member devices having the member resources and access paths of the member resources on the member devices.","Step : The first group server obtains characteristics of the member resources according to the member devices having the member resources and the access paths of the member resources on the member devices, and determines, according to the characteristics of the member resources, whether it is necessary to create a multicast group. Specifically, for the determining, by the first group server, whether it is necessary to create a multicast group, reference may be made to the description of -A. The following steps are included:","Step -: The first group server parses the group resource creation request to obtain descriptions of characteristics of the group resource and descriptions of characteristics of the member resources thereof, including but not limited to characteristics such as a type attribute of the group resource (being a static, dynamic, or temporary group or not), a purpose of the group resource (requiring a reliable response for a request or not), the access paths of the member resources on the member devices, access interfaces of the member resources, the member devices having the member resources, and network features thereof (supporting multicast or not).","For example, the descriptions of characteristics of the group resource may be obtained from description content of the group resource carried in the group resource creation request. The description content of the group resource includes the type attribute and purpose of the group resource. The descriptions of characteristics of the member resources may be obtained according to the URI information of the member resources included in the group resource description, and include URI structures of the member resources, access interfaces of the member resources, and the like. The member devices having the member resources may be also accessed according to the URIs of the member resources, so that characteristics such as the member devices having the member resources and network features of the member devices are further obtained.","Step -: Determine, according to the group description of the group resource creation request, whether the group resource to be created is a relatively static group or a dynamic group that changes frequently; if the group resource to be created is a relatively static group, perform a subsequent determination process; if the group resource to be created is a dynamic group, end the process without creating a multicast group for the group resource, thereby avoiding overheads of multicast group creation and maintenance caused by frequent group changes. The relatively static group may be: a group whose group description includes a specific member resource list and whose member changes are controlled by the first group server according to a group management command (for example, adding\/deleting a member). The dynamic group includes but is not limited to: a group including member resources that are a resource set meeting particular conditions, for example, member resources in a specific geographical range or member resources having other same characteristics, where changes of group members may be triggered automatically according to changes of the characteristics of the member resources (for example, a member leaves or enters a geographical range or the group selects a channel).","Step -: Determine, according to the access interfaces of the member resources carried in the group resource creation request, whether the access interfaces of the member resources are consistent, and if the access interfaces of the number resources are consistent, perform a subsequent determination process, or otherwise, end the process without creating a multicast group for the group resource. Whether the access interfaces of the member resources are consistent is specifically whether a same multicast data packet (for example, an IPv4 or IPv6 data packet) can be used for access. For example, if URIs for accessing multiple member resources comply with a same protocol and access port number, and access paths in the URIs of the multiple member resources are the same on different member devices, it may be considered that the multiple member resources have a same resource access interface. In an actual system, the URI may be represented by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator, uniform resource locator), while a basic structure of the URL includes:","<scheme>:\/\/<authority>:<port>\/<path>?<query>#<fragment>","The <scheme> part determines a protocol used for accessing a resource corresponding to the URL (for example, HTTP or CoAP); the <authority> part determines an address of a member device having the member resource (for example, an IP address or a domain name); <port> is an optional item, indicating a protocol access port number; and <path>?<query>#<fragment> indicates an access path of the resource on the member device.","For example, assuming that domain names of an M2M platform N1, an M2M device D1, and an M2M gateway G1 are respectively n1.example.com, d1.example.com, and g1.example.com, a URL of a group resource Grp1 on N1 is:","Grp1=http:\/\/n1.example.com\/groups\/grp1","URLs of member resources m11, m12, m13, and m14 included therein are respectively as follows:","m11=coap:\/\/d1.example.com\/xxx\/temp1","m12=coap:\/\/d1.example.com\/yyy\/temp2","m13=coap:\/\/g1.example.com\/xxx\/temp1","m14=http:\/\/n1.example.com\/xxx\/temp1","Among the 4 member resources, m11 and m13 have a same resource access interface, because the same CoAP is used in the <scheme> thereof and both access paths thereof on member devices (d1 and g1 herein) are \/xxx\/temp1; conversely, m12 and m14 have different resource access interfaces from other member resources, because the access path of m12 on the member device d1 is \/yyy\/temp2, while the <scheme> of m14 is the HTTP. In this example, a multicast group may be created for m11 and m13, but m12 and m14 are not included.","Step -: The first group server determines whether the member resources, the member devices having the member resources, and a network to which the member devices belong support multicast, and if multicast is supported, perform a subsequent determination process, or otherwise, end the process without creating a multicast group for the group resource. Whether the member resources support multicast may be determined according to whether the URLs corresponding to the member resources support multicast protocol access (for example, not supported by the HTTP, but supported by the CoAP). The first group server may further need to obtain related resource representation information, such as registration information, of the member resources and the member devices having the member resources, and determine, according to the resource representation information such as registration information, whether the member devices having the member resources and the network to which the member devices belong support multicast.","For example, on the M2M platform N1, registration information of the member device D1 having the member resource m11 may be accessed according to the following URL: http:\/\/n1.example.com\/sc1s\/d1.","The first group server may send an HTTP GET request to N1 to obtain resource representation content corresponding to the URL. In the resource representation content, whether D1 supports multicast may be indicated by a special attribute (for example, \u201cmulticastEnabled\u201d). If the value of the attribute is TRUE, it indicates that multicast is supported. If the value is FALSE, it indicates that multicast is not supported.","Optionally, even if the member device having the member resource does not support multicast, when the member resource needs to be accessed through another device supporting multicast, it may also be determined that the member device having the member resource supports multicast. As shown in -B, the first group server is an M2M device D1, and a group resource Grp2 includes a member resource m21 on an M2M platform, but D1 accesses m21 through an M2M gateway G1.","If a communication link between D1 and G1 supports multicast (for example, the CoAP), D1 may send a request to G1 in multicast mode, and then G1 converts the request into unicast mode (for example, the HTTP) to access m21 on N1. In this case, it may be considered that multicast is supported for accessing the member resource m21.","Step -: The first group server determines whether a quantity of member devices having the member resources meeting the foregoing conditions reaches a particular quantity, and if the quantity of member devices having the member resources meeting the foregoing conditions reaches the particular quantity, performs a subsequent step, or otherwise, ends the process without creating a multicast group for the group resource. Herein, a quantity determined according to a preconfigured policy or parameter may be used as a threshold for creating a multicast group. When the threshold is not reached, it is unnecessary to create a multicast group for the foregoing member resources, so that a management overhead of the multicast group is saved.","It should be noted that the time sequence of steps - to - is not strictly limited, and that the first group server may perform only one or more steps from - to - according to a configured policy or capability, which is not limited herein by the embodiment of the present invention. In addition, the first group server may further determine whether the request for accessing member resources of the group resource requires a reliable response, and if member access for the group resource requires a reliable response, ends the process without creating a multicast group for the group resource, or otherwise, performs a subsequent determination process.","Requiring a reliable response means that a response message indicating operation success or failure must be returned after the member devices having the member resources receive a member resource access request. Specifically, a request message of a Confirmable (CON) type in the CoAP is a member resource access request requiring a reliable response, and a receiver of the member resource access request must return a response message of an Acknowledgement (ACK) or Reset (RST) type; a request message of a Non-Confirmable (NON) type does not require a message receiver to return any response message.","Step : Allocate a multicast address to the member resources according to the member devices having the member resources and the access paths of the member resources on the member devices, and establish a mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI according to the access paths of the member resources on the member devices. Specifically, reference may be made to the description of -C. The following steps are included:","Step -: The first group server analyzes a condition of multicast domains to which the member devices having the member resources meeting various conditions in step  belong and whether all the member devices belong to a local multicast domain; and if all the member devices belong to a local multicast domain, executes step -, or otherwise, executes step -.","Specifically, in the embodiment of the present invention, multicast domains may be classified into a local multicast domain, a remote multicast domain, and a global multicast domain. The local multicast domain is an area of network addresses managed by the first group server. The first group server is capable of allocating multicast addresses of the local multicast domain (local multicast addresses) to member devices in the area. After devices in the area join a multicast group indicated by a local multicast address, data packets destined for the local multicast address may be received by all member devices that have joined the local multicast group. The remote multicast domain is an area other than the area of network addresses managed by the first group server. The group server is incapable of allocating a local multicast address to the remote multicast domain, and member devices in the local multicast domain cannot receive data packets destined for a multicast address of the remote multicast domain (remote multicast address) (even if the local multicast address and the remote multicast address are the same, because a same address space may be used repeatedly by different multicast domains), and vice versa. The global multicast domain refers to an entire network area including the local multicast domain and the remote multicast domain. Therefore, local network devices and remote network devices may receive data packets destined for a global multicast address so long as they join a multicast group indicated by a multicast address in a global multicast domain (global multicast address). Global multicast addresses may be managed and allocated in a unified manner by a global network entity, and may also be allocated in advance to some group servers according to particular address planning. For a guide to an allocation scheme of IPv4 and IPv6 multicast address spaces, reference may be made to standard documents such as [RFC 3171] and [RFC 4291]. Which multicast domain a member device specifically belongs to may be determined according to a connection relationship between the member device and the group server. For example, if a member device (for example, an M2M device) registers with the first group server (for example, an M2M gateway), it may be considered that the member device belongs to the local multicast domain of the group server. If a member device registers with another entity at a same level as the first group server (for example, another M2M gateway) or a higher level than the first group server (for example, an M2M platform) (that is, the member device belongs to the second group server), it may be considered that the member device belongs to the remote multicast domain. That is, the first group server obtains registration information of each member device according to the member addresses in the group resource creation request, and then determines, according to the registration information, whether the member device belongs to the local multicast domain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"b":["203","2","203","5","203","3"]},"Specifically, as described in step -, global multicast addresses may be allocated in advance to some group servers according to an address planning policy. Therefore, when the first group server determines that not all the member devices of the group resource belong to the local multicast domain managed by the first group server, the first group server searches itself to see whether any unallocated global multicast address exists in the global multicast address space that is allocated in advance, or the first group server sends an address allocation request to a global entity that is responsible for managing global multicast address allocation. A specific implementation manner of sending, by the first group server, an address allocation request to a global multicast address management entity that is responsible for managing global multicast addresses is as follows:","Assuming that the global multicast address management entity is an M2M platform N1, and that a resource URL for allocating a global multicast address on N1 is http:\/\/n1.example.com\/mcAddrPool, the first group server may access a resource http:\/\/n1.example.com\/mcAddrPool according to an HTTP GET request. If N1 returns a success response, a global multicast address requested by the first group server may be obtained from a message body of the response message. If N1 returns a failure response, it means that the M2M platform N1 cannot allocate a global multicast address to the member devices.","Actually, the first group server may also use a similar method to request a remote or global multicast address to be allocated by another entity (for example, another group server) that is responsible for managing allocation of local or remote multicast addresses. The implementation manner is similar to the manner of requesting a global multicast address from the M2M platform N1, and is not described in detail in the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"b":["203","3","203","6","203","7"]},"m31=http:\/\/d2.example.com\/xxx\/temp1","m32=http:\/\/d2.example.com\/xxx\/temp2","m33=coap:\/\/d3.example.com\/xxx\/temp1","m34=coap:\/\/d4.example.com\/xxx\/temp1","Then, the member device having m31 and m32 is an M2M device D2, while member devices having m33 and m34 are respectively M2M devices D3 and D4, and none of D2, D3, and D4 belongs to a local multicast domain of G1. It is assumed that D3 and D4 can be accessed through a second M2M gateway G2, and that their connection relationship is shown in -D. Therefore, it may be considered that the members resources (m31, m32) can be accessed through the second group server (M2M device D2 in -D), while member resources (m33, m34) can be accessed through a third group server (M2M gateway G2 in -D). However, if D2 or G2 is unable to act as a group server due to reasons such as device capabilities, it may be considered that member resources (m31, m32) or (m33, m34) cannot be accessed through another group server, specifically, the first group server in the embodiment of the present invention (M2M gateway G1 in -D).","It should be noted that even if only one member resource (for example, only m31 exists, and m32 does not exist) can be accessed through another group server, step - may still be performed to create a group resource for the member resource m31.

Specifically, no matter whether the access interfaces of the member resources are the same, it is necessary to associate the group resource identifier with the allocated multicast address and establish a mapping relationship between the multicast address and the \u201cfanout URI\u201d. The fanout URI is the destination URI of the member resource access request sent to the member devices by the first group server when receiving the request for accessing the member resources of the group resource. Specifically, when the URIs of the member resources comply with the same protocol and access port number, and the access paths of the member resources on the member devices are the same, the fanout URI is the access path of the member resources on the member devices. When the URIs comply with the same protocol and access port number, but the access paths on the member devices are different, the fanout URI is set to a virtual resource identifier (which may be a group resource identifier or a resource identifier in another form). For establishing the mapping relationship between the multicast address and the fanout URI, reference may be made to the following cases:","First case: The access paths of the member resources of the group resource on the member devices are the same.","For example, it is assumed that a group resource Grp4 on the M2M gateway G1 is Grp4=http:\/\/g1.example.org\/groups\/grp4.","Member resources included therein are m41 on an M2M device D1 and m42 on an M2M device D5:","m41=coap:\/\/d1.example.org\/xxx\/temp1","m42=coap:\/\/d5.example.org\/xxx\/temp1","An IPv6 multicast address allocated by the first group server (M2M gateway G1 in this example) to the member resources m41 and m42 in the group resource Grp4 is [FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1231], and the network connection relationship between devices is shown in -E (that is, both member devices D1 and D2 having the member resources m41 and m42 belong to the M2M gateway G1). The mapping relationship between the fanout URI (\/xxx\/temp1) and the multicast address ([FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1231]) of the group resource Grp4 and the mapping relationship between the fanout URI (\/xxx\/temp1) and the member resources (m41 and m42) of the group resource Grp4 are as shown in Table 1. Certainly, in this case, because the access paths of all the member devices having the group resource on the member devices are the same, all the member resources correspond to one multicast address and one fanout URI. Therefore, the mapping relationship may further be only a mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the multicast address of the group resource Grp4, and it is unnecessary to record the mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the member resources of the group resource. However, the same group server generally includes multiple group resources, while member resource features of each group resource are inconsistent. Therefore, for record consistency, even if it is unnecessary to record the mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the member resources, the member resources may be recorded in the mapping relationship in the list or related attributes may be reserved, so that record consistency is ensured.","Second case: The member resources of the group resource represent the member devices having the member resources.","For example, it is assumed that a group resource Grp5 on the M2M gateway G1 is Grp5=http:\/\/g1.example.org\/groups\/grp5, where member resources included are m51, m52, and m53 on M2M devices D1, D5, and D6 respectively.","m51=coap:\/\/d1.example.org\/","m52=coap:\/\/d5.example.org\/","m53=coap:\/\/d6.example.org\/","An allocated IPv6 multicast address is [FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1232], and the network connection relationship between devices is still as shown in -E (that is, all the member devices D1, D5, and D6 respectively having the member resources m51, m52, and m53 belong to the M2M gateway G1). Therefore, the fanout URI corresponding to the member resources m51, m52, and m53 is a root symbol \u201c\/\u201d, and the mapping relationship between the fanout URI (\/) and the multicast address ([FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1232]) of the group resource Grp5 and the mapping relationship between the fanout URI (\/) and the member resources (m51, m52, and m53) are as shown in Table 2. In this case, fanout URI information may also be omitted for simplicity. In addition, in this case, the mapping relationship may also be referred to as the mapping relationship between the multicast address ([FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1232]), the fanout URI (\/), and the member resources (m51, m52, and m53) of the group resource. Unless otherwise specially noted in the embodiment of the present invention, the mapping relationship refers to the mapping relationship between the multicast address, the member resources, and the fanout URI.","Third case: The access paths of the member resources of the group resource on respective member devices are different.","For example, it is assumed that a group resource Grp6 on the M2M gateway G1 is Grp6=http:\/\/g1example.org\/groups\/grp6, where member resources of the group resource Grp6 are m61 on an M2M device D5 and (m62, m63) on an M2M device D6 respectively:","m61=coap:\/\/d5.example.org\/xx","m62=coap:\/\/d6.example.org\/yy","m63=coap:\/\/d6.example.org\/zz","An IPv6 multicast address allocated by the first group server (M2M gateway G1 in -E in this example) to Grp6 is [FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1233], and the network connection relationship between devices is shown in -E (both the member device D5 having the member resource m61 and the member device D6 having the member resources m62 and m63 belong to the M2M gateway G1. Therefore, the first group server needs to allocate a virtual fanout URI to each member resource of the group resource Grp6 (the specific allocation method may be determined by the first group server, and is not limited herein in the embodiment of the present invention), for example, \u201c\/well-know\/grp6\u201d. The virtual fanout URI (\/well-know\/grp6) does not directly correspond to member resources on any member device, but each member device needs to associate the virtual fanout URI with the member resource corresponding to the virtual fanout URI and belonging to the member device in the group resource. For the specific association method, reference may be made to the subsequent related description of -G. In addition, to avoid a name conflict of the virtual fanout URIs allocated by different group servers, which may occur on the same member device, proper name space division may be adopted between different group servers, or a unique group URI (for example, \/g1.example.org\/groups\/grp6) is directly used as a part or an entirety of the virtual fanout URI. For the mapping relationship between the fanout URI (\/well-know\/grp6) and the member resources m61, m62, and m63 of the group resource Grp6 and the established mapping relationship between the fanout URI (well-know\/grp6) and the multicast address ([FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1233]), reference may be made to Table 2.","Fourth case: Access interfaces of a part of member resources are the same.","For example, when access interfaces of a part of member resources are the same, while access interfaces of other member resources are different, apart from use of the foregoing method, member resources having the same access interface may be grouped into a first group (there may be multiple groups), member resources having different access interfaces are grouped into a second group, and then each group of member resources, multicast addresses, and fanout URIs are mapped according to the foregoing method to form multiple groups of mapping relationships. For each group of member resources, the group server may allocate different multicast addresses separately or allocate the same multicast address. For the latter, it is required that the \u201cfanout URI\u201d of each group should be different.","For example, it is assumed that a group resource Grp7 on the M2M gateway G1 is Grp7=http:\/\/g1.example.org\/groups\/grp7, where member resources included in the group resource Grp7 are respectively m71 on an M2M device D1, m72 on D5, m73 on D6, m74 on D7, m75 on D8, m76 on D9, and m77 on N1:","m71=coap:\/\/d1.example.org\/xx\/aa","m72=coap:\/\/d5.example.org\/xx\/aa","m73=coap:\/\/d6.example.org\/yy\/bb","m74=coap:\/\/d7.example.org\/yy\/bb","m75=coap:\/\/d8.example.org\/cc","m76=coap:\/\/d9.example.org\/dd","An IPv6 multicast address allocated by the first group server (M2M gateway G1 in -E in this example) to the group resource Grp7 is [FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1234], and the network connection relationship between devices is shown in -E (that is, all member devices D1, D5, D6, D7, D8, and D9 respectively having the member resources m71, m72, m73, m74, m75, and m76 belong to the M2M gateway G1). Therefore, the member resources (m71, m72) correspond to the same fanout URI \u201c\/xx\/aa\/\u201d, and the member resources (m73, m74) correspond to the same fanout URI \u201c\/yy\/bb\/\u201d, while a virtual fanout URI, for example, \u201c\/well-known\/grp7\/\u201d, needs to be allocated to (m75, m76). Therefore, the mapping relationship established for each member resource of the group resource Grp7 is shown in Table 2, that is, the mapping relationship between the member resources (m71, m72) and the fanout URI (\/xx\/aa) as well as the mapping relationship between the multicast address ([FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1234]) and the fanout URI (\/xx\/aa), the mapping relationship between the member resources (m73, m74) and the fanout URI (\/yy\/bb) as well as the mapping relationship between the multicast address ([FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1234]) and the fanout URI (\/yy\/bb), the mapping relationship between the member resources (m75, m76) and the fanout URI (\/well-known\/grp7) as well as the mapping relationship between the multicast address ([FF32:30:3FFE:FFFF:1::1234]) and the fanout URI (\/well-known\/grp7), and the mapping relationship between the member resource (m77), the unicast address ([3FFE:2A00:100:7031::1]), and the fanout URI (\/abc).","When a part of member resources do not support multicast: if the group resource further includes member resources not supporting multicast, the member resources not supporting multicast are accessed in a unicast mode one by one according to the prior art, and do not need to be added to the member address mapping table.

In this case, the multicast address column is filled in with the unicast addresses, and the fanout URI column is filled in with the access paths of these member resources on the member devices.

The group advertisement for joining the multicast group carries the allocated multicast address to instruct the member devices supporting multicast to join the multicast group corresponding to the multicast address. For the member devices not supporting multicast, it is unnecessary to send the group advertisement for joining the multicast group. Using a group resource (for example, Grp7) including multiple mapping relationships between multicast addresses and fanout URIs as an example, the first group server needs to respectively send a group advertisement for joining a multicast group to member devices corresponding to member resources in each mapping relationship having a fanout URI. Furthermore, the group advertisement for joining the multicast group may not only includes the multicast address corresponding to the multicast group that the member devices should join, but also includes the mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the member resources.","Specifically, when the access paths of the member resources in the group resource on the member devices are completely the same (for example, Grp4 and Grp5 in Table 1 and Table 2), the group advertisement for joining the multicast group may only need to include multicast address information; when the access paths of the member resources in the group resource on the member devices are not completely the same (for example, Grp6 and Grp7 in Table 2), the group advertisement for joining the multicast group should further include the mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the member resources, so that the member devices having the member resources store the mapping relationship between the fanout URI and the multicast address and the mapping relationship between the member resources and the multicast address.","The group advertisement for joining the multicast group may be sent to the member devices in multiple modes, for example, a preconfigured unicast, multicast, or broadcast mode. Specifically, when the unicast mode is used, the first group server sends, one by one by using a unicast message, a group advertisement for joining a multicast group to unicast addresses (for example, IPv4 or IPv6 unicast addresses) of the member devices having the member resources; when the multicast or broadcast mode is used, the group server sends, by using a multicast or broadcast message, a group advertisement message for joining a multicast group to a pre-agreed multicast or broadcast address (for example, an IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address), and in this case, it is required that the corresponding member devices have joined the multicast\/broadcast group corresponding to the specific multicast or broadcast address (for example, implemented by using an IP multicast management protocol such as IGMP or MLD), and that the group advertisement for joining the multicast group should further include identifiers (URIs) of the member devices or URIs of the member resources to instruct the member devices corresponding to the identifiers (URIs) of the member devices or URIs of the member resources to receive and process the group advertisement for joining the multicast group, while other member devices ignore the group advertisement for joining the multicast group.","The embodiment of the present invention does not limit a transmission protocol (for example, HTTP, CoAP, or SIP) used for sending the group advertisement for joining the multicast group in the unicast, multicast, or broadcast mode, and the message format itself may also use different encapsulation modes (for example, XML or binary encoding). The following provides only an exemplary implementation manner of sending a group advertisement for joining a multicast group by using a RESTful request.","To implement the present invention, a member device stores mcGroups resources whose member resources join the multicast group, for storing 0 to any plurality of multicast group resources <mcGroup>, while each <mcGroup> resource describes information of a multicast group that the member device joins.

For example, a PUT, POST, or DELETE method is used to directly modify an existing <mcGroup> resource list on a member device (or a part of attributes therein) to indicate an advertisement for instructing the member device to join or leave a multicast group. Specifically, leaving an original multicast group and joining a new multicast group are indicated by replacing the whole <mcGroup> resource; a multicast group address is changed by changing an mcAddress attribute in the <mcGroup> resource; a fanout URI corresponding to the multicast group is changed by changing the fanoutURI attribute in the <mcGroup> resource; or some member resources on the member device are instructed, by adding, deleting, or modifying a member resource list in the memberList, to join or leave a multicast group.","After receiving the group advertisement for joining or leaving a multicast group, the member device should join or leave a corresponding multicast group by using a multicast management protocol such as IGMP or MLD according to the instruction in the group advertisement for joining or leaving a multicast group, and meanwhile, maintain the multicast group resource <mcGroup> stored on the member device, so that a subsequent member resource access request from the group server is processed.","In addition, if the second group server allocates a multicast address in step -, the second group server needs to be regarded as a member device, and the same processing of sending a group advertisement for joining or leaving a multicast group is performed, which is not further described herein.","In addition, after the first group server creates the group resource, the first group server may further receive a group resource update request sent by an application server, for example, a group resource update request for adding member resources, a group resource update request for deleting member resources, or a request for modifying group resource description information.","Specifically, the group resource update request for adding member resources carries the group resource identifier and member resources that need to join the group resource, where the member resources that need to join the group resource include member devices having the member resources and access paths of the member resources on the member devices.

In the foregoing embodiments, the division of various module included is only based on function logic, but the present invention is not limited to the preceding division, so long as corresponding functions can be implemented. In addition, the specific names of the functional module are only used to distinguish the functional units and are not used to limit the protection scope of the present invention. Implementation of the method executed by the member device and functions of various functional modules of the member device may be completed by a processor of the member device, and implementation of the method executed by the group server and functions of various functional modules of the group server may be completed by a processor of the group server.","As may be seen from the technical solutions provided in the embodiments of the present invention, a mapping relationship between an access path of a member resource on a member device and a fanout URI is established, and the fanout URI is included in a member resources access request, so that the member device having the member resource executes, according to the access path of the member resource on the member device as indicated by the fanout URI, an operation indicated by the member resources access request. Therefore, according to a multicast technology and a fanout URI, different member devices can parse a multicast request for accessing member resources, and perform subsequent operations for the access request. Therefore, the group server does not need to unicast the access request to each member device, and network overheads are saved.","The foregoing descriptions are merely exemplary specific embodiments of the present invention, but are not intended to limit the protection scope of the present invention. Any variation or replacement readily figured out by a person skilled in the art within the technical scope disclosed in the present invention shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.
