title: Template for inspecting and marking repair areas on an object
abstract: A template for assessing damaged areas on an object, such as a fan blade or other item, includes a set of marks indicating the maximum areas of damage allowed on the periphery of the object. A guide enables the template to be aligned in proper position against the object for accurate visual inspection of the damaged areas. For example, one or more blend guides are included to allow the inspector to mark a blend area around the damage to enable maintenance personnel to smooth sharp, jagged edges of the damaged areas, thereby relieving stress points and improving the aerodynamic efficiency of a blade in an engine. The template can include a magnifying portion that allows the user to see more detail on the object. Linear and/or curved measurement scales can also be included on the template.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention was made with Government support under contract F33657-98-D-0117, awarded by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Foreign object damage (FOD) on aircraft turbine engine blades is a condition defined as any damage from small nicks and scratches to complete disablement or destruction of an engine caused by damaged parts of blades that break loose during operation. The blades rotate at very high speeds, and various levels of damage can be inflicted by foreign objects striking the blades, depending on the speed of the blades, the speed of the aircraft, and the size and hardness of the object.","FOD can be caused in a variety of ways including rocks or other hard objects being ingested by the engine during operation in the air or on the ground. Another source of FOD arises when components such as nuts, bolts, or tools are mistakenly left in or near the engine during maintenance. Additionally, leading and trailing edges of blades are subject to gradual erosion from abrasive sand and grit particles in the air that is ingested by the engine during operation. Another common source of engine FOD is in-flight icing that forms on the airframe or engine itself, breaks off and is ingested by the engine.","A typical engine has hundreds of blades which must be inspected for cracks, foreign object damage (FOD), and corrosion. Damaged and eroded blades degrade engine performance, as well as posing a potential cause of engine failure, and therefore must be replaced once the damage or erosion has exceeded a certain level. The flight crew is often not aware of FOD, however, in case of extensive damage, it can be indicated by vibration and changes in the engine's normal operating parameters. For example, damage to fan or compressor blades results in an increase in exhaust gas temperature (EGT), decrease in engine pressure ratio (EPR), and a change in the speed (RPM) ratio between the core engine and the fan section (N2\/N1). Visual inspection for substantial damage to inlet fan blades and guide vanes is required to determine whether a blade can be repaired, or must be replaced.","A certain level of damage to a blade does not pose a serious threat to operational safety or performance. Guidelines regarding the extent of visible blade damage allowed are often provided to enable maintenance personnel to judge whether the blade must be repaired or replaced before further use. The amount of allowable damage can vary depending on the location of the damage along the length of the blade. The guidelines are typically expressed in terms of a percentage or amount of the leading and trailing edges of the chord (width) of the blade that may be missing before repair or replacement is required.","It is often difficult to visually gauge the amount of a blade that is missing without a measuring aid, such as a ruler. One known method of visual inspection includes marking damage limits at the tip and the bottom (root) of the blade. A straight line is drawn along the length of the blade between the marks at the tip and the root. The marks can be drawn on the leading edge and\/or the trailing edge, depending whether both edges of the blade are damaged.","Once the allowable limits for damage to the blade are marked on the blade, the inspector can determine whether the blade must be replaced. When a damaged area on a blade is determined to be within a tolerable range, it is often desirable to blend the sharp edges of the damage to improve aerodynamic performance of the blade. The blending process also helps relieve stress points, thereby helping to avoid further cracking\/damage to the blade during operation of the engine. Typically, an inspector will mark a small arc around the damaged area to indicate the area to be blended.","Thus, the inspector must measure along the length and the width of the blade to gauge each area of damage on both the leading and the trailing edges. Typically, a blade will have an aerodynamic contour that includes a cambered airfoil along the chord with a slight twist along the length of the blade. The contour can add to the difficulty of measuring the blade with a conventional straightedge ruler. Additionally, fan and compressor blades are typically tapered along their length from root to tip, further adding to the difficulty of determining whether the damage is within allowable limits. The problem is exacerbated on aircraft with inlet ducts, which do not allow easy access to inspect the blades.","A visual inspection of the engine fan blades is typically conducted on a routine basis. Considering the number of jet engines in service, millions of man-hours are required each year to complete the inspections. The blade inspection procedure outlined above is awkward, time-consuming, and prone to human error. It is therefore desirable to provide a device to facilitate more accurate and efficient visual fan and compressor blade inspection. It is also desirable to include a guide for marking the blend areas on the damaged portions of the blade with the inspection device.","Embodiments of a template for assessing damaged areas on an object, such as a fan blade or other item, includes a set of marks indicating the maximum areas of damage allowed on the periphery of the object. A guide enables the template to be aligned in proper position against the object for accurate visual inspection of the damaged areas. For example, one or more blend guides are included to allow the inspector to mark a blend area around the damage to enable maintenance personnel to smooth sharp, jagged edges of the damaged areas, thereby relieving stress points and improving the aerodynamic efficiency of a blade in an engine. The template can include a magnifying portion that allows the user to see more detail on the object. Linear and\/or curved measurement scales can also be included on the template.","Other advantages and features of the invention will become more apparent, as will equivalent structures which are intended to be covered herein, with the teaching of the principles of embodiments of the present invention as disclosed in the following description, claims, and drawings.","Referring to ,  shows a front view of an embodiment of template , which can be used to determine whether damage or erosion extends beyond allowable limits on virtually any type of blade. Template  is typically sized and shaped to substantially conform to at least a portion of the blade being inspected and includes one or more marks that indicate the maximum areas of damage allowed on any part of the blade, such as one or both of leading and trailing edges as well as the tip of a blade.","In the embodiment of template  shown in , alignment mark  is provided to allow the inspector to align template  with at least a portion of the blade being inspected. When alignment mark  of template  is aligned with the corresponding portion of the blade, damage limit mark  provides an indication of the amount of the blade that can be damaged or eroded before the blade must be replaced. In the embodiment shown, damage that extends between alignment mark  and damage limit mark  is considered to be within an allowable range. Damage that extends from alignment mark  to beyond damage limit mark  exceeds the allowable range, and indicates that the blade should be replaced.","Alignment mark  and damage limit mark  are shown as lines extending from root  to tip  with a slight curvature near the root  in the embodiment of template  shown in . The distance between alignment mark  and damage limit mark  increases gradually from root  to tip . Thus, a greater amount of damage to the leading edge of the blade is allowed at tip  than at root . One reason for allowing more damage near the tip  is because smaller pieces of the blade are less likely than larger, heavier pieces to be projected outside the engine.","In other embodiments, the length, shape, and distance between alignment mark  and damage limit mark  can vary, depending on the shape of the blade, the areas to be inspected, and the amount of allowable damage different areas of the blade can sustain before the blade is replaced.","Alignment mark(s)  can be positioned to indicate all or a portion of the leading edge, trailing edge, tip, root, and\/or other portions of a blade that is sufficient to align template  for visual inspection of the blade. Further, more than one damage limit mark  and\/or alignment mark  can be included on template . Different combinations of damage limit mark(s)  and alignment marks  can be included on the same template  so that the template  can be used to inspect different blades having different profiles and damage tolerances. Separate templates for each blade configuration are typically utilized, however.","Template  can also include other types of damage limit marks  to indicate whether damage to various other portions of the blade are within pre-specified tolerances. An example of another type of damage limit mark shown on the embodiment of template  in  is tip chamfer mark , which extends upward at an angle from alignment mark  to tip  of template . In the example shown, tip chamfer mark  extends beyond damage limit mark  at the tip  of template , however, the length, shape, and angle of tip chamfer mark  between alignment mark  and tip  can vary, depending on the shape of the blade, and the amount of allowable damage that can be sustained at the tip of the blade before the blade must be replaced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIGS. 1B and 1C","b":["100","112","114","112","100","112","116","102","112","102","104"]},"Alignment guide  can be fastened to face plate  using any suitable attachment means, such as adhesive or other type of bonding, mechanical fasteners, or co-formed in a unitary construction with face plate . In the embodiment shown, alignment guide  is a rectangularly-shaped portion of material having a first side  aligned with a portion of an outer edge  of face plate . A top portion  of alignment guide  is aligned with a portion of tip  of face place . Raised side portion  of alignment guide  is aligned with a portion of alignment mark . Notably, alignment guide  is an optional feature of template  and other embodiments of alignment guide  can have other suitable shapes and be positioned at other suitable locations on template .","In one embodiment, face plate  is fabricated with clear mylar that is 0.007 inch thick, and alignment guide  is fabricated with a polycarbon material that is 0.06 inch thick. Alignment mark , damage limit mark , and tip chamfer mark  are printed on template  using a lithographic printing process, or any other suitable marking process. The position of damage limit mark  is derived from maintenance manual data that provides dimensions of allowable blend areas for a particular type of blade.","Template  can also include one or more blend guides  that allow a user to make blend marks around damaged areas to indicate the maximum amount of blade that may be removed without exceeding the maximum damage limit mark  during the blending process. Maintenance personnel can use the blend marks as limits of the area of material that can be removed from blade  to smooth sharp, jagged edges of the damaged areas, thereby relieving stress points on the blade and improving the aerodynamic efficiency of the blade.","The embodiment of the template  shown includes three circular blend guides . One or more of blend guides  can have a different radius of curvature than the others. The smallest blend guide  can be sized according to the minimum allowable blend radius. Blend guides  can be formed by forming openings in template . Template  can, however, include blend guides that are formed using any suitable method and have different shapes and sizes than shown in the embodiment of template  in . Additionally, a blend guide  formed as an opening (indicated by crosshatching) in at least a portion of the area between alignment mark  and damage limit mark  can be included in template , as shown in . A user can place template  over the blade to mark a boundary around the damaged area in the space allotted by opening . The user can then use an appropriately sized blend guide  to mark a blend area on the blade, as desired or required.","In some embodiments, template  can include one or more sets of template markings , , (collectively referred to with reference number ) around circular blend guides . Markings  can be configured to approximately indicate whether a blend mark around a damaged area on the blade will be within a pre-specified tolerance, such as damage limit mark . Referring to ,  shows sets of arrows indicating distances a, b, c between alignment mark  and damage limit mark  near the bottom, middle, and top, respectively, of template . Markings , , correspond to distances a, b, c. Markings  shown around the opening of blend guides  can be used to align template  with an edge of the blade when a particular blend guide  is positioned over a damaged area. Dashed lines are shown in the openings between markings , or for convenience in  to indicate alignment with an edge of the blade. The dashed lines would otherwise typically not appear in the openings. The user can determine whether to align template  using markings , , or based on the position of the damaged area. For example, mark can be used for damage to the lower portion of the blade, while marks and can be used for damage near the middle and upper portions, respectively, of the blade. In some embodiments, portions of damage limit mark , such as the top, middle, and bottom of damage limit mark , can be color-coded. Marks  can be color-coded to correspond to the portion of damage limit mark  with which the marks  are associated.","Referring again to , one or more measuring scales ,  can be included on template  to allow a user to measure a damaged area of the blade. Measuring scale  is shown as two linear scales orthogonal to one another. Such a configuration allows the user to determine the height and width of the damaged area. Measuring scale  is shown as a series of curved (circular) marks of different sizes that can be overlaid over the blade to determine the diameter of the damaged area. Other suitably shaped and sized measuring scales can be included on template in addition to or instead of measuring scales , . Although linear measuring scales  are shown along a straight edge of template , measuring scales ,  can be positioned at any suitable location on template . Note that markings that indicate the units of measurement of measuring scale(s) ,  can also be included on template .","Some embodiments of template  can further include magnifying portion  that can be used to view at least a portion of the blade being inspected in more detail. Magnifying portion  can be any suitable size, shape, and magnifying power, and can also be configured to be removed from and coupled to template . For example, magnifying portion  can be fabricated with materials that allow a rim around magnifying portion  to snap into and out of template . One of blend guides  can be used to retain magnifying portion  in template , although another opening, sleeve, or other suitable structure can be provided in template  for this purpose. Magnifying portion  can also be configured with the same or smaller thickness as template  to prevent magnifying portion  from causing a bump in template  when template  is overlaid on the blade. Additionally, a tether (not shown) can be coupled between magnifying portion  and template  to prevent magnifying portion  from being dropped or otherwise completely separated\/lost from template .","Further, a lighting device (not shown), such as a light emitting diode or other suitable lighting device, can be included in template  to help illuminate the damaged area during inspection. A power source such as a battery or other suitable power source can be coupled to provide power to the lighting device. An on\/off switch can be mounted on or at least partially embedded in template  and coupled between the power source and the lighting device to allow the user to control operation of the light. In some embodiments, the lighting device can be configured around the rim of magnifying portion  or other suitable location to illuminate at least a portion of the damaged area as magnifying portion  is positioned adjacent the damaged area.","In some embodiments, template  is configured to substantially correspond to the size and shape of the entire blade to be inspected. In other embodiments, template  is configured to correspond to only a portion of the blade to be inspected, such as the leading edge, a portion of the leading edge, the tip, a portion of the tip, the trailing edge, a portion of the trailing edge, or the periphery of the blade.","In one method of inspection, template  is slid along a side of the blade until alignment guide  contacts the edge of the blade. The tip  of template  is aligned with the tip of the blade, and the damage is assessed in relation to damage limit mark  and tip chamfer mark . If the damaged area is within damage limit mark , the damaged area is marked for blending using the appropriate size blend guide .","Face plate  is typically fabricated with a flexible material that allows face plate  to adapt to the contours of the blade during inspection. The material used for face plate  is also typically transparent to allow viewing of damage to the blade when template  is overlaid on the blade. Alignment guide  can be fabricated using the same material as face plate , or any other suitable material. Typically, the material used for alignment guide  does not compress or otherwise change shape when abutted against the edge of the blade. The material used for alignment guide  can, but is not required to be transparent. Alternatively, template  may be fabricated with rigid material that is formed to similar contours of the blade(s) to be inspected.","Referring now to , a partial side cross-sectional view of an embodiment of an axial flow jet aircraft engine  is shown as an example of the type of device in which blades are installed and inspected on a routine basis. Air flow F enters jet engine  through intake . Fan section  is located at the very front of engine  and comprises a plurality of rotating fan blades  that push airflow F into bypass section  and compressor section . Compressor section  is comprised of a plurality of rotating rotor blades  and stationery stator blades .","Rotor blades  compress airflow F into combustion chamber  and force airflow F rearward while continuing the direction of airflow F parallel to centerline axis  of engine . The action of rotor blades  increases air compression at each stage and accelerates airflow F rearward. By virtue of this increased velocity, energy is transferred from compressor section  to airflow F in the form of velocity energy. Thus, the purpose of compressor section  is to take in ambient airflow F, increase the speed and pressure, and discharge airflow F into combustion chamber .","Fuel is mixed with airflow F in combustion chamber  and ignited, thereby adding energy to airflow F, resulting in an increased pressure and temperature of airflow F. Pressure within combustion chamber  forces airflow F into turbine section , which is comprised of a plurality of turbine blades . Turbine section  removes some energy from airflow F to power compressor section  and fan section . Airflow F then passes into exhaust chamber  where it combines with the flow from bypass section . An afterburner  can provide additional fuel which is ignited to increase the energy of airflow F. Airflow F is then expelled from engine  through nozzle  as an exhaust flow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["250","206","210","220","200","206","210","220","200","210","220","252","250","210","220"]},"Engine  can be enclosed in a nacelle mounted externally on an aircraft, or incorporated internally in the aircraft. Objects that can cause damage to blades throughout each section of engine  are typically ingested via intake  when engine  is operating on the ground and in flight. Access ports are typically located near the rotating blade assemblies to allow inspectors to visually inspect the blades using optical or video borescopes while the engine  is still mounted in the aircraft. Often, damage to blades at the opening of intake  indicates whether other blades in the engine may be damaged. Engine removal and disassembly is usually required for detailed inspection of blades other than first stage fan blades.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["300","200","100","300","302","300","300","250","300","306","308","310","300","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["100","300","102","306","300","112","100","306","300","104","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3B"],"b":["100","300","124","320","300","320","104","124","306","104","320","100","300","320","104","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["124","100","300","130","124","306","300","130","104","100","130","300"],"i":["b ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 3E","b":["138","100","300","138"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["400","306","308","312","300","102","104","110","112","124","100","400","402","406"]},"When template  is sized to substantially match the size of blade , an alignment mark for trailing edge  of blade  is typically not required.

Damage limit marks  and tip chamfer marks  are included on either side of alignment mark . One or more blend guides  can also be included on template .","Damage limit marks  and tip chamfer marks  on both sides of alignment mark  allow blade  to be inspected from either side of blade .

In the embodiment shown, sleeve  is portion of material attached or formed on the reverse side of template  along at least a portion of tip  and adjacent alignment edge  of template . Sleeve  is typically most useful to retain template  on blades with tips that are not tapered toward the edge to be inspected, and where adequate clearance is available to slip sleeve  over the tip of the blade.","Another example of a method for retaining blade inspections templates on the blade to be inspected includes the use of magnets attached to or embedded in the template.
