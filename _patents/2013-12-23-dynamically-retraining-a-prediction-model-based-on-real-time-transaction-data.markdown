title: Dynamically retraining a prediction model based on real time transaction data
abstract: Various embodiments of systems and methods to dynamically retrain prediction models based on real time transaction data are described herein. In one aspect, real time application data and status data associated with an entity are obtained. The obtained application data is inputted to a prediction model to produce an assessment of a risk. The obtained status data with the assessed risk are compared. When the obtained payment status data does not match the determined risk, the prediction model is retrained.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Prediction models are applied to predict future trends or behavior patterns (e.g., a risk of default) from given input data. Typically, a prediction model is trained with transaction data associated with entities for achieving better operational efficiencies, reducing fraudulent transactions and the like. Often, the amount of transactional data is significantly large (e.g., in terabytes and gigabytes) and changes frequently (e.g., daily). Therefore, the process of training the prediction model could be time consuming, and it may be difficult to regularly check the accuracy of the prediction model. Further, training the prediction model periodically (e.g., monthly) may not be accurate since the transaction data used to train the prediction model may become old (e.g., by a month) and relying on old transaction data might be risky.","Embodiments of techniques to dynamically retrain a prediction model based on real time transaction data are described herein. Prediction models are mathematical models that establish co-relations between parameters that affect an outcome. According to various embodiments, the prediction models are built by analyzing transaction data (e.g., historical transaction data) and the relationships between the influencing parameters and the output is derived to predict future trends or behavior patterns. Further, the transaction data (e.g., input data) can be referred as training data associated with entities. An entity can be an individual, a group of people, a company, group of companies, etc. Further, the prediction model can then be used to predict the output for any new set of influencing parameters (e.g., the parameters for a new customer).","Initially, the prediction model is trained using training data (e.g., historical transaction data) associated with the entities. Training the prediction model involves scrutinizing the historical transaction data and establishing a relationship between the influencing parameters and the output. In one exemplary embodiment, transaction data includes application data consisting of parameters influencing a risk and status data defining status of deferral of payment. Subsequently, in one embodiment, when real time transaction data (e.g., application data and status data) associated with an entity is received, the risk outcome as outputted by the prediction model corresponding to the received application data is checked. Further, when the risk outcome as output by the prediction model does not match with the received payment status data, the prediction model is dynamically retrained using the received real time transaction data. The real time transaction data can be a new transaction data or a change in the existing transaction data associated with the entity. In other words, when the relationship between the influencing parameters and the output does not match due to a change in a pattern of the transactional data, then the prediction model is retrained. Retraining can be defined as re-establishing the relationship between the influencing parameters and the output to account for the new pattern of changed transaction data.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

The real time transaction data and\/or the historical transaction data is used to train and\/or retrain the prediction model . In one exemplary embodiment, the data repository  is an in-memory computer system. The transaction data includes application data and status data of different entities involved in business transactions. For example, the application data may include risk related parameters such as, but not limited to, income level, number of existing loans, number of early payoffs done by an entity, payment plan change, skip of payments pertaining to existing loan, extension of a loan, and age of an entity. The status data may define whether an entity has defaulted loan.","Initially, the prediction model  may be trained with the historical transaction data stored in the data repository . Future behavior patterns can be predicted by the prediction model  for various purposes such as launch a new product\/service on the market, understanding and anticipating trends of the market, better operational efficiencies, reducing operational risks and fraudulent transactions, predicting a risk of default, etc.","The transaction data associated with the entities can change over time. Therefore, it is advantageous to retrain the prediction model using real time transaction data. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the model retraining module  retrains the prediction model  based on the real time transaction data to keep the prediction model  updated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"Process  can be implemented in other models such as, but not limited to, prediction model built using classification tree, regression model, economic model, econometric model, forecasting model, decision support model, estimation model and projection model.

In one embodiment, the application data includes a number of parameters or factors affecting a risk as shown in Table 1:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Input node","Parameter","Values"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["X1\u2002","Income level","High\/medium income = 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Low income = 0"]},{"entry":["X2\u2002","Existing loans","No existing loans = 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Greater than or equal to 1 = 0"]},{"entry":["X3\u2002","Early payoff","Yes = 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"No = 0"]},{"entry":["X4\u2002","Payment plan change","Yes = 0"]},{"entry":[{},{},"No = 1"]},{"entry":["X5\u2002","Extension of a payment","Yes = 0"]},{"entry":[{},{},"No = 1"]},{"entry":["X6\u2002","Renewal of loan","Yes = 0"]},{"entry":[{},{},"No = 1"]},{"entry":["X7\u2002","Age of a customer","Less than 40 = 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"More than 40 = 0"]},{"entry":["X8\u2002","Type of occupation","Salary = 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Business = 0"]},{"entry":["X9\u2002","Number of months for term","Less than 12 = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"end of current active loans","More than 12 = 0"]},{"entry":["X10","Deferral of payments for","Yes = 0"]},{"entry":[{},"existing loans","No = 1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In one embodiment, the parameters are interdependent. For example, the income level and the age of the customer can be interdependent as the income level may increase with the age. Further, the status data defines any payment deferral or overdue or delinquency of a loan.","At , the obtained application data is inputted to a prediction model to produce an assessment of a risk. In one embodiment, obtained application data is transformed into binary for simplicity. For example, an entity having a high or medium income is given value \u201c1\u201d and an entity having a low income is given value \u201c0\u201d. Similarly binary values are assigned to each parameter as specified in Table 1. Further, the application data (e.g., parameters) are inputted to the prediction model.","Exemplary prediction model  built using ANN is depicted in . The ANN is used to solve a class of problems that involve a plurality of input parameters and interdependency between them. The ANN consists of multiple layers. A first layer is an input layer (e.g., ) and a last layer is an output layer (e.g., ). In between the first layer and the last layer, there can be one or more hidden layers. One hidden layer , for instance, is depicted in . The number of hidden layers required depends on the complexity of the problem solved using ANN, and also on the nature of the output. The number of nodes in a hidden layer is equal to or more than the arithmetic mean of the number of nodes on either side of the layer. In , the number of hidden nodes is equal to or more than (10+2)\/2=6 (e.g., XH to XH).","The application data (e.g., parameters depicted in Table 1) are inputted to the prediction model  through input nodes (e.g., X to X). The connections between the input nodes (e.g., X to X) to hidden nodes (e.g., XH to XH) of hidden layer are referred as hidden nodes weights \u201cWH\u201d. Further, the connections between the hidden nodes (e.g., XH to XH) and output nodes (e.g., XO and XO) of the output layer are referred as output node weights \u201cWO\u201d. Initially, while training the prediction model, the \u201cWH\u201d and \u201cWO\u201d are calculated based on the transaction data (e.g., historical transaction data including application data and loan default data of customers). In one exemplary embodiment, the hidden nodes (e.g., XH to XH) and the output nodes (XO and XO) are computed using below Equations (1A), (1B), (2A) and (2B) (e.g., sigmoid function). Further, the values of \u201cWH\u201d and \u201cWO\u201d may be adjusted by a trial and error method till the values of the output nodes (e.g., XO and XO) match with the historical transaction data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sum","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"hidden"}},{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["Input","node","WH"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","*"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"A"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["Hidden","node"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mo":"(","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"e","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mn":"1"},{"mi":"sum","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"hidden"}}],"mo":"*"}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"B"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sum","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"output"}},{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["Hidden","node","WO"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","*"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"A"}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["Output","node"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mo":"(","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"e","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mn":"1"},{"mi":"sum","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"output"}}],"mo":"*"}}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","mi":"B"}}}]}]}}}},"For example, calculating the hidden nodes (e.g., XH to XH) and the output nodes (e.g., XO and XO) using the Equations (1A), (1B), (2A) and (2B) are depicted in Tables 2-6.

These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components may be implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions. The term \u201ccomputer readable storage medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media that stores one or more sets of instructions. The term \u201ccomputer readable storage medium\u201d should be taken to include any physical article that is capable of undergoing a set of physical changes to physically store, encode, or otherwise carry a set of instructions for execution by a computer system which causes the computer system to perform any of the methods or process steps described, represented, or illustrated herein. A computer readable storage medium may be a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. Examples of a non-transitory computer readable storage media include, but are not limited to: magnetic media, such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROMs, DVDs and holographic devices; magneto-optical media; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and execute, such as application-specific integrated circuits (\u201cASICs\u201d), programmable logic devices (\u201cPLDs\u201d) and ROM and RAM devices. Examples of computer readable instructions include machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher-level code that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example, an embodiment may be implemented using Java, C++, or other object-oriented programming language and development tools. Another embodiment may be implemented in hard-wired circuitry in place of, or in combination with machine readable software instructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","505","555","505","500","540","555","510","515","510","515","515","510","515","515","505","515","500","525","530","500","525","530","500","535","500","550","550","500","545","500","520","560","560","560","550","560"]},"A data source is an information resource.
