title: Gas permeable cell culture device and method of use
abstract: Gas permeable devices and methods are disclosed that provide highly efficient cell culture. Gas compartments, made up at least in part of gas permeable material, are dispersed within the culture device in locations that allow cells to remain within a fixed distance from a gas transmission location as the device scales in the horizontal direction. Gas permeable walls of the gas compartment(s) allow gas exchange with the ambient gas. Such an arrangement provides many advantages including the ability to eliminate the need for a gas-liquid interface, allow cell culture to proceed in the static mode (i.e. absent the need for media or gas to be pumped through the device), allow the scale of the device to increase in both the horizontal direction and vertical direction, reduce the rate of media evaporation, allow uncomplicated and low cost device fabrication, and provide the capacity for reduced feeding frequency.

No. 10\/961,814, U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/952,848, U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/952,856 as well as each document or reference cited in each of the applications, including during the prosecution of each co-pending patent application and each of the PCT and foreign applications or patents corresponding to and\/or claiming priority from any of these applications and patents, and each of the documents cited or referenced in each of the application cited documents, are hereby expressly incorporated herein.","For scale up of adherent cell culture, multiple shelf flasks such as the Nunc Cell Factory and Corning\u00ae Cell Stack are commonly used. However, to provide oxygen to the cells during culture, these devices require each shelf to have gas reside above the medium. This need for gas to be present in the device makes the device large and awkward to handle during scale up, wasting laboratory space and requiring the use of special equipment during media exchange. The net result is a complicated and costly process as cultures increase in size. The need for a gas-liquid interface to oxygenate the culture is the root cause of these inefficiencies.","Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/961,814 (Wilson et al.) describes multiple shelf devices that eliminates the need for gas to reside above each shelf. In one embodiment, a series of shelf-like scaffolds for cells to reside upon are arranged one above the other and at least a portion of the outer wall(s) of the device is gas permeable. The gas permeable outer wall(s) is oriented perpendicular to the scaffolds. Gas transmission through the gas permeable outer walls(s) allows cells to be oxygenated in the absence of a gas-liquid interface. The culture can proceed without need to perfuse media or gas (i.e. operates in a static mode), allowing a simple cell production method. However, as the device gets wider, the distance a cell can get from the oxygen source increases. At some point, a cell can get too far from the oxygen source and the device scalability in the horizontal direction becomes limited. Thus, although the device is more compact than traditional devices, its scalability in the horizontal direction is limited.","Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/952,848 (Wilson) also describes devices that eliminate the need for gas to reside above each shelf. In various embodiments, a series of cell compartments are arranged one above the other. The bottom of each cell compartment is gas permeable. In use, cells can reside upon the gas permeable surfaces, which act to function as gas permeable scaffolds. This allows each cell to be a uniform distance from the ambient oxygen source as the devices scales horizontally and vertically. However, this type of device can be more difficult and expensive to manufacture than the devices described in co-pending '814, elevating its cost to the end user. Furthermore, since more gas permeable surface area is present, evaporation of media in the device can occur at a higher rate than the traditional multiple shelf flask and the devices of co-pending '814. Configurations are disclosed that minimize this problem, but they add features that increase cost.","Although co-pending '848 and co-pending '814 provide a more space efficient geometry than traditional multiple shelf flasks, there are cell culture applications for which neither co-pending '848 nor co-pending '814 are ideal. As just one example, stem cells are often cultured at low surface density so that cells do not get too close to each other in order to prevent unwanted differentiation. As the number of cells that the culture is intended to generate increases, the culture device needs to provide a larger amount of surface area to keep the cells at low surface density. Therefore, a device that allows scale up in the vertical and horizontal direction is useful. To make the most efficient use of space, it should function in the absence a gas-liquid interface and not require equipment to pump media or gas through it. Although co-pending '848 provides those attributes, the extra cost to place cells a uniform distance from ambient gas is not warranted since few cells are present for each square centimeter of area that cells reside upon (i.e. low oxygen demand). The lower cost devices of co-pending '814 have limited scalability in the horizontal direction. Thus, a new device configuration is needed that is inexpensive to manufacture, easy to use, eliminates the need for a gas-liquid interface, does not require perfusion, and fills the void between co-pending '848 and co-pending '814. Such a device would cost reduce and simplify the cell manufacturing process for many important cell culture applications such as stem cell culture.","Accordingly, an improved gas permeable device is disclosed that is easy to manufacture, can function in the absence of a gas-liquid interface, does not require equipment to pump media or gas through it, and allows virtually unlimited scalability in the horizontal and vertical direction.","The invention described herein allows highly efficient cell culture. Gas compartments, comprised at least in part of gas permeable material, are dispersed within the culture device in locations that allow cells to remain within a fixed distance from a gas transmission location as the device scales in the horizontal direction. Gas permeable walls of the gas compartment(s) allow gas exchange with the ambient gas. Such an arrangement provides many advantages including the ability to eliminate the need for a gas-liquid interface, allow cell culture to proceed in the static mode (i.e. absent the need for media or gas to be pumped through the device), allow the scale of the device to increase in both the horizontal direction and vertical direction, reduce the rate of media evaporation, allow uncomplicated and low cost device fabrication, and provide the capacity for reduced feeding frequency.","In one embodiment, a gas permeable cell culture device include scaffolds arranged one above the other with a space separating them to form cell compartments. A manifold connects an access port to the cell compartments. At least one gas permeable gas compartment is in contact with the cell compartments, thereby enhancing gas transmission between cell compartments and ambient gas.","In another embodiment, the gas compartment includes walls that are oriented perpendicular to the scaffolds.","In another embodiment, the gas compartment opening to ambient gas is located on the bottom of the gas permeable device.","In another embodiment, the gas compartment opening to ambient gas is located on the top of the device.","In another embodiment, the gas compartment opening to ambient gas is located on the side wall of the device.","In another embodiment, the gas compartment opening to ambient gas is located on the top and\/or bottom and side wall of the device.","In another embodiment, the gas compartment opening to ambient gas is traverses the entire gas permeable device with a gas opening on opposing walls of the gas permeable device.","In another embodiment, the gas compartment includes a gas compartment support structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["10","18","20","21","19","24","18","10","24","22","22","22","24","18","24","10","24"],"sub":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["24","32","34","32","28","28","28","30","30","28","30","28","18","24","30","30","10","34","30","28","28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"],"b":["24","28","30","5","28","6","30","6","5","30","24","28","10","22","30","24","30"]},"Controlling the area where cells can deposit during inoculation is a design consideration. When the device is filled with inoculum, each cell gravitates to the area of the device directly below it. Preferably the design allows at least 90%, and more preferably 95%, of cells to gravitate to scaffolds in a uniform pattern of distribution. Thus, manifold  should occupy the smallest volume of space possible while still facilitating easy delivery and removal of media. Scaffolds  may or may not make liquid tight contact with side wall(s)  and rear side wall . A gap between scaffolds  and adjacent walls may exist if it is easier to fabricate the device in that manner or if it is determined that a greater cross-section for movement of solutes from cell compartment to cell compartment is needed than can be provided by the manifold(s). If it is determined that a gap will exist, be aware that cells gravitating from inoculum will fall through the gap to the lowest scaffold (or bottom) and seed at a surface density that is higher than other areas of the scaffolds. Note that the same physical relationship between the scaffolds and the exterior walls holds for the scaffolds and the gas compartment walls. Thus, the gap includes the distance between scaffolds and adjacent walls. The gap area and manifold area contribute to the quantity of cells that do not seed uniformly on scaffolds. In a preferred embodiment, the distance between scaffolds and exterior walls, except at the manifold location, is about 0.2 inch or less.","The presence of gas compartment  acts to reduce the distance a cell resides from a gas transmission location. To help explain this concept and referring again to , consider side walls  and gas compartment walls  as gas permeable. The presence of gas compartment  allows cell A to reside at a shorter distance to an area of the device where gas transmission occurs than it would in the absence of gas compartment .","The purpose of the gas compartment(s) is to allow ambient gas (typically incubator gas) to reside within the gas compartment(s) of the novel device. The movement of ambient gas is driven by a concentration difference that develops during culture between the contents of the cell compartments and the ambient gas. For example, during culture a concentration gradient forms across the gas permeable material causing gas (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) to be transmitted from the side of the gas permeable material that exhibits the highest concentration to the side that exhibits the lowest. For example, typically a gradient of oxygen forms such that oxygen is transmitted from a standard cell culture incubator into the cell compartments of the novel device.","Gas compartments are most preferably structured to allow ambient gas to freely enter gas compartments, absent forced flow by ancillary apparatus such as pumps. By so structuring the gas compartments, inlet and outlet ports for directing forced gas flow are not needed. Gas moves rapidly during convection and the distance between the closest opposing walls of the gas compartment need only be great enough such that gas can move at a greater rate than the culture demands it. In general, the greater the depth of the gas compartment from the outer surface of the device, the wider the gas compartment should be. Too narrow a cross-section could restrict air flow. Making the width small generally serves the purpose of making the device more compact in size. However, the space savings already provided by eliminating the need for a gas-liquid interface are substantial. Thus, a cross-sectional width of the opening to the gas compartment is about 0.1 inches or greater is preferred. Also, the shape of the opening preferably remains constant throughout the depth of the gas compartment. For example, for a rectangular opening with a width of 0.1 inch, the gas compartment walls would remain generally parallel and at a distance of about 0.1 inch throughout the gas compartment. Since the volume of space displaced by the gas compartments is relatively small in comparison to the volume of the gas permeable device, greater distances do not cause much lost space. Thus, depending on the width and height of the device, and the number of gas compartments employed, a cross-sectional width of the opening to the gas compartment of up to 1 inch could effectively allow gas transmission without much impact on the footprint of the device.","There are many possible options for the geometry and the material that comprise the gas compartments. The length, width, depth, gas transmission rate, and all other aspects of the gas compartment can be altered to meet the needs of a given cell culture application. Gas permeable materials that are liquid impermeable are preferred, such as dimethyl silicone. However, co-pending '856 describes how liquid permeable materials can be used.","The location and number of gas compartments can be altered to control the distance at which cells can reside from a gas transmission location. As the gas permeable device scales to a larger size in the horizontal direction, more and more gas compartments can be added.  shows a cross-sectional view of a gas permeable device , modified to reduce the maximum distance at which cells, such as cell B and cell C, can reside from a gas transmission area. In this depiction, two gas compartments  descend into gas permeable device . In the case where side walls  and gas compartment walls  are gas permeable, it can be seen how gas compartments  allow cells B and C to be closer to gas transmission areas than they would in the absence of gas compartments . Thus, the ability to maintain acceptable oxygen tension in the culture media as the device scales horizontally is achieved by the use of gas compartments and gas permeable walls that allow cells to be in proximity of ambient gas.","Gas compartments need not descend into cell compartments to allow cells to be closer to gas compartment walls. Any arrangement that diminishes the distance at which a cell resides from a gas permeable wall(s) can exist. For example, gas compartments can ascend into, traverse through, and\/or move completely through the gas permeable cell culture device. Examples are shown in , , , and , where gas compartments , gas permeable wall(s)  of gas compartments , device side walls , scaffolds , and\/or cell compartments  can be seen in relation to each other. In all cases, any exterior walls of the gas permeable device can be gas permeable as an option, but at least a portion of the gas compartment must be gas permeable. How to determine when to rely on gas permeable exterior device walls, such as side walls, will be described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["12","24","12","24","19","22","24","30","30","28","24","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["12","24","24","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["12","24","12","18","19","22","24","30","30","28"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["12","24","12"]},"Gas compartments need not be constrained to the body of the device to be effective.  shows a perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.

In this configuration, gas compartments  act to expand the perimeter of gas permeable device  and gas permeable walls  act to greatly improve gas transmission into and out of gas permeable device . Skilled artisans will recognize that the openings to gas compartment  need not be entirely through the top and bottom to greatly increase the surface area for gas transmission. The openings can be through the top and\/or bottom and side wall.","Although gas compartments can be any size and shape, it is preferable for the gas compartment structure to be created with the intent of providing the most uniform culture environment in each cell compartment that is possible. The degree to which uniform culture conditions can be established depends upon where the gas compartment(s) are located within the gas permeable culture device. To improve uniformity, a design objective is to create structure that controls the farthest distance that a cell can reside from a gas compartment wall. Preferably, making the gas permeable device a shape that allows gas compartments to be located in a symmetrical pattern relative to the device centerline is one way to provide uniform conditions in the cell culture compartments.  shows an illustrative embodiment of the present invention structured accordingly. It is a cross-sectional view showing a preferred method of locating gas compartments in the absence of gas permeable walls at the device perimeter. In this depiction, two gas compartments  ascend into gas permeable cell culture device . Scaffolds  are uniformly spaced apart and oriented one above the other. To demonstrate that external walls  need not be gas permeable for proper function, consider the case where they are not gas permeable in this depiction. Consider gas compartment walls  of gas compartments  as gas permeable along their entire height and located such that the maximum distance D that a cell can reside from them is fixed throughout the cross-section. In this manner, so long as cells are distributed on the scaffolds uniformly, the oxygen transmission to cells residing at the farthest point D from the gas compartment walls  is roughly equivalent throughout the device. The actual distance D can vary depending on the anticipated oxygen demand of the culture. For example, when the gas permeability of walls forming the gas compartments is uniform, the distance D for cultures with high oxygen demand like hepatocytes would be less than for cultures with low oxygen demand like stem cells maintained at low surface density. The gas compartment is preferably structured so that its walls are generally perpendicular to the scaffolds. In that manner, the volume of medium residing in each cell compartment can be generally equal, cell distribution onto scaffolds during inoculum is uniform, and cells residing in each cell compartment are at a similar physical distance from the gas compartment walls. Preferably, designing the gas permeable walls of the gas compartment is done in a manner that provides similar gas transmission capacity to each cell compartment. Thus, when constructing the walls of the gas compartment(s), the area that is gas permeable should be of uniform material type, thickness, and surface area relative to each cell compartment and to every other gas compartment.","Not all walls of the gas compartment need to be gas permeable to create substantially uniform gas transmission across a horizontal cross-section of the gas permeable device. Referring again to , consider the case where walls  are gas permeable. If wall A and wall B of gas compartment  are not gas permeable, while walls C are gas permeable, a cell residing at any given location on scaffold  as viewed in the horizontal cross-section can remain within distance D of a gas transmission location.","Deviating from the preferred relationships between scaffolds and gas compartments is optional, however, when culture demands for gas exchange will not overcome the capacity of the gas compartments to satisfy the gas transmission requirements and when fabrication cost can be reduced by a different structure for the gas compartments. Those skilled in the art will recognize there are many possible configurations that will meet the basic objective of allowing more scalability in the horizontal direction by using gas compartments to improve gas transmission to the cell compartments.","Another consideration for how to physically orient and arrange the gas compartment(s) is the impact the gas compartments can have upon the flow of fluid during medium delivery and removal from the device. Preferably, the gas compartment(s) will be arranged in a manner that facilitates easy fluid flow. The gas compartment(s) should preferably not obstruct medium flow, trap gas in the device, or create highly turbulent flow. The access port location(s) can help overcome these potential undesirable flow characteristics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6C","FIG. 6A"],"b":["37","38","36","35","18","24","24","24","28","30","36","35","30","26","25","30","36","35","54","36","24"]},"Materials used to fabricate the gas permeable devices of this invention can be any of those previously used, or described for use, in cell culture devices and particularly those described in co-pending '814 and '848. Although liquid permeable, gas permeable material can be used as described in co-pending '856, the preferred embodiments utilize liquid impermeable, gas permeable materials. In the preferred embodiment, the device is disposable and materials are optically clear, non cytotoxic, and can be fabricated by injection molding. Various desirable characteristics for scaffolds and gas permeable materials have been previously described in the patents expressly incorporated herein. In addition to the previously described structure for microscopic assessment, gas compartments that descend in the gas permeable device can be structured with an opening that is wide enough to allow a light to shine into the gas compartment in order to facilitate inverted microscopy of the lowest scaffold.","In addition to a much more efficient use of space obtained by eliminating the need for a gas-liquid interface above each scaffold while allowing scalability in the horizontal and vertical direction, the ability to easily fabricate the device(s) of this invention allows further cost reduction in the cell culture process.
