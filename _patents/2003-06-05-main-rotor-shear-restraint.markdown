{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor. This invention was invented under contract number N00019-96-C-0128 with Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.","The present invention relates to a shear restraint on a main rotor. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to a helicopter flex beam main rotor shear restraint.","A main rotor on a helicopter is the main system of rotating airfoils of a helicopter. The main rotor is considered to be an important part of the helicopter. It provides the lift that allows the helicopter to fly, as well as the control that allows the helicopter to move laterally, make turns and change altitude. The main rotor of a helicopter must be able to adjust the angle of the rotor blades in order to perform these various maneuvers.","The main rotor typically has a yoke, which can be defined, but without limitation, as a flexure that retains the helicopter blades of the main rotor. The rotating controls adjust the angle of the rotor blades with each revolution of the rotor. Bearings within the main rotor system allow for movement of the main rotor components while reacting the loads. Certain bearings, such as the shear restraint bearing, accommodate the blade feathering (blade feathering can be defined, but without limitation, as the action of changing a blade angle of a controllable pitch propeller) and flapping motions, and react the blade loads.","In a typical helicopter, main rotor self-lubricated shear restraint bearings become loose due to bearing wear. This can create a play in the bearings and reduce the effectiveness of the lead-lag damper. A lead-lag damper is needed in flex beam rotors in order to provide the necessary lead-lag damping to the rotor system. A system is needed to prevent these bearings from becoming loose due to bearing wear.","Furthermore, standard yokes typically require a hole in the yoke. Having a hole makes the design of the yoke more complicated, as well as potentially creating weak spots in the yoke. A system is needed that eliminates the need for a hole in the yoke.","Thus, there is a need in the art to provide a main rotor shear restraint that incorporates the listed benefits without the limitations inherent in present methods. For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a main rotor shear restraint.","The instant invention is directed to a main rotor shear restraint that satisfies the needs enumerated above and below.","The present invention is directed to a main rotor shear restraint that includes two spherical ball segments, two corresponding bearing outer races, and a spring system for loading the bearing outer races against the two spherical ball segments.","It is an object of the invention to provide a main rotor shear restraint that prevents bearings from becoming loose due to bearing wear.","It is an object of the invention to provide a main rotor shear restraint that accommodates dynamic feathering motions, hub misalignments, and steady and dynamic loads.","It is an object of the invention to provide a main rotor shear restraint that allows a yoke without a hole to be used in a helicopter.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in ,  and . As seen in , the main rotor shear restraint  for a helicopter includes two (2) spherical or hemispherical segments , two (2) bearing outer races , and a spring system . Typically a helicopter includes a yoke  that communicates with the helicopter rotors. The yoke  may be a flex beam type yoke; however, the present invention can be used with any type of yoke . The yoke  may have two sides, a first yoke side  and a second yoke side . Each spherical or separate solid hemispherical segment  is fixed to a side of the yoke and has a corresponding bearing outer race . For instance, as seen in , a first spherical segment  may be fixed to the first yoke side , while a second spherical segment  may be fixed to the second yoke side . The spring system  is for loading each bearing outer race  against its corresponding spherical segment .","In the discussion of the present invention, the invention will be discussed in a helicopter environment; however, this invention can be utilized for other vehicles or machinery that utilize a main rotor.","In the preferred embodiment, the spherical segment  can be a segment of a ball. The type of spherical or ball segment that can be used in this invention is, but without limitation, a hardened ball segment that can run in spherical seats called races. As seen in , the spherical segment  may include a flattened portion  and a spherical portion . The flattened portion  is substantially level and even, and has no marked projections or depressions. Accordingly, the flattened portion  has an appearance similar to a typical tabletop. The spherical portion  is substantially rounded and circular or shaped like a segment of a solid geometric figure generated by the revolution of a semicircle about its diameter. Accordingly, the spherical portion  has an appearance similar to a dome or a spherical vault. In the preferred embodiment, the flattened portion  is apositioned or disposed on a side of the yoke , while the spherical portion  is apositioned to the bearing outer race . As seen in , in the preferred embodiment, both spherical centers  of each of the two spherical segments  are coincident with the center of the yoke , specifically the vertical center of the yoke. Furthermore, both spherical centers  may be coincident with each other.","The bearing outer race  can be defined, but without limitation, as a spherical seat for the spherical segment . The bearing outer race  may have a seat portion  and a spring communicating portion . As seen in , the seat portion  of the bearing outer race  is shaped to correspond to the spherical portion  of the spherical segment . The spring communicating portion  communicates with the spring system  to allow the spring system to apply pressure on the bearing outer race . The spring communicating portion  may be substantially flat, substantially concave or convex, or any shape that lends itself to effectively communicating with the spring system .","In the preferred embodiment the bearing outer race  is coated with polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon\u00ae, specifically the seat portion . The spherical segment  may be a segment of a feathering ball bearing and may also be coated with polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon\u00ae.","In other variations of the invention there may be more than two spherical segments  and corresponding bearing outer races  within the main rotor shear restraint . The spherical segments  may be manufactured from steel, metal, metal alloy, or any type of material that lends itself to a bearing or spherical shape.","The spring system  applies pressure to the bearing outer races  to prevent looseness in the spherical segments . Even as the spherical segments  or bearing outer races  wear, pressure from the spring system continues to minimize looseness. The spring system  may be two separate systems, one for each set of spherical segment  and bearing outer race  or one system that applies pressure to all the spherical segment-bearing outer race sets in the invention. The spring system  may be a mechanical spring system or an elastomeric spring system.","In one of the embodiments of the main rotor shear restraint , specifically a main rotor shear restraint  on a H-I helicopter, the spring system  with about 110,000 pounds per inch of stiffness will retain the bearing outer race .","The spherical segments  may be attached to both sides of the yoke  by any attachment method. Each spherical segment  may be independently rigidly attached or fixed to the yoke . The spherical segment  may be attached to the yoke  by any means practicable. For instance the following attachment methods or means may be used: adhesive, chemical agents, magnets, screws, bolts, nails, hooks, or any other type of attacher or attachment method or means that lends itself to attaching the spherical segment  to the yoke . In the preferred embodiment, the spherical segment  is attached to the yoke  by a shear pin  (shown by dashed lines in ). A single shear pin  may attach both spherical segments  to the yoke , or each spherical segment  may have its own corresponding shear pin .","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements. The terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.","Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims, and accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
