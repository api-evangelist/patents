A high level of LDL in the bloodstream has been linked to the formation of coronary lesions that obstruct the flow of blood and can rupture and promote thrombosis. Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, page 879 (9th Ed. 1996).","Statins inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis in humans by competitively inhibiting the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (\u201cHMG-CoA\u201d) reductase enzyme. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the conversion of HMG to mevalonate, which is the rate determining step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Decreased production of cholesterol causes an increase in the number of LDL receptors and corresponding reduction in the concentration of LDL particles in the bloodstream. Reduction in the LDL level in the bloodstream reduces the risk of coronary artery disease. J.A.M.A. 1984, 251, 351-74.","Currently available statins include lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin and atorvastatin. Lovastatin (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,231,938) and simvastatin (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,784) are administered in the lactone form. After absorption, the lactone ring is opened in the liver by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, and the active hydroxy acid is generated. Pravastatin (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,227) is administered as the sodium salt. Fluvastatin (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,073) and cerivastatin (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,006,530 and 5,177,080), also administered as the sodium salt, are entirely synthetic compounds that are in part structurally distinct from the fungal derivatives of this class that contain a hexahydronaphthalene ring. Atorvastatin and two new \u201csuperstatins,\u201d rosuvastatin and pitavastatin, are administered as calcium salts.","Rosuvastatin calcium (7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(N-methyl-N-methylsulfonylamino) pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R,5S)-dihydroxy-(E)-6-heptenoic acid) is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, developed by shionogi for the once daily oral treatment of hyperlipidaemia (Ann Rep, Shionogi, 1996; Direct communications, Shionogi, 8 Feb. 1999 & 25 Feb. 2000). It is a superstatin, which can lower LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides more effectively than first generation drugs. Rosuvastatin calcium has the following chemical formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"51.65mm","wi":"73.32mm","file":"US07396927-20080708-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Rosuvastatin calcium is marketed under the name CRESTOR for treatment of a mammal such as a human. According to the maker of CRESTOR, it is administered in a daily dose of from about 5mg to about 40 mg. For patients requiring less aggressive LDL-C reductions or who have pre-disposing factors for myopathy, the 5 mg dose is recommended, while 10 mg dose is recommended for the average patient, 20 mg dose for patients with marked hyper-cholesterolemia and aggressive lipid targets (>190 mg\/dL), and the 40 mg dose for patients who have not been responsive to lower doses. WO 03\/032995 further discloses a method of preventing dementia by administering to a patient rosuvastatin.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,440 discloses the process to produce rosuvastatin salt. The process of U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,440 starts with the methyl ester of rosuvastatin, known an (methyl-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(N-methyl-N-methylsulfonylamino) pyrimidin-5-yl]-(3R,5S)-dihydroxy-(E)-6-heptenate (methyl rosuvastatin)). The process for preparation of the intermediates disclosed in the '440 patent is incorporated herein by reference.","In the '440 patent, rosuvastatin sodium is prepared from its methyl ester according to Example 1 (6) by adding sodium hydroxide to a solution of the methyl ester in ethanol, followed inter alia by distillation, followed by addition of ether to the residue obtained from distillation. When preparing a salt of rosuvastatin, the present applicants found that diethyl ether may not be used in production; after distillation of the solvent, the present applicants obtained a viscous oil that hardly precipitates in diethyl ether.","Preparation of rosuvastatin calcium is also disclosed in WO 04\/052867,WO 04\/014872,WO 00\/49041 and WO 03\/097614.

In one particular embodiment, the hydrocarbon is toluene or chlorobenzene. The phase transfer catalyst of the reaction may be an alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or arylalkyl ammonium salt.","Another embodiment of the invention encompasses processes for producing rosuvastatin calcium salt comprising: reacting, t-butyl ester of rosuvastatin with sodium hydroxide in presence of water, a tetrabutylammonium phase transfer catalyst and an organic solvent selected from the group consisting of toluene and chlorobenzene to obtain rosuvastatin in the water; removing traces of the toluene or chlorobenzene from the water; adding calcium chloride to the water to precipitate rosuvastatin calcium; and filtering the rosuvastatin calcium salt. The process may further comprise stirring during the reaction.","Yet another embodiment of the invention encompasses processes for producing rosuvastatin calcium salt substantially free of impurities comprising the steps of: reacting a Cto Cester of rosuvastatin with a base in a two phase system of water and acetonitrile; concentrating the water phase to obtain a residue; adding a source of calcium and water to the residue to form a solution in water; and recovering rosuvastatin calcium as a precipitate. The process may further comprising stirring during the reaction. In the process, the impurities may be equal or less than about 0.3% as measured by area percentage HPLC.","In the processes of the invention, the calcium salt may contain less than or about 0.4% total impurities as measured by area percentage HPLC. In the processes of the invention, the rosuvastatin calcium salt does not have detectable levels of impurities when measured by HPLC at RRT 0.62, 1.18, 1.26, 1.60, 2.68, 3.66, 3.89, 3.93,or 4.10. In a particular embodiment, the impurities are less than about 0.01% as measured by HPLC area percentage.","Another embodiment of the invention encompasses processes for producing rosuvastatin calcium comprising: (a) preparing a solution of rosuvastatin sodium; (b) concentrating the solution to obtain a residue; c) combining the residue with water to obtain an aqueous solution; d) washing the aqueous solution with a water immiscible organic solvent; e) removing traces of the organic solvent; (f) adding a source of calcium to the solution to precipitate rosuvastatin calcium; and (g) recovering the rosuvastatin calcium salt.","Yet another embodiment of the invention encompasses rosuvastatin calcium in solid state having less than or of about 0.4% total impurities as measured by area percentage HPLC. In a particular embodiment, the rosuvastatin calcium may have impurities equal or less than about 0.3% as measured by area percentage HPLC.

Most preferably, \u201cambient temperature\u201d refers to a temperature of about 25\u00b0 C. The term \u201creduced pressure\u201d generally refers to a pressure of about 10 mmHg to about 50 mmHg.","The present invention provides for a process for preparing rosuvastatin from a Cto Calkyl ester of rosuvastatin, most preferably t-butyl ester of rosuvastatin. In one embodiment, the t-butyl ester of rosuvastatin is reacted with at least about 1 equivalent of a base, in the presence of a Cto Calcohol, and stirred at ambient temperature, followed by precipitation from water. A preferred alcohol is ethanol. The reaction may be carried out by suspending the ester in the alcohol, followed by addition of the base to obtain a solution of the salt.","The base is preferably added portionwise, with preferred bases being alkali and alkaline earth metal bases, other than calcium hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and barium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is particularly preferred for use as a base.","During or after the combining of the base with the ester, the resulting solution is preferably stirred for at least about 5 minutes, more preferably for about 1 hour. The solution is then preferably filtered in order to remove any impurities originating from the starting material.","The process of the present invention may also be carried out by starting with a solution of rosuvastatin salt in a solvent, such as the sodium salt in a Cto Calcohol, rather than starting from the ester. Such solution may for example be prepared by starting with rosuvastatin sodium as a solid, and adding the solid to an alcohol.","The reaction mixture is then preferably concentrated to obtain a residue. The term residue refers to an oil containing rosuvastatin salt, resulting from removal of solvent from a solution of the rosuvastatin salt. The removal of solvent is preferably carried out by evaporation under reduced pressure (below about 50 mmHg) and at a temperature of about 40\u00b0 C. to about 70\u00b0 C., with about 60\u00b0 C. being preferred.","The residue is then distributed between an aqueous and an organic water immiscible phase, wherein the salt of rosuvastatin moves into the aqueous phase and the impurities into the organic phase. The distribution may be carried out by washing the solution of the salt in the aqueous solvent with the organic solvent. The aqueous phase preferably contains water, but may also contain other solvents in a mixture with water, as long as the other solvents allow for a two phase system and solubility of the salt in at least the aqueous phase.","In a preferred embodiment, the residue is combined with water to obtain a solution, and then the rosuvastatin salt in the solution is washed with an organic solvent. Preferably, water is added in the amount of at least about 1:1 or 1:0.5 water:lower alcohol (v\/v) used in the previous steps.","Preferably the organic solvent is a Cto Cester or ketone such as ethyl acetate or methyl ethyl ketone. Other organic solvents include alkyl carbonates such as di-ethyl carbonate, Cto Caromatic and saturated hydrocarbons such as toluene, benzene, xylene, cyclic and acyclic hexane and heptane.","After the washing step with the organic solvent, traces of organic solvent remaining may be removed by conventional techniques in the art, such as evaporation under reduced pressure at a temperature of about 5\u00b0 C. to about 80\u00b0 C. more preferably about 60\u00b0 C.","The salt may be converted to a calcium salt by combining the solution with a source of calcium such as CaCl, preferably at ambient temperature. After combining, the reaction mixture is preferably stirred, and the rosuvastatin calcium salt is recovered by conventional techniques such as filtration, and preferably washed.","In another embodiment, a two phase system is used with a phase transfer catalyst. Examples of phase transfer catalysts include quaternary ammonium salts, such as a bromide or sulfate salt of tetrabutylammonium, hexadecyltrimethylammonium and benzyltriethylammonium. A crown ether or a quaternary phosphonium salt may also be used as a phase transfer catalyst.","In this embodiment, an aqueous phase and a water immiscible phase is used. A water immiscible organic solvent is used in which the ester of rosuvastatin or other desired rosuvastatin derivative is substantially soluble. Examples of such organic solvents include saturated and aromatic, substituted and unsubstituted Cto Chydrocarbons, and Cto Cketones and esters. Specific examples of such solvents include benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, and cyclic and acyclic hexane and heptane. The aqueous phase contains a base, as described above, which through the use of the phase transfer catalyst is taken to the water immiscible phase, resulting in rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin then moves to the aqueous phase. Rosuvastatin calcium is recovered from the aqueous phase as described above.","In another embodiment, rosuvastatin calcium is prepared from an ester derivative of rosuvastatin with a two phase system in the absence of a phase transfer catalyst. In this embodiment, a preferred two phase system is water and acetonitrile, under basic conditions so that the two solvents are not substantially miscible. Alkali metal or alkaline earth metals may be used as bases. In one embodiment, use of sodium hydroxide results in the sodium salt, which may then be recovered from both the organic and aqueous phase as illustrated in example 7. The organic and the aqueous phase may be concentrated, and water and a source of calcium added to precipitate the rosuvastatin calcium from solution in water.","The present invention also relates to rosuvastatin calcium salt substantially free of impurities, i.e., the calcium salt contains less than about 0.5% impurities as an area percentage by HPLC, more preferably less than or of 0.4% total impurities, and most preferably less than or of about 0.3% total impurities. In one embodiment, the calcium salt does not have detectable impurities level when measured by HPLC at RRT 0.62, 1.18, 1.60, 2.68, 3.66, 3.89, 3.93 and 4. 10. The detection level of the HPLC used in the present invention is about 0.01% area percentage. The RRT values expressed herein are specific to the HPLC conditions disclosed herein.","Relative to CRESTOR, the rosuvastatin calcium of the present invention has a higher purity profile and does not have a detectable level of an impurity at RRT 1.26, which is present in CRESTOR. Based in analysis by LC-MS, this impurity has a molecular weight of 479.","Pharmaceutical formulations\/compositions of the present invention contain rosuvastatin calcium substantially free of impurities. The rosuvastatin calcium prepared by the processes of the present invention is ideal for pharmaceutical formulation. In addition to the active ingredient(s), the pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention may contain one or more excipients. Excipients are added to the formulation for a variety of purposes.","Diluents increase the bulk of a solid pharmaceutical formulation, and may make a pharmaceutical dosage form containing the formulation easier for the patient and care giver to handle.

Excipients that may function as glidants include colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium trisilicate, powdered cellulose, starch, talc and tribasic calcium phosphate.","When a dosage form such as a tablet is made by the compaction of a powdered formulation, the formulation is subjected to pressure from a punch and dye. Some excipients and active ingredients have a tendency to adhere to the surfaces of the punch and dye, which can cause the product to have pitting and other surface irregularities. A lubricant can be added to the formulation to reduce adhesion and ease the release of the product from the dye. Lubricants include magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl palmitostearate, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, mineral oil, polyethylene glycol, sodium benzoate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium stearyl fumarate, stearic acid, talc and zinc stearate.","Flavoring agents and flavor enhancers make the dosage form more palatable to the patient. Common flavoring agents and flavor enhancers for pharmaceutical products that may be included in the formulation of the present invention include maltol, vanillin, ethyl vanillin, menthol, citric acid, fumaric acid, ethyl maltol and tartaric acid.","Solid and liquid formulations may also be dyed using any pharmaceutically acceptable colorant to improve their appearance and\/or facilitate patient identification of the product and unit dosage level.","In liquid pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention, valsartan and any other solid excipients are dissolved or suspended in a liquid carrier such as water, vegetable oil, alcohol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerin.","Liquid pharmaceutical formulations may contain emulsifying agents to disperse uniformly throughout the formulation an active ingredient or other excipient that is not soluble in the liquid carrier. Emulsifying agents that may be useful in liquid formulations of the present invention include, for example, gelatin, egg yolk, casein, cholesterol, acacia, tragacanth, chondrus, pectin, methyl cellulose, carbomer, cetostearyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol.","Liquid pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention may also contain a viscosity enhancing agent to improve the mouth-feel of the product and\/or coat the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Such agents include acacia, alginic acid bentonite, carbomer, carboxymethylcellulose calcium or sodium, cetostearyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, ethylcellulose, gelatin guar gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, maltodextrin, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, propylene carbonate, propylene glycol alginate, sodium alginate, sodium starch glycolate, starch tragacanth and xanthan gum.","Sweetening agents such as sorbitol, saccharin, sodium saccharin, sucrose, aspartame, fructose, mannitol and invert sugar may be added to improve the taste.","Preservatives and chelating agents such as alcohol, sodium benzoate, butylated hydroxy toluene, butylated hydroxyanisole and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid may be added at levels safe for ingestion to improve storage stability.","According to the present invention, a liquid formulation may also contain a buffer such as guconic acid, lactic acid, citric acid or acetic acid, sodium guconate, sodium lactate, sodium citrate or sodium acetate. Selection of excipients and the amounts used may be readily determined by the formulation scientist based upon experience and consideration of standard procedures and reference works in the field.","The solid formulations of the present invention include powders, granulates, aggregates and compacted formulations. The dosages include dosages suitable for oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), inhalant and ophthalmic administration. Although the most suitable administration in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated, the most preferred route of the present invention is oral. The dosages may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the pharmaceutical arts.","Dosage forms include solid dosage forms like tablets, powders, capsules, suppositories, sachets, troches and losenges, as well as liquid syrups, suspensions and elixirs.","The dosage form of the present invention may be a capsule containing the formulation, preferably a powdered or granulated solid formulation of the invention, within either a hard or soft shell. The shell may be made from gelatin and optionally contain a plasticizer such as glycerin and sorbitol, and an opacifying agent or colorant.","The active ingredient and excipients may be formulated into formulations and dosage forms according to methods known in the art.","A formulation for tableting or capsule filling may be prepared by wet granulation. In wet granulation, some or all of the active ingredients and excipients in powder form are blended and then further mixed in the presence of a liquid, typically water, that causes the powders to clump into granules. The granulate is screened and\/or milled, dried and then screened and\/or milled to the desired particle size. The granulate may then be tabletted, or other excipients may be added prior to tableting, such as a glidant and\/or a lubricant.","A tableting formulation may be prepared conventionally by dry blending. For example, the blended formulation of the actives and excipients may be compacted into a slug or a sheet and then comminuted into compacted granules. The compacted granules may subsequently be compressed into a tablet.","As an alternative to dry granulation, a blended formulation may be compressed directly into a compacted dosage form using direct compression techniques. Direct compression produces a more uniform tablet without granules. Excipients that are particularly well suited for direct compression tableting include microcrystalline cellulose, spray dried lactose, di-calcium phosphate dihydrate and colloidal silica. The proper use of these and other excipients in direct compression tableting is known to those in the art with experience and skill in particular formulation challenges of direct compression tableting.","A capsule filling of the present invention may comprise any of the aforementioned blends and granulates that were described with reference to tableting, however, they are not subjected to a final tableting step.","The solid formulations of the present invention include powders, granulates, aggregates and compacted formulations. The dosages include dosages suitable for oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), inhalant and ophthalmic administration. Although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated, the most preferred route of the present invention is oral. The dosages can be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the pharmaceutical arts.","In addition to excipients, the pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention may contain an adjuvant.","The Impurity Profile Determination of Rosuvastatin Ca comprised testing a sample using HPLC.
