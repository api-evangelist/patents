title: Cross-platform subselect metadata extraction
abstract: A metadata extraction system executes a query against a database on a data storage device connected to a computer. Initially, the query is modified to replace one or more selected clauses with a false clause. The modified query with the false clause is executed. Metadata is retrieved from the result set obtained by executing the modified query. The metadata is used to obtain column types, which are converted to Java™ types. Then, a SQLJ iterator is generated, which has parameters for the Java™ types.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates in general to computer-implemented database systems, and, in particular, to a technique for cross-platform subselect metadata extraction.","2. Description of Related Art","Databases are computerized information storage and retrieval systems. A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) which uses relational techniques for storing and retrieving data. Relational databases are organized into tables which consist of rows and columns of data. The rows are formally called tuples or records. A database will typically have many tables and each table will typically have multiple tuples and multiple columns. The tables are typically stored on direct access storage devices (DASD), such as magnetic or optical disk drives for semi-permanent storage.","In a DBMS, data records are stored in table spaces. A table space may contain one or more tables. Each table space contains a number of space map pages. Each space map page covers a number of data pages. One or more records can be stored in a single data page. All data pages within a single table space must have the same page size. Typically, a page contains 4096 bytes.","Some current systems provide a technique for obtaining column names and data types of a table or a query result. For example, the DB2\u00ae Universal Database (UDB) system from International Business Machines, Corporation has a DESCRIBE command for use in defining a result set (i.e., a query result). In particular, the DESCRIBE command lists column names and data types of a query result (i.e., a result set). The DB2\u00ae UDB system supports the DESCRIBE command for various platforms or operating systems, including UNIX\u00ae, Windows NT\u00ae, and OS\/2\u00ae platforms and enables a developer to access table, view, or query metadata information. Metadata information comprises information about other information. For example, metadata provides type information about columns in a table.","SQLJ is a set of standards used to define how the Java\u2122 programming language can be used with the Structured Query Language (SQL). SQLJ enables developers to use Java\u2122 data types or classes as data types in SQL. Therefore, relational tables accessed within an SQLJ application may contain columns having Java\u2122 data types or classes. A SQLJ stored procedure is considered a specialized type of SQLJ application. Additionally, a SQLJ iterator describes columns for a result set using Java\u2122 types.","On the other hand, some systems do not provide such techniques for obtaining the types of a result set. The DB2\u00ae Version 5 of the OS\/390\u00ae platform, on the other hand, does not have a DESCRIBE command. However, a developer can alter the Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement so that it returns no data, but allows full access to the metadata similar to that provided in the above DESCRIBE command.","The types of a result set is useful and desirable information. There is a need in the art of an improved technique of obtaining this information, across platforms.","To overcome the limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for a computer-implemented technique for cross-platform subselect metadata extraction.","In accordance with the present invention, a metadata extraction system executes a query against a database on a data storage device connected to a computer. Initially, the query is modified to replace one or more selected clauses with a false clause. The modified query with the false clause is executed. Metadata is retrieved from the result set obtained by executing the modified query. The metadata is used to obtain column types, which are converted to Java\u2122 types. Then, a SQLJ iterator is generated, which has parameters for the Java\u2122 types.","In the following description of one embodiment of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced.

Overview","The present invention provides a Metadata Extraction System  that extracts metadata across platforms. In particular, the metadata that is extracted includes data types of columns in a result set. Without knowledge of which platform the Metadata Extraction System  is running on, the Metadata Extraction System  can determine the metadata of a result set of a SELECT statement without returning or producing any customer data from the statement.","B. Stored Procedure Builder","The Metadata Extraction System  is part of a Stored Procedure Builder, which assists developers with the creation of stored procedures. A stored procedure has zero or more parameters. The stored procedure receives parameter values and is executed via SQL statements. Typically, a stored procedure is used to execute a group of SQL statements without user input (other than the initial parameter values).","In one embodiment of the invention, the stored procedure builder is the DB2\u00ae Stored Procedure Builder, which is a graphical application that supports the rapid development of stored procedures. The Stored Procedure Builder may be used to create stored procedures, build stored procedures on local and remote servers, modify and rebuild existing stored procedures, and run stored procedures for testing and debugging the execution of installed stored procedures. The Stored Procedure Builder provides a single development environment that supports many different platforms and works in conjunction with many different applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","402","400","404"]},"As to debugger components, a Debugger Daemon  and Debugger Client  are provided for debugging a stored procedure built with the Stored Procedure Builder . As to Deployment components, the Stored Procedure Builder  uses a Java\u2122 Database Connectivity (JDBC) application programming interface (API)  to communicate with a Database . The Stored Procedure Builder is implemented with Java\u2122 code and all database connections are managed by using a Java\u2122 Database Connectivity (JDBC) application programming interface (API). Furthermore, the Database  may reside on one of many Platforms  and connected to a Debugger Backend . Some platforms include: AIX\u00ae, OS\/2\u00ae, OS\/390\u00ae, OS\/400\u00ae, Sun Solaris\u00ae, UNIX\u00ae, Windows NT\u00ae, Windows 95\u00ae, Windows 98\u00ae, and Windows 2000\u00ae.","IBM, DB2, Universal Database (UDB), OS\/2, OS\/390, OS\/400, AIX, and VisualAge are trademarks or registered trademarks of International Business Machines, Corporation in the United States and\/or other countries.","UNIX is a trademark registered of UNIX Systems Laboratories in the United States and\/or other countries.","Microsoft, Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Visual C++, and Visual Basic are trademarks or registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and\/or other countries.","Sun Solaris, JAVA, and JAVA-based marks are trademarks or registered trademarks of Sun Microsystems in the United States and\/or other countries.","C. Metadata Extraction","A SQLJ iterator is a command that describes the output of a SELECT statement. This is used to statically bind a statement in DB2\u00ae. A technique for supporting the SQLJ iterator across platforms was needed. Thus, in order to support the SQLJ iterator across different platforms, the Metadata Extraction System  was developed. One advantage of the Metadata Extraction System  is that it supports SQLJ iterators (an important part of SQLJ) across different platforms, instead of just supporting it on one or a few platforms. Some platforms include: AIX\u00ae, OS\/2\u00ae, OS\/390\u00ae, OS\/400\u00ae, Sun Solaris\u00ae, UNIX\u00ae, Windows NT\u00ae, Windows 95\u00ae, Windows 98\u00ae, and Windows 2000\u00ae.","The Metadata Extraction System  alters the SELECT statement by adding\/inserting a false WHERE condition (e.g., WHERE 1=\u22121). The inclusion of the false WHERE condition results in no rows being returned, while metadata about the result set is available. In particular, even though no rows are returned, the MetaData via a Java.sql.ResultSetMetaData field is still available and used to construct the iterator necessary for the generating SQLJ code where a SELECT statement is returning rows of data.","Since SQL is a complex language where there are a minimal set of reserved words, one or more false SQL statements are constructed and loaded into a list of statements to run. In one embodiment, the number of false SQL statements will be equivalent to the number of WHERE clauses. For example, if a SQL statement has a WHERE clause, then one false WHERE clause is generated and used to replace the original WHERE clause and anything following it (e.g., a GROUP BY clause). If a SQL statement has two WHERE clauses, then one false WHERE clause is generated and used to replace both of the WHERE clauses and everything following them and a second false WHERE clause is generated and used to replace the second WHERE clause and everything following it (i.e., this leaves the first WHERE clause in the SQL statement. The first SQL statement with a false WHERE clause to run without experiencing a SQL exception is the one used to extract the MetaData.","The Metadata Extraction System  improves performance by removing the ORDER BY clauses, should they exist in the statement. Also, the Metadata Extraction System  handles subselect statements (e.g., a WHERE clause within a WHERE clause). In one embodiment, the pseudocode is not applied to SELECT <column name> INTO statements because results are directly loaded into variables.","Additionally, if the SQL statement requires that the application program pass in parameter values at run time (e.g., the parameters could be used in an expression), default values are used by the Metadata Extraction System  when executing a SQL statement with one or more false clauses so that the SQL statement can run properly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"In block , a stored procedure builder receives a SQL statement from a user and determines whether the SQL statement requires a SQLJ iterator. A SQL statement requires an iterator if it is a SELECT statement, other than a SELECT INTO statement (which selects data into one or more variables). In block , if an iterator is required, processing continues with block , otherwise, processing continues with block .","In block , the Metadata Extraction System  assists the stored procedure builder with building a stored procedure requiring a SQLJ iterator through construction of a SQLJ iterator for the SQL statement and continues to block  for precompiling. In block , the stored procedure builder builds a stored procedure and continues to block  for precompiling. In block , a precompiler precompiles the stored procedure. In block , a Java\u2122 compiler compiles the precompiled stored procedure.","The following provides pseudocode for the Metadata Extraction System :",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Is there a WHERE clause in the SQL statement?"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"231pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"N","Y"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1)","|","+","Establish its position in the statement."]},{"entry":[{},"|",{},"Is it bounded by whitespace on either side?"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"|","N","Y",{}]},{"entry":[{},"|","|","+","Copy SQL statement up until the WHERE clause, and replace"]},{"entry":[{},"|","|",{},"the WHERE clause and everything following it with"]},{"entry":[{},"|","|",{},"\u201c WHERE 1 = \u22121 \u201d.
