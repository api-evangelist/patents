More particularly, the invention relates to a technique for providing an advertisement attached webpage generated by utilizing a web API which provides software capabilities on the Internet and defining web APIs that contributed to creation of the advertisement attached webpage for enabling distribution of referral fees for the advertisement.","Such a system as follows is widely utilized today: the operator of a website published on the Internet makes a contract with an advertisement agent that runs an advertisement intermediary service and posts an advertisement for an enterprise distributed by the advertisement intermediary service on the webpage. And a referral fee is paid to the website operator based on the number of times the advertisement is displayed on viewers' Web browsers or viewers select a link in the advertisement to move to a corresponding webpage of the enterprise, or the number of times viewers select the advertisement to move to a corresponding page that sells the enterprise's products and buy such products and\/or the amount of purchase.","For instance, AdSense (Non-Patent Document 1) of Google (a registered trademark) solicits Web operators to post advertisements on their webpages. Google has a Web operator post an advertisement on his webpage and pays a referral fee to the Web operator when a viewer of the webpage clicks a link in the advertisement.","A conventional mechanism for posting an advertisement on a website is conceptually illustrated in . When a webpage request  is made to a website  from a Web browser , the website  provides an advertisement attached webpage . Here, the website  typically transmits HTML containing a URL indicating the location at which advertisement information resources are stored, and upon receiving the HTML, the Web browser makes an advertisement information request  to ask for resources from the URL of the advertisement information resources. When advertisement information  is returned, the Web browser displays advertisement information. Advertisement information is typically rendered using an image and\/or animation for catching viewers' attention. Such an images or animation is designed as a link so that a page containing more detailed information (typically a webpage of the enterprise posting the advertisement) can be returned when a viewer selects the advertisement.","In the link, introducer identification information is embedded. When a viewer of the webpage selects the advertisement on a web browser, a notice of advertisement selection  is sent to the advertisement intermediary service . Upon receiving the request, the advertisement intermediary service  redirects the viewer to the website of the enterprise  that corresponds to the advertisement and displays a page corresponding to the advertisement on the web browser . Here, the advertisement intermediary service  counts the number of times the advertisement is selected for each piece of introducer identification information or the like by utilizing the introducer information embedded in the link of the advertisement. Based on the result of counting, the advertisement agent determines an amount to pay as a referral fee.","The invention according to Patent Document 1 describes a method for the purchaser of a product to select a party to which a referral fee is paid such as when one buys a product through an affiliate advertisement.","The invention according to Patent Document 2 describes a method for embedding a web browser in a portion of an application having a GUI and displaying an advertisement on the browser. By doing so, the invention realizes such control as to enable utilization of functions of the application only while the advertisement is displayed, for example.\n\n","Web APIs, which are mechanisms for providing software capabilities on the Internet, are receiving attention. Web application developers can realize high-performance web applications at low costs by combining web APIs provided by other developers.","Various types of web APIs are available, such as user authentication, syntax analysis of a given sentence, retouch of a given image, provision of map information, and so forth. Information returned by a web API can be modified by a web application developer to be embedded in a webpage and displayed on a web browser. Because they permit modification, even when advertisement information is returned together as a returned value from a web API, a web application developer could eliminate the information, making it difficult for the provider of the web API to gain referral fees for advertisements.","With the technique of Patent Document 1, although the purchaser of a product is allowed to select a party to pay a referral fee, fair payment of referral fees is difficult because selection of whom to pay depends on the purchaser's judgment.","Also, using the technique of Patent Document 2, web API developers can obtain an opportunity to gain advertisement revenues through an application running on a computer, not through a webpage, but the application is required to provide a GUI and the technique is not applicable to a web API that does not have a GUI.","In view of such problems, an object of the present invention is to provide an advertisement providing system and an advertisement providing method for providing an advertisement attached webpage generated by utilizing a web API which provides software capabilities on the Internet and defining web APIs that contributed to creation of the advertisement attached webpage for enabling distribution of referral fees for the advertisement.","To attain the object, an information providing method according to the present invention is an

acquires key information issued by the web API call control program and uses the key information to call the web API program, and the web API program confirms whether the key information received from the web API utilizing program is valid and returns a result of executing the web API program only if the key information is valid.","Furthermore, in the information providing method of the invention, web API call control is performed such that the web API utilizing program acquires a session ID from the web API call control program every time the web API utilizing program is to call the web API program and calls the web API program using the session ID as key information.","Furthermore, in the information providing method of the invention, web API call control is performed such that the web API utilizing program acquires from the web API call control program in advance a key that enables the web API utilizing program to call the web API program a plurality of times, and uses the key to call the web API program.","Furthermore, in the information providing method of the invention, web API call control is performed such that the web API program sends key information received from the web API calling program to the web API call control program, and the web API call control program verifies whether the key information received is valid information issued by the web API call control program and sends the result of verification to the web API program.","Furthermore, in the information providing method of the invention, web API call control is performed such that the web API program records the key information sent from the web API utilizing program and information that can identify a calling web API utilizing program and a called web API program in a log and regularly

In that case, the step of checking whether the selection\/non-selection field of SC is set to \u201cselected\u201d  may be replaced with a step of checking that the advertisement requestor's IP in SC has been recorded.","Method for Detecting a Fraud","Measures to reduce the risk of the advertisement intermediary service being deceived into paying a referral fee that is included in the concept of the invention will be described.","(1) In the present invention, every time a page request is made to a website from a web browser, the advertisement intermediary service issues and manages a session ID. As an alternative method, contribution of a website operator or a web API provider may be indicated to the advertisement agent by supplying their introducer identification information to the advertisement intermediary service. However, because this method permits introducer identification information to be supplied to the advertisement intermediary service even if a web API has not been actually utilized, a fraud could be committed. Use of the session ID of the present invention makes fraudulent acts difficult because it enables checking of whether a session ID returned by making session ID confirmation to the advertisement intermediary service from a web API is one issued by the advertisement intermediary service, whether too long time has not elapsed since its issuance, or the like.","(2) Another possible way of fraud is to increase the degree of contribution by recording the introducer identification information of a web API provider into the contributor recording table more than one time by performing session ID confirmation a number of times when the web API is called with a certain session ID. Such a fraud can be prevented by establishing a rule that charging can be made only once for one session ID and checking whether a row having the same session ID and introducer identification information is already present when writing a contributor to the contributor recording table in the advertisement intermediary service, and recording to the contributor recording table only when such a row does not exist. Alternatively, such a fraud could be prevented by writing into more than one row of the contributor recording table and, even if multiple rows containing the same pair of a session ID and introducer identification information are encountered at the time of calculation of referral fee, performing processing counting those rows as one occurrence.","(3) A website operator is required to post an advertisement on his or her webpage for utilizing a web API. For such a reason as impairing the appearance of a webpage, however, some website operators might want to utilize a web API but not want to post an advertisement. Using the present invention, when a link to an advertisement is not described in a webpage, an advertisement information request will not be transmitted to the advertisement intermediary service from a web browser. In the invention, when the advertisement intermediary service receives an advertisement information request, it records the advertisement requestor's IP in the session management table. Thus, when a webpage with no advertisement link embedded therein is provided, an advertisement requestor's IP address is not recorded. Session IDs in rows of the session management table in which an advertiser requestor's IP is not recorded are found in the contributor recording table, and from the introducer identification information contained in the first row found, a website operator who is not displaying the advertisement can be identified. Once such a website operator has been identified, some measures can be taken such as to warn him or stop him utilizing the web API.","Or if only recording of an advertisement requestor's IP is required, an IP address can be recorded in the advertisement requestor's IP field of the session management table by sending an advertisement information request to the advertisement intermediary service not from the web browser but from the website processing device. In this case, however, as the same IP address is stored every time or only several particular IP addresses are stored in the advertisement requestor's IP field, a suspicious website operator can be identified by analyzing the advertisement requestor's IP field of the session management table.","Using JavaScript or CSS, an advertisement could be made invisible on a web browser even if advertisement information is obtained by the web browser. In this case, advertisement selection rate would be extremely low. If such a website is found by checking the website management table, session management table, or contributor recording table, one can actually view the website to see if the advertisement is displayed.","To be specific, for each introducer in the introducer management table, all session IDs of introducer identification information corresponding to the introducer are retrieved from the contributor recording table (the number of session IDs is regarded as the number of times the webpage has been displayed), and all such rows of the session management table that correspond to the session IDs retrieved and that have \u201cselected\u201d in the selection\/non-selection field are retrieved (the number of the retrieved rows is regarded as the number of selections). And if the number of selections divided by the number of times the webpage was displayed is below a threshold (e.g., 0.01), it is checked whether the advertisement is being properly displayed such as by viewing the webpage.","The first embodiment has such advantages as follows. It can provide web API providers with an opportunity to gain advertisement revenues. By passing around a session ID at the time of communication among the advertisement intermediary service, a web API, and a website, a mechanism that makes it difficult to commit fraudulent acts can be provided.","While the description of the present embodiment envisages a web API for indicating famous people's birthday, various web APIs are available such as ones for user authentication, syntax analysis of a given sentence, retouch of a given image, providing map information, and so on. Some web APIs require data for their execution, in which case data necessary for execution of a web API is applied instead of date used in the present embodiment. This also applies to the following embodiments.","While the first embodiment implements the session ID request , web API call , and page generation  on the website processing device , these processes may be realized on the web browser  using a programming language running on the web browser , such as JavaScript.","In this case, the session ID requesting section , the web API calling section , and the page generating section  which are provided in the website processing device  in the first embodiment are provided in the web browser .","Specifically, the website processing device  sends a webpage in which the session ID requesting section, web API calling section, and page generating section are included using JavaScript or the like to the web browser .

As a log  for a website and a log  for a web API, session IDs, time of call, calling introducer identification information, and called introducer identification information are recorded as logs.","The log  is sent periodically (e.g., once a month) to the advertisement intermediary service processing device.","Logs may be sent by running a program such as a web server for receiving logs on the advertisement intermediary service processing device so that the website processing device and the web API processing device periodically send logs to the server, or running a server program such as a web server on the website processing device and the web API processing device so that the advertisement providing service periodically makes a log delivery request to the website processing device and web API processing device and the two devices send logs upon receiving the request.","Upon receiving the log , the advertisement intermediary service processing device summarizes the log using a log summarizing section .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0253","num":"0332"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1703","1703","324","1902","1903","324","1902","1902"]},"The 15 seconds at step  is a rough guide of time required for a request to reach the callee from the caller, and if this value is exceeded, the call is invalidated because a fraudulent may have occurred. Of course, a value other than 15 seconds may be used or this check may not be performed.","If the session ID and introducer identification information are valid at step , the session ID and called introducer identification information of L are stored in the contributor recording table .","It is checked whether processing for all the rows of web API logs is completed , and if not completed, the flow returns to step . If completed, processing is terminated.","Since logs are collected from both the website processing device and the web API processing device in the present embodiment, a website and a web API have to collude to commit a fraudulent such as making a false report that the web API was used even if it was not actually utilized. The embodiment is thus expected to provide the effect of making fraudulent acts difficult. Of course, logs may be collected and summarized from only one of the website processing device or the web API processing device.","Also, while the present embodiment uses a session ID, a key may be used as in the sixth embodiment. In that case, a key of a web API is recorded in a log instead of a session ID. The key may be the same as the introducer identification information of the web API.","When a key is used, the storage section of the advertisement intermediary service of  will be similar to that of , and the process  of storing the session ID and called introducer identification information of L in the contributor recording table which is performed by the log summarizing section of  is replaced with a process of recording the key and introducer identification information of L and the time of calling as the time.","Using the method of summarizing periodically-collected logs according to the present embodiment, performance is improved as compared to a method that checks session ID for each request. However, it also has a shortcoming in that it can find a fraud only at the time of log summarization.","A method for changing advertisements depending on the type of web API will be described.","Its system configuration is shown in , in which the portions enclosed by a bold line are the new additions. A keyword field  is added to the web API management table  and a keyword field  is also added to the advertisement information storage table . More than one keyword can be registered in each of the keywords fields.","In the keyword field  of the web API management table , keywords related to each web API are registered. For example, for a web API that indicates famous people's birthday, \u201cfamous people\u201d and \u201cbirthday\u201d can be registered as keywords.","In the keyword field  of the advertisement information storage table , keywords related to each advertisement are registered. For example, for an advertisement for a flower shop, \u201cflower\u201d, \u201cgift\u201d, and \u201cbirthday\u201d can be registered as keywords.","For example, when the advertisement intermediary service  receives the advertisement information request (sending a session ID)  of , it finds rows containing the session ID corresponding with the received one from the contributor recording table , identifies introduced identification information  contained in the row, and extracts multiple keywords  from a row the web API management table  that contains the introducer identification information. Next, the advertisement intermediary service  searches for advertisements containing any of the keywords retrieved from the advertisement information storage table  and returns rows it found to the web browser as advertisement information . When more than one row are found, one that contains the most matching keywords may be adopted or one may be randomly selected.","Although in the description above a process of finding an advertisement is performed on each request based on session ID, a field for registering web APIs to be utilized or web API keywords may be provided in the website management table so that web APIs that are utilized by a website or keywords for web APIs to be utilized may be registered in advance. This method is also applicable to an embodiment that uses keys or logs.","The foregoing embodiments summarize continuous usage of web APIs in the advertisement intermediary service. However, instead of continuous summarization, usage may be summarized only for a certain time period (e.g., only the first week of each month, every Wednesday, 10:00 to 12:00 every day, or at irregular intervals) so as to reduce burden of the task.","Using the concept of the invention, an opportunity to gain advertisement revenues can be given to web API providers who have had difficulty in gaining advertisement revenues. Also, a website operator has to deliberately judge whether a fee-based web API has an effect worth paying for it when he wants utilize a fee-based web API. A web API provided according to the present concept is easy to introduce as it only requires posting of an advertisement for utilizing it. As described above, the present concept is considered to have the effect of promoting utilization of web APIs or attracting more web API providers.","As has been described, the present invention involves three parties: web API provider, website operator, and advertisement agent. Advantages offered to the three parties by the invention are as follows.","Web API Provider","Many of web APIs are currently published as freeware. Using the present invention, a referral fee through an advertisement can be obtained from a website that utilizes a web API.","Website Operator","Enabled to easily create a sophisticated website utilizing web APIs. At present, some web APIs are utilized based on a contract, such as to pay a certain amount of yen per month or request, with a website operator who wants to utilize a web API. Using the present invention, which is a mechanism that allows a web API provider to gain a referral fee depending on the quantity of viewing for an advertisement posted on a website, a website operator can utilize web APIs just by posting an advertisement on his or her website.","The following are two possible ways to distribute a referral fee.","A website operator who wants to utilize a web API is required to post an advertisement in a manner specified by the provider of the web API and referral fees from that advertisement are paid only to the web API provider.","A website operator who wants to utilize a web API is required to post an advertisement in a manner specified by the provider of the web API and referral fees from that advertisement are paid to both the web API provider and the website operator.","In the latter case, if viewing of the website utilizing the web API increases and viewing of the advertisement concomitantly increases, more referral fees can be earned.","Advertisement Agent","An advertisement agent is a party that intervenes between an enterprise that wishes to run advertisement and a website operator who wants to gain advertising revenues by posting an advertisement on his website. The difference referral fees paid to the website operator and\/or web API providers from the fee paid by the enterprise is the profit of the advertisement agent. As a fee paid by an enterprise wishing to run advertisement, a fee per viewing is set in many cases. As more websites carry sophisticated and appealing advertisements with use of web APIs, advertisements are more likely to be viewed. As a result, enterprises that want to run advertisements are expected to increase and it could in turn increase the profit of advertisement agents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 20"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
