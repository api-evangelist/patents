While organizations spend a lot of time and effort securing the enterprise from outside threats, it is also important to focus on the inside. Segregation of Duties (SoD) monitoring may help identify risks from insider malicious activity and even unintentional actions that may result in large potential losses. Traditional SoD remediation reports contain pages and pages of text and end up extending across 15 or 20 ERP application screens. IT security, business teams and compliance analysts need to pour over reports and attempt to identify violations.

Risk and compliance analysts may assess risk across the board covering IT applications, IT assets, corporate assets, critical assets and the physical access that users and administrators have to them. In an embodiment, this holistic picture of risk may be the starting point from which all remediation activity takes place providing a more secure, policy-driven and compliant result.","An embodiment can be understood with reference to .  shows an AlertInsight subsystem according to an embodiment. Such subsystem contains a visual mapping and remediation layer , a data aggregation and continuous monitoring layer , and a sources of data layer . Such sources of data layer  are, for example and not limited to, ERP systems, Identity and Access Management (IAM) Provisioning and Roles Management systems, and sources of threat detection. Such sources of threat may come from IT Security Automation and Physical Security\/SCADA, Process Controls Systems and video surveillance systems.","An embodiment of a user-interface can be understood with reference to .  shows an exemplary user-interface for rapid risk identification, visualization, remediation and role redesign, according to an embodiment. In the embodiment, drilling down on a risk item may show the details of processes, transactions, roles with permissions and the users all in one screen.
