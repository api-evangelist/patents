{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Test engineers often need in depth knowledge of the syntax and structure of the application that they are testing. Many applications adjust how they display data and objects depending on the size of the window to display the objects in. For example, data that appears in a certain row on one display can appear in a different row using a different display. Such variability in display can make application testing difficult.","There are some situations where a generated test will not run properly without being adapted. A test can be adapted when testing dynamic scenarios where the application displays data retrieved from a database. The data displayed may not always appear at the same position, because the data displayed can depend on the amount of data available from the database.","Various embodiments herein include at least one of systems, methods, and software to help reduce the complexity in testing software. One or more embodiments can include a system including a web controller configured to provide access to at least one container displayed by an application and a web user interface (UI) configured to be controlled using the web controller. The system can include an application controller object configured to implement an application controller interface and expose methods for performing operations on application controls of the application and an application query object. The application query object can include at least one filter with at least one condition, the at least one condition defining an attribute or property of a UI element to check for. The application query object can be configured to return at least one UI control when the UI control includes at least one UI element that includes features that match criteria defined by the at least one filter and the at least one condition.","A test automation process can be simplified by having a script return a control of an element displayed in an application, as compared to having the process directly search for and perform actions on the element displayed. By providing an entity testing the program the ability to search controls, a test automation process can become data agnostic and the process can allow the tester to have less knowledge about the specifics of the application being tested while still allowing the tester to test the application.","A purpose of the test automation can include reducing the testing effort by using software to generate, maintain, and run automated tests. Test automation tools commonly provide features to record business scenarios that can then be stored in a repository and converted into tests. The test framework can execute the generated tests to check and validate software applications.","Creating tests by recording business scenarios can have some limitations. There are some situations where a generated test will not run properly without being adapted. Such situations can include the testing of dynamic scenarios where the application displays data coming from a database. The data displayed may not always appear at the same position depending on the amount of data available. For example, a test selecting the first line in a table is not sure to select the same information when executed again because the first line can display information that has been inserted in the database since the last test.","Test engineers, when facing such situations, often write custom scripts to solve the issue. However, automating the testing of common business scenarios can be difficult in view of complex technologies used for displaying the content. The situation can be even more difficult when testing web applications displaying information in a browser, such as HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages that may be augmented with scripting. The HTML, coupled with its scripting capabilities, can be flexible, and most modern web applications do not restrict their User Interface (UI) to simple HTML elements. In practice, web applications are built on top of a UI framework (e.g., running server-side), which can be responsible for generating web or other HTML content. The output of such a UI framework can be very sophisticated. It can, for instance, rely on page composition techniques (e.g., using frame elements) to organize the page layout. It can also create complex UI elements that have their own semantics. There are many examples of such complex UI elements. Some examples include tables, combo-boxes, tabs, trees, lists, collapsible panels, grids, traffic lights, or progress bars, among others. Each one has its own semantic and, because of the HTML language flexibility, each one can be implemented differently by the UI framework.","A common problem when testing an application can be that the information that the test operates upon can be in different positions in a display depending on the amount of information retrieved from the database. The test engineer can adapt their test to the display and to account for the amount of information retrieved. This problem can arise when searching a web page of a web application for the content of the UI element and not the identification (ID). This can be possible, but can have drawbacks. An example of a drawback can include the test becoming complex from recursively iterating through a list of HTML UI elements displayed by a web page. Another example of a drawback can include the creation and the maintenance of the test can rely upon a deep knowledge of the UI technology. Yet another example of a drawback can include a UI element not using attribute for displaying the content. Each HTML UI element can have its own semantic and may not use the same attribute for displaying the content. A consequence can be that the test can become sensitive to the internal structure of the UI element (e.g., HTML element). Even a minor change in the way the HTML content is generated can affect the execution of the HTML content.","Each of the various embodiments described herein can address one or more of the issues, drawbacks, or problems that can be faced when testing dynamic scenarios. One or more problems encountered in test automation of an application can be solved by using a query Application Programming Interface (API) that hides the HTML complexity and allows a tester to search the displayed information, such as by using filters and conditions. The API can be implemented for testing applications that are built on top of a Web Common User InterFace (WebCUIF) framework. Examples of applications that utilize the WebCUIF framework to display HTML content are the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications from SAP. However, the implementation is not restricted to the WebCUIF Framework technology. The same approach can be reused or specialized to handle the content generated by a wide variety of UI frameworks.","The WebCUIF framework can be the presentation layer that generates the content (e.g., HTML content) shown by an application (e.g., a CRM Application). This framework can generate UI elements (e.g., input fields, dropdown list boxes, and checkboxes) that are a composition of several HTML elements. To help automate the tests of such generated UIs the WebCUIF framework can put some meta-information in the page (e.g., in a hidden HTML SPAN element). This meta-information may not be session-dependent and can be used by the test automation framework to generate stable tests.","When testing dynamic scenarios, the test automation of these applications can access HTML content via a native Component Object Model (COM) Interface (from Microsoft\u00ae) that the Internet Explorers browser exposes. An advantage of the Microsoft\u00ae API can be that the HTML content can be explored and manipulated at runtime. The drawback can be that this HTML content can be very complex, and the direct manipulation of the internal hierarchy of HTML UI elements can lead to unstable tests. An alternative to the native COM interfaces from Microsoft\u00ae can be to use one of the query APIs described herein. The API systems described herein can be used by a test that is generated out of a recorded scenario.","Several test frameworks are available for testing business applications. Some examples include Component Based Test Automation (CBTA), which can be a Solution Manager capability that extends the Test Composition Environment (TCE), and System Analysis and Program development (SAP) Test Automation and Optimization (TAO), which can be a product integrated with third-party products. SAP TAO provides, for example, the ability to generate tests that are compliant with Hewlett Packard (HP\u00ae) Quality Center, HP\u00ae Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and HP\u00ae Quick Test Professional. Both CBTA and SAP TAO can benefit from one or more embodiments of the query API disclosed. The query API can be used to test applications that are based on web UI technologies such as Business Server Page (BSP), Web Dynpro Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP), Web Dynpro Java, or Enterprise Portal, among others.","The query APIs discussed herein can have one or more advantages, including the ability to obfuscate the UI element (e.g., HTML element) complexity and provide the ability to search for UI elements and UI element controls using filters and conditions. Another potential advantage is that the query API can be specialized to simplify common needs (e.g., the API can target by default a \u201cWorkArea\u201d page or frame where an application displays its content). Another potential advantage can include the tester not needing to understand the internal page composition structure of the object or application being tested. Yet another advantage of the API can include the API being exposed via the COM interface of a test player COM object and can therefore be called from different languages, such as Visual Basic or other programming languages or scripting languages, such as VBScript or other scripting languages. Yet another advantage of the query API can include the ability to interact with a UI of an application, rather than working directly with the application.","One or more embodiments that include one or more of the advantages discussed are described in detail below with reference to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","220","220","220","220","112","100","102","214","100","104","220","104","220"]},"The API system  can include a filter interface  and a condition interface  defining the criteria that an attribute or property of a UI element  must match before being selected by a query. The API system  can include a web application control interface  that can wrap an underlying UI element interface  (e.g., an HTML element interface) or provide convenient methods for retrieving meta-information. The API system  can include an application control collection interface  for handling collections of UI elements  when several UI elements  match the query criteria. The application query interface  can provide access to a UI control (e.g., a button, text box, tables, entry in a table, link (e.g., hyperlink), drop down list, scroll button, or title box, among others) and can help hide the complexity of the underlying native application element.","The API system  can include a web controller interface  that can be an entry point providing access to the browser session and to the browser window. The API system  can include a web query interface  that can be exposed by a query object . The query object can be executed to retrieve UI elements  or UI element controls. The API system  can include a web control collection interface  for handling collections of UI elements  when more than one UI element  matches the query criteria. The web query interface  can provide access to the application content (e.g., HTML content) via the web control interface .","The API system  can include an operation result interface  that can provide a result of an operation performed on a UI element . The UI elements  (e.g., HTML elements or CRM web controls) can be identified using a Unified Resource Identifier (URI). Examples of UI controls include input fields, dropdown list boxes, check boxes, or other controls that are composed of multiple UI elements. Each UI control can include a specific identifier element (e.g., an HTML SPAN element) that includes one or more attributes or properties that can provide meta-information. A condition  can search for a specific meta-attribute or a meta-property. The meta-attribute or meta-property can be an attribute that is retrieved from the meta-information. The meta-information can be specific to the UI element or the UI technology.","When executing a test script, the script coding corresponding to the test can be sent to the client computer and executed using a script interpreter. A runtime library can be a set of scripts providing helper classes, functions, and procedures that help simulate user interactions with the UI.","Test components are components performing operations on UI elements . A runtime library can support several UI technologies and can include a set of test components. A test component implementation can delegate operations to be performed to one or more objects (e.g., COM objects). When testing a web application, this can be done by calling one or more methods of the web controller interface  or the application controller interface .","The test components targeting a UI element  can have an input parameter specifying the URI of the UI element . The URI can be a string identifying the UI element. The URI concept can be used by the query API for identifying the UI element (e.g., web controls or CRM web controls). The URI parameter can be resolved at runtime when searching for a UI element . The URI can be generated when recording user interactions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","120","200","204","220","220","200","208","210","220","220","102","120","214","216","220","220","220","220","214","220","220"]},"The UI elements A-B can include one or more attributes or properties. Attributes or properties of a UI element A or  can include the value of the UI element A or B or the identification (ID) or URI of the UI element A or B, which can be unique within the application UI  or the application container . Other attributes or properties include the type of UI element A or B or the tagtype (e.g., sub-type) of the UI element A or B (e.g., \u201ccheckbox\u201d for a UI element that can be a checkbox, \u201cdropdown list box\u201d for a combo box, or \u201cvalue help\u201d for input fields with a button or link that opens a help box, such as the F4 help popup box). Yet other attributes or properties include the name of the UI element A or B, the view of the UI element A or B, the context of the UI element A or B, the interface associated with the UI element A or B; the row at which the UI element A or B appears; the key of UI element A or B, or the column title that contains the UI element A or B.","Other attributes or properties can include: \u201cread only\u201d as a Boolean that indicates whether the UI element A or B can be read only or read\/write, \u201cdisabled\u201d as a Boolean which indicates whether the UI element A or B can be active or inactive, \u201cclass\u201d as a list of one or more styles that are applied to the UI element A or B, or \u201chref\u201d which can be used by a UI element A or B to define where a link should navigate to, among others.","A query object  can be accessible through the application controller interface  or the web controller interface . The query object  can be configured to search the application UI , or a specific portion of the application UI , such as the application container . The query object  can search for one or more UI elements A-B that include one or more attributes or properties that match criteria specified by a filter , condition A or B, or sub-filter  of the application query object .","The one or more conditions A or B can specify one or more properties or attributes to look for in a UI element A or B. Conditions  can compare operands (e.g., an attribute or property of a UI element A or B or a user specified string or value) as strings and the comparison can be case-sensitive. In one or more embodiments, the query object  can do non-case-sensitive comparisons. This non-case-sensitive comparison can be accomplished using one or more options . The one or more conditions A-B can include the one or more options  that specify an operation that can be performed on an attribute or property specified by the condition A and the corresponding attribute or property of the UI element . The operation defined by the option  can be performed on the relevant attributes or properties before they are compared to determine if they are the same. Examples of operations that can be defined by the options  include converting to uppercase or lowercase, trimming to remove heading and trailing spaces, converting to Boolean, converting to integer; or converting to float, among others. The Boolean option can be implicit for attributes such as \u201cread only\u201d or \u201cenabled\u201d or \u201cdisabled\u201d. Converting to integer can include truncating or rounding the relevant value.","The one or more conditions  can support a plurality or operators to use in comparing the attribute or property specified in the condition  to a corresponding attribute or property of the UI element . Such operators include equals (e.g., \u201c=\u201d), does not equal (e.g., \u201c< >\u201d or \u201c!=\u201d), less than (e.g., \u201c<\u201d), greater than (e.g., \u201c>\u201d), less than or equal to (e.g., \u201c<=\u201d), greater than or equal to (e.g., \u201c>=\u201d), contains, starts with, ends with, or matches, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","222","302","304","102","120","222","306"]},"The web controller interface  can provide access to a browser session and the browser window.

The system further includes a first network and system management system stored on the at least one memory device and executable by the at least one processor to receive metric messages broadcast on a first network by network entities. The system further includes a metric message connector module stored on the at least one memory device and executable by the at least one processor.","The metric message connector module can be executable by the at least one processor, in some embodiments, to perform different data processing tasks. Such data processing tasks can include processing metric messages received by the first network and system management system to identify, based on configuration data and data of the received metric messages, metric messages to be forwarded to a second network and system management system on a second network. Further, for each received metric message identified to be forwarded to the second network and system management system, the metric message connector module can perform additional data processing tasks.","The addition data processing tasks of the metric message connector module, with regard to each metric message identified to be forwarded to the second network and system management system can include retrieving, from the at least one memory device, an XML template to populate with data of the identified metric message and mapping data that maps metric message data to fields of the XML template. The metric message connector module can then populate the XML template with data of the identified metric message according to the mapping data. Once the XML template can be populated, the metric message connector module can then transmit, via the at least one network interface device encoded within a SOAP message, the populated XML template to the second network and system management system on the second network.","Computer-readable instructions stored on a computer-readable medium are executable by the processing unit  of the computer . A hard drive. CD-ROM, and RAM are some examples of articles including a non-transitory computer-readable medium. For example, a computer program  capable of performing one or more of the methods illustrated and described herein can be stored on a non-transitory computer-readable medium. An example of such a computer program can include a computer readable storage device including instructions stored thereon, the instructions, which when executed by a machine, cause the machine to perform operations including controlling a web user interface (UI) through a web controller object that provides access to a UI of an application through a web controller interface. The computer program can include instructions that cause the machine to perform operations on application controls of the application using an application controller object configured to implement an application controller interface and expose methods for performing the operations and execute an application query object, the application query object including at least one filter with at least one condition. The computer program can include instructions that cause the machine to compare an attribute or property specified in the at least one condition to an attribute or property of a UI element of a UI control and return the UI control when the UI control includes a UI element that includes features that match the criteria defined by the at least one filter and the at least one condition.","It will be readily understood to those skilled in the art that various other changes in the details, material, and arrangements of the parts and method stages which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the inventive subject matter can be made without departing from the principles and scope of the inventive subject matter as expressed in the subjoined claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 8A","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 15"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
