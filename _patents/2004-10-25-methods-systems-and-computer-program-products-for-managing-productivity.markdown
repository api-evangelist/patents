Understanding the nature of each job, drilled down to a detailed task level, along with existing or potential factors that may affect the successful execution of each of these jobs is important in order for the business to establish realistic productivity goals and set performance standards. Existing business processes have been lacking in this level of understanding, such that any performance standards established would not likely be capable of accurate measurement in terms of whether a task was successfully completed. In addition, larger enterprises have been known to incur significant difficulties in sifting through voluminous databases of task execution data and determining which task data is relevant and how the data should be interpreted (e.g., the reason a task is reported to have exceeded a set time standard by several hours may be attributed to poor worker productivity when, in fact, an unforeseen obstacle caused the time discrepancy).","Effective tracking of worker productivity is also important in order for businesses to forecast potential changes needed in workload and address these changes so that the appropriate manpower is on hand at any given time.","Exemplary embodiments relate to methods, systems, and computer program products for managing productivity. Methods include establishing a planned execution time for performing a task. The task is assigned a unique identifier. Methods further include comparing the planned execution time with an actual execution time for performing the task and, based upon the results, calculating an efficiency rating. The actual execution time is extracted from a task dispatch system via the unique identifier. Methods also include associating the efficiency rating with one or more of: an individual performing the task, a supervisor of the individual performing the task, a group of individuals with which the individual performing the task is associated, and an organization associated with the individual performing the task.","Systems for managing productivity include a host system executing a dispatch system and a productivity management application. Systems also include a storage device in communication with the host system. The productivity management application receives a planned execution time for performing a task, compares the planned execution time with an actual execution time for performing the task. The actual execution time is extracted from a task dispatch system via a unique identifier assigned to the task. The productivity management application further calculates an efficiency rating based upon the comparisons, associates the efficiency rating with at least one of: an individual performing the task; a supervisor of an individual performing the task; a group of individuals associated with an individual performing the task; and an organization associated with an individual performing the task. The productivity management application stores the efficiency rating in the storage device.","Computer program products for managing productivity include a storage medium readable by a processing circuit and storing instructions for execution by the processing circuit for facilitating a method. The method includes establishing a planned execution time for performing a task. The task is assigned a unique identifier. The method further includes comparing the planned execution time with an actual execution time for performing the task and, based upon the results, calculating an efficiency rating. The actual execution time is extracted from a task dispatch system via the unique identifier. The method also includes associating the efficiency rating with one or more of: an individual performing the task, a supervisor of the individual performing the task, a group of individuals with which the individual performing the task is associated, and an organization associated with the individual performing the task.","Other systems, methods, and\/or computer program products according to exemplary embodiments will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon review of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, and\/or computer program products be included within this description, be within the scope of the present invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, a productivity management system is provided for facilitating the tracking and governance of performance standards established by a business enterprise. Engineered service measures include scientifically derived and physically verified times established for performing specific tasks associated with each job that is performed within the enterprise environment. These times may be based upon normal skill, prescribed methods, and for individuals working under normal conditions. Factors that may potentially affect the successful execution of each of these jobs is taken into account in order to acquire the most accurate picture of worker performance. The productivity management system also provides a method for load balance forecasting to facilitate necessary short and long term load balance assessments.","While described herein with respect to telecommunications work activities conducted by technicians in a central office environment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the productivity management activities may be equally implemented in any environment that measures the performance of task-based functions.","Turning now to , a system  upon which the productivity management activities may be implemented in accordance with exemplary embodiments will now be described. System  of  includes a host system  in communication with a storage device . The host system  depicted in  may be implemented using one or more servers operating in response to a computer program stored in a storage medium accessible by the server(s). Host system  may operate as a network server (e.g., a web server) to communicate with one or more user systems (e.g., , ). Host system  may also include a firewall (not shown) to prevent unauthorized access and enforce any limitations placed on authorized users of host system . The firewall may be implemented using conventional hardware and\/or software as is known in the art.","Host system  may also operate as an application server. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, host system  executes one or more computer programs (e.g., service order application , dispatch system , loading program , and productivity management application ) for implementing the productivity management functions described herein. Processing may be shared by one or more of user systems ,  and host system  by providing an application (e.g., java applet) to user systems , . Alternatively, one or more of user systems ,  may include stand-alone software applications for performing a portion or all of the processing described herein. As previously described, it is understood that separate servers may be utilized to implement the network server functions and the application server functions. Alternatively, the network server, the firewall, and the application server may be implemented by a single server executing computer programs (e.g., -) to perform the requisite functions.","In exemplary embodiments, service order application  receives requests for work activities such as installation tasks, repair tasks, and equipment\/service upgrade tasks. Information relating to the request is entered into service order application  and includes, e.g., a task description, a task location, a task date, etc. A service order may be generated therefrom via service order application .","In exemplary embodiments, dispatch system  receives the service orders, sorts through the information contained therein, and identifies a specific group or entity that is responsible for each order. For example, a service order requesting a new installation may be assigned to an office or entity that is geographically accessible to the installation location. Dispatch system  segregates the incoming service orders by specified criteria (e.g., geographic location of task) and builds a task record for each service order. The task records may be entered into task record table  and stored in storage device  where they await further processing.","Dispatch system  may also designate tasks relating to specified preventative maintenance or routine procedures that are assignable to a group or entity. For example, a routine procedure may be to inspect fire-extinguishing equipment at a location on a weekly basis. This preventative maintenance or routine work may also be entered into task records in table .","In exemplary embodiments, loading program  refers to an interface application used by workers (also referred to herein as technicians) for accessing daily or periodic work lists for which they are responsible. A work list may be, for example, a daily list of tasks assigned to an individual. A technician logs into loading program , enters his\/her name or identification, and prints out a work list with the task information. The assignment of tasks to a specified technician may be accomplished via loading program  by a supervisor (e.g., associating a task with a technician using the task identifier and the technician name or identification). Loading program  may also be used by a technician to enter task execution information for each assigned task. The technician may enter, for example, the starting time of the task, the time that the task was completed, and any relevant information (e.g., difficulties encountered in performing the task, a task status if the task could not be completed, etc.).","In accordance with exemplary embodiments, productivity management application  includes instructions for extracting selected task information from storage device  (e.g., task records from table ) and applying business logic to the extracted information. Selected task information and the results of the application of business logic may be recorded in productivity records in table  and\/or group records in table . The records in tables  and  are implemented in a searchable database that is accessible to authorized individuals who may then generate reports resulting from the searches. Productivity management application  may be, for example, an application programming interface that manipulates task data acquired from legacy applications (e.g., if service order application  and\/or dispatch system  are proprietary software applications). Alternatively, productivity management application , service order application , dispatch system , and\/or loading program  may be implemented as a single application with one or more layers of access permissions established for each type of user associated with the enterprise of system  (e.g., technician, supervisor, manager, corporate officers, etc.).","In exemplary embodiments, system  users at one or more geographic locations contact host system  through one or more of user systems , . User systems ,  may be coupled to host system  via a network . Each of user systems ,  may be implemented using a general-purpose computer executing a computer program for carrying out the processes described herein. The user systems ,  may be personal computers (e.g., a lap top, a personal digital assistant) or host attached terminals. If user systems ,  are personal computers, the processing described herein may be shared by one or more of user systems ,  and host system  (e.g., by providing an applet to user systems , ). For purposes of illustration, user system  is operated by a technician for retrieving daily work lists and entering executed task data, and user system  is operated by a superior of the technician for gathering performance data associated with the technician and other direct reports, as well as for generating a variety of reports.","Network  may be any type of known network including, but not limited to, a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), a global network (e.g. Internet), a virtual private network (VPN), and an intranet. Network  may be implemented using a wireless network or any kind of physical network implementation known in the art. User system  and\/or  may be coupled to host system  through multiple networks (e.g., intranet and Internet) so that not all user systems ,  are coupled to host system  through the same network. One or more of user systems ,  and host system  may be connected to network  in a wireless fashion. In one embodiment, network  is an intranet and one or more of user systems ,  execute a user interface application (e.g. a web browser) to contact host system  through network . In another exemplary embodiment, user systems ,  are connected directly (i.e., not through network ) to host system  and host system  is connected directly to or contains storage device .","Storage device  includes data relating to assigned and completed tasks for workers associated with host system  and may be implemented using a variety of devices for storing electronic information. It will be understood that storage device  may be implemented using memory contained in host system  or it may be a separate physical device. Storage device  may be logically addressable as a consolidated data source across a distributed environment that includes network . Information stored in storage device  may be retrieved and manipulated via host system  and\/or via user systems , . In addition to storing work lists, storage device  may also store task-related records and reports. The records are described further in  and the reports are described further in .","Turning now to , a block diagram of exemplary database tables utilized by host system  in implementing productivity management activities will now be described. Tables - may be stored within one or more databases that are located in storage device . Task identifier table  includes a listing of each task associated with the enterprise implementing the productivity management activities in system  of . Each task is distinguishable by a unique identifier.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","204","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIGS. 4-8","FIG. 2"],"b":["206","206","206","208","208"]},"Turning now to , an exemplary flow diagram for implementing the productivity management activities will now be described. Productivity management application  periodically extracts selected task execution data from task record table  at step . Each record in task record table  includes a task identifier that may be utilized as a key for associating the record with a productivity record in table  and\/or group record in table . Productivity management application  retrieves engineered task measurement data for the task identified in step  at step . The tasks may include items relating to, e.g., installation, maintenance, and routine jobs performed by technicians in a telecommunications central office environment. The productivity record specifies a planned time for executing the task via field  in productivity record table  of .","Business logic is applied to the extracted task execution data at step . Business logic includes, e.g., calculating the difference between the actual time it took to execute the task and the planned time for execution resulting in an overage or underage time. This difference may be determined by subtracting the TASK1_ACTSTART time in field  from the TASK1_ACTEND time in field  (both in task record table ) and then using this result, calculating the difference between the TASK1_PLND_TIME in field  (in productivity record table ) and the result. A negative number indicates that the technician performed the task in under the expected or planned task time. A positive number indicates that the task was performed in over the expected or planned task time. The overage\/underage is recorded as OVER_UNDER_TIME in field  (in productivity record table ). Using this calculation, an efficiency rating may be generated and entered as %_EFF in field  at step . Other information may be utilized along with the efficiency rating in determining overall performance. For example, the business logic may factor in obstacles that may have prevented the task from being completed, issues that may have caused the task to be only partially completed, or problems that may account for any overages in time that occurred in completing the task. This criteria and resulting data are described further in .","The results of the application of the business logic may be stored in one or more productivity records in table  of storage device  at step . The productivity records in table  are searchable by authorized individuals of system  (e.g., supervisors at user system ) and reports may be generated at step .","Turning now to  a user interface screen  is shown and described herein. A supervisor who desires performance information regarding his\/her direct reports accesses the productivity management system via a web-based user interface and is presented with screen . Screen  provides a menu of three different types of reporting options available, namely, ESM reports , trends reports , and forecast reports . ESM reports are directed to specific technician performance of assigned tasks. Sample ESM reports are shown and described in  and a sample trends report is shown and described in .","A supervisor who selects ESM reports  option is then presented with a submenu  of available ESM reports. Shown in submenu  are options for a network manager crew summary report , technician summary report , technician job list report , and management report . These reports may be further broken down into time periods. For example, the network crew summary report  may viewed as a daily report (option ) or a monthly report (option ). Once a supervisor selects a report, a subwindow  is presented which enables the supervisor to further drill down the report information by organization level and time period. For example, a supervisor may desire to view report data for a specified period of time by entering a time period in field . Organization level  may be used to view high-level report data (e.g., corporate level\/general manager). Organization level  may be used to drill down the report data within the organization of level  (e.g., by department\/office).","For purposes of illustration, a supervisor has selected to view a daily network manager crew summary report using options  and . The report period selected in subwindow  is Sep. 8, 2004.  illustrates a sample daily network manager crew summary report generated via the productivity management system. Summary report  identifies each technician associated with the supervisor via column . Performance information is differentiated into categories including ESM daily tasks in columns , ESM travel tasks in columns , ESM work time in columns , total ESM performance in columns , measurement time analysis in columns , task completion in columns , and time reporting summary in columns .","ESM daily tasks in columns  refer to everyday administrative tasks and employee work breaks. ESM travel tasks in columns  refer to the amount of time incurred in going from job to job during a given day. ESM work time in columns  refer to the amount of time associated with executing tasks assigned to the technician in a work list for a given day. Columns - are comprised of three components: plan, actual, and O\/U. Plan time refers to the amount of time a task is expected to take in accordance with the ESM measurements devised by, or on behalf of, the enterprise. This data is reflected in TASK1_PLND_TIME field  of productivity record table  as described above in . Actual time is the time the technician entered for the task and is reflected in TASK1_ACTSTART and TASK1_ACTEND fields  and , respectively, of task record table  in .","Total ESM performance in columns  refer to an aggregate of the times reflected in columns - and also includes an efficiency rating calculated from these figures using business logic adopted via the productivity management system (reflected in %_EFF field  in productivity record  of ). Measurement time analysis in columns  breaks down the percentage of time on tasks in accordance with each task's priority level assigned. This information may be useful in determining how much of the available assigned work was executed by priority. For example, low priority work is oftentimes found to be easier work as compared to higher priority work. Thus, it may be useful for a supervisor to know that a first technician who is 100% efficient has been performing consistently low priority work (e.g., checking fire extinguishers and other routine work) and a second technician who is 85% efficient has been performing consistently high priority work (e.g., a communications line at a bank is down). In addition, a total time spent on other tasks (e.g., tasks executed but not assigned to a technician) is also recorded in columns . This measurement may be entered in situations, e.g., when the technician is called to assist another technician due to unexpected circumstances.","Task completion in columns  break down tasks assigned by a number of tasks completed and partially completed, along with an percentage of completed work. A reporting errors column  is also included in report  which provides a number of errors reported for the technician for use in shedding light on any discrepancies in the actual task time incurred compared with the expected task time. Time reporting summary information in columns  refer to any anomalous work that is not measured by the enterprise or is noted but not defined. Columns  also record overtime hours incurred and capital time incurred.","Screen  provides a link to additional information if desired by the supervisor. For example, a supervisor may select view calendar option  in order to view a report for a different day. In addition, a supervisor who desires specific information about a single technician in column  may select the desired technician name and the productivity management system retrieves and presents a technician daily summary report, a sample of which is shown in . The sample report  of  is presented for a technician who was selected from line  of . As can be seen from the report , much of the same information presented in report  for this technician is also presented in report , but with greater detail. For example, the tasks performed are broken down in the report  by priority. Then, efficiency data is provided for each of the items broken down within the report .","As with the report of , report  also includes links to additional information such as a view calendar option  and a link \u201cTotal CO Operations\u201d  which, when selected, causes the productivity management system to retrieve and present a job detail report, a sample of which is shown in . Job detail report  provides specific information for the technician including additional information regarding any reporting errors (see generally items ) that were identified in report  in column . This information enables a supervisor to better understand any discrepancies in the technician's performance as represented in these reports.","As indicated above, other reports available via the productivity management system includes trends reports. A trend report provides information concerning patterns of productivity and performance issues and observations using business logic provided by, or on behalf of, the enterprise. Various types of trend reports are available for levels of hierarchy within the enterprise and includes an Office Completion report, Network manager completion report, Turf Completion report, and Weekly\/Monthly Trend report, which can further be broken down by, e.g., Office, Network Manager Turf, Area Manager Turf, General Manager Turf, Network Vice President Turf, and generally by the enterprise. A sample weekly\/monthly trend report by Network Management Turf is shown in . This and other trend reports may be generated using search criteria similar to that shown and described in . Report  displays the total number of hours worked for a period of time (e.g., September 1-4 and 5-8. This total number of hours worked is then broken down by categories and priority levels as described above.","As described above, the productivity management system facilitates the tracking and governance of performance standards established by a business enterprise using engineered service measures that include scientifically derived and physically verified times established for performing specific tasks associated with each job that is performed within the enterprise environment. Factors that may potentially affect the successful execution of each of these jobs is taken into account in order to acquire the most accurate picture of worker performance. Load balance forecasting is also implemented using the productivity management system in order to facilitate necessary short and long term load balance assessments.","As described above, embodiments may be in the form of computer-implemented processes and apparatuses for practicing those processes. In exemplary embodiments, the invention is embodied in computer program code executed by one or more network elements. Embodiments include computer program code containing instructions embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other computer-readable storage medium, wherein, when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. Embodiments include computer program code, for example, whether stored in a storage medium, loaded into and\/or executed by a computer, or transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via electromagnetic radiation, wherein, when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general-purpose microprocessor, the computer program code segments configure the microprocessor to create specific logic circuits.","While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Referring now to the drawings wherein like elements are numbered alike in the several FIGURES:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
