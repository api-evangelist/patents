No. 61\/506,905 filed 12 Jul. 2011, and entitled \u201cPosition Estimating for a Mobile Device,\u201d which is assigned to the assignee hereof and which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field","Certain aspects of this disclosure relate to position estimation for mobile devices.","2. Information","A mobile device with a receiver adapted to receive and process wireless signals may have processing capabilities to estimate a position or location of the mobile device based, at least in part, on information obtained from such received wireless signals. For example, such a mobile device may be adapted to estimate its position or determine a \u201cposition fix\u201d using one or more known techniques such as processing signals received from transmitters in satellite positioning system (SPS) to determine pseudoranges to such transmitters, estimating ranges to transmitters at known locations by measuring signal strength, just to name a few examples. There may be certain advantages and disadvantages to using particular techniques associated with, for example, accuracy, time to fix and power consumption.","One particular implementation is directed to a method performed by a special purpose computing apparatus, the method comprising: storing data representative of one or more probabilistic models in a storage medium; updating the data representative of the one or more probabilistic models based, at least in part, on historical statistical information regarding searching wireless signals; and determining an approach to search for one or more wireless signals transmitted by one or more wireless transmitters for estimating a position of a mobile device based, at least in part, on the updated data representative of the one or more probabilistic models.","Another particular implementation is directed to an article comprising non-transitory storage medium comprising machine-readable instructions stored thereon which are executable by a processor of a special purpose apparatus to: update data representative of one or more probabilistic models stored in a memory based, at least in part, on historical statistical information regarding searching wireless signals; and determine an approach to search for one or more wireless signals transmitted by one or more wireless transmitters for estimating a position of a mobile device based, at least in part, on the updated data representative of the one or more probabilistic models.","Another particular implementation is directed to an apparatus comprising: one or more receivers to receive and process wireless signals; and one or more processors programmed with instructions to: determine an approach to search for one or more wireless signals received at the one or more receivers from one or more wireless transmitters for estimating a position of a mobile device based, at least in part, on one or more probabilistic models, the one or more probabilistic models being updated based, at least in part, on historical statistical information regarding searching the wireless signals.","Another particular implementation is directed to an apparatus comprising: means for maintaining data representative of one or more probabilistic models in a storage medium; means for updating the data representative of the one or more probabilistic models based, at least in part, on historical statistical information regarding searching wireless signals; and means for determining an approach to search for one or more wireless signals transmitted by one or more wireless transmitters for estimating a position of a mobile device based, at least in part, on said updated data representative of said probabilistic models.","It should be understood, however, that these are merely example implementations and that claimed subject matter is not limited in these particular respects.","In particular implementations of a mobile device with position estimation capabilities, such a mobile device may estimate its position or location based, at least in part, on information obtained from signals received from transmitters which are positioned at known locations. For example, such a mobile device may estimate its position using anyone of several techniques such as, for example, obtaining pseudoranges to space vehicles (SVs) in a satellite positioning system (SPS), advanced forward link trilateration (AFLT) observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA) (on LTE and\/or WCDMA), associating received 802.11 MAC addresses with 802.11 access points at known locations for measuring ranges to the access points based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and\/or measured round trip time (RTT), just to name a few examples. Likewise, in attempting to obtain an estimate of its location (or \u201cposition fix\u201d), such a mobile device may search for and acquire signals transmitted by any one of several particular transmitters to obtain information enabling computation of such a position fix.","In particular implementations, in obtaining information for computing a position fix, a mobile device may select a set of signals to search for from among available signals being transmitted by known transmitters. However, selection of different particular sets of signals to search may provide different outcomes such as, for example, different time-to-fix, different power consumption or different accuracy, just to name a few examples. Accordingly, one aspect of a particular implementation is directed to selection of particular signals to search for obtaining information for use in computing a position fix.","In one aspect of a particular implementation, one or more probabilistic models associated with an ability to acquire signals from particular transmitters may be used for determining an approach for selecting signals to be searched for obtaining information for computing a position fix. In another aspect, such probabilistic models may be updated based, at least in part, on historical statistical information regarding past attempts to search for and\/or acquire signals transmitted from the particular transmitters. As described below, using such probabilistic models for selection of signals to search enables tailoring a strategy for searching signals according to particular criteria such as time to fix, power consumption and accuracy in a particular locale. In another aspect, a particular approach chosen or selected may be wirelessly broadcasted for other entities to use in collecting historical statistical information. If a location of a mobile device in question is at an entrance to an indoor building, for example, future attempts to search for SPS signals may not be fruitful, and consume battery power unnecessarily. On the other hand, an existing WiFi access point deployment could be leveraged to provide an alternate means of positioning. Consequently, a historical statistical model of this particular location may suggest to a mobile device to forego attempting to acquire SPS signals in favor of attempting to acquire signals for WiFi-based positioning. Historical statistical information may also suggest particular times (e.g., based on WiFi signal patterns) to re-attempt acquiring SPS signals. Also, these are merely examples of historical statistical information and claimed subject matter is not limited to any exact content of historical statistical information. Historical statistical information may also be expressed in any one of several forms including, for example, parameters associated with a size and type of a particular statistical distribution, an expected value an any particular form such as, for example, an average, mean, median, mode, min, max, range, or any similar form thereof. Historical statistical information may also characterize a shape of a probability distribution such as, for example, Gaussian, exponential, Poisson, Rayleigh, etc., and may indicate parameters specifying or describing such a probability distribution. In other implementations, historical statistical information may include one or more percentile values, confidence intervals, or any information implying a goodness of fit, reliability or availability. In another example implementation, signal strength information may be conveyed in a form of an estimated or specified transmitter power, an EIRP, an antenna pattern, or expected received signal strength at one or more distances from a transmitting antenna. Any of these examples of signal strength information may be referenced to a particular mobile reference implementation, with a particular noise figure or RF sensitivity, for example. A reliability of historical statistical information, or data for use in deriving historical statistical information, may be expressed using a confidence indicator. Such a confidence indicator may be conveyed in terms of probability, for example. Associated accuracy assumptions may be degraded to reflect a low confidence indicator. In the specific example in which statistical information is expressed as a distribution, a number of samples used to infer such a distribution may also be provided as a proxy for reliability information.","In one particular implementation, wireless network  in which positions of mobile devices  may be estimated at least partially by processing wireless signals  transmitted by a wireless transmitter , as described with respect to . For simplicity, only one mobile device  is shown in . It should be understood, however that wireless network  may include multiple mobile devices at different geographic locations. Wireless transmitters  may transmit wireless signals  that are received by a variety of mobile devices . In this context, wireless signals  may be transmitted in or through wireless signal interfaces or links ,  that extend from wireless transmitter  to one or more mobile devices . As shown in , a wireless transmitter  may be fixed to a spaced-based satellite that is part of a Global Navigation Satellite System travelling in a known orbit. Also as shown in , a wireless transmitter  may be fixed to a terrestrial location at an access point such as a cellular base station or wireless LAN access point. Examples of wireless signal interfaces or links ,  can include, but are not limited to, satellite-based links such as satellite positioning system (SPS) wireless links etc., as well as terrestrial wireless communication links such as cellular telephony links, WWAN links, WLAN links, WPAN links, and the like.","A position estimate or fix of a mobile device  may be obtained by processing signals received at the mobile device  using any one of several techniques. Wireless transmitters  which are either terrestrially fixed or satellite-based may be situated at particular known positions. Information relating to the position of wireless transmitters  may be known locally at a mobile device . In particular implementations, such information relating to positions of wireless transmitters  may be stored in a memory locally at a mobile device  and\/or transmitted to the mobile device  from a location server (not shown) over a wireless communication network. By having such knowledge of positions of wireless transmitters , measuring a range of a mobile device  to wireless transmitters  may provide information useful in estimating a position of mobile device . However, the usefulness of received wireless signals  in estimating a location of mobile device  may depend at least in part on characteristics of received wireless signals , which may vary based on particular environmental conditions, geographic position and\/or location of a mobile device  receiving such wireless signals . Characteristics of wireless signals  affecting such usefulness in estimating a location of mobile device  may also vary as a function of time of day, radio frequency (RF) obstructions or interferences, and\/or other such factors.","If a mobile device  receives multiple wireless signals  being transmitted by multiple different wireless transmitters , the receiving mobile device  may select a particular wireless signal  (from a particular wireless transmitter ) to process based on one or more probability models.","Estimating a position of a mobile device  based on received wireless signals  may depend on whether the mobile device  is within geographic reception areas of wireless transmitters  transmitting the received wireless signals , and also where the mobile device  is positioned within such geographic reception areas. For example, a wireless signal  as received at a mobile device  may become weaker as a range to an associated wireless transmitter  increases. Signal strength of a received wireless signal may not necessarily be closely related to a range to a wireless transmitter transmitting the received wireless signal, however. For example, other factors such as RF obstructions or interferences to wireless signal transmission may diminish strength of a wireless signal at reception.","If a particular wireless signal  identifiable as being transmitted by a particular wireless transmitter  is received at a mobile device , the mobile device  may be assumed to be within a particular range of the particular wireless transmitter  and positioned within a geographic region. For example, if geographic transmission boundaries corresponding to a transmission range of wireless transmitter  are known, then by having a mobile device  receive wireless signal from wireless transmitter , the mobile device  may be ascertained as being within geographic transmission boundaries of wireless transmitter .","Different wireless transmitters  may transmit wireless signals  utilizing different and distinct protocols, information, signal types, etc. Certain wireless signals  may be used to provide services to subscribers associated with certain mobile devices . While a user of mobile device  may subscribe to a particular service to receive the intended contents of certain particular wireless signal transmissions, wireless signal strengths associated with those wireless signal transmissions may be monitored for position estimation without such a subscription. Actually, signal strengths, wireless transmitter identifier, point of origin, and other such details of wireless signals  being transmitted by wireless transmitters  of different service providers may be monitored in this manner. In a particular implementation, a mobile device  may monitor not only wireless signals  associated with a particular service provider to which the mobile device  is subscribed, but also wireless signals provided by other service providers. Such use of wireless signals  transmitted by wireless transmitters  from multiple service providers may allow for position estimation using a larger constellation of available wireless transmitters .","Certain wireless transmitters  may include, but are not limited to: cellular base stations, satellites, pseudolites, WLAN access points, WPAN hubs, network extenders (e.g., repeaters), femto cells, just to name a few examples. As such, a wireless transmitter  may comprise a terrestrially-based transmitter or a satellite-based base transmitter such as transmitters on space vehicles (SVs) in a satellite positioning system (SPS) such as any one of several global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), ground-based pseudolites, transmitters implementing particular broadcast formats (e.g., MediaFLO, ISDB-T, DVB-H, DTV, etc.) (including broadcast-only transmitters), just to name a few examples.","Certain implementations of mobile device  may include, but are not limited to: cell phones, satellite phones, satellite radios, PDAs, asset tags and like tracking devices, notebook computers, tablets, portable data hubs, just to name a few examples. Tasks, services, or applications of mobile device  may relate to navigation, voice and\/or data, using such resources as shared or common processor writing, memory (reading, writing, storing, processing, and other operations), as well as battery power used to search wireless signals. A mobile device may be carried by a person, secured within a vehicle, provided on machinery, just to name a few examples. Certain implementations of mobile device  may have limited operational resources. Hence, performing certain tasks or applications may be expected to consume some amount of one or more of these resources.","Particular wireless signals  (associated with wireless signal interfaces or links , ) may have distinct operating characteristics, and impart distinct costs, reliabilities and the like associated with enabling position estimating operations associated with a mobile device . Characteristics of at least one wireless transmitter  may affect dimensions, reliability, and\/or other characteristics of a wireless signal interface or link ,  and associated wireless signal . A variety of factors may be considered in determining a desirability of processing signals from a particular wireless signal interface or link ,  to select for use in estimating position of a mobile device . Such factors may include, but are not limited to: a) how quickly a position estimate may be obtained; b) a likely power consumption or an expected amount of battery power used for searching and\/or processing the particular wireless signal; c) availability of alternative wireless signals to process for use in estimating a position; d) expected or likely accuracy of detection or measurement of an expected signal; e) likely accuracy of measurement; f) likelihood of receiving expected signal; g) likely time to fix and\/or h) availability of particular resources at the mobile device  to process the received signal, just to name a few examples.","In particular implementations, a mobile device  may obtain a position estimate or position fix from processing multiple wireless signals  transmitted over multiple respective wireless signal interfaces or links , . Here, a mobile device  may search in attempt to detect wireless signal characteristics of and\/or information transmitted in one or more of such multiple wireless signals . Such signal characteristics of and\/or information transmitted in selected wireless signals  associated with particular transmitters may be detected or obtained by searching and processing the selected wireless signals . Such signal characteristics and\/or information may include, for example, signal strength, code phase, round-trip delay, transmitter identification information (e.g., identification of one or more transmitters such as WLAN MAC addresses associated with transmitters at known locations, CDMA pn offsets), transmitter timing information, just to name a few examples. Transmitter timing information may include, for example, one or more error estimates associated with the timing of a signal transmitted by a transmitter, a relationship between a framing structure of a signal transmitted by at least one transmitter and a standardized time source.","In this context, \u201csearch\u201d or \u201csearching\u201d a wireless signal  transmitted from a wireless transmitter  may include any one or a combination of signal processing techniques for use in detecting or measuring particular characteristics of and\/or obtaining information transmitted in a received wireless signal  (e.g., for the purpose of estimating a position of a receiver). Such signal processing techniques may include, for example, digital sampling and filtering, analog filtering, coherent or incoherent integration, correlation, application of discrete fourier transforms, peak detection and related logic, data channel or packet processing, just to name few examples.","In estimating its position, according to an implementation, a mobile device  may select a set of particular wireless signals  to search based, at least in part, on one or more probabilistic models. Such probabilistic models may characterize an ability of mobile device  to extract information from processing particular wireless signals  for use in obtaining a position estimate. For example, such a probabilistic model may provide a probability of obtaining sufficiently accurate and reliable information given one or more conditions. In one particular implementation, such a probabilistic model may provide a probability of reliably detecting, measuring and\/or acquiring a wireless signal  transmitted by a particular wireless transmitter  given certain conditions such as, for example, time of day, an indication of an available battery power, approximate location of mobile device  within a coverage area, current RF environment, satellite azimuth and\/or elevation angle, just to name a few examples. In other implementations, such a probabilistic model may provide a probability of extracting transmitter identification information (e.g., MAC address), a round trip delay or code phase detection under one or more similar conditions. Of course these are merely examples of how a probabilistic model may characterize an ability of a mobile device to extract characteristics and\/or information from searching particular wireless signals according to particular implementations, and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.","According to particular implementations, the aforementioned probabilistic models may be used in determining a particular search strategy associated with estimating a position of mobile device  based upon characteristics and\/or information extracted from received wireless signals . For example, and as discussed above, a mobile device  may select from among several wireless signals , transmitted by associated wireless transmitters , to obtain information for use in estimating its position. Here, such a mobile device  may select to search a wireless signal , from among available wireless signals , based, at least in part, on one or more of the above described probabilistic models. For example, mobile device  may select a particular wireless signal  to search based, at least in part, on a probability that such a search would yield sufficiently accurate and reliable information, given particular conditions at the time the search is to be performed. A time that a search is to be performed, if referenced against probabilistic information regarding how often and when a mobile device was observed to be able to detect a certain transmitter or transmitter type, may be useful. For example, a probabilistic model may account for times when a mobile device is at a \u201chome\u201d location, with its respective transmitters in-view, and when the mobile device is at a \u201cwork\u201d location with a different set of transmitters known to be in-view. Another example of such a may be a tendency of a mobile device to be able to acquire signals transmitted by satellites in a particular portion of the sky. If a mobile device dwells for a significant duration in an environment where satellites in a portion of the sky are blocked from view, SPS signals may be easier to acquire in a portion of the sky that typically has a satellite in view. In such a case, it may be useful to model GNSS availability by azimuth and\/or elevation angle at a given location. However, this is merely an example of how a mobile device may apply a probabilistic model in selecting a particular wireless signal to search and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.","In one implementation, information and\/or digital signals representative of probabilistic models may be stored and maintained in a memory (not shown) associated with an aggregating entity . Here, such mobile device  may access and obtain such stored probabilistic models for use in determining a strategy for searching wireless signals  (e.g., selecting a particular set of signals to be searched) for use in estimating a position of mobile device . In one particular implementation, stored probabilistic models may be derived and\/or updated based, at least in part, on historical statistical information gathered in the course of attempts to search wireless signals  transmitted from particular wireless transmitters . For example, aggregating entity  may obtain such historical statistical information gathered from one or more mobile devices  in the course of searching for wireless signals  of interest transmitted from the particular wireless transmitters . A mobile device  may also maintain salient information available from previous processing of such search results to communicate using one of many available wireless communication protocols or to perform a position fix. In an alternative implementation, such a mobile device  may gather such historical statistical information from a network server. Here, such historical statistical information may be received at a mobile device  in a communication session such as in a wireless communication link or from a wired connection (e.g., at a USB port or Internet connection). In another example, mobile device  may receive historical statistical information which is wirelessly broadcasted over a broadcast network. Of course, these are merely examples of how historical statistical information may be obtained for use in determining or updating a probabilistic model, and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.","In one implementation, such historical statistical information may indicate a success or failure associated with an attempt to search a wireless signal  from a particular wireless transmitter , and any other associated conditions. Such \u201csuccess\u201d in searching a wireless signal may be determined if information is obtained from the searched signal for use in computing a position fix. In one particular example, success or failure in searching for a wireless signal may be based, at least in part, on an absolute or relative signal strength threshold applied in a detection technique, for example. Historical statistical information may also include a duration elapsed to acquire at least one searched wireless signal. Historical statistical information may also include indications of accuracy of received signals gathered from an a priori or a posteriori means. Here, an a priori means may measure and\/or determine absolute or relative signal strength, mapped multipath behavior, correlation peak shape and\/or quantity or observed rate of measurement outliers. An a posteriori means may measure and\/or determine a presence of navigation solution outliers, unit fault for an entire navigation solution or component unit faults for each measurement type of interest. Aggregating entity  may then update and\/or derive one or more of the aforementioned probabilistic models by processing the gathered historical statistical information using for example, mean, median, variance, Bayesian estimation, parametric filtering (including sign test filters, quartile filters, etc.), histograms, weighting, Hidden Markov modeling and\/or other filtering techniques to derive one or more of the aforementioned probabilistic models. These models may be updated by aggregating entity  in near real-time, for example. Alternatively, such models may be updated in a batch. In one aspect, a mobile device  may, following a failed attempt to acquire a signal transmitted from a transmitter , reattempt to acquire the signal. Here, determining a particular approach to search for a wireless signal may comprise determining a time to re-attempt acquiring the wireless signal based, at least in part, on updated historical statistical information.","The particular implementation of  shows that aggregating entity  is disposed within a network entity such as location server , which may communicate with one or more mobile devices  through a wireless network connected to mobile switching center , for example. In other implementations, however, such an aggregating entity may reside on a particular mobile device  that is tailoring a strategy to search wireless signals for obtaining a position fix for the particular mobile device . In other implementations, such an aggregating entity may reside on a first mobile device  while a second mobile device  communicates with the first mobile device  for obtaining access to stored signals representative of probabilistic models. In another example implementation, aggregating entity  may be accessible through the Internet via a web service or \u201ccloud\u201d using any one of several Internet protocols. Based, at least in part on such accessed probabilistic models, the second mobile or portable device  may then select signals to search as discussed above. Here, the second mobile or portable device  may communicate with the first mobile device  using any one of several techniques such as, for example, mobile to mobile messaging through mobile switching center  or peer-to-peer communication, just to name a couple of examples.","Any one of several applications hosted on a mobile device  may use an estimated position, frequency and\/or clock state of the mobile device . Such a frequency and\/or clock state of a mobile device  may be based, at least in part, on one or more internal or external temperature readings from sensors, combined with an internally held model for changes in frequency of a local oscillator used for controlling frequency and\/or clock state with respect to a measured temperature. In a particular implementation, location server  and\/or aggregating entity  may be operated and\/or maintained by a service provider. Certain implementations of location server  may be provided with suitable processing power and computational characteristics to derive, maintain, store, and\/or update information descriptive of probabilistic models as discussed below.","Upon collection of historical wireless signal statistical information at mobile device  or other device, such historical wireless signal statistical information may be transported to other devices or systems to be maintained, stored, aggregated, updated, or otherwise processed for deriving and\/or updating probabilistic models. In a particular implementation, location server  and\/or aggregating entity  may receive collected historical wireless signal statistical information, and derive and\/or update aforementioned probabilistic models accordingly.","In a particular implementation, geographic or spatial movement (or repositioning) of a mobile device  may be referenced relative to a reference. As such, the position of mobile device  may be expressed in reference to various coordinate axes. Particular implementations may employ one or more of a variety of techniques in estimating a position of mobile device  for use in navigation applications, for example.","According to particular implementations, and as pointed out above, mobile device  may select any one of several different search strategies for obtaining information for use in estimating a position of mobile device . In the particular example of wireless network , a position of mobile device  may be estimated based at least in part on: a) a wireless signal  transmitted from space vehicles in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS); or alternately b) signals transmitted by wireless transmitters  which are terrestrially-based using Advanced Forward Link Trilateration (AFLT)-based wireless signal , just to name two examples. While acquisition of SPS-based wireless signals may provide relatively high accuracy (e.g., on the order of ten meters), use of such techniques may consume considerably more power at a mobile device  than using AFLT, for example. Here, if an AFLT technique is used to estimate a position of mobile device  with sufficient accuracy, such a technique may be selected over processing signals transmitted by space vehicles of a GNSS if less energy is likely to be used, for example. For example, accurate position estimation of mobile device  may be provided particularly easily if mobile device  is determined to be physically close to a wireless transmitter  which is terrestrially-based. Such proximity may be estimated in certain instances using signal strengths, transmitter ID, etc.","In another implementation, different search strategies may include searching for signals transmitted by WLAN access points versus search for GNSS signals. For example, depending on a rough location of a mobile device , signals transmitted from a WLAN access point may be searched first, followed by searching for GNSS signals if searching for signals from WLAN access points is not successful. In such a case, success may be defined by estimated accuracy, number of transmitters from which signals are received and acquired, probability of a mobile device having moved based, at least in part, on received signal characteristics, just to name a few success criteria.","In some implementations, GNSS assistance data such as, for example, rough position may be available to a mobile device  to enable a quicker position fix. In other implementation environments, such GNSS assistance data may not be available. To obtain a rough position, a mobile device  may first determine a rough position using any one of several terrestrial positioning techniques such as AFLT. Here, a mobile device  may employ probabilistic models in determining a strategy for searching for base station pilot signals (e.g., CDMA pilot signals) for obtaining pilot signal strength measurements. Such probabilistic models may be further extended for searching for signals transmitted from sources other than cellular base stations such as, for example, signals transmitted from WLAN access points, signals transmitted by broadcast-only transmitters, just to name a few examples. Probabilistic models may incorporate not just a probability of search success, given a particular environment, but also a probability of detecting a signal after a certain amount of time has been elapsed while searching, according to a particular model of diminishing returns, for example. Thus, probabilistic models may be revisited from time to time during a search process based, at least in part, on intermediate search results for determining a search strategy for an on-going search, or to determine when to abandon searching a particular signal transmitted by a particular transmitter. Such a strategy may incorporate probabilistic information for a likelihood that a signal would be detected at a given range of signal strengths or at various times since a last search was performed based, at least in part, on results of prior searches.","As pointed out above, information or signals descriptive of or representing probabilistic models for use in selecting a search strategy may be stored in memories or databases of an aggregating entity (e.g., aggregating entity ) in a form to allow such information to be retrieved and\/or updated. Such probabilistic models may be stored in memory, database, or other like memory device, and indicate probabilities of detecting or acquiring, such as may be used in estimating position with a sufficient degree of reliability and\/or accuracy as discussed above.","As pointed out above, certain implementations of a mobile device  may use probabilistic models to estimate a probability of successfully searching wireless signals  to obtain information for computing a position fix. As such, a mobile device and\/or its user may consider tailoring its position estimating wireless signal search strategy based at least partially on one or more probabilistic models, relating to such factors as a desired level of accuracy, timeliness, energy consumption, cost of service, remaining battery energy, user settings, etc.","In one particular implementation, certain probabilistic models, as described above, may model a probability of success of position estimation using particular combinations of wireless signals . In particular implementations, such a probabilistic model may condition such probabilities of success based, at least in part, on any one of several factors. For example, such probabilities of success may be based, at least in part, one or more approximate or rough estimate of a location of a mobile device  receiving wireless signals in a particular geographic region. In other implementations, such a probability of success may be conditioned on any one of several other factors such as, for example, time of day, day of week, time of year, device sensitivity, expected signal strength, expected signal availability, device temperature and expected signal accuracy, just to name a few examples. In one implementation, a mobile device  may search for signals based, at least in part, on more than one coarse location estimates, in turn. For example, such a mobile device  may search for signals based, at least in part, on a \u201chome\u201d profile first during a time of day that the mobile device  had been historically found to be at \u201chome\u201d. If, however, a mobile device  is not found to be \u201chome\u201d, the mobile device  may search for signals using a strategy designed for a historically known \u201coffice\/work\u201d location. Likewise, a mobile device  may start a search at an \u201coffice\/work\u201d location if a time of day\/week indicates the mobile device  is more likely to found there. Likewise, other factors or historically known device states may be taken into account. For example, commute times and usage history during each of these time states. A mobile device  may run location-based applications more often based, at least in part, on its coarse location, the time of day and\/or week, etc. and these usage histories may be used to determine times that the mobile device  is more likely to need a background position fix, or the coarse location at which the device most often needs location services.","In certain implementations, location server  and\/or aggregating entity  may maintain almanac data associated with wireless signal interfaces or links  and . Such almanac data may in one exemplary implementation comprise a database of information descriptive, indicative or representative of estimated positions or locations of wireless transmitters  (e.g., by latitude, longitude and height or earth-centered coordinates) and\/or coverage areas served by any of the wireless transmitters . Such almanac data may further associate such information descriptive of locations of wireless transmitters  with identification information (e.g. MAC address or cell tower identifier, etc.). Here, for example, a mobile device  may determine known locations of wireless transmitters  from such almanac data. In particular implementations, mobile device  may compute a position fix based, at least in part, on measured ranges (e.g., pseudoranges) to said to such wireless transmitters , in combination with such known locations. In other implementations where, for example, a wireless transmitter  has a short range and\/or small coverage area, a mobile device  may estimate its location by merely associating transmitter identification information (e.g., a MAC address) obtained from a signal received from the wireless transmitter  with a location of the wireless transmitter  obtained from almanac data. It should be understood, however, that these are merely examples of how almanac data descriptive of locations of transmitters may be used in computing a position fix of a mobile device , and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.","Probabilistic models maintained in aggregating entity  may comprise, for example, Hidden Markov Models Bayesian estimators, parametric filters (e.g., sign test filters, quartile filters, etc.), histograms or weighting, as discussed above, and may be used to model states (such as wireless signal and position estimating states) of wireless transmitters , wireless signals , wireless service or coverage areas, as well as wireless signal interfaces or links , . Here, such a probabilistic model may model an ability of a mobile device  to obtain information for use in estimating its position using a particular wireless signal interface or link , .","In a particular implementation, stored signals representing probabilistic models maintained in aggregating entity  may be updated and returned to a mobile device . Such probabilistic models, in particular implementations, may model probabilistic distributions of wireless signals  received at the mobile device . Such probabilistic distributions may indicate a probability that particular wireless signals  that may be received by the mobile device  under certain conditions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"302"},"At block , one or more probability models maintained at block  are updated based, at least in part, on historical statistical information. As discussed above in one particular example, such historical statistical information may comprise an indication of success or failure to search for a wireless signal from a particular transmitter under certain conditions. Accordingly, such historical statistical information may be indicative of search success rates associated with searching signals transmitted by particular wireless transmitters . In another alternative aspect, such historical statistical information may be indicative of signal strengths associated with signals transmitted by particular transmitters. Here, for example, such probabilistic models may be affected by measured signal strengths under particular conditions and may model signal strengths under such conditions.","In another alternative aspect, such historical statistical information may be associated with a particular position and\/or identifier of a mobile device  receiving signals from a particular wireless transmitter . Here, associating such historical statistical information with particular mobile devices  and locations of same permits updating of probabilistic models (e.g., for determining a probability of successfully searching a signal) as conditioned on a location and\/or identity of a receiving device.","In another alternative aspect, historical statistical information may be associated with signals transmitted from a particular transmitter type of a plurality of transmitter types. In one particular example, such historical statistical information may be indicative of successes and failures associated with attempts to search signals transmitted from at least one bi-directional wireless access point. In another particular example, such statistical historical information may be indicative of successes and failures associated with attempts to search signals from a broadcast-only transmitter.","In another alternative aspect, historical statistical information may be indicative of attempts to search signals for use in at least one communication application (e.g., voice or data). In one particular example, such historical statistical information may be indicative of a pilot strength measurement message (PSMM) in a 1\u00d7CDMA network. In another particular example, such historical statistical information may be indicative of a network measurement response (NMR) in a GSM network. In another particular example, such historical statistical information may be indicative of an Measured Results List (MRL) associated with a WCDMA or LTE system. Of course these are merely examples of attempts to search signals for use in communication applications according to particular implementations, and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. Here, historical statistical information may be mobile device dependent, aggregated over multiple mobile devices , or a combination thereof. In this particular implementation, historical statistical information may be maintained on a mobile device  or on a separate aggregating network device (e.g., aggregating entity ).","In another alternative aspect, historical statistical information may include a list of a plurality of wireless signals searched by a particular mobile device . Here, for example, such a list may include an indication as to whether individual signals listed (e.g., signals transmitted by particular transmitters) were searched successfully by the particular mobile device . Also, such a list may also include information indicating an amount of energy expended or power used to search for the particular searched signals, time required, received signal strength, etc.","In particular implementations, as discussed above, historical statistical information may be provided to an aggregator, such as aggregating entity , as part of a bi-directional communication session (e.g., with a particular mobile device searching for signals and providing historical statistical information regarding same). During such a bi-directional communication session, for example, a mobile device may forward historical statistical information associated with or descriptive of multiple transmitters or transmitter types. For example, such information associated with or descriptive of multiple transmitters or transmitter types may be transmitted on a forward link of such a bi-directional communication session. Alternatively, such information associated with or descriptive of multiple transmitters or transmitter types may be transmitted on a reverse link of such a bi-directional communication session.","In a particular implementation, aggregating entity  may receive historical statistical information (as discussed above) from a plurality of sources (e.g., multiple mobile devices ) and update associated probabilistic models based, at least in part on such historical statistical information received from such multiple sources. In a particular example, aggregating entity  may receive historical statistical information from multiple mobile devices  regarding signals searched from the same particular transmitter. The multiple mobile devices  may also have received the received signals while positioned at different locations and under different conditions, etc. Here, aggregating entity  may then \u201caggregate\u201d historical statistical information received from multiple sources to build and\/or update one or more probabilistic models associated with that particular transmitter based on multiple searches from different locations and different conditions, etc.","In one particular implementation, aggregating entity  may aggregate historical statistical information from multiple sources which is descriptive of timing information associated with particular transmitters. For example, wireless transmitters  may transmit signals having characteristics which are synchronized to a particular timing reference. Such timing or calibration information may be used, for example, in computing or correcting ranges or pseudoranges to transmitters. In a particular example, such signals may comprise the phase of a framing structure that is referenced to a particular standard time stamp, or a time stamp associated with a particular framing phase. As such, aggregating entity  may also aggregate time information received from multiple sources to associate a detected signal phase with a timing estimate for a particular signal being transmitted by a wireless transmitter . Such timing information may also be used, for example, in estimating a phase or frequency of received signals relative to signal timing references for the purpose of narrowing time and\/or frequency search windows.","In another particular implementation, aggregated historical statistical information may be associated with and\/or comprise an identification of transmitters within a particular operating region. For example, aggregating entity  may aggregate and associate historical statistical information with identities of transmitters as indicated in an almanac of transmitters in a particular operating region. In one particular implementation, such an almanac may organize information associated with the transmitters in such an operating region using a hierarchical identification structure. Where such an operating region covers an area serviced by a GSM system, for example, aggregating entity  may associate transmitters and\/or historical statistical information with a location area code (LAC), and then cell IDs (CIDs) within such an LAC. Similarly, where such an operating region covers an areas serviced by a UMTS system, aggregating entity  may associate transmitters and\/or historical statistical information with an identifier associated with radio network controllers (RNCs), and then cell IDs associated with such an RNC. In a Long Term Evolution (LTE) and\/or other 4G implementation, aggregated historical statistical information may be organized around other, different, hierarchical and non-hierarchical frameworks such as a global cell identifier and\/or a subset of a global cell identifier. It should be understood that while a hierarchical organization of historical statistical information may allow for a reduction in redundancy of almanac information in general, claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.","Based, at least in part on probabilistic models updated at block , block  may determine one or more approaches for searching signals for the purpose of estimating a location and\/or obtaining a position fix. As pointed out above, a mobile device  may employ any one of several different approaches to search signals for the purpose of estimating a location and\/or obtaining a position fix. As discussed above, a particular approach may be selected based, at least in part, on an updated probabilistic model such as, for example, a probabilistic model of a conditional probability of successfully searching particular signals from particular wireless transmitters . As such, a particular approach for searching may comprise selection of at least one signal to be searched by a mobile station.","In a particular example, an approach for searching signals for the purpose of estimating a location and\/or obtaining a position fix may indicate a particular transmitter type to be searched. For example, a particular approach may include searching SPS signals transmitted by SVs in a global navigation satellite system. Alternatively, such an approach may include searching signals transmitted by terrestrial base stations as part of an attempt to obtain a position fix using AFLT. A probability of detecting a pilot signal maybe determined, at least in part, from historical AFLT or PSMM information. In addition, such an approach may identify signals from particular transmitters to be searched. For example, if more than four SVs of an SPS are \u201cin view\u201d of a mobile station , such an approach may select the four most likely to be acquired for providing a sufficiently accurate position fix based, at least in part, on updated probabilistic information.","In another particular implementation, an approach for searching signals may specify a Doppler window of a particular signal from a particular transmitter and\/or transmitter type to be searched. Referring again to the particular example approach of searching one or more SPS signals from SVs, a particular approach determined at block  may also specify particular a Doppler window to be employed for searching a signal transmitted by a particular SV. Here, for example, a probabilistic model may indicate a particular probability of successfully searching such a signal conditioned, for example, on Doppler window size. Similarly, in another particular implementation, an approach for searching signals may specify a particular transmitter type and\/or specific transmitter to be searched. Referring again to the particular example approach of searching one or more SPS signals from SVs, a particular approach determined at block  may specify particular epochs in an SPS signal to be searched. Here, for example, a probabilistic model may indicate a particular probability of successfully searching such a signal conditioned, for example, on particular time windows to search. Such time windows may comprise, for example, fractional parts of a GPS code epoch or fractions of a navigation message epoch for which the navigation message is either well known or has more desirable properties for search sensitivity. Power consumption in connection with conducting a particular search may be conditioned, at least in part, on a size of Doppler and\/or time windows.","In another particular implementation, an approach for searching signals may specify a selection of a particular search mode from multiple such search modes. For example, in searching for an SPS signal transmitted by an SV, a particular searching approach may specify a short dwell or a longer dwell for obtaining a code phase detection based, at least in part, on an expected received signal strength or expected received signal attenuation in a particular geographic region. Of course, this is merely one particular example of how a searching approach may involve selection of a search mode from among a plurality of search modes and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.","In another particular implementation, an approach for searching signals may be selected subject to particular target accuracy level associated with a position fix to be obtained from searching such signals. For example, such a target accuracy level may rule out particular lower accuracy searching techniques in favor of other searching techniques that provide sufficient accuracy. In another particular implementation, an approach for searching signals may be selected subject to a power consumption constraint. For example, such a power consumption constraint may rule out using particular power-costly searching techniques in favor of other searching techniques that are more power efficient. In yet another particular implementation, an approach for searching signals may be subject to a target time to fix. For example, such a constraint on time to fix may rule out using particular searching techniques likely to yield a longer time to fix in favor of other particular searching techniques likely to yield a shorter time to fix.","In yet another particular implementation, block may  may determine scores associated with available candidate approaches for searching signals for obtaining a position fix. Such a score may be determined from a plurality of factors such as, for example, likely power consumption, likely accuracy and\/or likely time to fix. Other factors may include, for example, an observed signal strength, a size of coverage area serving a mobile device  and\/or a type of transmitter transmitting the searched wireless signal (e.g., cellular base station tower, femtocell, IEEE std. 802.11 access point, etc). It should be understood, however, that this is merely an example of factors that may be evaluated for determining a score associated with an available candidate approach for searching signals and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.","As pointed out above, any one of several techniques may be selected as an approach or strategy to estimate a position of a mobile device based, at least in part, on wireless signals received at the mobile device . In particular implementations, trilateration based upon use of timing information relating to transmissions sent between wireless transmitters  and a mobile device  may be used to estimate a position of mobile device . One approach, called Advanced Forward Link Trilateration (AFLT) as implemented in CDMA or Enhanced Observed Time Difference (EOTD) in GSM or Observed Time Difference of Arrival (OTDOA) on WCDMA and\/or LTE, measures at a mobile device  relative times of arrival of wireless signals  transmitted from wireless transmitters . These relative times of arrival of wireless signals  transmitted from wireless transmitters  may be transmitted to a location server (e.g., a Position Estimation Entity (PDE) in CDMA), which may thereupon estimate a position of mobile device using these times of reception. Alternatively, these measurements may be used to estimate a position of a mobile station  at the mobile device , if sufficient almanac information is available. Transmit times at a wireless transmitters  may be coordinated such that at a particular instance of time, times-of-day associated with multiple wireless transmitters  are within a particular error bound. Known positions of wireless transmitters  and times of reception may be used to estimate positions of mobile devices. Certain implementations of location server  may also monitor emissions from wireless transmitters  in an effort to estimate relative timing of these emissions; thereby relative distances as well as resulting position may be estimated at location server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["600","600","102","670","672"]},"A baseband processor  may be adapted to provide baseband information from a central processing unit (CPU)  to transceiver  for transmission over a wireless communications link.

In this context, in an MSB operational mode, a position fix for a mobile device  may be computed on the mobile device . In an MSA operational mode, a position fix for a mobile device  may be computed remotely on a server which is separate from the mobile device . In an MSAB mode, a position fix for a mobile device  may be computed either on the mobile device  or remotely on a server which is separate from the mobile device . API  may also specify other information to be reported by hybrid manager  such as, for example, horizontal estimated position error (HEPE), subsystem status, signal measurements, just to name a few examples. API  may also supply GNSS assistance data. In a particular implementation, API  may be defined independently of any particular over-the-air protocols.","As shown in the particular example of hybrid location manager , information used in satisfying a request for location information may be obtained based, at least in part, on measurements from one or more of acquiring GNSS signals through GNSS Measurement Engine (ME) , receiving signals from one or more WLAN access points through WiFi driver , processing terrestrial wireless signals using WWAN ME  and\/or Sector-cell-ID circuitry\/logic , and inertial sensors .

In one example, hybrid manager  may configure such subsystems to be in an on, off or auto-select operational state.","In a particular implementation, upon receiving a request for location information from API , hybrid manager  may evaluate available hybrid positioning options, and choose an appropriate combination of measurement techniques to meet the request. Hybrid manager  may make such a choice based, at least in part, on knowledge regarding the capabilities of various positioning subsystems including, for example, achievable position measurement accuracy, achievable RF sensitivity, achievable time-to-fix performance, expected power consumption, any assistance data or database access needed and\/or any requirements for calibration prior to autonomous operation, just to name a few examples. Hybrid manager  may also make such a choice based, at least in part, on an operational status of various positioning subsystems such as, for example, cold start, warm start or hot start.","In a particular implementation, hybrid manager  may choose a particular combination of measurement techniques based, at least in part, context and environmental information received from context and environment awareness engine . For example, hybrid manager  may activate a particular positioning subsystem while environmental and context conditions are favorable (e.g., for obtaining positioning measurements) for the particular positioning subsystem, and deactivate the particular positioning subsystem while such environmental and context conditions are not favorable. Based upon a chosen hybrid option, hybrid manager  may individually command affected positioning subsystems, initiate mode transitions and obtain measurements. Hybrid manager  may also perform quality of service checks, report measurements, status, errors and\/or other information as requested and as available. Hybrid manager  may also request assistance data (e.g., GNSS ephemeris, almanac data, etc.) from assistance data manager  for use by various positioning subsystems in processing received signals for obtaining positioning measurements. Assistance data manager  may provide assistance data in real-time based, at least in part, on internal operational status, system configuration, location mode and time-to-fix. In a particular implementation, assistance data manager may determine whether assistance data is available internally from other subsystems without obtaining assistance data externally (e.g., using resources of a communication network). An assistance data manager  may update local assistance data in local database  via local database manager  from time to time or as needed. Local database  may store assistance data such as, for example, WLAN tiles and base station almanac information.","Hybrid manager  may also perform power management to enhance power efficiency. For example, hybrid manager  may reduce power consumption by putting a positioning subsystem into a low power mode or lower scanning rate while the particular subsystem is static.

In a third level of data fusion, individual measurements from two or more of GNSS position engine , WiFi position engine , AFLT position engine , sector-cell-ID position engine  and\/or inertial position engine  for the purpose of computing a single location estimate. Here, in this particular implementation, such a third level of data fusion may combine measurements obtained from different position engines to compute a location estimate where measurements from any single position engine may be insufficient and\/or incomplete to compute such a location estimate.","By combining measurements and\/or location estimates obtained from multiple position engines, hybrid position engine  may achieve a higher availability than is possible with only a single position engine. In particular implementations, hybrid position engine  may also support MSAB mode, which may simultaneously execute MSA and MSB modes. While in MSAB mode, hybrid position engine  may report location estimates and measurements to hybrid manager  as they become available.

Pseudolites may comprise ground-based transmitters that broadcast a PRN code or other ranging code (e.g., similar to a GPS or CDMA cellular signal) modulated on an L-band (or other frequency) carrier signal, which may be synchronized with GPS time. Such a transmitter may be assigned a unique PRN code so as to permit identification by a remote receiver. Pseudolites may be useful in situations where SPS signals from an orbiting satellite might be unavailable, such as in tunnels, mines, buildings, urban canyons or other enclosed areas. Another implementation of pseudolites is known as radio-beacons. The term satellite, as used herein, is intended to include pseudolites, equivalents of pseudolites, and possibly others. The term SPS signals, as used herein, is intended to include SPS-like signals from pseudolites or equivalents of pseudolites.","While certain exemplary techniques have been described as shown herein using various methods and systems, those skilled in the art that various other modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted should understand it. Additionally, many modifications may be made to adapt to a particular situation to teachings of claimed subject matter without departing from central concepts described herein. Therefore, claimed subject matter may not be limited to particular examples disclosed, but that such claimed subject matter may also include all implementations falling within the scope of appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
