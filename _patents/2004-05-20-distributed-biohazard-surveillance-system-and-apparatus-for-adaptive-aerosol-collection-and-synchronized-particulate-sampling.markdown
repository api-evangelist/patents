No. 10\/849,451, entitled \u201cDistributed Biohazard Surveillance System and Apparatus for Adaptive Aerosol Collection and Particulate Sampling,\u201d Navy Case No. 83,657, filed on May 19, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,006,923, hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention (Navy Case No. 96395) was developed with funds from the United States Department of the Navy. Licensing inquiries may be directed to the Office of Patent Counsel. Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego, Code 20012, San Diego, Calif., 92152: telephone (619)553-3001.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to biohazard surveillance systems and more particularly to an adaptive distributed system for the collection and sampling of hazardous particulates.","2. Description of the Related Art","The challenges we face from biological threat agents are increasing. While microbes continue to evolve and biotechnology becomes more powerful, the inherent hazards to humans, plants, and animals from infectious microorganisms are greatly increased by their intentional use by terrorists. The need for faster and better capabilities for warning, response, and cleanup was painfully evident in the case of a small-scale deployment of a noncontagious, naturally occurring anthrax pathogen. Terrorist use of other biological agents may result in far greater loss of life; agents that might be contagious or perhaps engineered for increased virulence and resistance to medical treatment. As microbes evolve and compete for survival, naturally emerging threats must also be quickly identified and distinguished from suspected terrorism. While the focus on bioterrorism is driven primarily by concerns about attacks on humans, attacks on livestock and\/or crops can be just as devastating. A recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain demonstrates the devastating effect microbes can have on livestock and the consequent effect on food supply and economies. Rogue states have actively explored both animal and plant pathogens as weapons.","Lessons learned from the Persian Gulf War highlighted the need for biological warfare agent detectors and the subsequent solutions improved capability on the battlefield. However, other biological hazard (\u201cbiohazard\u201d) surveillance deficiencies were soon recognized in the aftermath of conflict. \u201cGulf War Syndrome\u201d and other ailments suffered by military personnel revealed a need for compact diagnostic tools with integrated sample-processing and detection capabilities to quickly identify disease-causing agents on and off the battlefield. In 1998, a consolidated approach was begun (at the Army Medical Institute for Infectious Diseases) to develop medical diagnostic systems using a common platform for biohazard identification entitled \u201cThe Common Diagnostic Systems for Biological Threats and Endemic Infectious Diseases.\u201d Research encompassed development of rapid sample-processing methods, identification technologies, reagents and size reduction of laboratory analysis platforms.","In 2002, the Department of Defense (DoD) defined a new approach to a common medical test platform for identifying biological warfare agents and pathogens of operational concern. The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) exemplifies this approach. JBAIDS will be configured to support reliable, fast, and specific identification of biological agents from a variety of clinical specimens and environmental sources. JBAIDS will enhance force protection by providing commanders with information to determine actions to protect against and avoid contamination and to restore operations following an attack. JBAIDS information will aid medical personnel in determining appropriate treatment, effective preventive medical measures, and medical prophylaxis in response to the presence of biological agents. Required to combat the threat of biological attack faced by U.S. forces deployed worldwide, JBAIDS will also improve protection against endemic infectious diseases, thereby filling a need identified during the Persian Gulf War for a compact diagnostic identification tool. Today's global military mission, with ongoing operations in war-torn locations teeming with infectious diseases, demands a readily accessible, far-forward biological agent identification capability. This is critical to maintaining troop readiness, quickly determining patient treatment, disposition (for example, quarantine and medical evacuation), and protecting the homeland population from infections acquired by the military, from bioterrorism, and from emerging disease threats.","The DoD has addressed the biological threat in the context of the battlefield. However, biological threat reduction in the civilian population context is different. For example, the average civilian is not trained or equipped for response, the public health system is not supported with the kind of central command and control systems associated with the military, different requirements exist on sensitivity and different levels of tolerance for false positives and false negatives, and there is a need for dealing with a broader set of potential agents. Also, much higher sensitivity is required for Counter Terrorism (CT) detection, raising substantial technology challenges and the need to assess background interferences that may be more significant for low-level detection and monitoring schemes.","The urgent need for improved biohazard surveillance capability was also recognized and described for the first time in other Government agencies during this period. For example, the United States Postal Service has developed a Biohazard Detection System (BDS) using proven technology to implement early identification of anthrax. The BDS unit consists of an air-collection hood, a cabinet where the collection and analysis devices are housed, a local computer network connection, and a site controller (a networked computer). All BDS processes are automated. The equipment continuously collects air samples from mail canceling equipment while the canceling operation is underway. The air collection hood is installed over the canceling equipment at the very first pinch point in the mail processing operation where it absorbs and concentrates airborne particles into a sterile water base. This creates a liquid sample that is injected into a cartridge. An automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is performed on the liquid sample using sophisticated DNA matching to detect the presence of anthrax (). The test sample is compared to a template for the anthrax DNA sequence for a match. The system concentrates air samples for a one-hour period followed by the PCR test that takes approximately 30 minutes. The BDS is simultaneously concentrating particles for the next sample while the PCR test is performed for the previous sample. So while the first result requires approximately 1\u00bd hours, subsequent results are obtained every hour. Upon detection of a DNA match, the BDS computer network conveys that information to the site controller computer. Local management is notified directly by on-site BDS personnel and also by multiple forms of electronic communication from the BDS site controller. The emergency action plan is activated, the facility's building alarm is sounded and everyone in the building is evacuated. Disadvantageously, the BDS is not adapted for identifying biohazards other than the anthrax spore.","Practitioners in the art have proposed various solutions to the sampling, detection, analysis, identification and reporting problems associated with the biohazard surveillance requirement. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,895,922, Ho describes a process and apparatus for detection of viable and potentially hazardous biological particles that may be dispersed in an airstream. Ho teaches a method for directing each of the contained particles along a linear path through air, in a sequential manner, and sampling them for determination of their size, whether they are biological and viable, and whether they are present in concentrations greater than background levels. The particle size identifies the particles as respirable or not and the particles are characterized as biological and viable by subjecting each particle in turn, to 340 nm, ultraviolet laser light and looking for the emission of fluorescence, which is typically emitted from bacteria or bacterial spores. Fluorescence detected in the 400\u2013540 nm range signals the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen, which is indicative of biological activity or viability. Ho's apparatus is compact, and power-efficient because he uses a solid state, ultraviolet laser that is actuated only when the particle is passing the laser and only if it is deemed to be a biologically viable candidate, but it is disadvantageous for use in a remote automated surveillance station.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,266,428, Flanigan discloses a system and method for remote detection of hazardous vapors and aerosols by means of two differential spectral signature spectra taken in the field of view at a low spectral resolution. A first linear discriminant optimized for the low spectral resolution is applied to the first spectrum to obtain a first response, and a hazardous cloud is detected automatically in accordance with the first response. A second differential spectral signature spectrum is taken in the field of view at a higher spectral resolution and a second linear discriminant optimized for the higher spectral resolution is applied to the second spectrum to obtain a second response, which is formed into a false-color image and displayed to an operator. The operator discriminates the hazardous cloud in accordance with the image. The first and second linear discriminants can be formed by linear programming. Flanigan's system is disadvantageous for use in a remote automated surveillance station.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,317,080, Baxter discloses a method of tracking airborne substances including the steps of detecting the presence of one or more airborne substances and releasing a tracking balloon into the path of the one or more airborne substances, the tracking balloon having a transmission means and a global positioning means adapted to communicate the latitude and longitude coordinates of the tracking balloon whereby the latitude and longitude coordinates of the tracking balloon are representative of the latitude and longitude of the one or more airborne substances previously detected. Baxter neither considers nor suggests solutions to the remote automated surveillance problem.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,490,530, Wyatt discloses an aerosol hazard classification and early warning network that includes a large number of remote detector and analysis units, which are deployed throughout a region under surveillance for a potentially hazardous aerosol intrusion. Such aerosol threats may originate from fires, volcanic eruptions, or overt releases of biological and chemical agents dispersed in aerosol form. Among the former are the characteristic toxic aerosols released during refinery fires or explosions. The latter biological agents include bacterial spores, lyophilized bacterial cells, and virus preparations, whereas chemical agents might include various forms of nerve gasses and other anti-personnel gasses such as mustard, all commonly deployed in aerosol form. Each detector station contains an aerosol handling unit that samples and transfers ambient aerosol particles one-at-a-time through a light scattering chamber where each such particle is constrained to pass through a fine laser beam producing, thereby, an outgoing scattered light wave. The scattering chamber contains a plurality of scattered light detectors arranged to accept light scattered into different angular locations. The signals detected at each detector position are processed by a corresponding digital signal processing chip with the resulting set of digitized signals being transferred to an on-board central processing unit (CPU). The CPU analyzes the set of light scattering signals and identifies or otherwise characterizes each particle. The classification data are then stored and, on preprogrammed command, telemetered to a remote \u201ccentral station\u201d by means of an on-board telemetry unit. The central station analyzes the sets of data received from all the detector stations and then instructs, as necessary, selected detector stations via telemetric means to change their sampling and telemetry rates. As soon as sufficient data are available, the central determines the presence, threat, extent, and progress of the aerosol cloud. These factors are then telemetrically transmitted by means of alarms and warnings sent to potentially threatened regions. Although Wyatt's system is well-adapted to remote surveillance and he teaches the use of fluorescence to identify biological compounds, his \u201clight scattering\u201d data are adapted to characterizing and counting particles in an aerosol and Wyatt doesn't consider the rapid and automated identification of biological particles.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,532,067, Chang, et al. describe a method for fluorescence probing of particles flowing in a fluid, including steps of defining a trigger volume in the fluid by intersecting a plurality of substantially orthogonally aimed trigger laser beams, each of a different wavelength, detecting light scattered from the vicinity of the trigger volume by a plurality of particle detectors each sensitive to a wavelength corresponding to the wavelength of a trigger laser beam, probing the particles with a pulsed laser triggered by the particle detectors, collecting fluorescence emitted from the particle in a detection volume and focusing it in a detection region, detecting the fluorescence focused in the detection region. Chang, et al. neither consider nor suggest solutions to the remote automated surveillance problem.","In U.S. Pat. No. 6,613,571, Cordery et al. disclose a method and system for detecting biological and chemical hazards in mail using predetermined descriptions of the hazards sought but they neither consider nor suggest solutions to the remote automated surveillance problem. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,656,253, Willey, et al. disclose a dynamic electrostatic filter apparatus for purifying air using electrically charged liquid droplets but they neither consider nor suggest solutions to the remote automated surveillance problem. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,664,550, Rader et al. describe an aerosol lab-on-a-chip (ALOC) that integrates one or more of a variety of particle collection, classification, concentration (enrichment), an characterization processes onto a single substrate or layered stack of such substrates. By mounting a UV laser diode laser light source on the substrate, or substrates tack, so that it is located down-stream of the sample inlet port and at right angle the sample particle stream, the UV light source can illuminate individual particles in the stream to induce a fluorescence response in those particles having a fluorescent signature such as biological particles, some of said particles. An illuminated particle having a fluorescent signal above a threshold signal may trigger a sorter module that separates that particle from the particle stream. But Cordery et al. consider the process control and particle stream separation problems and neither consider nor suggest solutions to the remote automated surveillance problem.","In view of the recent terrorism-related security requirements mentioned above, there is a clearly-felt need in the art for a robust (military-hardened) miniaturized remote system for the initial detection, localized analysis and reporting of the presence of biohazards. Such a system requires a large number of permanently-deployed remote surveillance stations each of which can operate independently and without human intervention. Such stations must be adapted for accepting updated detection information from a remote control center to permit adaptation to global changes in the threat environment, for example.","These unresolved problems and deficiencies are clearly felt in the art and are solved by this invention in the manner described below.","This invention solves the above problem by providing a distributed biohazard surveillance system including a plurality of robust miniaturized remote monitoring stations for the detection, localized analysis and reporting of a broad range of biohazards. The remote monitoring station may be adapted to identify many different biological particles and is not limited to particular predetermined biohazard profiles. Each monitoring station is centrally and dynamically reconfigurable and can operate unattended. The distributed system may be used to locate and report unsuspected sources of biohazards and to monitor the localized effects in real-time through cooperation with a centralized data processing facility.","The monitoring station apparatus can also count, categorize (e.g., distinguish biological from non-biological particles), and collect samples of airborne particulate matter for local retrieval and analysis.","In one aspect, the invention is a distributed biological hazard surveillance system including a central processing assembly including means for receiving and transmitting data;

The images generated at each detector assembly () in region  may be analyzed locally in neural network IC , for example, or centrally in neural network facility , before the image identifications are reported to central processing assembly . The downloaded identification reports are saved in database  where they are periodically \u201cmined\u201d by an expert system  to discover pathogen detection pattern anomalies. That is, once the detector assembly images are analyzed to identify pathogens, the overall pathogen detection patterns within region  must be analyzed using, for example, a knowledge-based inference engine embodiment, such as a Knowledge Amplifier employing Structured Expert Randomization (KASER) or in any useful expert system embodiment. The KASER is disclosed in the commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/206,930 filed on Jul. 24, 2002 and entirely incorporated herein by this reference. Such an analysis can pinpoint the sources and perhaps the likely causes of contamination and also recommend areas for evacuation or other counter-measures. This is possible through the implied fusion of the data with other applicable data such as observed weather patterns, satellite imagery, passenger flight manifests, intelligence reports, etc. Moreover, cognizant authority such as, for example, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), can use the system to identify and control any epidemics. The literature is replete with descriptions, discussions, and many examples of different types of neural networks. The necessary application software may be constructed without undue experimentation by one having access to common knowledge in the software arts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","20","36","38","22","20","38","40","25","40","42","44","40","44","46","40","44","48","50","44","40","50","48","50","50","12","20","44","46"]},"Several additional components are disposed to create an optic stage . These include a capacitor bank , a flash diode , and a quartz optical microscope , which are separately illustrated for expository purposes but are preferably embodied monolithically as optic stage  shown in more detail in . A slightly-heated particle such as particle  is blown across optic stage  wherein it is electrostatically precipitated onto the slide  (\u201cslide capture\u201d) by means of an electrostatic precipitator formed by the Van de Graaff generator , the attractor grid  and one or more ion emitters exemplified by the platinum wire tip . Flash diode  produces a burst of short-wave ultraviolet (UV) light, which \u201cfreezes the frame\u201d to permit image capture by a digital camera . Microscope  is fitted with the quartz lenses  selected to transmit UV wavelengths and to provide the magnification desired for identification of the particles sought. Lenses  may be automatically interchangeable but this is not required for acceptable operation. A digital zoom feature may also be included in digital camera  to help adjust image magnification but it is not required for acceptable operation. The optical image from microscope  is captured by digital camera  and stored in the random access memory (RAM) . Processor  operates in cooperation with neural network IC  to identify and categorize particle  and to compute and accumulate statistics representing the historical detection class densities, for example. Processor , digital camera  and other sensitive electronic components in the vicinity of optic stage  must be properly shielded and grounded to prevent damage from the static charges induced by Van de Graaff generator .","Neural IC  may be embodied, for example, as a neural network whose number of fundamental memories is expected to increase supra-linearly with scale. Neural network IC  may be integrated with processor  or implemented as a separate IC as shown, for example. Neural network IC  should identify sharper class distinctions and be more tolerant of the orientation problem than are conventional neural network architectures. Such a capability could usefully categorize a particle having characteristics of bacteria A and bacteria B as being of type A, type B, or unknown. That is, the provision for feedback in such a neural network implies a better capability for discriminating among particles that may otherwise appear similar.","The functions of neural IC  may be remotely disposed at central processing assembly  instead of locally by moving all processing to the back-end of the system architecture, but this is not preferred because of the cellular transmission time required to accommodate reductions in distributed processing and localized decision making. Neural IC  may be embodied as any useful neural network; e.g., the weightless Zero Instruction Set Computer (ZISC) pattern-recognition chip produced by Silicon Recognition, Inc. If neural IC  is embodied as a weighted neural network, then hidden-layer technology is required (e.g., a perceptron is not recommended). This is necessary to enable system  to distinguish concave from convex spirals, for example. The choice between weighted and weightless neural networks embodiments may be accomplished without undue experimentation and either type of network can be generally useful, however. Neural network  is trained in the laboratory; e.g., by using Kohonen learning or the slower back-propagation model for the weighted network. With sufficient fundamental memory, sufficient training and sufficient detection time, particulate orientation and partial occlusion should not prevent the necessary particle assay.","There are several alternatives illustrated for powering detector assembly . A rechargeable lithium-metal hydride battery  is alone sufficient to power assembly  continuously for few days, but additional power is required to achieve the preferred one-month stand-alone capability. Alternatively, a shielded and grounded methanol-based micro fuel cell  of the type currently used for powering cell phones and laptop computers should be able to power the system continuously for up to a month; perhaps with an external methanol bottle (not shown) to supplement the internal fuel store . A silicon solar cell array  is preferred to charge battery  or to electrolyze water to provide fuel to fuel cell . Such an arrangement should permit assembly  to remain powered and operational at night or on heavily overcast days. The necessary size of array  depends on the location, temperature (solar cells are more efficient at lower temperatures), time-of-year, and maximum acceptable downtime. Smaller solar arrays are suitable for the cooler sunny regions. Many such useful arrays are readily available in the art and are commonly used for powering emergency roadside phones in remote areas, for example. Of course, where standard alternating current (AC) power is available, detector assembly  may be powered by means of any suitable AC power supply adapter, for example.","The cell phone  communicates through cell antenna  with cell phone relay antenna  () disposed in region . A thin-client Java-based operating system of the type used to control cell-phone operations is sufficient for controlling the operation of cell phone . All communication protocols can be realized without undue experimentation by practitioners having access to common knowledge and standard practices in the field of communication architecture. Digital camera  and RAM  transceive through cell phone , which preferably uses an outer gold-plated conformal embodiment (A) of antenna  that conforms to cylindrical container  and also reflects any scattered infrared (IR) radiation to reduce unit heating from incident sunshine. Preferably, assembly  should be configured to operate at temperatures from \u221220 to +50 degrees Celsius. The inner gold-plated surface (B) of antenna  serves as a front-surface mirror to diffuse and increase the intensity of the short-wave UV flash provided by flash diode . When digital camera  is embodied as a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, the CCD element's well-known sensitivity to high-energy short-wave UV light permits practical use of microsecond flash periods.","Another feature of the system of this invention is that cell phone  can be used to both remotely download images and to upload new neural network weights (or data vectors for weightless networks such as the ZISC mentioned above). Assembly  may update its particulate detection capability on a regular or irregular basis. This feature permits adapting system  to detect new biological threats as more assemblies  are deployed remotely.","To conserve power, fan  can be operated through timer intervals or remotely by way of cell phone , or through the setting of the timer intervals by means of cell phone . With extensive conservation, rechargeable lithium-metal hydride battery  may be sufficient to power detector assembly  intermittently over the preferred one-month operating period. As fan  is operated less frequently, the time interval between servicing filters A\u2013B is increased because of reduced airflow. Also, the time interval between servicing grid  is similarly increased because optic stage  is powered down when fan  is powered down.","As described herein, detector assembly  can operate as part of a robust, military-hardened miniaturized system for the detection, localized analysis and transmission of information on the presence of biohazards. Detector assembly  can count, categorize, distinguish biological from non-biological particles, and collect airborne particulate matter on grid  as well as in filters A\u2013B. In addition, detector assembly  is centrally and dynamically reconfigurable and can be adapted to operate unattended for periods of at least one month between maintenance cycles and in temperatures from \u221220 to 50 degrees Celsius, for example. A plurality of detector assemblies  can be distributed to pinpoint sources of biohazards and to suppress their deleterious effects through integration with centralized processing assembly  in a distributed biological hazard surveillance system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["52","54","56","36","59","59","58","59","56"]},"Van de Graaff generator  supplies the charge to the ion emitters exemplified by platinum wire tip . Van de Graaff generator  is embodied preferably as a well-known beltless cigar-shaped embodiment that may be powered from an automobile cigarette lighter socket for use as a negative ion supplier in the automobile, for example. A set of power transistors and a capacitor-based timer  is provided to alternate the charge polarity to slide , grid  and one or more ion emitters exemplified by platinum wire tip . The rate at which the charge polarity may be alternated is limited by the parasitic capacitance of slide , but the charge should be alternated rapidly enough to avoid building up an obfuscating deposit on slide . The proper charge polarity alternation rate can be determined using dry air at standard temperature and pressure (STP) without undue experimentation. Capacitor bank  is disposed so that its time constant matches twice the desired alternation period.","The distance  between slide  and grid  should be set to 2.828 (i.e., two times the square root of two, as the charge density is inversely proportional to the square of the distance) times the maximum polarized arc distance at STP. The diameter of platinum wire tip  may be assumed to be negligible here. This does not pose a problem for the focal length of the microscope  because the distance between slide  and the platinum ion emitters exemplified by platinum wire tip  is mechanically variable. As the ion emitters exemplified by platinum wire tip  are moved closer to slide , more particulate matter is deposited on slide  instead of grid , up to the maximum arc distance. This distance need not be automatically adjusted but rather should be set manually to obtain an acceptable average particle density for microscopic examination in the particular locale and ambient conditions.","In operation, capacitor bank  is charged, while the ion emitters exemplified by platinum wire tip  are charged negatively (i.e., by circuit ) and slide  and grid  are held to ground or the opposite positive polarity. This causes particulate matter to deposit on slide  and grid  in proportion to the relative distances separating them from the ion emitters exemplified by platinum wire tip . Next, flash diode  is fired by circuitry (not shown) contained in capacitor bank . Microscope  then relays the particulate image to digital camera . Then, capacitor bank  begins to recharge while slide  is charged negatively while the platinum ion emitters exemplified by platinum wire tip  and grid  are held to ground or the opposite positive polarity. Any particles on slide  then take on the negative charge from slide  and are immediately repelled to grid  and, to a lesser extent, to the ion emitters exemplified by platinum wire tip . This disposition of the particles after imaging can be readily appreciated as inconsequential for the next imaging cycle. A few particles may be imaged more than once in different positions and orientations, but this is not disadvantageous and may perhaps be useful for selecting particle orientation and for training the neural network, for example. Over several cycles, new particles should in fact be sampled. Grid  may be periodically cleaned and various biological assays performed on the matter removed therefrom. Such assays may include reviews for any viral particles too small for optical detection. Because the peculiar effects that viral particles display after having invaded a bacterial host may be optically detectable, an embodiment of optic stage  may be adapted for the indirect detection of a limited number of active viral particles. A similar, but more complex system capable of direct viral detection may be implemented by replacing optical microscopic  with an electron microscopic assembly, but only with significant increases in cost and complexity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["20","52","62","60","64","64","85","64","59","85","52","85","56","66","85","66","85"]},"The \u201cvortex-capture\u201d embodiment of optical stage  illustrated in  resolves the image prolixity problem as follows. A main controller  embodied as a single-board computer sends the control messages A\u2013E to camera , flash diode  and the relays A\u2013B in the charging circuit from Van de Graaff generator  as shown. Relays A\u2013B are first set by controller  to charge grid  and platinum wire tip  with opposing voltages. This operates to charge any particles floating in the incoming air as they flow through grid  so they are attracted to vortex  around platinum wire tip . Then, after some delay but before the particles are extracted as they attain the voltages of platinum wire tip , controller  activates camera  and flash diode  to acquire the particle image. By means of a simple software program for the controller, the activating timing for each component can be set properly as follows.","Except for the discrete drive time imposed by the hardware (e.g., camera ) the software program can adjust the activating time almost continuously. Therefore, supposing that the charging speed is constant, the activating time for the camera and flash can be varied until the sample images are satisfactory to experimentally identify a satisfactory activation timing scheme, without undue experimentation. This embodiment permits the particles to be captured at the right time without unnecessary increases to the computational cost and storage space. It is advantageously much easier to adjust the software program timing codes than to modify the hardware arrangements when adapting assembly  for different environments and requirements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["92","94","96","98","100","102"]},"The stored image signal is then transferred to a neural network for analysis and identification in the step . This analysis may rely on a number of neural network weights acquired or evolved through a training program or introduced from some outside data store, for example. The result is the determination of a particle identification in the step , which is used to generate a digital analysis data signal in the step  for use in a particle detection report. Finally, the digital analysis data signal is stored in a data store in the final step , where it remains available for transmission to a central analysis facility or for local development of detection statistics and other data mining operations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["112","112","114","116","118","114","112"]},"Clearly, other embodiments and modifications of this invention may occur readily to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of these teachings.
