title: Irrigation control system and method
abstract: An irrigation control system with a programmable controller having a high speed central processor and a touch screen monitor for independent and simultaneous operation of multiple watering stations and schedules. The touch screen monitor allows for quick entry of changes to irrigation schedules that can be made while the system is in use, thus preventing service interruption. The irrigation control system will accommodate multiple watering stations with precise accuracy and allows for independent start times for each station. Multiple output terminals permit connection to various watering stations as a pre-programmed, removable thumb drive containing the operating system and application software is connected through a USB port to a high speed central processor. The irrigation method describes using the controller for optimum plant growth and health.

schedules involving multiple irrigation stations.","Irrigation control has become increasingly important in recent years with the high costs of labor, plants, raw materials, water and other resources. Greenhouse owners, farmers and other growers today require optimum growth and minimum percentage plant death more than ever before to remain competitive. While water was once an inexpensive resource, it is becoming increasingly costly and now must be conserved for economical plant farming and greenhouse operation. Formerly, many varieties and sizes of plants were watered under a single, standard schedule. Now for conservation purposes, plant varieties have to be scheduled according to the type and size of the plants in order to save energy and water. Where it was once suitable to water an entire greenhouse according to a single schedule, now different plants and sections of the greenhouse may require multiple watering stations, each operating on independent schedules. Further, lightning is the number one cause of failure in the commercial controller industry.","Thus, in view of the problems and limitations of prior irrigation control systems, the present invention was conceived and one of its objectives is to provide an irrigation control system having an electronic controller with a high speed processor and a touch screen monitor for easy operation and simultaneous programming of multiple irrigation stations.","It is another objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system in which alterations can be made to irrigation schedules in a quick and convenient manner.","It is still another objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system which is modular in design to allow the system to expand based on the growing needs and rate of a particular owner.","It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system which contains multiple independent programs with each program having multiple start times as needed.","It is also another objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system whereby any program can address any irrigation station and any irrigation station can be addressed by any or all programs.","It is a further objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system which will independently and simultaneously control multiple stations and programs.","It is still a further objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system which includes an AC power source input and station outputs which are protected from lightning and power surges.","It is yet a further objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system with a touch screen to provide graphic plots in twenty-four hour cycles for each station.","It is another objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system which includes a standard thumb drive containing programming data for both the operating system and the application programs.","It is still another objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system which allows for precise independent scheduling for each station.","It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide data storage in non-volatile memory to allow the programs of the irrigation control system to resume automatically after a power failure.","It is still a further objective of the present invention to provide a method of irrigating plants using an irrigation control system for a precise watering schedule which can be varied depending on the precise needs of the plants for optimum health and growth.","It is still yet a further objective of the present invention to provide an irrigation control system having an electronic controller with a high speed processor and a touch screen monitor for checking the system status and diagnostics system resulting in less down time and less maintenance cost.","Various other objectives and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art as a more detailed description is set forth below.","The aforesaid and other objectives are realized by providing an irrigation control system and method which utilizes a high speed central processor and touch screen monitor.

The top of the metal housing is pivotally joined to a touch screen monitor affixed to the top of the housing for user convenience in activating, monitoring, programming, changing and\/or adjusting irrigation schedules, diagnosing field problems, manually operating a station, and running a system test for any of the various watering stations. The main circuit board is powered by a USB power source having a USB processor mounted thereon. Output terminals on the main circuit board allow for connection of expansion modules. Each expansion module (module) can drive up to eight (8) independent irrigation stations.","The auxiliary circuit board includes a central high speed processor, ram memory, a ram memory slot, a display driver for the touch screen monitor and multiple USB ports. One USB port accommodates a pre-programmed thumb drive containing both the operating system and application software.","Each module includes an output microprocessor which is connected to zero crossing detector circuitry, station loop switches, lightening\/over volt protection circuitry and open station loop switch circuitry.","The method of irrigating using the irrigation control system requires programming the central processor from the thumb drive, selecting the proper irrigation schedule by use of the touch screen monitor and operating the electric control valve of particular stations to irrigate the plants associated therewith.","Irrigation control system  allows efficiency for irrigation needs and simplified programming of multiple irrigation stations  as outlined below:\n\n","Free commercially available Linux operating system compatible with central processor  and USB processor  is used to convert the source codes of the application specific firmware\/software and programs into machine language which central processor  and USB processor  (as seen in the Figs. herewith) can interpret. The application specific firmware\/software and programs are loaded into central processor for programming the same with the application specific firmware\/software and programs as described herein. The source codes of the application specific firmware\/software and programs for preferred irrigation control system  are contained in the computer program listing appendixes submitted herewith.","For a better understanding of the invention and its operation, turning now to the drawings,  illustrates in schematic fashion preferred irrigation control system  with controller  connected to irrigation station  consisting of water line  and sprinkler head  for supplying water  which is connected to water control solenoid valve . All components of irrigation station  are conventional.","Controller housing  as seen in  is a powder-coated aluminum enclosure for controller  and is constructed to meet severe weather conditions and provides a well grounded, durable system. As an option a stainless steel enclosure may be provided. Top cover  on controller  is mounted with draw latches  and catches  allowing removal for access to touch screen monitor . When installed top cover  provides water resistance for controller .","Water control solenoid valve  is joined by electrical conductor output wires  to expansion module  as shown in .

USB ports , ,  and , display monitor output , and mouse and keyboard outputs (not shown) are included on conventional auxiliary circuit board . Standard 512 MB RAM memory  is used. DC power is supplied by standard ATX DC power supply . Central processor  includes the necessary hardware and firmware\/software to read\/write to thumb drive , read\/write to RAM memory , transfer bidirectional data via four (4) separate USB ports , ,  and , and provide signal formatting and data transfer to drive touch screen monitor  and to accept data input for touch screen monitor . Although not used the ability to accept data via a keyboard and mouse (not shown) provides a communications capability that greatly aids software generation and factory production testing and trouble shooting.","Central processor  is capable of accepting large memory banks and application software fully functional within 512 MB of RAM memory . All irrigation control system  application firmware\/software operates fully from RAM memory . Upon startup, system  loads all data to RAM memory  and application operations are implemented from RAM memory . Data is written back to thumb drive  in USB Port  only when the user makes a change in an application feature.","Central processor  is positioned on auxiliary circuit board  () and USB processor  () on main circuit board  receives data from central processor  and is the data path to output microprocessors  on expansion modules . Output microprocessor  times and formats all data to and from central processor  to expansion modules , as well as formatting the input data from the system status monitor circuitry  and directs this input data to central processor .","Main circuit board  ties all the components of irrigation control system  together. Functionality of main circuit board  is varied as it interfaces central processor  to expansion modules  as well as providing the communication path for the system status data from expansion module  to central processor . All the data from central processor  as well as DC voltage to power output microprocessors  are included and expansion modules  are received from central processor  via USB ports , . Input terminals  allow data from external sensors (not shown) to be directed to central processor , as well as input for remote control data to direct central processor  to implement specific actions. Main circuit board provides the capability for receiving up to five (5) expansion modules . Each expansion module  contains module circuitry  as seen in  which provides eight (8) module ports  (two (2) shown schematically in ). Thus preferred irrigation control system  is capable of simultaneously driving up to forty (40) irrigation stations . Main circuit board  is the distribution interface for the low voltage AC to output terminals  (see ) allowing replacement of expansion modules  without the necessity of rewiring output terminals .","Touch screen monitor  () is a commercially available monitor manufactured by Intolux (China), Model# SSDA07007-T manufactured by Southeast Marketing and distributed by SSD Southeast of Fuquay Varina, N.C. Touch controller software drivers are standard offerings of the supplier.","Display monitor output  as seen in  provides the data path to drive touch screen monitor . Displayed on monitor  are various screens to direct the user in application data input via touch screen monitor  to select the desired action as well as to report the current selected application options. Also, irrigation control system  status is reported via touch screen monitor . Full function touch screen monitor  does not require \u201ccoded\u201d readouts of usual industry products.","Touch screen programming for the user is available by utilizing seven (7) inch (17.8 cm) touch screen  seen in  of touch screen monitor  which is the user friendly interface to central processor  having 640\u00d7800 high resolution display. Programming, system status and system diagnostics of system  are all available at the touch of the user. Touch screen  allows programming new operation, checking on an old one, manually operating an irrigation station, diagnosing a field problem, or running a system test. A help screen is programmed into system  software and by touching the \u201c?\u201d at the bottom right corner of touch screen , access to system definitions are shown.","USB processor  shown in  is commercially available as part# PIC1F2455-I\/SO. Firmware is written specifically for this application as described below. Data is transferred from USB processor  to output microprocessor  via expansion module bus connector  (see , ). The output from USB processor  and 24V output station loop switch  is also connectorized allowing expansion module  to be pluggable. This allows the user to replace expansion modules  without rewiring.","Expansion module output terminals  () provide the path for the input of the low voltage AC signal to expansion module  and the output of eight (8) 24V output station loop switches  (only one (1) shown) contained on each expansion module . Each switch has both a source and a return path. Output terminals  are industry standard wiring terminals and are part of main circuit board  to allow replacement of expansion modules  without making wiring changes. Eight (8) output terminals  provide electrical connections for up to forty (40) irrigation stations .","Presence of an expansion module  on main circuit board  is detected by USB processor  thus customizing central processor  firmware to properly configure irrigation control system . This technique is commonly referred to as \u201cPlug and Play\u201d. All activity of expansion module  is controlled via output microprocessor  under the direction of the installed firmware.","Expansion module output microprocessor  is a PIC16F882\/IS available from a number of sources. Output microprocessor  receives data from central processor  via USB processor , decodes the address and operational data and directs the proper output station loop switch  to assume either an On or Off condition in one (1) second intervals. Output microprocessor  also receives data from open loop detector circuitry  and monitor circuitry  located on expansion module  (See , ) and reports this data to central processor  in a similar manner.","Zero crossing detector circuitry  (T-T) (only two (2) shown) (see ) routes signals to either turn On (or Off) a particular output station loop switch . The function of zero crossing detector circuitry  is to time the signal to output station loop switch  with the low voltage AC signal such that the actual switching occurs only when the AC voltage is at zero volts (thus the name zero crossing detector). The signal to either turn On (or Off) an output station loop switch  is routed via zero crossing detector circuitry  () to output station loop switch . Zero crossing detector circuitry  is included to enhance reliability as irrigation station  output loops can be long. Water control solenoid valve  generates a high probability of high reflective voltages at the time of switching. By incorporating zero crossing switch  (# MOC3033SM) , switch  is only switched when the 24VAC is crossing zero (0) volts. This is the precise time when the alternating voltage changes from positive to negative (or vice versa) and minimizes the voltage and current reflections generated when switching electrically inductive loads.","System status monitor circuitry  (only one shown) allow output microprocessor  to read digital voltage during different stages of operation of output station loop switches . Expansion module  firmware directs the timing of the signal inputs to determine if system  is operating properly. Conditions that can be detected are: blown fuses and switch failure.","Lightening\/over volt protection circuitry  (, ) and output wires  of controller  (see ) are exposed to lightning. Each output port  as seen in  is protected by instrument grade fast acting electrical fuse  rated at 2.5 amperes. In addition each output port  is protected from extreme conditions such as lightning strikes. Gas discharge tubes  (part # SL1003)(U, U, U, U) one shown in  prevent instantaneous voltages from rising beyond a predetermined value and limit the instantaneous voltage at output terminals  to two hundred and thirty (230) volts. Gas discharge tubes  offer high voltage protection even in the absence of high currents. Lightening\/over volt protection circuitry  and Metal Oxide Varistors  (MOV) (P7204) see  have the ability to shunt high instantaneous currents and can route up to two thousand (2000) amperes to electrical ground. A blown output fuse is a system status condition that will be reported to the user status screen.","Output station loop switches  seen in  control the flow of low voltage AC to output terminals . They are either On or Off as directed by output microprocessor .","Output station loop switch  as seen in  switches AC voltage as the output voltage to 24VAC to operate the station water control solenoid valves . Preferred output station loop switch  is a Triac (S6006D). The rated switching current is thirty (30) times the average current required to switch an industry standard solenoid for improved reliability. Also, the rated voltage is seventeen (17) times the actual switched voltage. This in conjunction with other protection devices provide a high degree of immunity for irrigation control system  to lightning. During the switching time, (once per second) output station loop switch  is monitored and any malfunction is reported to central processor  to be displayed to the user (not shown) on touch screen monitor .","Open loop detector circuitry  detects malfunctions and reports to central processor . An open fuse or a malfunctioning switch is detected on one (1) second intervals and reported to central processor . The user has the ability to view a \u201cStatus Screen\u201d that is a composite reporting of all monitored functions of individual irrigation stations  as seen in .","Shown in , USB Port  accepts standard thumb drive . Software (Linux) for preferred irrigation control system  and proprietary application software reside on thumb drive . This allows updating of proprietary application software for the user. Changing thumb drive  to an updated version of software is therefor easily accomplished as all programs\/data are stored on thumb drive .","USB Port  is the bidirectional data transfer port of all operational data and allows transfer of operation data to main circuit board  and for receiving data pertaining to the operational status of irrigation control system . Application data from central processor  to main circuit board  includes the address of the output station loop switch  and its operation status (On or Off). Data is sent from central processor  and transferred via USB port  to main circuit board  and consequently to expansion module output microprocessor  on one (1) second intervals. The status of control system  is \u201cpoled\u201d at one (1) second intervals. Also, at one (1) second intervals, central processor  poles expansion module  via main circuit board  as to irrigation control system  status. The external input data, whether from touch screen monitor , external sensors (not shown) or remote control  () is sent to central processor  via USB port .","USB Port  provides backup and restore capabilities to irrigation control system . After the user has implemented applications, data can be stored in a backup thumb drive (not seen) for \u201cdisaster recover\u201d occasions and connected to USB port (). Also, USB port  can be used to implement a transfer of application data to a new system software thumb drive (not seen) using the familiar \u201cbackup and restore\u201d routines common to the industry. As further seen in , USB port  accepts data from touch screen monitor . This is user data input to implement the desired program features.","Input terminals  and associated circuitry (R, R, R, R, R, C and C) are typical input ports () which accept digital data from external sensors (not shown) and remote control . Input terminals  () serve two (2) main functions, to condition the data (signal) and to protect the circuitry from external voltages typically produced by lightning. External sensor input signals are routed onto main circuit board  via input terminals  (). These signals are conditioned via electronic components associated with input terminals  (). After conditioning, the signals are routed to USB processor  () which routes these data signals to central processor  via USB Port . Remote data signals  are routed onto main circuit board  via remote control input terminal  (). After conditioning and electrical isolation via opto-isolator (not shown), the conditioned signals are routed to USB processor . USB processor  then routes these signals to central processor  via USB Port .","Remote control input terminal  () is configured to accept remote data signals  from remote control  whereby remote data signals  are conditioned and routed to USB processor  and thus to central processor . Remote data signals  enter main circuit board  via remote control input terminal , () and is electrically isolated from all other internal circuitry via opto-isolator (not shown). The associated components (not shown) condition and protect circuitry (not shown) in a similar fashion as those associated with input terminals . The transmitted data directs that certain irrigation stations  be operated for a specified time.","DC power supply  as seen in  converts incoming 110VAC to the necessary DC voltages needed to operate central processor  and monitor . DC power supply  also provides the 110VAC necessary to operate the low voltage AC power supplied from heavy duty transformer  seen in . Transformer  is protected from overload by a fused input source from AC power source  and is capable of providing ten (10) amperes of current. This is 125% of the current needed to operate forty (40) water control solenoid valves  rated at 200 ma each.","When control system  is needed to be enlarged, each expansion module  will add eight (8) additional irrigation stations . From an initial control system of eight (8) stations  to a control system of forty (40) stations .","For additional system enlargement, up to two hundred thirty two (232) irrigation stations  can be controlled by using alternate expansion module  as seen in alternate irrigation control system  shown in . Alternate irrigation control system  routes two (2) output wires  to irrigation stations . As seen in  in the alternate form expansion module  consists of an output microprocessor , RF code generator , 24VAC mixer , output drivers  and lightening\/over volt protection circuitry . Output microprocessor  encodes the address of each station  in a burst of high frequency voltage  () that is superimposed on the 24VAC that provides the power to operate water control solenoid valve . At each water control solenoid valve  is decoder  that is programmed with a specific electrical address. In addition to the address is the operation command (On\/Off) thus RF code generator  is a 24VAC \u201cbus\u201d with superimposed high frequency data. Thus alternate two (2) wire expansion module  is compatible with main circuit board . Five (5) two (2) wire system outputs are each capable of controlling up to forty (40) irrigation stations . Each alternate expansion module  could control up to two hundred (200) irrigation stations . Four (4) more expansion modules  may be installed for a total of two hundred thirty two (232) stations.","Forty-eight (48) application programs, all stored in thumb drive  are completely independent. All forty-eight (48) programs are active 100% of the time and programming is easy via touch screen . Any program can control any of irrigation stations  which can be controlled by any number of the forty-eight (48) programs. Special programs are easily implemented through USB ports , ,  and  which allow input and special programs with the operation of a detector or switch (not seen). Programmed actions (both on and off) can be as brief as one (1) second and as long as twenty-four (24) hours for soaking or misting applications for each irrigation station . Misting on and off times are independently set and either can be a minimum of one (1) second. The interval between misting is also independently set to a desired time. Flexibility such as this assures healthy plants with a minimum risk of fungus and disease. The cycle to repeat (1 to 9) and mist for hours using only one start time is set and correct water usage maximizes benefit while reducing cost. In the alternate two wire configuration system , each of the six (6) systems will be directed by forty-eight (48) programs as described above. Each of the forty (40) irrigation stations  constitute a \u201cwater system\u201d and each water system has full capabilities as described herein.","Each of the six (6) independent irrigation start times per program available for each irrigation station  are multiplied in effectiveness by the ability to repeat at a user defined interval. One start time with a repeat interval of ten (10) minutes is equivalent to one hundred and forty-four (144) start times per day. Each start time is completely independent of the other five (5) start times. Start times and run times are not related. Any number of irrigation stations  can be started at the same time, each with a different run time. Scheduling of each station  from one (1) day to thirty-one (31) days is available by touching the days on touch screen  as needed.","Accessing the schedule of any individual irrigation station is accomplished from the status screen for monitor  by pressing the SCHEDULE button on touch screen  for any station  and it will display a twenty-four (24) hour schedule graph for the selected station . The presented graph is for \u201ctoday\u201d but a touch of the \u201cnext day\u201d button advances the screen in twenty-four (24) hour increments. Reverse scrolling is possible by pressing the \u201cprevious day\u201d button. Knowing the detail schedules means efficiency in work crew assignments. Irrigation soak control using touch screen  allows each start time to be programmed independently with a given interval. The user defines a precise amount of water needed, as well as the precise soak time. Multiple programs for each station  of the forty-eight (48) independent programs can address any of stations  available. Each station  can be assigned a different run time. This flexibility provides precisely the correct amount of water to various plants and conditions.","Controller  contains a high power output source that is capable of providing sufficient power to operate forty (40) irrigation stations  at once. All stations  can be programmed to supply the precise amount of water needed and at the most beneficial time.","As all stations  are independently controlled the designation of a pump control (sometimes called master valve) can be chosen. An irrigation station  chosen for the designation of pump control will be denoted with a \u201cP\u201d on the system status display screen on monitor  as a reminder that this particular irrigation station  has a special application. Using touch screen  any irrigation station  can be designated as the \u201cpump station\u201d.","Programs can be named to identify functions or locations. Names to match the location, i.e. \u201cGreenhouse #1\u201d or \u201cFront Lawn\u201d, or the name can reflect the function, e.g. \u201cMisting\u201d, assuring the user of the functionality of each program and its intended purpose. This is accomplished through touch screen  as are renaming of programs.","Also, naming of individual irrigation stations  is an easy option. Individual stations  can be named to remove any user doubt as to the location or purpose of the particular station .
