The Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention in general relates to electronic circuits, and more particularly to a high frequency microwave mixer with reduced noise and improved dynamic range.","2. Description of Related Art","A mixer is an electronic circuit which converts an input signal from one frequency to another. Basically, this is accomplished by combining, for example, an RF input signal with the signal from a local oscillator in a non-linear device, one example of which is a diode quad. As a result of the process, various frequencies are generated, including sum and difference frequencies. The difference frequency may be selected as the intermediate frequency (IF) for further processing.","In order to convert a wide range of input RF signals, from a maximum to a minimum, the mixer must have a wide dynamic range. Often this is accomplished by increasing the power or drive level of the local oscillator. Fabricating the mixer as an integrated circuit on a Si (silicon) chip requires that the local oscillator power be objectionably large. The present invention uses SiGe (silicon germanium) technology to provide a high frequency integrated circuit mixer having a wide dynamic range with relatively low power consumption. In addition, high linearity is achieved with a novel passive RF balun fabricated on the silicon chip.","An integrated circuit mixer is provided which has elements formed on a silicon substrate, and which elements comprise: a non-linear circuit device for mixing signals and a passive balun comprised of a) a first insulating layer on the silicon substrate, b) a ground plane on the first insulating layer, c) a second insulating layer on the ground plane, d) a first microstrip line on the second insulating layer and having a predetermined shape, e) a third insulating layer on the first microstrip line, f) a second microstrip line on the third insulating layer and being generally coextensive with the first microstrip line, with the second microstrip line having a first section of a first width and a second section of reduced width. The passive balun has an input port for receiving an RF signal, and first and second output ports connected to the non-linear circuit.","The mixer additionally includes a local oscillator balun having an input port for receiving a local oscillator signal, and first and second output ports connected to the non-linear device. An output port is connected to the non-linear device for delivering an IF signal as a result of the mixing of the RF and the local oscillator signals. The balun arrangement, per se, may be used with a variety of circuits.","Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific example, while disclosing the preferred embodiment of the invention, is provided by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art, from the detailed description.","In , mixer  includes an RF input  for receiving an RF signal from a circuit, such as RF amplifier . Mixer  also includes a second input  to which is applied an output signal of a local oscillator . These signals are mixed by a non-linear process known as heterodyning, resulting in a plurality of generated signals, among which is, after suitable filtering, a desired IF signal having a frequency which is the difference between the local oscillator frequency and the RF signal frequency, and which is provided at port .","Mixer  is a double balanced mixer fabricated by conventional monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) techniques and, as illustrated in , includes first and second baluns  and . As will be described, balun  is a passive balun so as to provide high linearity, and balun  is an active balun so as to provide low power amplification of the local oscillator signal applied at input . Basically a balun is an impedance matching device which is operable to receive an input signal (the unbalanced signal) and provide first and second output signals (the balanced signal) which are equal in amplitude and 180\u00b0 out of phase. Conversely, the balun can provide an unbalanced output signal in response to an input balanced signal. In the present arrangement, the balun performs the first-mentioned function.","Mixer  includes a non-linear device shown by way of example as a passive diode quad , having arms -, with each arm having one or more diodes . Output ports  and  of balun  are respectively connected to junction points  and  of diode quad , while output ports  and  of balun  are connected to junction points  and . The output of balun  also includes capacitors  and , serving as feedback and DC blocking capacitors. Port , from which the IF signal is derived, is connected to the junction between two inductors  and  connected across the output ports  and  of balun .","An embodiment of a novel balun, passive balun , which is fabricated by integrated circuit techniques, is illustrated in . As best seen in the plan view of  and the exploded view of , balun  is comprised of microstrip lines in different layers, separated by dielectric layers (which for clarity are not illustrated in ). More particularly, balun  includes a ground plane  disposed on a dielectric layer deposited on silicon substrate .","The next metallization layer consists of microstrip line , of generally serpentine shape disposed above ground plane  and including output ports  and . Microstrip line  is connected to ground by a series of metalized vias . The width of the microstrip line  is uniform throughout the entire serpentine shape.","The top metallization layer consists of microstrip line  (shown stippled) which is divided into two sections, - and - which generally follow the serpentine shape of microstrip line . Section -, however, has a first width which may be of the same width as microstrip line  beneath it, while section - has a second, and smaller width. These two different widths of sections - and - define two different impedances with respect to microstrip line . The input RF signal is applied to input port , connected to section -.","A transmission line representation of the balun  is illustrated in . Ground plane  is deposited on a thin first dielectric layer , such as SiO(silicon dioxide) covering the Si substrate . The next metallization, microstrip line  is separated from ground plane  by a second dielectric layer  and is electrically connected to the ground plane by metalized vias . The balanced output signal is provided at output ports  and . The top metallization, microstrip line  is separated from microstrip line  by a third dielectric layer  and receives the RF signal at input port . An impedance Zis defined between microstrip line  and first section - of microstrip line , while a different impedance Zis defined between microstrip line  and reduced width second section - of microstrip line . Since microstrip line  is of uniform width an impedance Zis defined between it and ground plane . The arrangement of transmission lines to form the balun  is done in a way that eliminates any coupling to the Si substrate below the ground plane . This allows the formation of a balun which can work at high microwave frequencies without any coupling losses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["22","22","16","22","80","81","84","85","86","87","88","89","80","81","90"],"sub":"c"},"Collector  is connected to terminal  via resistor  and inductor , while collector  is connected to terminal  via resistor  and inductor .
