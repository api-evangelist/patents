title: Generalized grid security framework
abstract: The subject specification comprises a generalized grid security platform (GGSP) that can control power distribution and operations in a power transmission and distribution grid (PTDG) in real or near real time. The GGSP can receive data from one or more data sources, including a PMU(s) or an IED(s), which can obtain power system related data and provide at least a portion of such data to the GGSP at a subsecond rate. The GGSP can correlate data from the data sources based at least in part on a temporal, geographical, or topological axis. The GGSP can analyze the data, including performing predictive analysis, e.g., via simulation, root cause analysis, post mortem analysis, or complex event processing, when desired, to facilitate identifying a current or predicted future state of the PTDG, a cause or source of an abnormal condition, or a remedial action execution plan, new operation or maintenance guidance, etc.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION AND CLAIM FOR PRIORITY","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a non-provisional of, and claims the benefit of, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/333,838, filed May 12, 2010, and titled \u201cGENERALIZED GRID SECURITY FRAMEWORK\u201d, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The subject specification generally relates to intelligent power transmission and distribution grids, and more particularly to a Generalized Grid Security Framework that can control power grid operations, control power transmission, and perform power grid diagnostics and adjustments.","Power grids have not undergone significant architectural changes since use of electricity for power was realized more than a century ago. The idea of a \u201cSmart Grid\u201d was introduced in the late 1990s, however, today, power grids still only employ limited intelligence in managing and providing power to consumers. Energy transmission and distribution systems are currently at a crossroads, as they confront the significant problem of imbalances of various kinds Not only is the gap between supply and demand continuing to increase due to global population growth, but there also is a geographic imbalance in energy production and consumption patterns. These imbalances and uncertainties could be exacerbated in the future considering the rapidly increasing energy demands of newly industrialized nations, such as China, India, Brazil, and Russia, as these and other nations will compete for more generating sources to meet expected energy demands. While incorporating a wide variety of renewable (non-fossil fuel) energy sources is part of the solution to the increasing energy demands, it is not likely that incorporating renewable energy sources will be a panacea for the impending energy issues. Thus, it is clear that there also will have to be significant changes in the power transmission and distribution network to help meet future energy needs.","Conventional power grids typically employ Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\/Energy Management System (SCADA\/EMS) technology, which collects information regarding conditions in the power grid from remote terminal units or remote control centers at scan rates ranging on the order of multiple seconds. The power systems are typically dealing with a couple of hundred of thousands data points updated in correspondence with the multiple second scan rates.","From a network security and reliability point of view, state estimator algorithms have been improved over the years but are still using well known techniques. The creation of Regional Transmission Operator in the United States pushed the technology to improve efficiency of the algorithms to cope with 30,000+ network buses, to address topology errors and parameter estimation. Contingency analysis application is also very similar to what it used to be 20 years ago.","From a dispatcher point of view, the most frequently used displays within a control room are still the schematic representation of the network (e.g., mapboard), the substation online displays and tabular alarm lists. While such arrangement used to be sufficient, with the increased energy demands, increased risk of outages due to the increase in energy demands, increased complexity in transmission network systems, new power flow patterns starting to emerge following the introduction of deregulated markets, introduction of more and more intermittent resources (e.g., distributed power generation, such as wind power, solar power, etc.) to the power grid, etc., such conventional arrangement is becoming increasingly lacking in key features, which eventually may lead to dramatic consequences. For example, after Aug. 15, 2003, blackout in Northern America, a post-mortem analysis clearly highlighted the fact that SCADA\/EMS systems had severe deficiencies. Overwhelming alarm flows and lack of Situation Awareness have been emphasized.","For grid reliability, transmission system operators desire to have an accurate up-to-date representation of their power system. Conventionally, the SCADA system collects data from the field and EMS applications perform security analysis of the current power system state. The power system state is compared against \u201cnormal\u201d operating conditions, e.g., one needs to make sure that each piece of equipment is operated according to its nominal design conditions while ensuring that enough reserve and security margins are still available even after a loss of a major component on the network. This process is usually called \u201cNetwork Monitoring\u201d. Today, the Network Monitoring function does not include a monitoring of the health of the pieces of equipment that constitute the topology of the network under operation.","Further, SCADA\/EMS systems operation also has not evolved significantly over the last few decades, since being implemented. It actually mimics vertically integrated utilities which even after deregulation (split of generation, transmission and distribution) often operate their system in a centrally hierarchical system. Typical configurations consist of a National Control Center supervising Regional Control Centers, each of them interacting with some local Load Dispatch Centers with functions performed independently with few if not no bidirectional data flow and functional responsibilities.","Further, today, SCADA\/EMS systems are mostly focusing on operation, using data collected on the order of multiple second scan rates, and provide limited insight in developing or short-medium term changing conditions. This used to be an acceptable arrangement, until recently, since network operation planning was well established and did not change drastically between day-ahead scheduling and real-time operation. Now, with the ever increasing uncertainties impacting grid operation such as intermittent resources production, obtaining only a current view of the power system is no longer adequate for efficient and reliable network operation.","As indicated above, there have been certain drivers for changes in power distribution and transmission. For instance, new power flow patterns have started to emerge following the introduction of deregulated markets. Those have been more and more accentuated with the interdependency of markets (regional markets) and development of close to real-time markets (infra-day markets). In addition, uncertainty has also been introduced with the extensive development of renewable energy resources production such as wind power. Such intermittent resources require careful attention especially for reserve management and network security. Currently, situation awareness of the fast changing flow patterns and other aspects of the power grid are lacking.","This tendency is also emphasized with the development of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) and High Voltage DC links (HVDC) equipment. Thanks to the use of modern power electronics technologies, operators currently benefit from flexible ways to re-dispatch flows. However, this flexibility propagates to neighboring networks and can thereby contribute to uncertainty and fast changes of flow patterns if not coordinated properly. This is also re-enforced by the ever larger interconnection of transmission networks which ease the propagation of grid disturbances (e.g. inter area oscillation) and make them visible and detrimental to other grid operators.","Another driver for change is the fast development of Distributed Generation (DG). In some European countries where most of the wind generation is connected at distribution level, it is quite frequent to see energy flowing from distribution back to sub-transmission and transmission levels. Associated with the limited predictability of the wind resources, such unknown represents a risk factor for network security since this production may not be necessarily observable. Moreover, conventional power generation management is based on the management of centralized power plants rather than decentralized power plants, and decentralized management is becoming increasingly necessary. For example, in a country such as Denmark, this means shifting from a model to be managed from a couple of tens generators to 5000+ generators. With the technical evolution DG can be eligible to support frequency regulation effort as well as voltage regulation effort. Characteristics of changes brought by massive DG deployment can be summarized as follows: centralized vs. distributed injection points; exponential increase of generation resources; and intermittency of the resources for some of them.","The above specificities make these evolutions hardly manageable by conventional SCADA\/EMS systems. DG impacts each SCADA\/EMS subsystem. It is necessary for a data acquisition system to connect these resources which are owned by many different actors, and hence represent as many external systems to connect, while ensuring security and reliability of the data acquisition. Network security also requires accurate modeling of the distributed generation injections to be able to assess their impact on steady-state network state as well as for dynamic analysis. Generation control and management applications also need to cope with these DG resources especially dealing with the uncertainty related to the intermittent character of some DG resources.","In some countries, high growth areas can stress the system and push operation towards previously unattained limits. In many countries, while the electric energy consumption growth is stable, peak demand growth rate now represents a challenge. As a consequence, with the ever increasing time to build new transmission lines infrastructure due in part to local opposition to such construction (e.g., \u201cNot In My Back Yard\u201d mindset), system operators must operate the grid with existing and in some cases old assets. This often translates in using the assets at their maximum capacity and making them sweat. This puts the grid operation at hedge and requires deep knowledge of the real state of the assets. Current power system applications are not capable of optimizing the use of the current grid infrastructure.","The above obviously shall not jeopardize the grid reliability. With the ever growing economy sensitivity to the electricity availability, grid operation at the edge shall not occult grid reliability principles and deteriorate electricity quality of supply. With increasing threats of major blackouts and pressing incentives to improve revenue performance, transmission system operators face daunting challenges.","In recent years, manufacturers have developed condition monitoring solutions which aim at locally measuring key vital parameters of network equipments via smart sensors. Real-time calculation and simulation of developing conditions can then be performed to support assessment of the real-state of the assets. Condition monitoring systems apply to a large spectrum of network assets, such as switching devices or transformers. They can provide data usually called \u201cnon-operational\u201d data to supervisory systems. Those data are not necessarily electrical values but are also encompassing information related to the real state and health of the power grid asset and are relevant to its optimized management.","With the latest development of international standards, one can also notice that the substations do not behave anymore as an independent and local actor in charge of reporting information to a hierarchical upper level. More and more intelligence is introduced at the substation level. For instance, IEC61850, in its latest evolutions, enables communications between substations which thus allows intelligent and fast adapting scheme to better protect and operate the grid. The emergence of so-called \u201clocal\u201d agents leads to a much more decentralized information and operation architecture and represents a real paradigm shift from the centrally hierarchical grid operation which applied for decades.","The development of Active Distribution Networks and eventual involvement and empowerment of end-user for consumption behavior will also drive significant changes in grid operation and will as a consequence impact the SCADA\/EMS systems. However, conventional generation management systems do not have adequate demand response programs and lack the ability to forecast the impact of demand response on generation dispatch and on reserves management, and its impact on network analysis, and lack adequate ability to control the associated resources and provision of information necessary for demand response settlement.","There have been recent technological advancements, which can or are being utilized in power grids. For instance, advancements in communication technology and infrastructure now allow for relatively large bandwidth for data transmission as well as high quality of service to support critical applications. Also, sensors, such as Non-Conventional Instrument Transformer, also have been recently developed to ease monitoring of existing assets with non-intrusive techniques. Further, enhanced processing power brought by continuous improvements in hardware and availability of data management capabilities allow now to gather more data and make them available to an end-user for application usage.","Another recent advancement is Phasor Measurement Units (PMU), which is a relatively new data source at the control center level due in part to the improvement of telecommunication infrastructures. By providing coherent set of time-correlated measurements, PMU brings a new insight of \u201creal\u201d network state which until very recently was inaccessible at the grid operator level. Also, Intelligent Equipment Devices (IED) and Digital Fault Recorders are other examples of data sources of interest to understand a network state. However, conventional power generation management systems do not adequately leverage the respective capabilities of these recent technological advancements.","The above-described deficiencies of today's systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.","The following presents a simplified summary of the various embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed subject matter nor delineate the scope of the subject embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The subject specification comprises a generalized grid security platform (GGSP) that can control power transmission and distribution and operations in a power and transmission distribution grid (PTDG) in real time or at least near real time (e.g., at a second rate). PTDG is intended here as a generic term that can encompass a more traditional transmission grid as well as a power distribution grid or smart grid. The GGSP can receive data from one or more data sources, such as a Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) or an Intelligent Equipment Device IED, which can monitor power conditions in the PTDG and generate power system related data, wherein at least a portion of such data can be provided to the GGSP at a subsecond rate (e.g., on the order of milliseconds). The GGSP can correlate data from the data sources based at least in part on a temporal axis, geographical axis, and\/or topological axis. The GGSP can analyze the power system related data, including performing predictive analysis (e.g., via simulation), root cause analysis, post mortem analysis, or complex event processing, when desired, to facilitate identifying a current or predicted future state of the PTDG, a cause or source of an abnormal condition in the PTDG, or a remedial action execution plan to be implemented to repair, replace or maintain respective pieces of PTDG equipment, new operation or maintenance guidance, among other features, as more fully disclosed herein.","In accordance with various aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a system that includes a data information hub configured to receive power system related data from one or more data sources associated with a PTDG, and correlate respective pieces of the power system related data, based at least in part on at least one of a temporal axis, a locational axis, or a topological axis, to generate correlated pieces of power system related data. The system can further include a GGSP configured to analyze at least a portion of the correlated pieces of power system related data in real time to control power transmission and distribution by at least one of a power substation or a transformer in the PTDG in real time, in accordance with at least one predefined power system control criterion.","In accordance with various other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a method that includes the acts of correlating a plurality of items of power system related data, based at least in part on at least one of a temporal axis, geographical axis, or topological axis, to generate one or more subsets of correlated items of power system related data; and dynamically controlling at least a portion of a PTDG based at least in part on results of analyzing at least one subset of correlated items of power system related data of the one or more subsets of correlated items of power system related data, in accordance with at least one predefined power system control criterion.","In accordance with still other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a computer-readable medium having stored thereon, computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a computing device, cause the computing device to perform operations comprising: correlating a plurality of items of power system related data, based at least in part on at least one of a temporal axis, geographical axis, or topological axis, to generate one or more subsets of correlated items of power system related data; and dynamically controlling at least a portion of a PTDG based at least in part on results of analyzing at least one subset of correlated items of power system related data of the one or more subsets of correlated items of power system related data, in accordance with at least one predefined power system control criterion.","In accordance with yet other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise means for correlating a plurality of items of power system related data as a function of at least one of a temporal axis, geographical axis, or topological axis including means for generating one or more subsets of correlated items of power system related data. The system can further include means for dynamically controlling, based on at least one predefined power system control criterion, at least a portion of a power transmission and distribution grid (PTDG) based on an output of a means for analyzing at least one subset of correlated items of power system related data of the one or more subsets of correlated items of power system related data.","The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the disclosed subject matter. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the various embodiments may be employed and the disclosed subject matter is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and distinctive features of the disclosed subject matter will become apparent from the following detailed description of the various embodiments when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The disclosed subject matter is described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It may be evident, however, that the disclosed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the various embodiments herein.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d \u201cplatform,\u201d \u201cinterface,\u201d \u201cnode\u201d, \u201csource\u201d, \u201chub\u201d, \u201ccenter\u201d, \u201cmeter\u201d, \u201cagent\u201d, and the like, can refer to and\/or can include a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational machine with one or more specific functionalities. The entities disclosed herein can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. Also, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate via local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems via the signal).","In addition, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B, then \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances. Moreover, articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in the subject specification and annexed drawings should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form.","Conventional power generation control systems typically utilize traditional Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\/Energy Management System (SCADA\/EMS) technology, which has not been significantly improved in recent decades, and which has documented deficiencies and limitations. There have been recent technological advancements in, for instance, data communications and power grid monitoring. For example, Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) can monitor power and operating conditions in a power grid and generate data relating to the power and operating conditions at a subsecond rate (e.g., on the order of milliseconds). However, conventional power generation control systems have not adequately leveraged such technological advancements and the enhanced power system related data to desirably control power transmission and distribution, and operations in a power grid.","As outlined above, drivers for change calls for a coordinated and integrated set of solutions that address the system reliability under increased level of uncertainties while ensuring increased productivity of new and aging assets under stress. Consistent with the primary function and objective of a Transmission System Operator, the subject specification promotes the concept of a generalized grid security platform (GGSP) that can: extend the functions of the traditional SCADA\/EMS, integrate the SCADA\/EMS with a Grid Performance and Diagnostic system, and interface with the Enterprise Asset Management functions, among other features, as more fully disclosed herein.","In accordance with various aspects, the subject specification comprises a GGSP that can control power transmission and distribution, and operations in a power transmission and distribution grid (PTDG) in real time or at least near real time (e.g., at a subsecond rate). As used herein, PTDG is intended to be a generic term that can encompass a more traditional transmission grid as well as a power distribution grid or smart grid. The GGSP can receive data from one or more data sources, such as a Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) or an Intelligent Equipment Device IED, which can monitor power conditions in the PTDG and generate power system related data, wherein at least a portion of such data can be provided to the GGSP at a subsecond rate (e.g., on the order of milliseconds). The GGSP can correlate data from the data sources based at least in part on a temporal axis, geographical axis, and\/or topological axis. The GGSP can analyze the power system related data, including performing predictive analysis (e.g., via simulation), root cause analysis, post mortem analysis, or complex event processing, when desired, to facilitate identifying a current or predicted future state of the PTDG, a cause or source of an abnormal condition in the PTDG, or a remedial action execution plan to be implemented to repair, replace or maintain respective pieces of PTDG equipment, new operation or maintenance guidance, among other features, as more fully disclosed herein.","In accordance with various aspects, the GGSP comprises the following subsystems. A data information hub (DIH) that has the ability to interface and use multiple data sources, to analyze and correlate data from the data sources to facilitate power system assessment, diagnostics and performance of remedial actions. The DIH paradigm can correlate data from various data sources (e.g., PMU, sensors, fault recorders, SCADA\/EMS, etc.) not only on a temporal axis but also on a geographical axis and topological axis. A grid reliability center (GRC) can provide a grid operation security overseer function. The GRC can support grid operation by providing SCADA\/EMS capabilities extended with new functions and applications, such as Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS). A grid diagnostic and performance center (GDPC) can provide a grid performance and security overseer function. The aspect of the GDPC is to leverage the new data sources (e.g., PMU) available as part of the smarter grids, wherein the new data sources can monitor grid operations and conditions, and can generate power system related data at a subsecond rate. The GDPC can transform data from the new data sources into comprehensive and enriched information featuring network equipment and power system health and performance as well as providing advanced diagnostic functions, as disclosed herein. The GDPC also can provide a comprehensive and unified post mortem analysis capability. In another aspect, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a set of interfaces for enterprise asset management (EAM). The EAM can provide maintenance overseer functions to an electrical utility. EAM can be interfaced with the other components (e.g., GRC, GDPC, etc.) of the GGSP in order to provide added value functions and business processes streamlining between grid operation and asset management functions. The GGSP also can include a Grid Unified View (GUV) module in charge of consolidating and providing synthetic information to end users allowing them to have a comprehensive understanding of the power system equipments and transmission grid state. For example, identification of (and action on) the most restrictive and relevant security constraint for the current grid conditions can be provided as part of the GUV module. In another aspect, a Unified Situation Layer (USL) can provide situation awareness and synthetic decision making support via intuitive navigation and presentation of application results and analysis, as disclosed herein.","The disclosed subject matter can provide a number of benefits to utilities. In most of the electrical utilities, grid operation, equipment and asset management are supported by different organizations and information technology (IT) systems with few interactions and interfaces between each other. With the development of enabling technologies, new data sources are made available at different levels of the electrical utility organization. One object of the GGSP is to fully leverage this information by enriching, correlating (e.g., by time and event) and sharing data between grid operation, asset, and system health and performance monitoring and asset management systems.","One beneficial result of the disclosed subject matter is that the electrical utility will benefit from improved reliability. The power system can be more reliable via the use of non operational data sources, which can allow anticipation of equipment failures, which can directly translate into reduced outage time. This is typically the case for transformer monitoring system which is able to locally monitor key vital equipment parameter and perform advanced diagnosis on the current transformer health. This information can be reported to GDPC. The GDPC, upon abnormal condition detection, can alert the grid operator (e.g., alarm at SCADA level) in conjunction with automatically triggering work order creation at asset management level.","In addition, the GGSP can comprise an Online Stability System that can extend steady-state network security analysis by providing power system stability assessment tools. To counteract inherent limitations to accuracy with which power system models can capture the true power system behavior, the Online Stability System also can leverage synchrophasor measurement-based data. The Online Stability System not only complements the traditional stability assessment techniques but also can provide a means to validate their results. One immediate application provides for monitoring power system dynamics and characterizing their stability in real time, such as providing early warning alerts upon low-frequency oscillatory dynamics to enable quickly rectifying undesired low-frequency oscillatory dynamics, as they could eventually (if not properly damped) lead to serious network incidents.","In accordance with other aspects, the GGSP can provide for improved grid performance and diagnostic assessments. Using the information collected from the health sensors, the GGSP can create a more accurate assessment of the actual state and health of grid equipment using online condition monitoring techniques. The GGSP can use this information to perform different impacts analysis to: develop a prioritized maintenance plan of critical grid equipment based at least in part on their health and criticality; develop strategic equipment upgrade programs; justify the criticality of required investments; predict the ability of the grid to withstand stressed operating conditions, etc. The GGSP also can monitor closely performance of grid equipment against expected design and operational objectives, and generate a maintenance plan to achieve higher performance objectives.","In accordance with other aspects, the GGSP can shift from corrective or scheduled maintenance (e.g., calendar-based maintenance) to condition-based maintenance of PTDG equipment. For example, the transformer monitoring system can actually perform self-diagnosis operations and derive conclusions regarding how the operational and health conditions are degrading, or are expected to degrade, over time. As such, if abnormal conditions are detected, the GGSP, utilizing the GDPC and enterprise asset management center (EAMC), can automatically generate a work order to rectify the abnormal conditions and\/or perform maintenance on the equipment. In a similar way, maintenance of other types of PTDG equipment, such as a circuit breaker or switching device, can be moved from a calendar-based to a condition-based protocol by the GGSP. The GDPC can access SCADA real-time and historical information, and can implement maintenance triggering logic which can, on one side, anticipate maintenance on PTDG equipment which is operated more often than originally forecasted, and, on another side, postpone maintenance on PTDG equipment which has been much less solicited. All of this can translate into less operational expenditures in corrective maintenance and can be directed to capital expenditures for anticipated renewal of network assets.","In still other aspects, the GGSP can make enhanced use of the network grid for power transmission efficiency. Constraints on new infrastructure building for power transmission grids result in a demand for much better use of the existing grid infrastructure. The GGSP can employ improved intelligence to enable optimization of network grid capacity usage. For example, the GGSP can utilize dynamic equipment (e.g. line) rating capabilities of equipment manufacturers as local intelligence (e.g., data) for use in determinations by the GGSP relating to power transmission and distribution, and operation of PTDG equipment. For instance, by accessing such information and sharing it at the control center level, the GGSP and\/or grid operators can safely increase transfer limits used by network analysis applications without jeopardizing the system reliability. The GGSP, by moving from static limits settings to dynamic limit settings, can improve power transmission capacities 15% to 20%, or more, which can be used for constraint alleviation and thus reduce the cost of congestion management and increase overall return on investment. This thereby results in transmission efficiency (e.g., transmitting more power with the same infrastructure) and further favors integration of renewable resources allowing the utilities to achieve their renewable energy penetration targets. In addition, integration of advanced Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) models within the platform also allows taking into account the increase of capacity transfer and larger transmission efficiency provided by monitoring and controlling of power electronic devices.","In accordance with various aspects, the GGSP can provide a comprehensive environment for the end user for improved situation awareness. The GGSP can provide an advanced User Interface (UI), which can leverage improved graphical techniques as well as geographical representations relating to the PTDG and PTDG equipment. The GGSP UI can be geared towards minimizing the effort for the end user to assess a situation relating to the PTDG. One objective of the GGSP is to make meaningful information, whatever the data context is, readily available to the end-user. For example, upon a transformer temperature alarm arrival at SCADA level, the operator will have the ability, on one hand, to use the UI to directly access transformer maintenance service record history as well as drill-down to transformer monitoring information reported to GDPC. Moreover, using the UI, the operator can be in a position to perform a \u201cwhat-if\u201d or predictive analysis to quickly and efficiently assess impacts of a transformer de-rated capacity from a network reliability point of view.","In another aspect, the GGSP, by connecting GRC, GDPC and EAM on an open and scalable architecture, can offer seamless access to power grid related information. The GGSP can thereby enable an end-user to more quickly access the information, which can result in a decrease in the reaction time to correct power grid related problems and thus decrease costs that may be incurred by such problems. Moreover, the GGSP, by enabling the end user to access the right information at the right time, can allow the end user to save time and can dedicate more time for system optimization, which can result in reduced operating costs.","In still another aspect, the GDPC can use the GRC as one of its data sources to collect real-time and historical operational power system related data relating to network equipment and power system. The GDPC, in return, can provide insight information about network equipment and power system (which a traditional SCADA\/EMS solution is not aware of) such as dynamic equipment rating, real-time equipment health status and real-time equipment guidance. For example, using the GGSP, a grid operator can use the GRC to directly request objective functions to or from the GDPC such as, for instance, a request to overload transformer T1 in Substation A by 15% for the next 20 minutes, and the GDPC can receive this request and redirect it to the corresponding Equipment Diagnostic and Prediction Module (EDPM) so that it can perform a simulation to determine whether transformer T1 can sustain the requested 15% overload for the next 20 minutes. Based at least in part on the results of the EDPM local analysis, the simulation can either authorize the requested temporary overload (knowing that this will accelerate the aging of the PTDG asset) or not allow it knowing the current condition (e.g., aging, isolation, temperature, etc.) of the transformer T1, in accordance with predefined power system control criteria.","The GRC also can fully benefit from EAM by having direct access to the EAM IT system, which can provide added value information, such as equipment services history or up to date maintenance work progress. To the GRC, this information can be of particular importance to enable the GRC to have a better understanding of the history of the assets or adapt grid operation decisions (e.g., switching operations) knowing the updated maintenance schedules to pass a peak load situation.","The disclosed subject matter can better leverage power system related data than conventional power generation control systems. Power transmission grids have become more and more telemetered: critical network equipment, such as power transformers, are equipped with sensors and condition monitoring systems; IEDs and fault detectors are being utilized more with substations and transmission lines; synchrophasor measurements are being made more available at critical grid locations, such as large power plants, large interconnection substations and important transmission corridors. For example, hundreds of PMUs have or will be installed in power transmission grids in the United States in the short term. Also, fault recorders are currently more systematically installed in substations; protection relay settings are versioned and effective settings datasets at a given time can be made available outside of the substations; results from tests performed during maintenance and the related data set collected during the maintenance also can be available.","The disclosed subject matter can comprise communication infrastructure (e.g., telecommunication infrastructure) associated with the power system, and can utilize the communication infrastructure to communicate the power system related data to or from the GGSP and its constituent components (e.g., grid diagnostic and performance center (GDPC)). In another aspect, the amount of power system related data being communicated from a data source to the GGSP can be controlled so that part of the power system related data, which is not required by or useful to the GGSP, can remain local at the data source, and another portion of the power system related data, which is useful to the GGSP in its operations, can be transmitted to the GGSP. This highlights the importance of local agent systems, such as equipment monitoring. For example, in the case of a circuit breaker monitoring system, there is no need to make all information acquired and computed by this subsystem available to the GGSP. Only macro-level information, such as, for example, the number of breaker operation with associated values of interrupted currents, is desired (e.g., required) to be fed upward to the GGSP. This approach has the benefits of reducing the amount of bandwidth required for data transfer as well as taking full advantage of the intelligence available at equipment or local level via a distributed processing architecture.","The disclosed subject matter can collect the above power system related data and other power system related data, such as disclosed herein, can correlate and analyze the data, and can identify and perform one or more desired power system related actions (e.g., remedial actions) to control power transmission and distribution, and power system operations in real time (e.g., on the order of milliseconds), in accordance with the predefined power system control criteria. As disclosed herein, integration of the GDPC both the Grid Reliability Center (GRC) and Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) can better leverage the newer data sources (e.g., PMUs) for a more dynamic operation of the grid and more proactive management of PTDG assets.","In another aspect, for grid operation, the GGSP can control power transmission and distribution, and operations to operate the power grid closer to the limits (e.g., closer to the dynamic equipment rating of PTDG equipment), instead of merely operating at the static or nominal rating, which can result in improved transmission efficiency without jeopardizing power system reliability. Increasing ampacity of grid infrastructure also favors renewable resources integration allowing the utilities to achieve renewable energy penetration targets.","For asset management, the GGSP can schedule and perform maintenance, repair, and replacement of PTDG equipment on a condition basis, in addition to or as an alternative to a calendar basis. The GGSP can identify and use advanced information (e.g., power system related data) provided by condition-based monitoring to assess the \u201ctrue\u201d state and health of PTDG equipment (e.g., asset). The GGSP can employ prediction and diagnostic modules to drive maintenance, repair, replacement efforts towards tailored needs which are adapted to the real asset condition. Such dynamic and proactive management by the GGSP can optimize maintenance, repair, and replacement expenditures by decreasing amounts usually spent into corrective maintenance and can allow more time for asset maintenance planning optimization.

Also, in another aspect, the GGSP  can be one GGSP subsystem of a plurality of GGSP subsystems that can be employed in a PTDG, wherein the GGSPs can cooperate with each other to control operations and power transmission and distribution in a PTDG.","The GGSP  can interface with and use multiple data sources; receive and\/or correlate data from the data sources based at least in part on a temporal axis, geographical axis, and\/or a topological axis associated with the PTDG portion ; and analyze data (e.g., received and\/or correlated data) to perform system assessment of the PTDG portion  and identify and perform, or facilitate performance of, one or more remedial actions (e.g., corrective actions), as desired, to control operation of and power transmission and distribution by the PTDG portion . In another aspect, the GGSP  can address and minimize customer issues, such as, for example: increasing stress levels on aging grid infrastructures, which can lead to more frequent and severe outages and blackout; growing share of renewable\/intermittent resources; ever larger and more complex systems; severe penalties\/sanctions due to outage time and decision delays; more and more data from the network assets & external sources with multiple systems and user interfaces. As more fully disclosed herein, some of the benefits for an electrical utility employing the GGSP(s) , can include, for example: improved situation awareness of operations of the power grid; improved network operation and enhanced reliability by complementing traditional SCADA\/EMS with a broader network-operation view, including stability applications and measurement-based (e.g., PMU) applications; maximized use of assets (e.g., stressed beyond normal operation limits) via dynamic equipment rating and condition monitoring, in contrast to only using static equipment rating; streamlined power grid operation and asset management interactions relying on dynamic equipment health information with reduced time to collect information necessary to locate and isolate a fault or other abnormal operating condition associated with the PTDG, as part of real or near real time operation and control of the PTDG; optimized asset management spending and reduced emergency outage time via a paradigm shift from calendar-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance (wherein, as desired, calendar-based criteria can still be one consideration as part of condition-based maintenance); reduced outage time and improved reliability indicators, such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI); and a comprehensive platform for grid diagnostics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","202","202","204","206","202","204","206","202","202"]},"In accordance with various aspects and embodiments, a data source (e.g., , ) can be a sensor (e.g., power system \u201chealth\u201d sensor, heat sensor, voltage sensor, current sensor, power system balance sensor, harmonic level sensor; other power system parameter type sensor, fault sensor, etc.), which can communicate sensed information at a desired frequency (e.g., on the order of milliseconds, on the order of seconds); a Frequency monitoring Network (FNET) that can be employed as a power system frequency measurement system that can accurately measure power system frequency, voltage and angle in real time (or at least near real time) (e.g., on the order of milliseconds), and can facilitate desired real time (or at least near real time) control of power transmission and distribution in the PTDG, wherein the FNET can be, for example, a PMU\/FNET, wherein the PMU\/FNET can be, for example, a frequency disturbance recorder (FDR); a SCADA\/EMS; intelligent equipment device (IED) that can provide power system related data in real or near real time (e.g., on the order of milliseconds, or on the order of seconds), as are known in the art; digital fault recorder (DFR); a fault current limiter (FCL) that can limit the amount of fault current when a fault occurs in the associated portion of the PTDG; or a fault current controllers (FCC) that also can control the amount of fault current in response to a detected fault; or other power system components associated with or contained with the GGSP .

In another aspect, the DIH  also can analyze and correlate the received data based at least in part on a temporal axis, geographical axis, and\/or topological axis, as desired. For example, the DIH  can provide not only a snapshot of measurements relating to the PTDG (e.g., measurements relating to certain power conditions in the PTDG) at a given time point but also a capture or identification of the state of the PTDG (e.g., state of the network) at the corresponding time point (e.g., network solution) and an effective sequence of events record at this time. The DIH  can process this information by, for example, correlating, preparing and transforming the information into consistent subsets of information which respectively can serve as respective inputs and triggers to upper level advanced applications and functions (e.g., analysis and\/or simulation applications and functions), as more fully disclosed herein. A typical example comprises the DIH  gathering (e.g., collecting and\/or aggregating) an events file(s) relating to the PTDG (e.g., a fault in the PTDG) from data sources (e.g., fault recorders) in a central location (e.g., GGSP ) and correlating the events file(s) with other power system data to enable the GGSP  to identify the fault and its location in real or near real time, wherein the fault identification and location in real or near real time can result in a shorter outage duration.

The bus component  can employ a high-speed data bus(es) to facilitate quick data transfers, for example, at a subsecond rate (e.g., typically less than one second, and can be at a rate on the order of milliseconds (e.g., 1 ms, . . . , 10 ms, . . . , 20 ms, . . . )), to facilitate real time or at least near real time control of the PTDG. The GRC , GDPC , EAMC , DIH  and\/or other components of the GGSP  can be communicatively connected to the bus component . Structuring the GGSP around the bus component  can ensure sustainable and long term system evolution capabilities.","In still another aspect, the system  can include a common services module  that can include desired services and interfaces, which can be utilized by the GGSP  and end users that use or access the GGSP . For instance, the common services module  can contain a user interface (UI)  that can be a comprehensive UI (e.g., graphical user interface (GUI), touch screen GUI) which can provide an end user with detailed situational awareness of the operations and status of the PTDG in real or near real time. The UI  is geared towards minimizing the effort for the end user to assess a situation relating to the PTDG. In accordance with various aspects, the UI  can include and\/or provide one or more various displays (e.g., liquid crystal display LCD), light emitting diodes (LED) display, combination LCD-LED display, cathode ray tube (CRT) display, etc.), speakers, lights, LEDs, adapters, connectors, controls, channels, ports, communication paths, etc. In an aspect, the UI  can present geographical representations (e.g., contextually) of all or a desired portion of the PTDG, wherein respective UI display screens can comprise respective geographical representations of the respective portions of the PTDG. The UI  also can present correlated and\/or contextualized information to the end user, so that the end user can have access to the desired (e.g., relevant) information relating to an aspect(s) of the PTDG. The UI  also can provide respective indicators or alarms, which can present an indication and\/or information regarding respective abnormal conditions or faults detected in the PTDG.","For example, an abnormal temperature can be detected for a transformer in the PTDG. The transformer temperature alarm can be received by the GGSP  at SCADA level. The GGSP  can generate a subset of correlated and\/or contextualized data relating to the abnormal temperature of the transformer, and the subset of correlated and\/or contextualized data can be presented to the operator via the UI . Given this subset of correlated and\/or contextualized data, and one or more controls, which are contextually related to the detected abnormal temperature condition associated with the transformer, presented to the operator via the UI , the operator can have the ability to directly access the transformer maintenance service record history and\/or the ability to drill-down to transformer monitoring information reported to GDPC  by the one or more data sources (e.g., , ) associated with the transformer. Also, the operator can be in a position to request performance of (e.g., automatic performance of) and\/or perform a predictive analysis (e.g., what-if analysis) via the UI  to quickly assess impacts of a transformer de-rated capacity on a network reliability point of view. One of the salient features of the advanced UI  service is a seamless integration of GDPC UI with the GRC operation UI. Such integration can avoid multiplication of the number of heterogeneous UIs at GGSP level and can allow focus on a consistent UI all over the different GGSP components.","In another aspect, the common services module  can include a common source modeler (CSM) module  that can generate power system model objects that can model respective power system components, and portions (e.g., a subset of power system components), of a PTDG. Since at least a portion (e.g., all or most) of power system model objects can be shared among the various GGSP components, it can be desirable for a single power system model object to be defined only once in order to achieve consistent definition of the same object among all subsystems. In that regard, the CSM module  can define respective power system model objects to provide respective consistent definitions of the respective objects among all of the GGSP subsystems.","In still another aspect, to facilitate data exchanges between a power system model object and another power system model object(s) or a power system component(s), the CSM module  include or be associated with, and can utilize or leverage, a standard information model such as a common information model (CIM), which can employ one or more specified modeling standards, protocols or algorithms. For instance, one type of standard that can be used is IEC 61970 CIM. The CSM module  can model all or a desired portion of the information, features, functions, etc., of the different components or subsystems of or associated with the GGSP  (e.g. models of objects involved in EAM). In an aspect, the CSM module  can provide one or more standard interfaces to generate, publish, and consume power system models relating to the GGSP . In yet another aspect, the CSM module  can provide power system model version management, wherein the CSM module  can support model-over-time management. That is, for example, when modeling a power system component for a particular period of time in the past, the CSM module  can restore and reconstruct model of the power system component, which was valid (e.g., in use) for the PTDG during that particular period of time, even if the power system component is currently different (e.g., different version, updated version). The CSM module , by utilizing model-over-time management, can facilitate accurately generating power system model objects for a given time period, which can be beneficial, for example, when performing a post mortem analysis and review relating to the PTDG.","In accordance with various other aspects, the common services module  can include a security component  that can control access to the GGSP  and associated components, in accordance with one or more security and\/or authentication protocols. The security component  can enforce security, including, for example, North American Electrical Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) criteria fulfillment or system architecture hardening, at all desired areas of the PTDG, at both application and infrastructure level. Since at least a portion of the data is collected from one or more substations associated with the GGSP  and security component , the security component  can desirably control access to the components of the PTDG and access to audit logs associated with the PTDG. For instance, the security component  can employ hardened security measures, such as, for example, air gap (e.g., air gap unidirectional data transfer) at the substation level. In another aspect, the security component  and\/or security and authentication protocols associated therewith can be adapted, as desired, for example, based at least in part on the requirements of the customer (e.g., utility company) and\/or the architecture of the PTDG.","In accordance with still another aspect, the common services module  can include a data access and reporting (DAR) module  that can provide respective types of data, respective types of data, respective types of access (e.g., based at least in part on respective grants of access rights), and\/or respective reporting templates, display screens, or UIs to respective users, such as direct end-users (e.g., network operators) within control centers, utility executives, corporate users, and\/or remote users, based at least in part on the type of user. The DAR module  can tailor the data or access to the data, reporting templates, display screen, UIs, etc., associated with the PTDG to profiles and access rights adapted or assigned to the user, based at least in part on the type of user (e.g., position or role of the user, data or access needs of the user in accordance with the user's position of role, etc.). The security component  and\/or DAR module  can require a user, power system component, or device to provide valid authentication credentials (e.g., password, pass phrase, personal identification number (PIN), biometric information (e.g., fingerprint, eye scan, voice recognition, etc.), public or private key, etc.) in order to gain access to the GGSP  or other associated portions of the PTDG, wherein the access rights granted to a user, power system component, or device can be based at least in part on the authentication credentials presented to the security component  and\/or DAR module .","In yet another aspect, the GGSP  also can comprise a processor component  that can operate in conjunction with the other components (e.g., DIH , GRC , GDPC , EAMC , etc.) to facilitate performing the various functions of the GGSP . The processor component  can employ one or more processors, microprocessors, or controllers that can process data, such as information relating to power transmission and distribution, control information (e.g., relating to a power system control or remedial actions), information (e.g., rules, algorithms) relating to power system control criteria, information (e.g., power condition related data, measurement data, data analysis information, sensed information, and\/or power system warning indicators, etc.) received from one or more data sources (e.g., , ), information relating to data analysis or simulations relating to the PTDG that are performed by the GGSP , information to facilitate interfacing the GGSP  with an associated component (e.g., data source  or , power distribution source (PDS), and\/or enhanced consumer meter (ECM) such as a smart meter or other power system related meter employing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), etc.), information relating to other operations of the GGSP , and\/or other information, etc., to facilitate operation of the GGSP , as more fully disclosed herein, and control data flow between the GGSP  and other components (e.g., data source(s), ECM, and\/or PDS, etc.) associated with the GGSP .","The GGSP  also can include a data store  that can store data structures (e.g., user data, metadata), code structure(s) (e.g., modules, objects, hashes, classes, procedures) or instructions, information relating to power transmission and distribution, control information (e.g., relating to a power system control or remedial actions), information (e.g., rules, algorithms) relating to power system control criteria, information (e.g., power condition related data, measurement data, data analysis information, sensed information, and\/or power system warning indicators, etc.) received from one or more data sources (e.g., , ), information relating to data analysis or simulations relating to the PTDG that are performed by the GGSP , information to facilitate interfacing the GGSP  with an associated component (e.g., data source  or , PDS, and\/or ECM, etc.), information relating to other operations of the GGSP , etc., to facilitate controlling operations associated with the GGSP .

This power system related data (e.g., PMU type data) can have an advantage of representing real-time complex measurements (phasor) for voltage and current at subsecond levels, which feature the actual dynamic network state of the network (e.g., PTDG). This and other power system related data also can be accurately time-tagged (e.g., by a data source and\/or another component, such as a WAMS ) using time stamping (e.g., GPS time stamping), and thus, such data can support WAMS functions, which can extend de-facto the visibility and understanding of the network power state for the operator as compared to the visibility and understanding of the network power state that is conventionally available accessing traditional SCADA telemetry. Thus, in an aspect, the GRC  can contain a WAMS  that can monitor operations and conditions of the PTDG, and can collect and\/or analyze power system related data (e.g., obtained from data sources) associated with the operations and conditions of the PTDG to facilitate real time or at least near real time system understanding of the status and conditions of the PTDG and control of operations of the PTDG.

The GRC  can identify and perform one or more remedial actions to rectify an identified potential power transmission and distribution problems in real time, so that such problems can be corrected before they can negatively impact stability of the PTDG.","In still another aspect, the WAMS  can facilitate analyzing or replaying historical power system related data to reconstruct events relating to power transmission and distribution, and operations of the PTDG. The reconstructed events can be analyzed by the WAMS  or other components of the GGSP to, for example, identify a root cause or source of an abnormal condition detected in the PTDG, optimize power system operations, evaluate conditions or performance of PTDG equipment, etc., as disclosed herein. The WAMS  also can generate one or more different types of alarms in real time and\/or predictively (e.g., based on a predictive analysis of power system related data), wherein the different types of alarms can relate to different types of abnormal conditions relating to power transmission and distribution, or operations associated with the PTDG. As desired, the data from the EPSMC(s)  and\/or the ECM(s)  can be utilized by the SCADA\/EMS component  as well.","In an aspect, the GRC  can comprise an online reliability assessment (ORA) module  that can provide a plurality of network stability analysis applications that can analyze the power system related data collected from one or more of the plurality of data sources (e.g., , , , and\/or ) and generate information indicating the reliability state (e.g., current reliability state) of the network (e.g., PTDG) in real or near real time, wherein such information can be presented to the operator (or another component associated with the GGSP) to allow the operator to quickly assess the reliability state of the portion of the PTDG for which the operator (or component) is responsible. In an embodiment, the ORA module  also can employ state-of-the art model-based applications, such as, for example, Quick Network Topology Assessment, with enhanced solution speed (e.g., at a subsecond rate) to manage, process, and\/or analyze the power system related data (e.g., obtained from the data sources (e.g., , , and\/or , ), or data analysis or synthesis results). Further, the GRC  can employ one or more security analysis tools that can execute at desired rates (e.g., on a subsecond level, or on the order of a second or more) in order to continually track the changing state of the power grid, or portion thereof, in real or near real time.","In another aspect, as new power system related data is received by the GRC , the ORA module  can analyze the new power system related data as well as historical power system related data, and can update the current power system state and contingency analysis results accordingly, based at least in part on the new power system related data and\/or the historical power system related data, in accordance with the predefined power system control criteria.

This can result in improved observability and solution accuracy in state estimation of the PTDG by the state estimator of the ORA module , as compared to conventional power grid systems using only SCADA\/EMS technology for state estimation. In an aspect, the ORA module  also can perform power system parameter estimation, as well as provide support for islanding and re-synchronization, using information received from an EPSMC(s)  or other data sources, and this can complement the application portfolio (such as disclosed herein) available at GRC level.","In addition, the GRC  also can utilize or model smart network devices (e.g., IEDs), such as those known in the art, and integrate them into the power systems applications suite. All or a portion of these smart network devices can be triggered and operated at a subsecond rate (e.g., in the millisecond range). These smart network devices also can be integrated into automated fast closed loop defense schemes of the GRC . These smart network devices can be some of the controls that can ensure that the PTDG is \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cself-healing\u201d and capable of responding quickly to imminent threats to security of the PTDG or PTDG operations.","In yet another aspect, the ORA module  can include one or more applications that can perform predictive security analysis. For instance, the ORA module  can employ an application(s) that can analyze received power system related data, and generate a subset of disparate predicted power-system operation scenarios (e.g., event(s)) comprising one or more predicted power-system operation scenarios, such as a best case power-system operation scenario, worst case power-system operation scenario, and\/or most likely case power-system operation scenario, and other prediction information, such as the respective percentages of likelihood of each scenario occurring, based at least in part on current or historical power system related data and the predefined power system control criteria. The subset of disparate predicted power-system operation scenarios and related prediction information can be presented to the operator or another component associated with the GGSP, so that the operator or other component associated with the GGSP can be aware of such predicted scenarios and can make decisions relating to operation of the PTDG based at least in part on the predicted scenarios and associated prediction information. As an example, the ORA module  can employ a power system simulator that can be utilized to perform fast \u201clook-ahead\u201d analysis of the received power system related data and simulate operation of the PTDG to predict how the PTDG will operate given specified parameters and conditions, and can generate and present the subset of disparate predicted power-system operation scenarios to the operator or other GGSP component, wherein the \u201clook-ahead\u201d analysis and operation simulations can be performed at a rate that can enable real time or near real time control of PTDG operations.","In an aspect, the GRC  can contain an online stability system (OSS) module  that can employ combined or integrated features on dynamic security phenomena of the PTDG. For instance, the OSS module  can include a dynamic stability analysis (DSA) component  that can perform model-based DSA using a complete network (e.g., PTDG) model (e.g., both static and dynamic) of the PTDG, for example, using the data collected from the one or more data sources , , , and\/or . The DSA component  can provide a comprehensive suite of applications that can analyze various stability phenomena, such as, for example, small signal stability analysis (SSSA), voltage stability analysis (VSA) and transient stability analysis (TSA), associated with the PTDG. This can be of paramount importance in PTDG operations, since, for example, for a certain transmission corridor of the PTDG, a thermal overload constraint could be the most restrictive during the morning load rise, while in the afternoon, the stability margin could become the most restrictive constraint. The OSS module , employing the DSA component , can dynamically perform and analyze the SSSA, VSA, and\/or TSA associated with the PTDG, and can dynamically control PTDG operations based at least in part on the results of such analysis to, for example, account for or manage a most restrictive constraint (or a subset of the most restrictive constraints) on PTDG operations at a given time period.","In still another aspect, as a complement, in addition to the model-based DSA, PMU-technology of a PMU type data source (e.g., ) also can facilitate providing a measurement-based approach for stability analysis relating to the PTDG, wherein the analysis can be performed by the OSS module . For instance, leveraging the PMU-technology of such a data source, the OSS module  can comprise an enhanced stability analysis component (ESAC)  that can monitor the level of instability in the PTDG (e.g., various portions of the PTDG) and can perform (e.g., dynamically, in real time or at least near real time) on-line detection and analysis of the level of oscillatory instability in the PTDG and can identify undesired oscillatory instability (e.g., a level of oscillatory instability that is outside the threshold value or range of values for instability), which can naturally complement the steady-state grid security applications of the GRC . The ESAC  can employ one or more components (e.g., associated with one or more applications), such as an oscillatory stability monitoring (OSM) component , that can allow detection of local and inter area low frequency oscillations. By monitoring and identifying poorly damped oscillations (e.g., oscillations that are outside the threshold value or range of values for oscillations), when the OSM component  detects such poorly damped oscillations, the OSM component  can trigger or generate early warning signals, which the OSM component  can provide (e.g., present) to the operator or another GGSP component giving the operator or other GGSP component sufficient time to react and avoid potential blackout situations in the PTDG (e.g., in real time or at least near real time). The OSS module  thus can comprise an overall comprehensive stability assessment system comprising the combination of both complementary approaches (e.g., model-based DSA by the DSA component  and measurement-based analysis by the ESAC ). This can thereby provide, for example, synthetic stability indices with tendencies relating to the PTDG for the power grid operators.","In yet another aspect, the system  can include a communication network  that can be employed to facilitate wireline or wireless communication between components (e.g., components, modules, centers, hubs, sources, etc.) or devices associated with the PTDG. For instance, the one or more data sources , , , and\/or , and the GRC , can be communicatively connected to the communication network  via a wireline or wireless communication connection utilizing one or more wireline or wireless communication technologies (e.g., wireline communication channels, such as digital subscriber line (DSL)-type channels, broadband-type channels, broadband over power lines (BPL), power line carriers (PLC), power line digital subscriber lines (PDSL), etc.; and wireless communication channels, such as cellular communication channels, Wi-Fi communication channels, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax) communication channels, femtocell communication channels, satellite communication channels, wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) channels, wireless local area network (WLAN) channels, etc.), and corresponding communication protocols (e.g., International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) type protocol, such as IEC 870-5-101\/104; Distributed Network Protocol (DNP), such as DNP-3; Transmission Control Protocol (TCP); Internet protocol (IP); General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) type protocol; etc.).","In accordance with various aspects, the communication network  can include a core network (not shown) that can facilitate routing communications (e.g., data communications) between the GGSP  and other communication devices (e.g., data source, computer, mobile phone (e.g., cellular phone, smart phone), personal digital assistant (PDA), electronic notepad, electronic netbook, electronic gaming device, another type of electronic device with communication capabilities, servers (e.g., email server, multimedia server, audio server, video server, news server, financial or stock information server), etc.) via the core network or via an Internet protocol (IP)-based network (e.g., Internet, intranet, etc.) (not shown) associated with (e.g., included in or connected to) the communication network . The core network also can allocate resources to the control nodes in the communication network , convert or enforce protocols, establish and enforce QoS for the control nodes or other devices, provide applications or services in the network, translate signals, and\/or perform other desired functions to facilitate system interoperability and communication in the wireless communication network. The core network further can include desired components, such as routers, nodes (e.g., serving general-packet-radio-service (GPRS) support node (SGSN), gateway GPRS support node (GGSN), etc.), switches, interfaces, controllers, etc., that can facilitate communication of data between the GGSP  and other communication devices associated with the communication network . The communication network  also can include the IP-based network, which can be associated with the core network, and which can facilitate communications by the GGSP  and other communication devices associated with the communication network  at least in part via communication of data packets (e.g., IP-based data packets) between the GGSP  and other communication devices associated with the communication network  using a wireline or wireless communication connection in accordance with specified IP protocols. In still another aspect, in addition to or as an alternative to, the GGSP  and other communication devices being able to communicate with each other via the communication network , the GGSP  and other communication devices can communicate with each other via communication technology(ies) (e.g., BPL, PLC, PDSL, etc.) associated with the transmission power lines in the PTDG.","Turning to  (along with ),  illustrates a diagram of an example system  implementing an OSS in accordance with various embodiments and aspects of the disclosed subject matter. The system  can comprise a GRC  associated with a substation. The GRC  can employ an OSS , which can function as more fully disclosed herein, wherein the OSS  can include an oscillatory stability monitoring (OSM) component , that can be employed, in part, to monitor at least a portion of the PTDG and detect local and inter area low frequency oscillations in the portion of the PTDG the OSM component  monitors. By monitoring and identifying poorly damped oscillations, the OSS module  and\/or OSM component  can transmit (e.g., automatically or dynamically) an early warning signal(s) to the operator (or a GGSP component) notifying the operator (or GGSP component) quickly enough to allow the operator (or GGSP component) to have enough time to react and avoid potential blackout situations or other undesired conditions in the PTDG.","In another aspect, the OSM component  can be associated with a PDC module , as more fully disclosed herein. The PDC module  can receive data (e.g., measurements, parameter values, indicators, time stamps, geographical tags, topological tags, etc.) from one or more data sources, such as EPSMC  (e.g., PMU), EPSMC  (e.g., PMU), EPSMC  (e.g., collapse prediction relay (CPR)), or one or more other devices (e.g., IEDs, smart grid devices) or sensors . One or more specified protocols (e.g., IEEE 37.118) can be employed by the PDC module , OSS module , OSM component , and\/or the one or more data sources to communicate, collect, or concentrate (e.g., communicate, collect and\/or concentrate, at a second, subsecond or millisecond-order rate) all or a portion of the data obtained from or otherwise associated with the one or more data sources.","In another aspect, the PDC module  and one or more of the data sources (e.g., EPSMC , EPSMC , EPSMC , and\/or sensors , etc.) can communicate with each other via a wireline (e.g., DSL, PLC, broadband, etc.) or wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, cellular, etc.) communication connection using an applicable communication protocol(s), to facilitate communication of data at relatively fast rates, which can facilitate real time or at least near real time control of the PTDG.","In still another aspect, the system  can employ an EMS component  (e.g., as part of the GRC), wherein the EMS component  can collect data from the one or more data sources and perform state estimation of the PTDG (e.g., at a rate on the order of a second(s) or even faster (e.g., subsecond rate)), and\/or can collect and process data from the one or more data sources associated with the PTDG and provide the collected data to the ORA module (e.g., ) in the GRC (e.g., ), and the ORA module can perform state estimation on the power grid, as more fully disclosed herein. For example, the EMS component  can collect data, such as data relating to voltage and current measurements performed by a PMU (e.g., EPSMC , EPSMC ), from the PMU, wherein such data can be collected at a subsecond or millisecond-order rate. The ORA module and\/or EMS component  can perform state estimation to identify or estimate the state of the PTDG and\/or perform a contingency analysis in real or near real time. By using the PMU measurement data, the ORA module and\/or EMS component  can perform state estimation of the PTDG that is improved over the traditional state estimation performed by conventional SCADA\/EMS systems.","In another aspect, the GRC  can include a WAMS  that can perform various power system monitoring, data analysis of power system related data, alarm processing, and other functions, as more fully disclosed herein, to facilitate real time or at least near real time system understanding of the status and conditions of the PTDG and control of operations of the PTDG. The WAMS  can collect, concentrate, and\/or aggregate data (e.g., power system related data), such as data associated with (e.g., produced by and received from) the one or more data sources, such as EPSMC , EPSMC , EPSMC , and\/or sensors , to facilitate utilizing and\/or processing the data to control power transmission and distribution, and operations associated with the PTDG.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0115"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","502","502","504","506","508","510","512","514","516","502","508","510","512","514","516","502","502"]},"In an aspect, the GDPC  can include an equipment health monitoring and dynamic rating (EHMDR) module  that can fully leverage information provided by local intelligent systems in charge of monitoring online conditions of critical assets (e.g., PTDG equipment, such as a power transformer) within the PTDG. In the case of a power transformer, such local or remote systems can provide advanced monitoring of all transformer main components, wherein an online condition monitoring, diagnosis and expert system also can include gas analysis, if desired. Distributed condition monitoring systems can transmit (e.g., broadcast) a subset of desired (e.g., relevant) information to the EHMDR module , and the EHMDR module  can generate or synthesize information relating to the state (e.g., current state) of the power transformer, based at least in part on the subset of desired information, and can provide an end user (e.g., grid operator) with synthetic information representative of the \u201ctrue\u201d state (e.g., \u201chealth\u201d state, operation level, power output, detected fault(s), equipment condition, etc.) of the transformer at a given time.","In another aspect, using this state information combined with operational and maintenance rules, which can be applied to the state information, the EHMDR module  can detect and\/or identify an abnormal condition relating to operation or equipment condition relating to a portion of the PTDG, and can trigger (e.g., dynamically or automatically) real-time alarming to the GRC in case of an abnormal condition being detected, so that the grid operator can be immediately informed of potential issues with the PTDG equipment. The approach is to provide an early warning signal, which can avoid a potential harmful situation such as sudden failure of a piece of PTDG equipment with immediate negative impact on the PTDG operation, such as, for example, an emergency power outage. In an aspect, the GRC and\/or a grid operator can perform a desired corrective action to rectify, prevent, alleviate, and\/or minimize a potentially harmful situation, as detected by the EHMDR module . For instance, the early detection of the potential harmful situation relating to the PTDG and generation of the early warning signal by the EHMDR module  can leave time for the grid operator or the GRC to identify an alternate operation scheme (e.g., transformer de-ration and load transfer, for instance), wherein the alternate operation scheme can be implemented by the grid operator or GRC to eliminate, prevent, or minimize a negative impact on the PTDG operation.","In still another aspect, the EHMDR module  also can utilize the distributed intelligence of the PTDG to facilitate assessing in real-time the dynamic rating of PTDG infrastructure, such as, for example, overhead transmission lines. For instance, the EHMDR module  can obtain electrical measurements of the amount of electricity being distributed by the overhead transmission lines, and can obtain information relating to the physical state of conductors and ambient conditions associated with the transmission lines from one or more sensors monitoring the transmission lines or components associated therewith. The EHMDR module  can analyze the measurement information and sensor information to render an accurate assessment (e.g., dynamically) of the cable ampacity of the transmission lines, wherein the cable ampacity can be used on grid operation side as a real-time conductor limit for network monitoring.","In another aspect, the GDPC  can include an equipment performance monitor (EPM) module  that can monitor the performance and condition of PTDG equipment. For instance, the EPM module  can receive information regarding actual equipment performance of a piece of PTDG equipment (e.g., from the EHMDR component ), access as-built manufacturer equipment performance datasheets comprising information regarding a piece of PTDG equipment (e.g., power transformer), and can compare the actual equipment performance of the piece of PTDG equipment with the as-built manufacturer equipment performance datasheet for that piece of PTDG equipment. Based at least in part on that comparison analysis, the EPM module  can identify the condition state of the piece of PTDG equipment over time, including identifying degradation of the PTDG equipment and equipment functions over time. This can be of benefit for a utility, as the EPM module  can enable the GRC and\/or a grid operator to anticipate PTDG equipment failures and\/or also can be used to trigger performance of a comparative analysis of similar PTDG equipment in the equipment fleet associated with the utility. The information relating to the comparative analysis generated by the EPM module  in relation to PTDG equipment also can be valuable in interaction with equipment manufacturers and associated maintenance services as equipment manufacturers can learn more about the actual performance of their PTDG equipment from the comparative analysis results, and maintenance services can learn more about the type(s) and frequency(ies) of maintenance to be performed on the PTDG equipment based at least in part on the comparative analysis results.","In an aspect, based at least in part on the information relating to actual PTDG equipment performance and conditions, information relating to the manufacturer equipment performance datasheets, comparison analysis of such information, and one or more equipment rules (e.g., in accordance with the predefined power system criteria), the EPM module  can automatically trigger generation and transmission of work orders to, for example, the EAMC (e.g., ), when an abnormal performance of PTDG equipment is detected or predicted. The fleet analysis view realized by the EPM module  also can bring a global approach to analyzing and correcting systematic equipment misbehavior (e.g., malfunctions, abnormal conditions). The EPM module  can interpret any detected performance behaviors via, for example, Key Performance Indicator calculation (e.g., configurable logic) and can generate one or more ad-hoc reports (e.g., ad-hoc PTDG equipment performance and conditions reports), which can be provided to other power system related components and\/or any interested parties within the utility organization.","In still another aspect, the GDPC  can include an equipment diagnostic and prediction module (EDPM)  that can complement the EHMDR module , and can provide diagnostic and prediction features relating to the operation, performance, PTDG conditions (e.g., power conditions, communication conditions, etc.), PTDG equipment conditions, etc., of the PTDG. The EDPM  can perform a simulation of operations, performance, and conditions of a portion (e.g., a piece of PTDG equipment, all or a portion of a PTDG sub-system, etc.) of the PTDG to simulate future operations, performance, and conditions of the portion of the PTDG at a given future period of or moment in time, based at least in part on information relating to the current condition of the portion of the PTDG portion and\/or historical information relating to the portion of the PTDG. Based at least in part on the simulation, the EDPM  can predict the future operations, performance, and conditions of the portion of the PTDG, and\/or make one or more diagnoses relating to the portion of the PTDG, at a given future period of or moment in time. As disclosed herein, such predictive and diagnostic features can have a paramount potential, as, for example, the simulation performed by the EDPM  can identify whether a temporary overload capacity for a portion of the PTDG is to be permitted or not (e.g., when a temporary overload capacity is requested), based at least in part on the results of the simulation of the future operations, performance, and conditions of the portion of the PTDG.","In another aspect, these simulation and prediction capabilities also can be applied to circuit-breaker monitoring systems. By not only focusing on the number of breaker operations but also taking into account conditions for past current cuts, the EDPM  can determine or identify the likely performance degradation over time for a switching device, such as a circuit-breaker. In one aspect, the EDPM  can generate and provide an early warning signal regarding a piece of equipment, and\/or can automatically trigger condition-based maintenance work orders, on the EAM side, to have maintenance work performed on the piece of equipment, based at least in part on the current or predicted future condition (e.g., degradation, equipment failure, etc.) of the piece of equipment. One objective achieved by the EDPM  is to be able to predict or anticipate equipment failures by performing more advanced simulation and predictive failure analysis which can thereby allow the utilities to perform maintenance and\/or take fragile equipment (e.g., degraded or likely to fail) out of service for repair before the actual defect occurs to the equipment. This approach can decrease the number of power system equipment malfunctions or failures over time which can translate into a reduced number of outages, shorter outage duration, and reduced cost for corrective maintenance of PTDG equipment.","In yet another aspect, the GDPC  can contain a root cause analysis (RCA) module  that can identify a root cause(s) or source(s) of an abnormal condition (e.g., power system parameter with an abnormal parameter value, fault or failure associated with PTDG equipment, etc.) associated with the PTDG. The RCA module  can receive information from one or more data sources (e.g., , , , , , , and\/or ), and can leverage and apply predefined logic (e.g., one or more predefined power system control rules) to that information to correlate the information and identify the source(s) or cause(s) of the abnormal condition associated with the PTDG.","The disclosed subject matter, by providing RCA capabilities, can provide the benefit of closing the information loop and providing return of experience and root cause identification associated with the PTDG. The RCA module  can operate in conjunction with the EDPM module  to facilitate performing a RCA, as, for example, the EDPM module  can provide information, such as results of analysis or simulation based at least in part on data received from the one or more data sources, and the RCA module  can use and\/or analyze the information received from the EDPM module  and other information received from the one or more other data sources to identify the root source(s) of cause(s) of an abnormal condition associated with the PTDG. In another aspect, the RCA module  can provide features for alarm reduction and synthesis, which can be fully leveraged at the GRC side.","One significant issue affecting pieces of PTDG equipment are their excessively old ages. In some utilities, several hundreds of power transformers may be 40 years or older. This can represent huge risks borne by the utility and obviously can cause an undesired increase in corrective maintenance costs and also an undesired increase in average outage frequency and duration times. Replacing such a fleet of PTDG equipment in a very short period of time is not realistic from an economic point of view nor an execution point of view knowing the grid operation constraints. It can therefore be beneficial for the utility to have an \u201cassistant\u201d for prioritizing fleet replacement.","In view of this, in an aspect, the GDPC  can comprise a replacement plan assistant (RPA) module  that can generate a replacement plan to replace respective pieces of PTDG equipment at respective times, in accordance with the predefined power system control criteria. In accordance with various aspects, the RPA module  can utilize the GDPC  to establish a comprehensive diagnostic landscape of the pieces of target PTDG equipment and identify and generate a priority equipment replacement sequence based at least in part on the actual respective health levels of the respective pieces of PTDG equipment; use the GRC (e.g., ) to assess the related reliability impacts of the items (e.g., equipment replacement items, equipment repair items, etc.) priority equipment replacement sequence, and identify and generate a respective remedial actions plan; and use the EAM (e.g., EAMC ) to perform the economic impacts and develop the remedial action execution plan, based at least in part on information in the remedial plan.","Conventional power systems typically prioritize fleet replacement by only taking into account the age of the asset, which is not sufficient. To overcome this deficiency, the RPA module  can perform a failure\/risk assessment of performance of respective remedial action items on PTDG equipment, and can generate a remedial action execution plan based at least in part on such failure\/risk assessment. In an aspect, the RPA module  can interact (e.g., communicate) with the EHMDR module , EPM module , and EDPM module  and\/or other components to obtain information (e.g., data, data analysis results, etc.) that can be analyzed to facilitate generating the remedial action execution plan. In another aspect, the RPA module  can integrate a grid security dimension, as performance (e.g., temporal performance) of remedial action items (e.g., PTDG equipment replacement, repair, or maintenance) in the remedial action execution plan can be arranged so that grid reliability can be maintained, wherein, for example, power system outages linked with PTDG equipment replacement, repair or maintenance can be minimized and scheduled at desired times. The RPA module  also can interface with one or more grid reliability look-ahead applications and can include one or more optimization engines to determine the most desirable (e.g., optimal) remedial action execution plan, taking into account various constraints (e.g., time to perform remedial actions, costs of the respective remedial actions, resource availability, PTDG security, power transformer manufacturer lead time, expected life time of PTDG equipment, penalty costs for anticipated corrective maintenance for life time extension, etc.).","As an example of various aspects of the functionality of the RPA module , the RPA module  can diagnose a condition or \u201chealth\u201d level of PTDG equipment, based at least in part on current or historical information (e.g., operating condition information, physical condition information, etc.) relating to the PTDG equipment. The RPA module  can generate a priority sequence for the performance of remedial actions (e.g., maintenance, repair, or replacement) of one or more pieces of PTDG equipment, based at least in part on analysis of the diagnosis of the condition or \u201chealth\u201d level of the PTDG equipment.","The RPA module  can evaluate the reliability impacts relating to the remedial actions of the priority sequence, in accordance with the predefined power system control criteria. The results of the reliability impacts can result in the RPA module  modifying (or not modifying) the priority sequence (e.g., modifying the order of remedial action, modifying priority level of a remedial action, etc.) and\/or including contextual results of the reliability impact evaluation with the priority sequence for further processing and evaluation. The RPA module  can generate a remedial action plan, based at least in part on the priority sequence and the reliability impact evaluation. The remedial action plan can include information relating to, for example, the temporal order of performance of respective remedial actions on respective pieces of PTDG equipment, the respective types of remedial actions to be performed on the respective pieces of PTDG equipment, economic information (e.g., respective economic costs) of performing the remedial actions on the respective pieces of PTDG equipment, contextual information relating to the respective remedial actions and\/or respective pieces of equipment, and\/or other information.","The RPA module  can evaluate economic impact of the remedial action plan. For example, the RPA module  can perform a cost\/benefit analysis on the remedial action plan as a whole, or on respective portions of the remedial action plan, to facilitate determining the economic impact of the remedial action plan in context. For instance, the RAP module  can identify and correlate the respective costs of performing the respective remedial actions temporally, locationally, and\/or topologically with the remedial actions, as desired. For example, the costs of performing the remedial actions can be correlated or grouped together over specified time periods (e.g., each month) to determine respective expected expenditures in performing the remedial actions over the respective specified time periods.","The RPA module  can generate a remedial action execution plan, based at least in part on the evaluation results of the economic impact of the remedial action plan. Based at least in part on the evaluation results of the economic impact of the remedial action plan, the RPA module  can generate the remedial action execution plan to include all or a desired portion of the remedial action items contained in the remedial action plan, modify a certain remedial action item(s) in the remedial action execution plan from the remedial action plan or replace the certain remedial action item(s) with a different remedial action item(s), modify the temporal order of performance of respective remedial actions in the remedial action execution plan from that contained in the remedial action plan, and\/or otherwise modify the remedial action plan to facilitate generating the remedial action execution plan, based at least in part on the evaluation results and the predefined power system control criteria.","In yet another aspect, the GDPC  can include a complex event processor (CEP) module  that can process multiple events to identify a subset of events that are relevant, for example, to identify added value information, and generate synthetic information that can identify and\/or propose one or more remedial actions that can be performed on PTDG equipment, wherein the synthetic information can be provided to the end user (e.g., grid operator). The CEP module  can be associated with various components, including, for example, the EHMDR module , the EPM module , the EDPM module , the RCA module , and the RPA module , and can receive data (e.g., data from data sources, synthesized data relating to data from data sources, analysis results relating to data from data sources, etc.) from those components and\/or other data sources associated with the GDPC . In an aspect, the CEP module  can analyze current and historical information relating to the power system and can detect complex patterns, correlate PTDG-related events, identify causes or sources of PTDG-related events, and\/or identify relationships between disparate PTDG-related events, etc., across different types of data, wherein the data can be correlated based at least in part on various temporal, locational, topological, and\/or other factors, as more fully disclosed herein.","In another aspect, the CEP module  can employ or configure one or more rules or algorithms, wherein the CEP module  can include a platform for defining physical power system behavior, in part by analyzing the data, detecting complex patterns, correlating PTDG-related events, identifying causes or sources of PTDG-related events, and\/or identifying relationships between disparate PTDG-related events, etc., in a discovery mode and\/or iterative mode. Based at least in part on its data analysis and predefined power system control criteria, the CEP module  can generate or configure (e.g., dynamically and\/or iteratively) rules, algorithms, and\/or logic (e.g., complex logic) that can be employed to facilitate controlling operations of the PTDG. The new rules, algorithms, and\/or logic can be sequentially added in the platform for use by the CEP module  and\/or other components of the GGSP, for example, after validation and\/or user acceptance of the rules, algorithms, and\/or logic.","In still another aspect, the GDPC  can perform a post mortem analysis regarding an event(s) (e.g., abnormal condition, fault, etc.) associated with the PTDG. The GDPC  can collect power system related data (e.g., a subset of correlated power system related data) over a specified time period to facilitate identifying phenomena, behaviors, or events, which have or may have occurred on the PTDG. The GDPC  can employ (e.g., execute) component models (e.g., PTDG equipments models) to simulate the PTDG components that were employed in the PTDG during various times of the specified time period; replay a sequence of events, network studies, oscillation characteristics, etc., associated with the portion of the PTDG for which the post mortem analysis is being performed; and utilize the CEP module , RCA module , or another component(s) associated with the GDPC  to perform the post mortem analysis of the event(s) associated with the PTDG over the specified time period, identify one or more remedial actions to execute based at least in part on the results of the post mortem analysis, or identify operation or maintenance guidance (e.g., new or modified operation or maintenance rules) based at least in part on the results of the post mortem analysis, in accordance with the predefined power system control criteria.","For example, in performing a post-mortem review relating to a low frequency oscillation, the GDPC  can obtain information desired to perform the post mortem review, wherein the information can be, for example, phasor data, PTDG topology, sequence of events that have occurred relating to the PTDG, protection settings, from the DIH. The GDPC  can access the OSS and execute an oscillatory stability analysis (e.g., offline), and, in parallel, can process sequence-of-events data to identify a source location of the low frequency oscillations. Employing model-based OSS analysis, the GDPC  can identify and validate one or more remedial actions that can be implemented to rectify the detected low frequency oscillations. The GDPC  also can analyze any impacts on the protection settings. The GDPC  can provide (e.g., publish) the one or more remedial actions for automatic implementation by the GGSP or for operator guidance of the end user.","In accordance with yet another aspect, the system  can include a DIH  that can receive, collect, aggregate, and\/or correlate data, such as data obtained from one or more data sources, associated with the GGSP, wherein the DIH  can comprise the same or similar functionality as more fully disclosed herein. The DIH  can be associated with (e.g., communicatively connected to) the EHMDR module , EPM module , EDPM module , RCA module , RPA module , and\/or other components associated with the GGSP.
