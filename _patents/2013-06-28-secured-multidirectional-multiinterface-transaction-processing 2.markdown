{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Field","Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to processing secure transactions.","Background","Conducting transactions electronically is becoming more common, especially conducting transactions from a mobile device. For example, a conventional mobile device (such as a mobile telephone, laptop computer, tablet computer, and the like) may be capable of sending and receiving electronic payments. Sharing sensitive or confidential information\u2014such as credit card information, bank account and routing information, and the like\u2014is often required to process an electronic payment.","In some situations and environments, certain components of a conventional mobile device (such as a processor) may not be secure; that is, they may be compromised by a computer virus or a hacker. In these situations and environments, any sensitive or confidential information exchanged during the transaction may be exposed, intercepted, and subsequently used maliciously and without authorization.","While the present disclosure is described herein with illustrative embodiments for particular applications, it should be understood that the disclosure is not limited thereto. A person skill in the art with access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which the disclosure would be of significant utility.","The terms \u201cembodiments\u201d or \u201cexample embodiments\u201d do not require that all embodiments include the discussed feature, advantage, or mode of operation. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure, and well-known elements may not be described in detail or may be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details. In addition, the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. For example, as used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d and \u201cincluding,\u201d when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, or groups thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 1-6"],"b":["10","10","10","20","30","30","40","50","60"],"i":["a","z"]},"Some or all of the components of the apparatuses depicted in  (i.e., , , , , , , and ) may be implemented in the same integrated circuit or in different integrated circuits. For example, and with reference to the apparatus  of , the processor , the secure element , and the connectivity device  may each be implemented in the same integrated circuit; or the secure element  and the connectivity device  may be implemented in the same integrated circuit, and the processor  in a different integrated circuit; or the processor  and the connectivity device  may be implemented in the same integrated circuit, and the secure element  in a different integrated circuit; or the processor , the secure element , and the connectivity device  may each be implemented in different integrated circuits. Also, as should be apparent to a person skilled in the art, other components may be included in the apparatuses depicted in , but may not necessary be required to achieve some or all of the aspects of this disclosure.","The apparatus  of  includes a processor , a secure element , and a connectivity device . The processor  is communicatively coupled to the secure element  and to the connectivity device , and includes interfaces  and  to communicate with the secure element  and the connectivity device , respectively. The processor  may be any processing device, including, but not limited to, a general purpose processor, a central processing unit (CPU), a microprocessor, an application-specific instruction set processor, and the like.","The secure element  of  is communicatively coupled to the processor  and to the connectivity device , and includes interfaces  and  to communicate with the processor  and the connectivity device , respectively. The secure element  of  includes hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software for interfacing and communicating with the processor  and the connectivity device , and for securely processing transactions. All software described throughout this disclosure may be embodied as one or more instructions on a non-transitory computer readable medium.","In some example embodiments, the secure element  is an integrated circuit or chip that is embedded in a printed circuit board (PCB)\u2014such as a motherboard, mainboard, logic board, and the like\u2014along with other components of the apparatus . In other embodiments, the secure device  is disposed in a subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module (SIM) that can be coupled to and communicate with the apparatus  via an interface. In yet other embodiments, the secure element  is disposed in a secure digital (SD) card that can be coupled to and communicate with the apparatus  via an interface. In some of these example embodiments the secure element  is implemented as a smartcard chip, and communicates with other components by sending and receiving one or more application protocol data units (APDUs).","In , the secure element  includes the application \u2014which, because it is executed on the secure element , may be referred to as a \u201csecure application.\u201d The application \u2014which may be an applet, or any other set of executable instructions\u2014may be activated by the secure element  to process a transaction, such as a secure transaction. Financial transactions (such as sending or receiving a payment), personal identification, the exchange of sensitive or confidential information (such as exchanging personal contact information, or personal medical information), and the establishment of a secure communication channel (or link) are non-limiting examples of secure transactions. Also, while illustrated as a single application in , it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the application  may represent plural applications, applets, and the like.","In some example embodiments, the secure element  includes an application for each \u201ctype\u201d of transaction that may be conducted by the secure element . For example, the secure element  may include a first application for processing secure financial transactions, a second application for the secure exchange of sensitive or confidential information, and a third application for establishing a secure communication channel. In these or other embodiments, the secure element  may include an application for each vendor, party, or device that the apparatus  conducts a transaction with. For example, the secure element  may include a first application for conducting a secure financial transaction with a first banking institution, and a second application for conducting a secure financial transaction with a second banking institution.","In some situations and environments, such as a mobile computing environment, the processor  may not be trusted or secure\u2014it may be compromised by a computer virus or a hacker, and any sensitive or confidential information used by the processor  may be exposed. Thus, in some example embodiments, the secure element  includes all necessary hardware (e.g., processor, memory, etc.) and software to process a secure transaction without requiring the processor  (or any other component) to process any of the transaction. That is, in these embodiments, the entire transaction is processed by the secure element ; as opposed to processing part or all of the transaction at the processor  (or any other component). As an example, the secure element  receives a request from either the processor  or the communication device  to process a secure transaction. In this example, the secure element  identifies the type of transaction requested, and activates an appropriate application residing on the secure element  (such as application ), which processes the transaction. This example illustrates that, while the secure element  may communicate with the processor  or the communication device  (or both) to obtain information regarding a transaction, the entire transaction may be processed by the secure element .","Turning again to , the connectivity device  is communicatively coupled to the processor  and to the secure element . The connectivity device  includes interfaces  and  to communicate with the secure element  and the processor , respectively. The connectivity device  also includes interface  for interfacing and communicating with one or more external devices. As such, the connectivity device  includes hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software for interfacing and communicating with the processor , the secure element , and one or more external devices. In some example embodiments\u2014such as the embodiment depicted by  (described below)\u2014an apparatus for processing a secure transaction includes more than one connectivity device.","The connectivity device  of  may be any device for sending and receiving communications\u2014wired or wireless\u2014to and from the apparatus .

In some example embodiments, the secure element  may generate and send an unsolicited communication, including an unsolicited command or instruction, to the connectivity device . In these embodiments, the connectivity device  receives\u2014via interface \u2014the unsolicited communication from the secure element , parses the unsolicited communication to identify the unsolicited command, and executes the unsolicited command. Here, the communication and the embedded command may be considered \u201cunsolicited\u201d because the connectivity device  did not request the communication from the secure element ; that is, the secure element  initiated the communication with the connectivity device . In these embodiments, it may be said that the connectivity device  (or the interface ) \u201clistens to\u201d and responds to secure element . The connectivity device  may \u201clisten to\u201d and respond to the processor  and one or more external devices in a similar manner. Also, the processor  may \u201clisten to\u201d and respond to the secure element  in a similar manner.","Each of the interfaces , , , , , , and  of  may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. Also\u2014as should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art\u2014the processor , secure element , and connectivity device  may include other interfaces for coupling to and communicating with devices, circuits, chips, components, and the like other than those shown in .","To facilitate interaction among the elements (e.g., , , and ) of , each element may provide an application programming interface (API) for the other elements to implement. For example, the connectivity device  provides an API that the secure element , or an application (such as application  of \u2014described further below) executing on the secure element , implements so that the secure element  can interact with and exploit the functionality of the communication device . Likewise, the secure element  may provide an API that the processor , or an application (such as application  of \u2014described further below) executing on the processor , implements so that the processor  can interact with and exploit the functionality of the secure element . Thus, each element of  may be able to communicate in a format compatible with each other element of .","As mentioned, an apparatus for processing a secure transaction may include plural connectivity devices.  illustrates an example apparatus  for processing a secure transaction that includes a processor  and a secure element  similar to those depicted and described in accordance with , but also includes plural connectivity devices -. In , the connectivity devices -may be the same type of connectivity device or different types of connectivity devices, and may communicate with other devices using the same or different communications protocols.

Because the apparatus initiates the transaction in , the pair and may be referred to as \u201cmaster\u201d and \u201cslave\u201d (respectively), or as \u201creader\u201d and \u201ctag\u201d (respectively); however, the roles of the apparatuses and may be reversed without departing from the scope of the disclosure.","Turning to stage , which corresponds to communication (1) of , the processor of the apparatus sends a transaction request to the external destination (apparatus) via the connectivity device . The transaction request may be generated by an application (e.g., application ) executing on the processor , and the application may be used to process\u2014in whole or in part\u2014the transaction.
