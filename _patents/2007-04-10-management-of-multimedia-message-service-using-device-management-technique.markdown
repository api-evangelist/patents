Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a message service and, more particularly, to a technique for remotely managing a message service in a terminal (device).","2. Description of the Related Art","A message service is a technology allowing a user to transmit or receive a message to or from another party through a fixed line terminal or a mobile terminal. The message service includes a short message service (SMS), an enhanced message service (EMS), and a multimedia message service (MMS), etc. Recently, the MMS, which allows users to attach diverse multimedia such as text, photos, video or audio into a message and transmit and receive it, is commonly used.","In order to execute the message service in the terminal, the terminal should have a message client and various set parameters. First, in order to allow the terminal to be connected with a network, information (or set values) for connectivity should be set in the terminal. In addition, various parameters that can be adjusted, e.g., a parameter for reporting whether a recipient has received a message after the message is transmitted, can be set in the terminal.","Therefore, in order to address the above matters the various features described herein have been conceived. An aspect of the exemplary embodiments is to manage a message service of a terminal through device management (DM) techniques. Here, the DM is a technique by which a particular device (or client) (e.g., a terminal) for which DM is to be performed, provides its resources or parameters (set values) in the form of a tree or other hierarchical logical structure to a DM server, and the DM server accesses and manages the desired resource(s) or parameter(s) of the tree.","This specification provides a method for managing a message service of a terminal that may include: configuring a management object related to a message service in the form of a tree; receiving a request for providing the management object related to the message service from a DM server; and providing the tree of the management object to the DM server.","This specification also provides a method for managing a message service that may include: providing a management object related to a message service to a DM server; receiving a request for updating a parameter of the management object from the DM server; and updating the parameter of the management object according to the request.","This specification also provides a terminal that may include: a management object that comprises at least one among a first node that allows an application of the terminal to refer to a connectivity parameter for a message service and a second node that designates a URL (Uniform Resource Location) of an MMS Proxy-Relay; and an enabler that allows a device management (DM) server to access the management object.","This specification also provides a device management (DM) server that may include: a transmitting\/receiving unit that receives, from a terminal, a management object related to a message service in the form of a tree (structure); and a processor that checks the received management object and selectively requests the terminal to update a parameter of the management object through the transmitting\/receiving unit.","This specification also provides a server that may include: an enabler that receives a management object in the form of a tree, from a terminal, that includes at least one among a first node that allows an application of a terminal to refer to a connectivity parameter for a message service and a second node that designates a URL (Uniform Resource Location) of an MMS-Proxy-Relay, and accesses the management object.","The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","The exemplary embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.","In the attached drawings, although a terminal is shown as an example, such depicted terminal may also be referred to in terms of other expressions, such as, user equipment (UE), mobile equipment (ME), etc. In addition, the terminal can be a portable device such as a notebook computer, a mobile phone, a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), a smart phone, a multimedia device, etc., or can be a non-portable device such as a PC or a vehicle-mounted device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , a terminal  is wirelessly connected with an MMS (Multimedia Message Service) Proxy-Relay  for transmission and reception of a multimedia message (MM), and also wirelessly connected with a DM server  for management.","The terminal may include a DM enabler client  an MMS client , a task execution module , and a management object .","The DM enabler client  is connected with the MMS client , the task execution module , and the management object  to provide interface with the DM server  for DM. For example, the DM enable client  may report a state of the MMS client  to the DM server , or may receive a request for updating software of the MMS client  from the DM server . In addition, the DM enabler client  may provide the management object  in the form of a tree to the DM server  or receive a request for updating the management object  from the DM server .","The MMS client  may be an element for an MMS and may be implemented as software. The MMS client transfers a multimedia message (MM) created by a user to the MMS Proxy-Relay  such that the message can be transmitted to another party.","The MMS client  receives a message from an arbitrary originator (sender) through the MMS Proxy-Relay . The MMS client  may be connected with the DM enabler client  and report its state to the DM server  as mentioned above. In addition the MMS client  may be connected with the management object  to read a parameter of the management object  and drive a multimedia message service according to the parameter.","The task execution module  is connected with the DM enabler client  and the management object . The task execution module  may perform several operations for device management according to a request of the DM server . For example, the task execution module  may update several software of the terminal  or firmware according to a request of the DM server . Namely, as mentioned above, the task execution module  may update software of the MMS client  according to a request of the DM server .","The management object  may include resources of the terminal  or a parameter (set value). Namely, the management object  includes several parameters for allowing the MMS client  to drive the multimedia message service. Resource or parameters existing in the management object  is provided in the form of a tree by the DM enabler client  to the DM server , and the DM server  accesses the terminal  through the tree. In this case, the DM server  may access only a desired resource or parameter in the management object , rather than every parameter stored in the management object . The DM server  may modify, delete and update only a desired parameter. The management object  will now be described in detail with reference to .","The DM server  includes a DM enabler server . The DM enabler server  receives the management object in the form of a tree from the terminal , and accesses the management object. In addition, the DM enabler server  may request the terminal  to update a parameter of the management object.","The DM enabler server  may receive a report on a state from the MMS client  of the terminal . In addition, the DM enabler server  may request updating of an application of the terminal , e.g., software of the MMS client .","Thus far, the terminal  of the present disclosure has been described to include the DM enabler client , the MMS client , the task execution module  and the management object . However, but without being limited thereto, these elements may also be implemented as a combination of a processor, a communication module (also called a transmitting\/receiving unit or a network interface) and a storage unit.","Likewise, the DM server  according to the present invention may also include a combination of a processor (not shown), a communication module (also called a transmitting\/receiving unit or a network interface), and a storage unit (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As shown in , a management object including several parameters for a multimedia message service may have the form of a tree.
