{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","This invention relates generally to photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) and, in particular, to the fabrication, assembly, and use of a microelectromechanical (MEMS) resonant acoustic cavity and piezoelectric microphone for photoacoustic spectroscopy.","Broadly, photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) is a detection method based on several simple principles: 1) the absorption of light by an analyte molecule; 2) the subsequent generation of an acoustical wave generated by the molecular relaxation, and 3) the detection of the acoustic wave by a pressure sensing device (e.g., a microphone).","The basic photoacoustic effect was discovered over a century ago. A. G. Bell, , Vol. 29, page 115 (1880), . Vol. 11, page 510 (1881; J. Tyndall, . Vol. 31, page 307 (1881); and W. C. Rontgen, . Vol. 11, page 308 (1881) discovered the opto-acoustic effect and its use in the \u201cspectrophone.\u201d Briefly, input optical radiation, periodically interrupted at a frequency in the audible range, was directed upon a gas medium in a glass container; and the periodic pressure fluctuations resulting from the absorption of radiation by the gas was detected by ear through a listening tube connected to the container. Other background references of interest include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,700,890, issued Oct. 24, 1972 and 3,820,901 issued Jun. 28, 1974, each in the name of L. B. Kreuzer; L. B. Kreuzer, 42, 2934 (1971); C. F. Dewey et al, 23, 633 (1973); R. D. Kamm, 47, 3550 (1976); E. Max et al, 11, 422 (1974); and C. K. Patel et al, 30, 578 (1977).","To this day, most photoacoustic cells are macro-scale devices measuring from inches to upward of a meter in length. The basic designs consist of a light source and a sealed cell including gas inlets and outlets, transparent windows, and a sensing microphone. In the past, the optical radiation was provided by an assortment of light sources including lamps, lasers, light-emitting diodes (LED) and even blackbodies. Although some modern trace gas measurement instruments based on photoacoustics utilize lamps, the majority of recent research for trace gas sensing in photoacoustics has been dominated by the use of laser sources. In particular, lasers sources have allowed the added advantage of increased modulation capabilities (up to GHz levels) not possible with other sources. Most thermal sources modulated through alternating current only maintain full modulation depth at low frequency (<100 Hz). Even with mechanical modulation (chopper wheel) of these sources, the highest possible modulation is still modest (<6.4 kHz).","In order to increase sensitivity of the photoacoustic signals, the modulation of the light source is designed to correspond to the acoustic resonant frequency in the photoacoustic cell in order to amplify generated acoustic signals. The lowest order mode that could be acoustically resonated in such a structure would correspond to the first longitudinal mode given by \u03c9=c\/2l, where \u03c9is the acoustic frequency, c is the speed of sound, and lis the resonator length. Resonant photoacoustic cells designed to take advantage of typical MEMS processing would practically have resonant structures on the order of one to several millimeters in length. Assuming atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature, and the resonator lengths suggested above implies an optical radiation source would have to modulated at approximately 10-100 KHz level to drive the photoacoustic cell into acoustic resonance. These requirements exclude the use of any thermal source necessitating the use of either a laser or LED.","Some described devices employ other features to improve sensitivity such as multiple-sensing microphones, resonant acoustic cavities, noise-suppression volumes, turntable light sources and multi-light-pass arrangements. As an example of one improvement, U.S. Pat. No. 4,163,382 discloses a method and apparatus that increases the sensitivity and flexibility of laser optocaustic spectroscopy, with reduced size. According to the method, it was longer as necessary to limit the use of laser optocaustic spectroscopy to species whose absorption must match available laser radiation. Instead, \u201cdoping\u201d with a relatively small amount of an optically absorbing gas yields optocaustic signatures of non-absorbent materials (gases, liquids, solids, and aerosols), thus significantly increasing the sensitivity and flexibility of opt caustic spectroscopy.","Another improvement to PAS, called wavelength modulated photoacoustic spectroscopy, or WM-PAS, eliminates a major noise source associated with traditional implementations of PAS. WM-PAS has been practiced in the prior art. An early description of the technique was provided by C. F. Dewey, , (Y-H Pao, ed., Academic Press, New York, 1977), pp. 62-64. Others have since practiced the technique including M. Feher, et al., 33, 1655 (1994); A. Miklos, et al., 58, 483 (1994); and B. E. R. Olsson, et al., 49, 1103 (1995). All use sinusoidal wavelength modulation waveforms. U.S. Pat. No. 6,552,792 improves on traditional sinusoidal modulation through the use of a modified square wave to provide increased signal compared to the sinusoidal and triangle waveforms.","Although sensitive, these devices have several shortcomings, including the large size of the cell and other apparatus. Accordingly, there exists the need for a trace chemical sensor, preferably with high-sensitivity, low-cost, low power consumption, and the capability to be mass-produced.","This invention improves upon the existing art by providing an integrated photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) cell fabricated using microelectromechanical (MEMS) techniques. The device is broadly based on a multi-layer structure including an inner layer disposed between top and bottom outer layers, with the inner layer being patterned to include a resonant cavity, and a microphone acoustically coupled to the resonant cavity.","In the preferred embodiment, the microphone is a piezoelectric thin film membrane formed on one of the outer layers. The resonant cavity is an open-tube resonant cavity to receive light from a source, and the inner layer is additionally patterned to include buffer cavities on either side of the resonant cavity. One or both of the top and bottom outer layers are patterned to include buffer cavities aligned with the buffer cavities in the inner layer on either side of the resonant cavity.","The preferred fabrication method involves joining an inner silicon substrate to a pair of outer silicon substrates, thereby encapsulating the resonant cavity, and depositing a piezoelectric thin film onto one of the outer substrates which is then patterned to create an acoustic sensor. The piezoelectric thin film may be any useful material, including lead zirconate titanate (PZT), aluminum nitride (AlN), or zinc oxide (ZnO). The resonant cavity and buffer cavities are formed using deep etch techniques subsequent to appropriate masking. The step of joining the inner substrate to the outer substrates preferably uses temperature and pressure to create a gold-silicon or gold-tin hermetic bond.","This invention resides in the fabrication, assembly, and use of a microelectromechanical (MEMS) resonant acoustic cavity and microphone for photoacoustic spectroscopy. The fabrication process involves a three-wafer process with the final structure utilizing wafer bonding for assembly.","Referring now to the Figures, an inventive resonant photoacoustic spectroscopy cell is shown generally at . The resonant cell  includes a fore buffer volume cavity , and an aft buffer volume cavity  that serve as buffer regions to suppress spurious acoustic inputs. The cell  also includes a central open tube resonant cavity .","The top wafer  of the resonant cell  encompasses portions of both the fore cavity  and the aft cavity  and the acoustical channel  from the resonant cavity . A thin film piezoelectric membrane, generally shown as , is deposited on the top wafer (see Step 4 in Top Wafer Process, paragraphs 0019-0031 supra). The portion of the thin film piezoelectric membrane  overlaying the acoustical channel  operates as an acoustic sensor or piezoelectric microphone and the terms are used synonymously herein. Electrical contacts  are connected to the top and bottom surfaces of the thin film piezoelectric membrane  and provide a means of transferring the piezoelectrically generated voltage from the top wafer to external digital signal processing equipment (not shown). The inner wafer  creates the central resonant cavity  and defines a portion of the fore cavity  and aft cavity . The bottom wafer  forms the remaining volumes of both buffer cavities  and  and gas input via port  and gas via output port  that are in fluid communication with central resonant cavity  as well as the buffer cavities  and . The resonant cavity  is formed to allow the interaction of a light source with the medium of interest with the cavity volume.","The processing of the various wafers to form an inventive cell follows according to a preferred embodiment. It is appreciated that the relative position of inventive cell element is variable and still affords an operative cell. Additionally, it is appreciated that optional further wafer layers are readily incorporated into an inventive cell. Further wafer laminates are appreciated to illustratively afford more complex resonant cavity shapes, introduce additional sensor elements, introduce additional gas via ports, introduce baffles or acoustic dampers, and the like.","Top Wafer Process","1.

An advantage of the present invention is the reduction in component volume. With a reduction in size in the present invention, the piezoelectric microphone is closer to the acoustic source than conventional devices. This proximity increases signal strength and overall sensitivity of the inventive cell. Additionally, the inventive photoacoustic cell is constructed solely on the MEMS scale including gas inlets\/outlets, sensing microphone(s), noise suppression volumes, and resonant cavity all located in a monolithic MEMS package. MEMS are manufactured in a large-scale batch-type fabrication, which inherently lower the cost of the final product. Additionally, the processing can be extremely accurate with tolerances generally more accurate than one micron. Piezoelectric sensing is extremely attractive for miniature components because it is a high-efficiency conversion of mechanical to electrical energy and a passive sensing technique, i.e. does not require an electrical power source. The technology incorporated in the inventive photoacoustic cell makes photoacoustic spectroscopy as a hand-held technique viable for numerous commercial and military chemical-sensing requirements.","The invention is applicable to all types of gas sensing and monitoring, including industrial waste gas monitoring, chemical detection on the battlefield, etc. Although the main use of photoacoustics is in trace gas sensing, the application can be used to detect absorption events in any phase gas, liquid or solid while avoiding effects from scattering phenomenon. This could make the technique viable for other ancillary markets. Additionally, there are several uses for the piezoelectric microphone itself that include passive acoustic detection for the military and physiological sensors for biological diagnostics.","Additionally, since this invention resides in a basic cell design, the application may take advantage of any additional or peripheral photoacoustic spectroscopy apparatus or methods, whether existing or yet-to-be-developed, including integrated versus discrete window technologies; optical tuning, chopping or modulation techniques; multi-light-pass arrangements; comparisons to reference cells; multiple sensing microphones, including thin-film approaches; and so forth."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
