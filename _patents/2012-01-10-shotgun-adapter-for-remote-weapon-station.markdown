title: Shotgun adapter for remote weapon station
abstract: An attachment is provided for operably connecting a shotgun to a weapons station. The shotgun includes a trigger and a butt stock. The weapons station can accommodate one of a Mk19 grenade launcher, an M2 .50 cal machine gun and an M240G machine gun. The attachment includes a trigger module, a pump grip adapter, and a gun frame. The module actuates the trigger and includes an actuator for pulling the trigger and an adapter for engaging the butt stock. The pump grip adapter includes slots for traveling pins on the weapons station to absorb recoil. The gun frame enables installation of the shotgun therein and mounts the trigger module and the adapter to the weapon station.

In particular, the invention relates to adaptation systems that enable a shotgun to be installed onto a remote weapons station.","A variety of small-arms-fire weapons can be installed onto a remote weapons station for infantry support. Such weapons include the Mk19 grenade launcher, M2 .50 cal machine gun, or M240G machine gun.","Conventional infantry weapon adapters yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, the embodied adapters provide for incorporation of a shotgun to a remote weapons station.","Various exemplary embodiments provide an adapter for operably connecting a shotgun to a weapons platform. The shotgun includes a body, a pump grip, a trigger and a butt stock. The weapons station can similarly accommodate one of a variety of weapons including the Mk19 grenade launcher, the M2 .50 cal machine gun, and the M240G machine gun. The adapter includes a trigger module, a pump grip adapter, a slide release mechanism, a charging linkage, and a gun frame. The module actuates the trigger and includes an actuator for pulling the trigger as well as an adapter for engaging the butt stock.","The pump grip adapter includes a boss and through-hole to interface with the charging linkage. The slide release mechanism allows the gun to be cycled out of sequence. The charging linkage allows the RWS to pump the gun by interfacing with the pump grip adapter and slide release mechanism. The gun frame enables installation of the shotgun therein and mounts the trigger module and the adapter to the station.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention.","Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments enable a Mossberg 500 or similar shotgun to be mounted in any remote weapon station (RWS) originally designed to hold a weapon, e.g., a Mk19 grenade launcher or an M2 .50 cal machine gun. The M1126 Stryker infantry carrier vehicle represents an exemplary RWS.","In addition to securing the weapon in position, various exemplary embodiments enable the shotgun to be fired remotely and cycled. The exemplary designs provide for quick installation and removal of the shotgun. Conventional designs lack any standard manner to mount a shotgun in a remote gun mount that were originally designed to contain the Mk19 or the M2 .50 cal.","The exemplary fixture can be reduced to five main parts: a Trigger Module or Assembly, a Pump Grip Adapter, a Slide Release Mechanism, a Charging Linkage and a Gun Frame.  show isometric assembly views of the Trigger Module .  shows an isometric exploded view of The Trigger Module  contained within a see-through housing box . This box houses a solenoid  integrated with a base , a helical spring , and a linkage  that facilitates the remote firing of the shotgun. The spring  coils around a transverse rod .","The linkage  connects to the solenoid . The Module  bolts onto the rear of the shotgun using a butt stock adapter  in place of the standard butt stock. The adapter  attaches to the base . A shoulder bolt  attaches an actuator bridge  to the box . A mezzanine rod  attaches the linkage  to the bridge . A trigger rod  extends across the bridge  to engage the shotgun's trigger.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","200","200","200","205","210","205","210","215","220"]},"The Adapter  includes mount plates  and  for providing structural support.
