Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the field of data entry and retrieval and, more particularly, to a method and system for use in annotating a variety of heterogeneous data object types.","2. Description of the Related Art","There are well known methods for capturing and storing explicit knowledge as data, for example, in relational databases, documents, flat files, and various proprietary formats in binary files. Often, such data is analyzed by various parties (e.g., experts, technicians, managers, etc.), resulting in rich interpretive information, commonly referred to as tacit knowledge. However, such tacit knowledge is often only temporarily captured, for example, as cryptic notes in a lab notebook, discussions\/conversations, presentations, instant messaging exchanges, e-mails and the like. Because this tacit knowledge is typically not captured in the application environment in which the related data is viewed and analyzed, it is often lost.","One approach to more permanently capture tacit knowledge is to create annotations containing descriptive information about data objects. Virtually any identifiable type of object may be annotated, such as a matrix of data (e.g., a spreadsheet or database table), a text document, or an image. Further, subportions of objects (sub-objects) may be annotated, such as a cell, row, or column in a database table or a section, paragraph, or word in a text document. An indexing scheme is typically used to map each annotation to the annotated data object or sub-object, based on identifying information, typically in the form of an index. The index should provide enough specificity to allow the indexing scheme to locate the annotated data object (or sub-object). Further, to be effective, the indexing scheme should work both ways: given an index, the indexing scheme must be able to locate the annotated data object and, given an object, the indexing scheme must be able to calculate the index for use in classification, comparison, and searching (e.g., to search for annotations for a given data object).","However, a number of challenges are presented when annotations must be made for objects from a variety of different type (i.e., heterogeneous) data sources manipulated by a variety of different application programs, which is a fairly common scenario in modern business enterprises. For example, in a biomedical enterprise, annotations may need to reference text documents (manipulated by a word processor\/text editor), experimental data (manipulated by a database or spreadsheet application), genomic data (manipulated by a specialized application), images (manipulated by an image viewing application), and the like.","One challenge is that different types of annotations (i.e., containing different types of information) may be made depending on the type of data object being annotated. Using the examples above, annotations made on portions of a text document may include comments on the text, annotations made on experimental or genomic data may contain information regarding how the data was gathered, validity, or significance of the data. One approach to accommodate the entry of such a diverse group of annotations is to create annotation structures that each contains a set of fields corresponding to the information to be contained in a corresponding annotation. When a user selects a certain type of data object to be annotated, the user may be presented with an interface for entering annotation information based on fields contained in an annotation structure corresponding to selected type of data object.","The type of information contained in annotations may also differ depending on a role of the user creating the annotation and\/or a role of the user expected to view the annotation. As an example, technicians, researchers, and managers may all be interested in different types of information (e.g., technicians with equipment used, researchers with the significance of the data gathered, and managers with the progress of a project). Further, certain information may only be available to users acting in a role having a given level of authority.","To accommodate different users, annotation structures may be created that correspond not only to a given type of data object, but also to a given user's role. However, given the many different types of data objects that may be annotated and that users may function in many different types of roles, there may be a large number of different combinations of data types and user roles. As a result, organizing and selecting a proper type of annotation structure for each different combination may present a challenge.","Accordingly, there is a need for methods and systems for organizing and selecting annotation structures corresponding to different combinations of data types and user roles.","The present invention generally is directed to methods, systems, and articles of manufacture for organizing and selecting annotation structures corresponding to different combinations of data types and user roles.","One embodiment provides a method for selecting an annotation structure for use in generating a form for entering annotation data. The method generally includes receiving a request from a user to create an annotation for at least one data object identified by a set of identifying parameters and retrieving, from a configuration file, information identifying at least one annotation structure associated with the at least one data object based, at least in part, on the set of identifying parameters, the annotation structure defining one or more annotation fields.","Another embodiment provides a method for annotating a set of disparate data points. The method generally includes receiving a request from a user to create an annotation for a specified set of data points, determining if the data points are of the same type, if the data points are not of the same type, retrieving, from a configuration file, at least one annotation structure associated with a set of data points of the same types as the specified set of data points, and generating, based on the annotation structure, an interface for entering annotation information to be associated with the specified set of data points.","Another embodiment provides a computer-readable medium containing an executable component for selecting an annotation structure for use in generating a form for entering annotation data. When executed by a processor, the executable component performs operations generally including receiving a request from a user to create an annotation for at least one data point identified by a set of identifying parameters and retrieving, from a configuration file, information identifying at least one annotation structure associated with the at least one data point based, at least in part, on the set of identifying parameters, wherein the annotation structure defines one or more annotation fields.","Another embodiment provides a system for creating annotations for data points contained in one or more different type data sources generally including a set of annotation structures, each specifying one or more annotation fields, at least one configuration file associating annotation structures with sets of one or more annotatable data points, and an annotation server. The annotation server is generally configured to receive a request from a user to create an annotation for at least one data point identified by a set of identifying parameters and retrieve, from the configuration file, information identifying at least one annotation structure associated with the at least one data point based on the set of identifying parameters and a role of the user.","Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, systems, and articles of manufacture that may be used to organize and select structures used to generate forms for capturing information as annotations for a variety of different type data objects. Some embodiments allow annotation structures to be associated with specific pairings of data object types and user roles via entries in a configuration file. When a user selects a set of one or more data objects for annotation, the configuration file may be accessed to determine a proper annotation structure for use in generating an annotation form based on the selected data objects and a role of the user. Embodiments of the present invention allow an annotation structure to be associated with data objects of the same type, data objects of different types, data objects from a common data source, or data objects from different data sources (i.e., disparate data objects).","As used herein, the term annotation generally refers to any type of descriptive information associated with one or more data objects. Annotations may exist in various forms, including textual annotations (descriptions, revisions, clarifications, comments, instructions, etc.), graphical annotations (pictures, symbols, etc.), sound clips, etc. While an annotation may exist in any or all of these forms, to facilitate understanding, embodiments of the present invention may be described below with reference to textual annotations as a particular, but not limiting, example of an annotation. Accordingly, it should be understood that the following techniques described with reference to textual annotations may also be applied to other types of annotations, as well, and, more generally, to any type of reference to a data object.","Further, as used herein, the term user may generally apply to any entity utilizing the annotation system described herein, such as a person (e.g., an individual) interacting with an application program or an application program itself, for example, performing automated tasks. While the following description may often refer to a graphical user interface (GUI) intended to present information to and receive information from a person, it should be understood that in many cases, the same functionality may be provided through a non-graphical user interface, such as a command line and, further, similar information may be exchanged with a non-person user via a programming interface.","One embodiment of the invention is implemented as a program product for use with a computer system such as, for example, the enterprise system  shown in  and described below. The program(s) of the program product defines functions of the embodiments (including the methods described herein) and can be contained on a variety of signal-bearing media. Illustrative signal-bearing media include, but are not limited to: (i) information permanently stored on non-writable storage media (e.g., read-only memory devices within a computer such as CD-ROM disks readable by a CD-ROM drive); (ii) alterable information stored on writable storage media (e.g., floppy disks within a diskette drive or hard-disk drive); or (iii) information conveyed to a computer by a communications medium, such as through a computer or telephone network, including wireless communications. The latter embodiment specifically includes information downloaded from the Internet and other networks. Such signal-bearing media, when carrying computer-readable instructions that direct the functions of the present invention, represent embodiments of the present invention.","In general, the routines executed to implement the embodiments of the invention, may be part of an operating system or a specific application, component, program, module, object, or sequence of instructions. The software of the present invention typically is comprised of a multitude of instructions that will be translated by the native computer into a machine-readable format and hence executable instructions. Also, programs are comprised of variables and data structures that either reside locally to the program or are found in memory or on storage devices. In addition, various programs described hereinafter may be identified based upon the application for which they are implemented in a specific embodiment of the invention. However, it should be appreciated that any particular nomenclature that follows is used merely for convenience, and thus the invention should not be limited to use solely in any specific application identified and\/or implied by such nomenclature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","111","132","100","111","132"]},"As previously described, the target data may be of any suitable type, such as textual or tabular (structured, usually non-textual), graphical, or any other type maintained in any type data source, such as a text document, flow diagram, schematic (e.g., electrical or mechanical) or any multimedia file (e.g, an audio file, image file, or video clip). During the capture process, the user entering the annotation content will typically be interacting with software that could be either embedded within their particular scientific applications (e.g., as a plug-in component) or, alternatively, with a separate annotation application that is external to their scientific applications, for example, a stand-alone browser. The annotations  may be stored in a central annotation repository (e.g., an annotation store ), which may be searched independently or in conjunction with the annotated data, thus allowing users to harvest knowledge captured by other users about the data of interest.","For example, the annotations  may capture insights of different users, such as a manager, chemist, and biologist, working an a biomedical enterprise. The annotations  may include annotations that describe various type data objects contained in various data sources, such as documents (e.g., project status reports) generated by the manager with a first application (e.g., a word processor), chemical data manipulated (e.g., created\/viewed\/edited) by the chemist with a second application (e.g., a database application), and biological data (e.g., genomic data) generated by a biologist with an Napplication (e.g., a database application or specialized genomic data application).","Storing the annotations  in the annotation store  may allow tacit knowledge to be captured about the data without modifying the data sources containing the data. It should be understood, however, that the annotation store  may actually reside on the same system as the annotated data sources. In either case, the various application data  are enhanced with the opinions and evaluations of experts (e.g., chemists, biologists, and managers), and this supplementary knowledge is made available to others via the annotation system .","Referring now to , a client-server view of one embodiment of the enterprise system  is shown. As illustrated, the system  generally includes one or more client computers  (e.g., user workstations) generally configured to access annotations  in an annotation store , via the annotation server  (e.g., a software component) running on at least one server computer . The client computers  and server computer may be connected via a network . In general, the network  may be any combination of a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), wireless network, or any other suitable type network, including the Internet.","As illustrated, the client computers  generally include a Central Processing Unit (CPU)  connected via a bus  to a memory , storage , input devices , output devices , and a network interface device . The input devices  may be any devices to give input to the client computer , such as a mouse, keyboard, keypad, light-pen, touch-screen, track-ball, or speech recognition unit, audio\/video player, and the like. The output devices  may be any suitable devices to give output to the user, including speakers and any of various types of display screen. Although shown separately from the input device , the output device  and input device  could be combined (e.g., a display screen with an integrated touch-screen.","The network interface device  may be any entry\/exit device configured to allow network communications between the client computer  and the server computer  via the network . For example, the network interface device  may be a network adapter or other network interface card (NIC). Storage  is preferably a Direct Access Storage Device (DASD). Although shown as a single unit, storage  may be any combination of fixed and\/or removable storage devices, such as fixed disc drives, floppy disc drives, tape drives, removable memory cards, or optical storage. The memory  and storage  could be part of one virtual address space spanning multiple primary and secondary storage devices.","The memory  is preferably a random access memory (RAM) sufficiently large to hold the necessary programming and data structures of the invention. While the memory  is shown as a single entity, it should be understood that the memory  may in fact comprise a plurality of modules, and that the memory  may exist at multiple levels, from high speed registers and caches to lower speed but larger DRAM chips. Illustratively, the memory  contains an operating system . Examples of suitable operating systems, which may be used to advantage, include Linux and Microsoft's Windows\u00ae, as well as any operating systems designed for handheld devices, such as Palm OS\u00ae, Windows\u00ae CE, and the like. More generally, any operating system supporting the functions disclosed herein may be used.","The memory  is also shown containing at least one application  (optionally shown with an associated annotation plug-in  and an annotation broker ). The application  may be any of a variety of applications used to manipulate (e.g., create, view, and\/or edit) data that may be annotated. For example, the application  may be a text editor\/word processor used to manipulate annotatable documents, a database application or spreadsheet used to manipulate data, a document generator\/viewer (such as Adobe's Acrobat\u00ae and Acrobat Reader) used to manipulate documents, or data analysis software, such as Decision Site available from Spotfire, Inc., imaging software used to manipulate images, and any other types of applications used to manipulate various types and forms of data.","Some application programs  may be configured to communicate with the annotation server  directly, for example, via a set of application programming interface (API) functions (not shown) provided for the annotation server . As used herein, the term API generally refers to any set of interface functions (e.g., implementing any suitable inter-process protocol) that may be used to communicate between a client computer or process and a server computer or process. Other application programs, however, may communicate with the annotation server  via plug-in components  and\/or the annotation broker  (e.g. also via API functions). In other words, annotation capability may be added to an existing application  via the plug-in components . The plug-in components  may, for example, present graphical user interface (GUI) screens to users of applications , thus allowing the creation and retrieval of annotations from within the applications used to manipulate the annotated data.","The annotation broker  is an optional component and may be implemented as a software component configured to present a standard interface to the Annotation Server  from various applications , for example, communicating with plug-in components  from multiple applications running on the same client computer . Hence, the annotation broker  may provide a degree of separation between the applications  and the annotation server , hiding detailed operation of the annotation server  and facilitating development of plug-in components . In other words, new applications  may be supported through the development of plug-in components  written in accordance with the annotation broker interface.","Components of the server computer  may be physically arranged in a manner similar to those of the client computer . For example, the server computer  is shown generally comprising a CPU , a memory , and a storage device , coupled to one another by a bus , which may all functions as similar components described with reference to the client computer . The server computer  is generally under the control of an operating system  (e.g., IBM OS\/400\u00ae, UNIX, Microsoft Windows\u00ae, and the like) shown residing in memory .","As illustrated, the server computer  may be configured with the annotation server , also shown residing in memory . The annotation server  provides annotation clients (e.g., running on one or more client computers ) with access to the annotation store , for example, via annotation API functions. In other words, the annotation API functions generally define the interface between annotation clients and the annotation server . As used herein, the term annotation client generally refers to any user interface (or other type front-end logic) of the annotation system that communicates with the annotation server to manipulate (e.g., create, update, read and query) annotation data. Examples of annotation clients include applications  communicating with the annotation server  (directly, or via plug-in components ) and an annotation browser .","As will be described in greater detail below, the annotation server  may be configured to perform a variety of operations, such as responding to requests to create annotations for specified data objects, formulating and issuing queries against the annotation store  to search for annotations for a specified data object, and formulating and issuing queries against the annotation store  to search for annotations satisfying one or more specified conditions (e.g., having a specified author, creation date, content, and the like).","For some embodiments, a distributed annotation system for an enterprise may comprise a plurality of distributed annotation servers , for example, each running on a different server computer . Each distributed annotation server  may support a different set of users (e.g., different departments, or even different geographic locations, within a common enterprise or separate enterprises, etc.), and may maintain a separate annotation store . However, each distributed annotation server  may be configured to access annotation content from annotation stores  maintained by other annotation servers  (e.g., directly, or through communication with the corresponding maintaining annotation servers ), thus allowing annotations to be created and shared by a wide range of users throughout a distributed enterprise.","For some embodiments, the annotation server , and various related components, may be configured via a set of administrative tools . For example, the tools  may be used to generate configuration data  accessed by the annotation server . As illustrated, the configuration data  may include various configuration files , a data source definition file  which may contain various information, such as identification of a set of annotation structures (or templates)  for use in displaying and collecting annotation information, the various annotatable data source types and indexing thereof, the roles in which users may operate, and other defining information which may affect operation of the annotation server . As will be described in greater detail below, the annotation structures  may contain a set of fields and groups of fields that determine what data is stored with the annotation and what data is presented to a user viewing the annotation, for example, based on the user's role.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["140","120","102","140","120","122","128","120","120","120"],"sub":["1","2","N"]},"As illustrated, the annotation server  may issue queries against the annotation store  via a query interface . For some embodiments, the annotation server  may issue abstract queries against the annotation store  and the query interface  may be an abstract query interface configured to map logical fields of the abstract query to corresponding physical fields of the annotation store . The concepts of data abstraction and abstract queries are described in detail in the commonly owned, co-pending application Ser. No. 10\/083,075, entitled \u201cImproved Application Portability And Extensibility Through Database Schema And Query Abstraction,\u201d filed Feb. 26, 2002, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","As illustrated, the annotation broker  may serve as an interface between annotation plug-ins  for multiple applications and the annotation server . For example, the annotation broker  may manage messages sent to and from multiple annotation plug-ins and the annotation server (e.g., providing mediation between multiple plug-in components  trying to access the annotation server  simultaneously). For some embodiments, the annotation broker  may be implemented as a Windows Component Object Model (COM) server that provides a standard interface and facilitates access to the annotation server  for annotation plug-ins  for Windows applications (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Acrobat, Spotfire, and other Windows applications). In other words, by providing a standard interface to the annotation server , the annotation broker  may facilitate extension of the annotation system to support new applications  through the development of plug-in components written in accordance with its interface.","As illustrated, an annotation browser  may allow the creation and viewing application data and annotations, independently of any of the applications . For some embodiments, the annotation browser  may provide a generalized web-based user interface for viewing structured data content (e.g. application source data that can be accessed directly through queries via the query interface ), and for creating and viewing annotations on it. As will be described in greater detail below, for some embodiments, the annotation browser may provide an interface allowing a user to simultaneous query data sources  and associated annotations.","For some embodiments, in order to identify annotated data object(s), an index, or set of indexes, that may be used to identify the corresponding annotated data object(s) may be stored with the annotation data. As illustrated, an index obtained from an annotation record may be used to retrieve information from one or more index tables  that may be used to identify the annotated data object or sub-objects, commonly referred to as annotated points .","As used herein, the term point may generally refer to any identifiable data unit (or group of data units) capable of being annotated. Examples of annotatable points include, but are not limited to, database tables, rows, columns, cells, or groups of cells, selected portions of a text document (e.g., defined by an offset and length, start and stop locations, or any other suitable defining information), and the like. Multiple points in an object may be referenced by the same annotation and any point in an object may be referenced by multiple annotations. Further, as indicated by the dashed arrow from the index table  in , an annotation may reference points in more than one annotatable data source . For some embodiments, additional points may be associated with an annotation, for example, via the annotation API , in effect propagating the annotation to the additional points.","In some cases, annotations may also be created and managed that are not associated with any particular point. For example, such annotations may facilitate the capture of insights that are more general in nature than annotation made for specific annotatable points. However, the method and systems described herein may still be utilized to advantage to create, organize, and search such annotations. For example, as described herein with reference to \u201cpoint-specific\u201d annotations, such annotations may also be created and viewed using one or more annotation structures.","Upon retrieving an annotation record  from the annotation store, using the index stored therein, the object described by the annotation can be found from the information within the annotation record, and, conversely annotations for a given object can be looked up in the annotation store, based on an index generated from it's identifying information. Thus, the indexes provide the ability to find corresponding data from annotations and to find annotations associated with data. Because different type data objects have different identifying parameters (e.g., database entities may be identified by table, column and\/or row values, while portions of text documents may be identified by an offset and length or start and stop values within the document, etc.) different indexing methods may be used depending on the type of the annotated data object.","Data sources are typically arranged as \u201cgranular\u201d hierarchical structures of different \u201clevels\u201d of data objects, each of which may be annotated for different reasons. For example, a database table may be annotated to explain why it was created (its purpose), a database column may be annotated to clarify what type of data is stored therein, a database row may be annotated to comment on a particular set of data (e.g., all related to a common patient), while a database cell may be annotated to comment on the significance of a particular value stored therein (e.g., an alarmingly high test result). In general, higher level data objects may be identified by indexes with fewer column values than indexes for lower level data objects (which may be regarded as sub-objects of the higher level data objects). Examples of suitable techniques for indexing a variety of different type data objects are described in detail in a commonly owned co-pending application Ser. No. 10\/600,382 now pending, entitled \u201cHeterogeneous Multi-Level Extendable Indexing For General Purpose Annotation Systems,\u201d filed Jun. 20, 2003, hereby incorporated by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["400","144","144","144","148"]},"Prior to performing the operations , however, the administrator may need to gather a variety of information used to determine how the annotation system should be configured (e.g., what data should be allowed to be annotated and what type of information should be captured as annotations). This data gathering may be considered a precursor to actually configuring the annotation system, for example, with the goal of limiting the annotation system to supporting annotations on data for which the annotations are likely to be beneficial. In case the administrator is not too familiar with the system in which the annotation system is to be deployed, a domain expert, as well as another type consultant (e.g., a service provider in the business of installing annotation systems), may be consulted to ensure proper considerations are taken prior to configuring the annotation system.","The operations  may be described with reference to  that illustrate exemplary GUI screens that may be presented to the user as part of the administrative tools . Of course, it should be understood that the details of the GUI screens are for illustrative purposes only and that the operations  represent just some of the types of operations that may be performed to configure the annotation system, and that a user may be able to perform various other configuration processes via the administrative tools  or through any other configuration interface.","The operations  begin at step , for example, upon invoking the administrative tools  and, at step , an interface is provided for defining annotation structures and other related information. The GUI screen of  illustrates one example of the type of interface that may be provided to the user. As illustrated, the GUI screen may include a configuration navigation panel  allowing the user to navigate through various configuration data structures (which may be implemented, in XML, as configuration files ) organized in separate folders (e.g., Data Sources, Roles, Users, etc.). In response to selecting a given folder, the user may be presented with a GUI panel (shown opposite the navigation panel ) corresponding to the selected folder.","A user may perform a loop of operations -, for example, using the various GUI panels, to define annotation structures that may contain annotation fields selected to capture annotation information associated with a particular combination of data scope and defined user role.","At step , various roles (e.g., biologist, chemist, manager, etc.) are defined. For example, in response to selecting the Roles folder in the navigation panel , the user may be presented with a GUI panel  shown in  allowing a user to add new roles. The user may associate users with roles via a GUI panel  shown in , which may be accessed by selecting a particular role in the navigation panel . As an alternative, roles may be associated with users via another similar GUI panel accessed by selecting a particular user in the navigation panel .","At step , point types (e.g., annotatable data objects and sub-objects of data sources) are defined.  illustrates exemplary operations  that may be performed to define annotatable data points. The operations  begin, at step  and, at step , available annotatable data sources are listed (e.g., database tables, spreadsheets, PDF documents, text documents, image files, or any type of identifiable data source). At step , a loop of operations (-) is entered to be performed for each of the listed data sources.","At step , data source subtypes are listed. Data source subtypes may be identified as cases where the content of a particular type of data source needs different type of metadata (captured in annotations) than other types. For example, for a database table, subtypes may include specific types of tables (e.g., a clinical data table, a personnel shift scheduling table, patient records, etc.), while for a text document, subtypes may include different types of documents (e.g., quality control documents, a resume, a patent application, etc.). As will be described in greater detail below, different annotation forms for use in creating annotations having different annotation fields may be presented to users, based on the data source subtype and selected point (and possibly a user role, as well).","At step , annotatable points for each type and subtype are listed. For example, as previously described, annotations for a database table may be made on a row, a column, a cell, or the entire table, while annotations for a text document may be made on the document or any section thereof (e.g., a group of words defined by a start character and stop character or offset and length).","At step , other data source qualifiers that further define an annotatable point (e.g., as an annotatable subpoint) are listed. Examples of other data source qualifiers for a particular scope, include the name of an annotatable entity, such as a particular column name. In other words, such a source qualifier may allow annotations of one column to be different than the annotations of another column. As another example of a data source qualifier, the content of an selected annotatable data object may be qualified, for example, to include a specified search string, one or more keywords, a particular value, set, or range of values, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":"460"},"For some embodiments, the annotatable points associated with any given data source may be defined via entries in the data source definition file  or some other configuration file.

An example of restricted values may be a set of column names for which annotations may be made, essentially limiting an annotatable point to those (e.g., columns or cells) identified by one of the listed column names. Such restricted values may be used explicitly (e.g., listing all allowable values) or implicitly (e.g., listing only prohibited values). Restricted values may also indicate one or more acceptable (or prohibited) values stored in an annotatable point (e.g., a text string or other type data value). As an example, for security or privacy reasons, cells containing certain values (e.g., a patient's name) may not be annotated.","Referring back to , at step , annotation structures  are defined, for example, by specifying available annotation fields to be included in the annotation structure. As previously described, the fields included in the annotation structure generally represent the metadata to be captured in the annotation. While not necessary, an annotation structure will typically include at least one field for entering comments. As illustrated in , annotation structures may be defined via a structures panel  by adding annotation field groups , as well as additional, separate, annotation fields . The structures panel  may be selected, for example, via a navigation panel  allowing other configuration panels to be selected (e.g., for defining roles, annotatable points, and the like).","At step , structures are associated with annotatable point-role sets. As will be described in greater detail below, for some embodiments, annotation structures may be associated with point-role sets via entries in the data source definition . As illustrated in , a scopes GUI panel  may allow users to associate a set of annotatable data points  (associated with a scope name ) and one or more listed roles  with one or more listed annotation structures .","To illustrate the affect of this association, when a user acting in a specified role attempts to create an annotation on a specified data point, the user may be presented with an annotation form allowing a user to enter annotation information corresponding to the annotation fields contained in the associated annotation structure. For example, while engaged in the process of conducting melanoma research, a biologist (e.g., a user acting in the role of a biologist) creating an annotation for a cell or column of a database Table X may be presented with a form for entering data for annotation fields included in the annotation structure  mel_rel_biologist. If more than one annotation structure were associated with the selected data scope and role of biologist, the user may have been presented with a list of annotation structures that best fit what the user was trying to annotate. The user may then be prompted to select one of the annotation structures from the list for use in creating the annotation.","If more annotation structures are to be defined, as determined at step , the operations - may be repeated, otherwise, the operations  are exited at step . It should be noted that more than one annotation structure may be associated with a particular role-point combination. Further, a particular annotation structure may be associated with more than one particular role-point combination. Further, various data structures may be employed to associated annotation structures with annotatable point-role sets. For example, the data source definition file  may be populated with entries that indicate (e.g., via a structure ID) a particular annotation structure  that should be used when a user operating in a certain role attempts to create an annotation for a specified data object (point).","As previously described, annotations may be created for a single point or a set of multiple points which may be the same or disparate (e.g., different types and\/or from different data sources). If a set of selected points are all of the same type, one or more annotation structures associated with that type may be used to create annotations for the selected points. For some embodiments, the association of annotation structures to an annotatable point-role pair for may be performed via entries in the data source definition file  or some other configuration file (e.g., as with the annotatable point definitions described above).","Such an entry for a single point type is referred to herein as a \u201cpoint map,\u201d while such an entry for a set of disparate points is referred to herein as a \u201cdisparate point set map.\u201d TABLE II below illustrates an exemplary portion (illustratively in XML format) of a point map for a cell of a relational data source (e.g., a relational database table).
