Detection sensitivity of a QCM is related to the resonance frequency and the thickness of the quartz membrane. A resonance frequency of about 5 MHz, corresponding to a quartz membrane thickness of 330 \u03bcm, enables a minimum detectable mass density of about 10g\/cm. Sensitivity is therefore generally limited to a range of about 10g\/Hz.","To increase sensitivity, some biosensors utilize silicon-based microcantilevers, which offer a sensitivity of approximately 10g\/Hz, about three orders of magnitude higher than QCMs. Advantageously, silicon microcantilevers are also widely available and may be easily integrated with existing silicon fabrication methodologies. Most silicon microcantilevers, however, rely on complex external optical components for deflection detection, an external driving mechanism for actuation and also require laser alignment. Moreover, because they are not piezoelectric, silicon microcantilevers are inferior for in-solution sensing, yielding low resonance peaks upon immersion in a solution.","Piezoelectric cantilevers, in comparison, use electrical means for detection and are not encumbered by the complexity and mass of the silicon-based sensors.","Constructed from lead zirconate titanate (PZT), they are capable of electrical self-excitation and self-sensing for in-situ electrical detection. Currently, piezoelectric biosensors are millimeter-size cantilevers made by bonding commercial PZT to non-piezoelectric substrates such as stainless steel, titanium or glass. Although capable of in-situ biosensing, these millimeter-size cantilevers lack the desired sensitivity for such applications.","Thin-film-based PZT microcantilevers, such as those disclosed in JP-07027559 A2 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,084,554, are highly sensitive instruments. U.S. Pat. No. 7,084,554, in particular, discloses a thin piezoelectric film biomorph capable of being formed as a cantilever. The biomorph may be composed of a piezoelectric thin PZT film of about 1-10 \u03bcm in thickness for the purpose of increasing the working frequency range of micro-electro-mechanical dimensioned (MEMS) systems. The patent further teaches that the piezoelectric thin film may be fabricated by thin film fabrication methods such as a sol-gel method, sputtering, hydrothermal methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or another thin film fabrication method, followed by low temperature annealing and dry etching, plasma etching or patterning by wet chemical etching (See col. 5, lines 55-64 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,084,554). These piezoelectric microcantilevers, however, are incapable of in-situ electrical detection due to degradation of resonance peaks in solution.","Recent advances in thin-film PZT microcantilevers incorporate an electrical insulation layer that prevents liquid damping. U.S. Patent Publication no. 2005\/0112621 discloses an insulation layer surrounding a PZT microcantilever having a thin piezoelectric film in order to prevent conduction in liquid media (See e.g. col. 4, lines 28-36).","However, there remains a need for a piezoelectric microcantilever device capable of in-solution biologic detection having a femtogram or higher sensitivity. In addition, there remains a need for a device consisting of array piezoelectric microcantilevers that is capable of simultaneous detection of multiple compounds.","Advancement in the sensitivity, accuracy and efficiency of electrical biosensing is essential to the developing field of bioterrorism defense. During the fall of 2001, for example, spores, a bioterrorism agent, were responsible for the deaths of 5 individuals and infection of 17 others. As bioterrorism threats become more prevalent, there is a growing need for reliable in-situ detectors capable of efficiently detecting multiple biological agents in real time.","Advancements in biosensing accuracy, sensitivity, multi compound detection are also potentially useful in the health sciences for early detection and prevention of diseases. Breast cancer, for example, is the second leading cause of death for women. Although a number of potential breast cancer markers, such as HER2 (HER2\/neu, c-erbB-2), EGFR, CA-15-3, CA27.29, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), and cytokeratins, are known, no blood test or method for detecting these markers currently exists. Mammography is frequently inadequate and often produces false positives leading to unnecessary biopsies. Therefore early detection methods for various cancers and other diseases lacking adequate diagnostic means, like breast cancer, that are capable of accurately, effectively and non-invasively identifying and quantifying pathogens and other disease markers are also needed.","In a first aspect, the present invention is directed to piezoelectric microcantilever sensors useful for detecting organic compounds. The piezoelectric microcantilever includes a piezoelectric layer, a non-piezoelectric layer and a receptor. The microcantilever may be constructed from piezoelectric lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (Pb(MgNb)O)\u2014(PbTiO)(PMN-PT) (PMN-PT) which typically has a thickness not greater than 70 \u03bcm with a dielectric constant of at least 1600.","In a second embodiment, the piezoelectric layer of the microcantilever is constructed from lead zirconate titanate (PZT), which typically has a thickness not greater than 4 \u03bcm with a dielectric constant of at least 1600.","In another aspect, the present invention is directed to methods for bioterrorism defense, food safety and pathogen detection.","Piezoelectric microcantilever sensors (PEMS) are mass sensors that use an electrical means for detection. Receptors are coated on the surface of PEMS to bind molecules of interest. The PEMS detects a change in mass because newly bound target molecules shift the mechanical resonance frequency of the device. By monitoring the resonance frequency shifts, a PEMS is capable of rapid, label-free, in situ quantitative detection of organic compounds or molecules including pathogens, antigens and proteins in a small volume solution (e.g. 100 \u03bcl) or in a cell culture using simple all-electrical measurements. PEMS are capable of electric actuation and detection and may also be constructed as an array for simultaneous monitoring of multiple target compounds or molecules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","9"]},"Conductive elements ,  may be any element capable of conducting an electrical signal from the piezoelectric layer to a device for detecting that signal. In a preferred embodiment, conductive elements  and  are electrodes which may be constructed from any conductive material. Preferably, the first electrode  is constructed from Au\/Cr or Pt\/Ti and subsequently patterned in several regions. The second electrode  is preferably constructed from Pt\/TiOon SiOfor PZT\/SiOPEMS or Pt\/Ti on a metal substrate or non-piezoelectric layer and subsequently patterned as well.","In order to maintain functionality in solution by preventing conduction, it may be useful to electrically separate or buffer conductive element  and second conductive element . Conductive element  is patterned slightly smaller than the piezoelectric layer  to ensure complete insulation of the edges and corners thereof. Any electrically insulating layer  may be used as a coating to achieve electrical separation or buffering.","In one embodiment, insulating layer  may comprise a 1.5 \u03bcm thick parylene (poly-para-xylylene) coating deposited on an electrode by chemical vapor deposition. When placed in static and 1 ml\/min flow rate of PBS solution, a parylene insulating layer  essentially prevents background resonance frequency shifts greater than 30 Hz and 60 Hz, respectively, over a period of 30 minutes. As a result, insulating layer  enables complete submersion of the microcantilever for in situ or in-solution detection while maintaining a Q value (quality value) greater than 35. For the purposes of this patent application, Q value is defined as the ratio of the resonance frequency to the resonance peak width at half the peak height.","Alternatively, a PEMS may be insulated using self-assembled monolayers with hydrophobic properties, preferably methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) or a combination of MTMS with parylene coatings of varying thicknesses, may also be used. When immersed in a PBS solution, an MTMS insulated piezoelectric microcantilever yields strong resonance peak intensities and prevents background resonance frequency shifts greater than 30 Hz over a period of 30 minutes.","Other insulation materials may include 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane, AlO, SiOand any functional hydrophobic silane, having a hydrophobic group selected from the group consisting of alkyl, phenyl, alkyl halide, alkene, alkyne, and sulfhydryl. In a preferred embodiment, the insulation material is mercaptopropylsilane (MPTS), which can also function to immobilize a receptor on the cantilever. The insulating materials may also include any combination of any of MTMS, MPTS, parylene, 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane, AlO, SiO, any functional hydrophobic silane having a hydrophobic group selected from the group consisting of alkyl, phenyl, alkyl halide, alkene, alkyne, and sulfhydryl, or a combination thereof.","Receptors  may be densely packed and immobilized onto, for example, a bi-functional linker modified sensor surface. Any receptor, such as specially synthesized cavitants, DNA oligonucleotides, proteins, single chain variable fragments (scFvs), enzymes, and antibodies to cells, antigens, pathogens, viruses, parasites, or combinations thereof may be bound to the sensor surface. For example, when trying to detect tumors, monomeric and dimeric anti-tumor scFv molecules, which are composed of variable light and heavy chains of antibody molecule anti-ECD scFV, that react to cancer markers may be bound to the electrodes. Similarly, when trying to detect (\u201cBA\u201d), antibodies specific to BA spore surface antigens may be immobilized on the electrodes.","Any means of adhering receptors  to the sensor surface may be utilized. In a preferred embodiment, receptors  are bound to the electrodes using an immobilization coating , such as self assembled monolayers (\u201cSAM\u201d), MPTS and bi-functional linkers. In one embodiment, for purposes of binding scFv, the immobilization coating may be a self assembled monolayer of 3-mercaptoproprionic acid (MPA) on a copper and gold-coated electrode activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropy)carbodimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 5 mg\/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS).","The PEMS also includes at least one non-piezoelectric layer , which may be fabricated from any compatible material, including a ceramic material, a polymeric material, a metallic material or combinations thereof. Preferably the non-piezoelectric layer  is fabricated from silicon dioxide (SiO) and silicon nitride (SiN) for PZT-thin film based PEMS. For example, a silicon nitride coating on single crystal silicon wafer may be prepared by low press chemical vapor deposition. A low stress silicon dioxide layer may subsequently be deposited on the silicon nitride layer by growing silicon dioxide films using low temperature oxide deposition or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. For PMN-PT-based PEMS, the non-piezoelectric layer can be any ceramic, metallic, or polymeric layer. A metallic layer such as Cu, tin, Ni, Ti, etc., or any combination is preferred because it can be provided by simple electroplating.","Non-piezoelectric layer  may be bonded to a shorter piezoelectric layer  so that the portion of non-piezoelectric layer  extending beyond the end of piezoelectric layer  forms a non-piezoelectric tip. Both piezoelectric layer  and non-piezoelectric layer  may be attached to a clamp. In an alternative embodiment, piezoelectric layer  may extend beyond non-piezoelectric layer , forming a piezoelectric tip. Optionally, the PEMS may be constructed so that neither piezoelectric layer  nor the non-piezoelectric layer  extends beyond the other. In order to achieve the best results, one of the piezoelectric  and non-piezoelectric layers  preferably extends beyond the other to form a tip. A PEMS may also include multiple piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric layers. For example, a non-piezoelectric layer may be placed between two piezoelectric layers or a piezoelectric layer may be placed between two non-piezoelectric layers.","A significant aspect of the microcantilever device is the fabrication of a highly piezoelectric layer , which enables electrical detection and actuation within the cantilever. The piezoelectric layer may function as a driving element, vibrating element and sensing element. Applying an AC voltage (input) across the piezoelectric layer bends and vibrates the PEMS, which in turn induces a piezoelectric voltage that produces readily detectable changes in the magnitude and phase of the output voltage. The resonance frequency of the PEMS is obtained by monitoring the maximum of the phase shift of the output voltage. This measurement is accomplished all-electrically, i.e., electrical actuation and electrical sensing.","Piezoelectric layer  may be constructed from any piezoelectric material, including a lead-free piezoelectric material such as (NaK)LiNbSbO(hereinafter \u201cSb-NKNLN\u201d), Sb-(NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(hereinafter \u201cSb-NKNLT\u201d), Sr\u2014(NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(Sr-NKNLN), Sr\u2014NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(Sr-NKNLT), SbSr\u2014(NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(SrSb-NKNLN), SrSb\u2014NaK)NbO\u2014LiTaO(SbSr-NKNLT), solid solutions with (BiK)TiO, (BiNa)TiO, Ba(ZrTi)O, BaTiO(hereinafter \u201cBT\u201d), (BiK)TiO(hereinafter \u201cBKT\u201d), (BiNa)TiO(hereinafter \u201cBNT\u201d), Ba(ZrTi)O(hereinafter \u201cBZT\u201d), Bi(ZnTi)O(hereinafter \u201cBiZT), (NaK)NbO(hereinafter \u201cNKN\u201d), BiScO\u2014PbTiOBaTiO\u2014(BiK)TiO(hereinafter \u201cBKBT\u201d), (BiNa)TiO\u2014(BiNa)TiO(hereinafter \u201cBNKT\u201d), (BiNa)TiO\u2014BaTiO(hereinafter \u201cBNBT\u201d), (BiNa)TiO\u2014Ba(ZrTi)O(hereinafter \u201cBNBZT\u201d) and (BiNa)TiO\u2014BaTiO\u2014(BiK)TiO(hereinafter \u201cBNBK\u201d).","In a preferred embodiment, the piezoelectric layer is fabricated from highly piezoelectric lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate films, e.g. (Pb(MgNb)O)\u2014(PbTiO)(PMN-PT) (PMN-PT), highly piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films or high piezoelectric lead-free films. Additionally, piezoelectric layer  may be fabricated in any form, preferably having free standing film geometry to enhance domain wall motion and piezoelectric performance.","A piezoelectric PMN-PT layer may be fabricated using a precursor-suspension method. Submicron crystalline PMN powder is first prepared by dispersing Mg(OH)-coated NbOparticles in a lead acetate\/ethylene glycol solution followed by calcination at about 800\u00b0 C. The crystalline PMN powder was subsequently suspended in a lead titanate (PT) precursor solution containing lead acetate and titanium isopropoxide in ethylene glycol to form a PMN-PT precursor powder, which can be sintered at a temperature as low as about 900\u00b0 C.","The resulting suspensions have previously been used to formulate PMN-PT freestanding films of about 8-75 \u03bcm thick upon sintering at 1000\u00b0 C. Preferably, the thickness is about 1-127 \u03bcm, more preferably less than about 50 \u03bcm, and most preferably less than about 8 \u03bcm. The precursor-suspension method may also be used to produce freestanding PMN-PT films having a thickness of less than 8 \u03bcm or larger than 75 \u03bcm. Typically, the freestanding PMN-PT films have femtogram sensitivity of at least 2\u00d710g\/Hz, dielectric constants greater than 1000, saturated polarization of about 30 \u03bcC\/cm, remnant polarization of 25 \u03bcC\/cmand a Q value as high as 300 and as low as 20. Therefore PMN-PT microcantilevers are capable of generating higher-mode resonance peaks resulting in enhanced sensitivity detection.","Further, PMN-PT freestanding films with thicknesses of 8 \u03bcm or 22 \u03bcam were found to exhibit an extremely high electric-field enhanced piezoelectric \u2212dcoefficient of 2000 pm\/V at E=10 kV\/cm, as shown in ), which is about 7 times that of the bulk PMN-PT and commercial PZT, and which also exceeds the piezoelectric coefficient of specially-cut single crystalline PMN-PT.

(PZT)\/SiOPEMS may be configured to form microcantilevers less than 20 \u03bcm long having attogram sensitivity of 10g\/Hz, a piezoelectric layer thickness of about 1.0-\u03bcm-8 \u03bcm, more preferably, less than about 4 \u03bcm, about 1.5-\u03bcm-2 \u03bcm or less than about 2 \u03bcm and a dielectric constant of at least 1600, more preferably, at least 1900. The PZT PEMS is capable of exhibiting up to four resonance peaks with quality values, Q, ranging from a minimum of about 20 to between 120 and 320. (PZT)\/SiOPEMS may also be configured to have a thickness of less than 2 \u03bcm and a length of less than 30 \u03bcm.

Because the cantilevers thus fabricated have clean interfaces between the PZT\/SiOlayer and the electrodes, the cantilevers exhibit high Q values. The resultant clean geometry of the microcantilever increases sensitivity and facilitates the manufacturing process.","The self-actuating and self-detecting PEMS of the present invention overcomes a significant problem of the prior art, miniaturizing microcantilevers without losing high resonance-peaks. In the present invention, the novel PMN and PZT micro-fabrication methods produce thin piezoelectric PEMS having enhanced sensitivity, as evidenced by the large dielectric constants, piezoelectric coefficients and Q values.","Q values are an excellent indicator of cantilever sensitivity. Although it is expected that the Q value of silicon micro cantilevers decreases with cantilever size,  shows that the Q value of a commercial-PZT-based piezoelectric microcantilever remains approximately the same even though the microcantilever length varies over two orders of magnitude due to the polycrystalline composition of the piezoelectric layer . The piezoelectric layer  of the present invention therefore utilizes polycrystalline compositions such as PMN-PT and PZT in order to miniaturize PEMS without losing sensitivity. For example, by reducing PZT PEMS to a length-scale of 300 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm, PMN-PT and PZT PEMS are capable of attaining detection sensitivity greater than 10and 10g\/Hz, respectively. Freestanding PMN-PT PEMS 500-700 \u03bcm in length are capable of achieving Q values higher than 300. Additionally, PEMS with a thickness of less than 5 \u03bcm and length of less 120 \u03bcm long, may achieve a sensitivity better than 10g\/Hz.","To further increase sensitivity and expedite the detection process, the PEMS may be immersed in a flowing solution for in-solution detection.

A tin non-piezoelectric layer was then electroplated on the nickel surface at a rate of 0.5 \u03bcm\/minute, using tin sulfate in a plating solution. A 150 nm thick platinum on a 10-nm thick titanium layer was evaporated on the other face of the film as the other electrode. The resultant PMN-PT\/Sn bilayer was embedded in wax and cut into the cantilever shape with a wire saw. Gold wires were attached to the top and bottom electrodes using conductive glue for electrical connection.

The immobilization methods may differ depending upon the receptor to be bound on the electrode surface.","For example, BA antigens may be immobilized on a lead surface by cleaning a platinum electrode with a 1:40 diluted piranha solution for 2 min, soaking the PEMS in a 2 mM 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) for 2 hr to form an MPA monolayer on the electrode surface, and activating the carboxyl group of the MPA using a solution of 2 mM N-Ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and 5 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) in water to allow covalent bonding of primary amines on the anti-BA-spore antibody to the MPA monolayer.","A method for PSA receptor immobilization on a lead surface includes the steps of immersing the microcantilever in a solution containing 1 part 30% HO, concentrated HSOand 29 parts water for 2 min, rinsing with distilled water and immersing in a 1 mM MPA aqueous solution overnight.

Alternatively, it may be possible to utilize longer mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) in order to optimize the efficiency.","scFv receptors may also be immobilized on a gold surface by using Cu ions to bind to His6 tag of scFv. In this method, the gold coated microcantilever tip is first cleaned with Piranha solution for 10 minutes and rinsed with distilled water. The gold surface is then treated with MPTS, MPA (mercaptopropionic acid), or MUA (mercaptoundecanoic acid) to form a monolayer on the gold-coated sensor surface. Preferably, the gold surface is treated by immersed in a solution of 1 mM 11 Mercaptoundecanoic Acid (MUA) and ethanol for 3 hours and rinsed with distilled water. The cantilever is then immersed in a 2 mM Cu(ClO)aqueous solution for 10 min to adsorb Cu on the MUA self assembled monolayer and form a MPA-Cu composite monolayer.

Submicron crystalline PMN powder was prepared by dispersing Mg(OH)-coated NbOparticles in a lead acetate\/ethylene glycol solution followed by calcination at about 800\u00b0 C. The crystalline PMN powder was subsequently suspended in a PT precursor solution containing lead acetate and titanium isopropoxide in ethylene glycol to form a PMN-PT precursor powder, which can be sintered at a temperature as low as about 900\u00b0 C.","The PMN-PT films were then polarized in order to obtain high piezoelectric coefficients. Before polarization, the orientations of domains were random with no net polarization. After polarization, many domains were aligned in the direction of the applied electric field resulting in a finite polarization. Although polycrystalline materials are not easily aligned in comparison to single crystal materials, PMN-PT films were geometrically structured so as to facilitate polarization alignment within the plane of the film.","The resulting freestanding PMN-PT films were then electroplated on one side with a sputtered 30 nm thick nickel\/platinum (Ti\/Pt) layer. A copper layer of appropriate thickness was then electroplated on the Pt surface to create a non-piezoelectric layer, followed by the deposition of the Ti\/Pt electrode on the other face of the film. A PMN-Pt\/Cu bi-layer was then embedded in wax and cut or chemically etched to form a cantilever shape with a wire saw.","A particularly advantageous aspect of this method is the ability to construct a microcantilever from one piece of PMN-PT film without having to separately attach the non-piezoelectric and piezoelectric layers, facilitating the manufacturing process. Because the cantilevers, thus fabricated, had a clean geometry and clean interfaces between the PMN-PT layer and the electrodes, cantilever sensitivity was heightened, as demonstrated by Q values as high as 300.","The resulting suspensions have previously been used to formulate PMN-PT freestanding films of about 8-75 \u03bcm thick upon sintering at 1000\u00b0 C. Typically, the freestanding PMN-PT films have femtogram sensitivity of at least 2\u00d710g\/Hz, dielectric constants greater than 1000, saturated polarization of about 30 \u03bcC\/cm, remnant polarization of 25 \u03bcC\/cmand a Q value as high as 300. Therefore PMN-PT microcantilevers are capable of generating higher-mode resonance peaks resulting in enhanced sensitivity detection.","A PZT\/SiOpiezoelectric layer of film may be formed on silicon wafers and attached to a substrate, such as glass, to form an array.  depicts a preferred micro-fabrication procedure for constructing PZT\/SiOpiezoelectric microcantilever sensors. A low-stress SiOsubstrate, 2-\u03bcm in thickness, was first deposited on front and back sides of a (100)-oriented silicon wafer by steam oxidation at 800\u00b0 C. A first side of the SiOconstituted the non-piezoelectric layer of the microcantilever, and a second side of the SiOformed an etching mask, wherein the silicon wafer was wet etched using KOH.","A 400 \u212b thick TiObonding layer was then deposited by reactive sputtering of Ti followed by the deposition of a 1500 \u212b thick platinum electrode. Reactive sputtering of Ti was carried out under 15 mTorr of 80% oxygen and 20% helium. To prepare for deposition of the platinum electrode, a stage or platform was heated to 650\u00b0 C. at a rate of 5\u00b0 C.\/min. The RF power was adjusted to the expected deposition rate. After deposition, the stage was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5\u00b0 C.\/min to avoid residue stress. Sputtering of the platinum bottom electrode began when the stage reached room temperature. The resultant platinum bottom electrode was preferably about 1500 \u212b in thickness.","A 1.5-\u03bcm thick PZT layer was then deposited on the Pt\/TiO\/SiO\/Si substrate using a sol gel method with repeated spin coating and heat treatment steps. According to the sol gel method, titanium isopropoxide and lead acetate were dissolved in ethylene glycol and zirconium-n-propoxide in 2-propanol. The dissolved components were mixed to obtain a PZT precursor solution. The precursor solution also contained a 50% excess of lead to compensate for lead loss during repeated heat treatment. The PZT thin films were then deposited by repeated spin coating on a Pt\/TiO\/SiOsubstrate followed by pyrolysis at 350\u00b0 C. for 12 min and sintering at 650\u00b0 C. for 2 hours after every 5 depositions. The Pt\/TiO\/SiOsubstrate was formed by depositing a 2-\u03bcm thick low-stress SiOon a silicon wafer through steam oxidation, depositing 40 nm of Ti on the SiOby sputtering and oxidization at 800\u00b0 C. and depositing 150 nm Pt by sputtering to prevent undesired interfacial reaction and diffusion. The TiObuffer and a SiOlayer, having a thickness larger than 0.5 \u03bcm, together effectively eliminated diffusion between the PZT layer and the substrate.","After forming the PZT layer, a first electrode, Pt\/Ti or Au\/Cr, was deposited by E-gun evaporation in high vacuum (2\u00d710torr or lower) to avoid oxidation of metal, particularly oxidation of the Cr layer. E-gun evaporation was used because it is gentler than sputtering or thermal evaporation and avoids damaging the PZT layer. The thickness of the resultant Ti or Cr bonding layer was approximately 5-40 nm and the resultant Pt or Au electrode layer was approximately 100-200 nm thick. A nickel layer was deposited on the top electrode to form a hard mask for protecting the top electrode and the underlying PZT during dry etching. The Ni and top electrode were patterned using an over-hang lift-off process. LOR10B and SPR3012 photoresists are recommended for executing the over-hang lift-off process, and the thickness of the undercut photoresist (LOR) was about 0.8 to 1.2 \u03bcm, approximately 1.5 times larger than the metal layer. The selectivity or etching rate ratio of PZT to Ni was nearly 5:1. The thickness of the resultant Ni layer was about 0.3-0.5 \u03bcm, depending on the PZT thickness.","The exposed PZT and TiO\/Pt bottom electrode was patterned by a chlorine-based inductively coupled plasma (ICP) dry etching process using a chlorine etching gas to expose the SiOand 150 sccm flow late. The pressure of the etching chamber was set to below 10 mTorr. The RF power was adjusted to the etching rate. Since the PZT is a ceramic material and the nickel etching mask is stable at high temperatures, a high RF power of about 400 W is recommended for PZT dry etching. The selectivity ratios of the PZT dry etching process were 5:1 for Ni and 8:1 for Pt. The etching mask for the bottom electrode was a thick photoresist such as one in the SPR220 series. Because the etching mask was a photoresist, a low RF power was recommended for this etching process. Silver glue was used to fill spaces between the sample and the stage to help dissipate heat during etching. For every 5 min of etching, a 20-min cooling period was required. By keeping the etching temperature below 120\u00b0 C., the PR was easily removed with acetone after etching.","The silicon dioxide on the second side was patterned by photolithography, and the exposed silicon dioxide was etched by CF\/CHFbased reactive ion etching (RIE). After the silicon-dioxide etching is finished, the whole first side was sealed by black wax, and the sample was placed in a 45% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. The temperature of the solution was set to 55-60\u00b0 C., and the KOH was used to etch the exposed silicon with the remaining silicon dioxide as an etching mask. After etching, the black wax was dissolved using trichloroethylene (TCE) and the front side was cleaned. The exposed silicon dioxide was removed on the front side by a CF\/CHF-based reactive ion etching (RIE). The first electrode and second electrode work together because the mask and the selectivity ratios are very high. If desired, the etching duration may be increased to ensure that all the silicon dioxide is removed and the cantilevers are released. After rinsing with acetone, 2-proponal and deionized water, free-standing PZT\/SiOpiezoelectric microcantilever sensors were obtained.","Mercaptopropylsilane (MPTS) was investigated for its ability to function both as an electrical insulator and as receptor immobilizer. The results established that MPTS is an effective insulator and immobilizer enabling the detection of the HER2 antibody both in solution and in the presence of BSA.","To prepare the MPTS coated PEMS, a PMN-PT\/tin PEMS was first soaked in a diluted (1:100 in water) piranha solution, containing two parts 98% sulfuric acid and one part of 30% hydrogen peroxide, at 20\u00b0 C. for 1 min to clean the tin and gold surfaces. Next, the PEMS was submerged in a beaker containing a 40 mM solution of MPTS in ethanol, and the beaker was covered with paraffin film to prevent ethanol evaporation. After 4 hours, the PEMS was rinsed with DI water and submerged in a 0.01 M solution of NaOH overnight for cross-linking. The PEMS was then soaked in DI water for 1 hour and dried overnight in a vacuum-oven at 762 mm Hg to ensure all the water was removed.

As can be seen, the PEMS yielded a resonance frequency shift of about 2800\u00b1200, 1000\u00b1100, 140\u00b1100, and 10\u00b1100 Hz at t=50 minutes, for 110, 50, 30 and 10 ng\/ml HER2 concentrations, respectively. The results indicate the PEMS was able to detect breast cancer markers in diluted serum with a concentration limit of 30 pg\/ml.","An array of three millimeter long PZT\/glass PEMS were used to assess the binding ability of a receptor for its ligand. The performance of 3 receptors, B1 scFv, H3 scFv, and Herceptin, was compared using an array of three identical PZT\/glass PEMS insulated with MPS. A heterobifunctional cross linking agent, sulfosuccinimidyl 4-N-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, was used to covalently attach the receptor to the MPS surface. After receptor immobilization the cantilevers were blocked using a 3% BSA solution for 1 hour, and then rinsed with a 1% BSA solution and a 1% Tween\u00ae 20 solution.","The three PEMS were all completely submerged in the same 6 ml flow cell. A 1:40 fetal bovine serum diluted in PBS containing a known spiked amount of HER2 ECD was introduced into the flow cell. The sample was flowed through the system at a rate of 0.7 ml\/minute.  shows the resultant PEMS detection of HER2 in solutions containing diluted 1:40 fetal bovine serum and HER2 in concentrations of 6 ng\/ml, 60 ng\/ml or 600 ng\/ml. In Table 3, the resonance frequency shift is given at t=60 minutes. According to  and Table 3, the three identical PEMS showed that Herceptin consistently had larger frequency shifts, suggesting that Herceptin can be detected using PEMS at a lower concentration limit, as compared to B1 scFv and H3 scFv.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0144"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Resonance frequency shift of the array PZT\/glass PEMS"},{"entry":"immobilized with different HER2 receptor: H3, B1 and Herceptin."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Concentration","H3","B1","Herceptin"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\u20036 ng\/ml","55","460","850"]},{"entry":[{},"\u200260 ng\/ml","150","840","1500"]},{"entry":[{},"600 ng\/ml","780","1300","3200"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"An array of millimeter long PZT\/glass PEMS, each having a width of about 300-600 \u03bcm and including a 1 mm long PZT layer and a 2 mm long glass tip, as shown in ), was used to detect the water borne parasite, (CP) at concentration levels of 0.1 CP\/ml in a volume of 60 ml, i.e., 6 total CPs in the 60 ml of water. The PEMS were insulated with MPS and conjugated with the anti-CP IgM using the bi-functional linker SMCC.","In the experiment, two arrays were used; one control array, whose PEMS were coated with an irrelevant protein BSA (not shown), served as control and one experimental array, whose PEMS were coated with anti-CP IgM. A CP sample was introduced to the PEMS array at a flow rate of about 1 ml\/min. ) shows the resonance frequency shift as a function of time for each of the four experimental PEMS coated with anti-CP IgM, i.e. C1, C2, C3, and C4. As can be seen, the control 1.5 array showed no resonance frequency shift while C1, C2, and C3 showed several hundred Hz resonance frequency shifts, indicating that a PEMS array may be used for CP detection at very low concentrations based on the positive response from any of the PEMS, which indicates the presence of a target pathogen.","A 40 \u03bcm long PZT\/SiOPEMS, as shown in ), was found to have an improved sensitivity of about 10g\/Hz with resonance peak Q values as high as 300 in a humidity controlled environment. ) shows the resonance frequency spectra of the PEMS corresponding to varying humidity. The resonance frequency was found to decrease with an increasing relative humidity due to the adsorption of water molecules on the sensor surface. Therefore it is possible to increase sensitivity with very small PEMS.","The resultant sensitivity of 6\u00d710g\/Hz demonstrates the feasibility of further reducing PEMS size while increasing sensitivity when compared to the millimeter sized commercial PZT PEMS having a sensitivity of about 10g\/Hz and 300-800 \u03bcm long PMN-PT PEMS having a sensitivity of about 10to 10g\/Hz.","Having described the preferred embodiments of the invention which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting, it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings.
