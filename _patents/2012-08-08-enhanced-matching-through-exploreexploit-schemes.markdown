title: Enhanced matching through explore/exploit schemes
abstract: Content items are selected to be displayed on a portal page in such a way as to maximize a performance metric such as click-through rate. Problems relating to content selection are addressed, such as changing content pool, variable performance metric, and delay in receiving feedback on an item once the item has been displayed to a user. An adaptation of priority-based schemes for the multi-armed bandit problem, are used to project future trends of data. The adaptation introduces experiments concerning a future time period into the calculation, which increases the set of data on which to solve the multi-armed bandit problem. Also, a Bayesian explore/exploit method is formulated as an optimization problem that addresses all of the issues of content item selection for a portal page. This optimization problem is modified by Lagrange relaxation and normal approximation, which allow computation of the optimization problem in real time.

The applicant hereby rescinds any disclaimer of claim scope in the parent application or the prosecution history thereof and advise the USPTO that the claims in this application may be broader than any claim in the parent application.","This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/267,538, titled ENHANCED MATCHING THROUGH EXPLORE\/EXPLOIT SCHEMES, and filed on Nov. 7, 2008, and is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/504,527, titled ACTIVITY BASED USERS' INTERESTS MODELING FOR DETERMINING CONTENT RELEVANCE, and filed on Jul. 16, 2009, the entire contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.","The present invention relates to Internet portal web pages, and, more specifically, to techniques for employing targeted experiments to select content items to be displayed on an Internet portal web page.","Owners of portal web pages wish to make their pages appealing to potential visitors. One way of making a portal page more enticing to those potential visitors is by placing interesting information on that portal page. For example, one might try to entice users to access a portal page by including, on the portal page, interesting and current content items such as news stories, advertisements, pertinent search results, or media. Such content items may be presented in conjunction with one another, or separately. Furthermore, there may be a substantive representation of the content item directly on the portal page, or the portal page may contain only a link with minimal information about the item.","If visitors to the portal page learn, by experience, that the content shown on the portal page is likely to be of interest to those visitors, and that the content shown on the portal page is likely to be dynamic, updated, fresh, and current each time that those visitors access the portal page, then those visitors will likely want to access that page additional times in the future, and with greater frequency. Also, the dynamic nature of the portal page will enhance the experience of the visitors.","Alternatively, if visitors to the portal page discover, by experience, that the content shown on the portal page is likely to be the same static content that those visitors saw the last time that they visited the portal page, or if visitors to the portal page come to understand that the type of content that is shown on the portal page is a type of content in which they are not interested, then those visitors become more likely, in the future, to forego visiting the portal page and visit other pages instead.","One challenge to the owner or the maintainer of the portal page becomes how to choose, from among the multitude of content that could be presented on the portal page, content that is likely to increase visitor interest in the page. One approach for selecting content might involve hiring a staff of full-time human editors to look for (and\/or compile or otherwise produce) news stories and other content items that those editors believe will be interesting to those who visit the portal page. However, such editors are only human, and, as humans, are inherently biased towards their own tastes and preferences. The content that appeals to the editors might not be content that appeals to significant segments of the public. Additionally, a staff of qualified full-time editors can require a significant and recurring monetary investment on the part of the owners of the Internet portal page to maintain or to scale.","Another approach for selecting content for presentation on the portal page is through an automated system. These automated systems are easier to scale and maintain than the staff of editors. The systems generally base content selection on historical information gathered from users of the portal page. For example, automated systems can rely on past user behavior including search queries that were previously entered, advertisements that visitors have clicked on, or information that visitors explicitly give to the portal page. However, such historical data does not always accurately reflect the current trends and desires of the visitors to the portal page. Also, because content for web pages can change very rapidly, the historical data may not include information about the content currently available to display.","The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, it should not be assumed that any of the approaches described in this section qualify as prior art merely by virtue of their inclusion in this section.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Visitor interest in a portal page\u2014measured by performance metrics such as overall visitor experience, number of page views, and click-through rate\u2014dictates the amount of advertising revenue that will be generated by the portal page. For simplicity, the following discussion will focus on click-through rate as the pertinent performance metric, but a person of skill in the art will appreciate that any yield function could be used as the performance metric. Click-through rate is also known as CTR, and is defined in one embodiment of the invention as a number of clicks on a particular content item divided by a number of times the particular content item has been displayed to users of the portal page.","In one embodiment of the invention, an automated system is used to select and present to users those items in the content pool that will most likely have a high CTR. In another embodiment of the invention, the automated system bases selection of content items for presentation on both historical data and hypothetical data produced by experiments. As previously stated, historical data alone does not reflect changing CTR, and the historical data does not contain information about newly available items. Also, historical data is generally sparse because the number of clicks observed for the items in the content pool is generally low compared to the number of times the items have been presented. Thus, decisions made by the system based on solely historical data cannot account for items of content that would perform very well, but that do not conform to the historical trends.","Thus, experiments based on observed user behavior are employed to investigate changing CTR, the effects of a dynamic content pool, and to find those outlier content items that perform unexpectedly well. These experiments are targeted in such a way as to minimize potential hazards of running experiments on live users, such as lowering user experience and depressing CTR. Through the use of targeted experiments, more information is gathered than would be available by using the historical data alone, and thus items with high CTR will be found more quickly.","Other features that may be included in various different embodiments of the invention are discussed in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","106"]},"In one embodiment of the invention, browsers A-N execute on separate computers, such as desktop or laptop computers. However, in one embodiment of the invention, one or more of browsers A-N executes on a mobile device such as a mobile or cellular telephone.","Each of browsers A-N communicates with server  via Internet . For example, browsers A-N may send Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests to, and receive HTTP responses from, server  across Internet . These HTTP requests and responses may be transmitted according to a multi-level suite of network communication protocols, typically including Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). Each of browsers A-N may be used by a different user. Browsers A-N may be widely distributed over the entire Earth. Using browsers A-N, users of browsers A-N specify the URL that is associated with a web page (e.g., the portal web page discussed above) that server  stores or dynamically generates. In response to these users specifying the URL, browsers A-N request, over Internet , from server , the web page that is associated with that URL. Server  receives these requests and dynamically generates and sends the requested web page to browsers A-N over Internet  in response.","In one embodiment of the invention, users of browsers A-N use browsers A-N to access a portal web page that is served by server . In one embodiment of the invention, server  is, or comprises, a web server. In one embodiment of the invention, the functionality of server  is provided instead by multiple separate servers to which the requests of browsers A-N are distributed by a load-balancing device that receives those requests. In response to requests from browsers A-N for the portal web page, server  sends the portal web page over Internet  to browsers A-N. As discussed above, the portal web page typically contains one or more content items that were selected from a pool of available content items. In response to receiving the portal web page from server , browsers A-N display the portal web page.","In one embodiment of the invention, server  dynamically generates at least portions of the portal web page in response to each request from browsers A-N. In one embodiment of the invention, the version of the portal web page that server  sends to various ones of browsers A-N differs from the version that server  sends to other ones of browsers A-N. For example, the version of the portal web page sent to browser A might contain different selected content items than the version of the portal web page sent to browser B.","In one embodiment of the invention, a Bayesian explore\/exploit solution is used as the content selection algorithm for the automated system. The algorithm is related to the classical multi-armed bandit problem, which is based on a slot machine with more than one arm. Each arm of the slot machine returns a reward of varying magnitude and each time the hypothetical player pulls an arm of the slot machine, the player must pay a set price. Once the player has pulled at least one arm, she examines the reward she has received from all of her past pulls, as well as the price the player has already paid and uses this information to decide which arm to pull next. The solution to the multi-armed bandit problem is a sequence in which to pull the arms of the slot machine that optimizes payout to the player.","This multi-armed bandit problem is similar to the problem of selecting content items to display on a portal page. There is an array of content items from which to select for display and, for each available spot on the page, one item is chosen to display. When a particular item is selected, the opportunity to display a different item is foregone, and thus each item selection comes with a set price. Choice of a particular item will produce a CTR of unknown magnitude. Thus, solutions to the multi-armed bandit problem are applicable to aid in selecting the order in which to present content items such that the order optimally converges to the highest possible payout. In the case of the portal page, the payout that is maximized is the click-through rate.","There are also some differences between the multi-armed bandit problem and the problem of content item selection for a portal page. The multi-armed bandit problem assumes immediate knowledge of the magnitude of the reward received by the player once an arm has been chosen and pulled. Thus, the decision of which arm to pull is based on all of the feedback from all of the previous pulls performed by the player. The assumption that all feedback will be available at every point of decision is not feasible in the case of presenting content items to visitors of a portal page because a visitor of the page, when presented with a content item, might not immediately click on the item. The visitor may do any number of things after viewing the content item, before deciding finally to click on the content item presented. Thus, one cannot assume that if a viewer does not click on a content item immediately, the viewer will never click on the content item. Also, in the case of a very large portal page, some time may be needed to gather and assemble information regarding the CTR.","Another difference between the problem of content selection and the multi-armed bandit problem is that the multi-armed bandit problem assumes a fixed set of arms available to be chosen. However, the set of content items available to be displayed on a portal page can change almost constantly.","Finally, the multi-armed bandit problem generally assumes that the magnitude of the reward for each arm is static. However, in the case of serving content items on a portal page, the CTR of an item may vary widely from day to day. For example, a content item about a movie that is to be released tomorrow could be very popular presently, but may lose its popularity overnight if it is a box-office flop.","Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, solutions to the multi-armed bandit problem are modified to address the particular issues of the content selection problem. In another embodiment of the invention, a new Bayesian explore\/exploit algorithm is used to address these issues.","An embodiment of the invention is described below wherein the solution to the traditional multi-armed bandit algorithm is modified to include an experiment to produce hypothetical data pertaining to a future time period. Based on this modified solution, a plan is formulated for selecting content items to be served during the future time period that are most likely to maximize the CTR of the portal page.","The experiment includes identifying a set future time interval and hypothetically serving content items to hypothetical users that are assumed to visit the portal page during the future time interval. The number of visitors to the page during a particular period of time is estimated from historical data. For each hypothetical presentation of a content item, the expected click-through rate of the item and the number of times the item was hypothetically served is recorded in an experiment database. The definition of the expected click-through rate for an item used for the experiment is an empirical estimate based on the true historical data regarding the item. When the experiment is complete, the data from the experiment database is used to create a plan for serving the available content items to actual portal page visitors during the set time period.","In one embodiment of the invention, as information is gathered pertaining to the content items presented to actual users during the set time period, the true historical database is updated with the data gathered from the true user reactions. Then the experiment is run again to produce an updated plan for a new future time period. Thus, the data from the experiment is used in conjunction with the historical data to provide a larger set of data on which to base the selection of the content items than would be available if content items were selected based on the available historical data alone. In another embodiment of the invention, experiments regarding future time periods are run continuously while information is gathered pertaining to content items presented to actual users of the portal page. In this embodiment of the invention, the future time period is not set, but is constantly moving so as to provide an updated corpus of projected future data at all times.","The following is a more detailed discussion of one embodiment of the invention. In order to simplify this discussion, the subject portal page is assumed to have N content items available to display and the capacity to display only a single content item at a time. A particular item i has a current estimated probability, {circumflex over (P)}, that a random user will click on the item. In one embodiment of the invention, {circumflex over (P)}is estimated by dividing the total number of clicks observed for item i by the total number of times item i has been shown to users. In another embodiment of the invention, {circumflex over (P)}uses both historical data and simulated data. One of skill in the art will appreciate that there are other ways to calculate {circumflex over (P)}. Thus, if item i is served K times, K\u00b7{circumflex over (P)}clicks on item i are expected.","A true historical database D holds the historical data pertaining to each of the N content items, including the number of times each item has been actually presented to users and the number of clicks that have been observed for each item. Historical database D is the basis for the experiment that produces the simulated data. In one embodiment of the invention, a priority function uses D to select which item to present hypothetically to hypothetical visitors during the set future time period, t. For each item in N, the priority function, \u0192, receives the historical data pertinent to an item i, denoted D, and outputs a number rank pertaining to item i based on that data. In one embodiment, the priority function is as follows:\n\n\u0192()()\n","Thus, the priority of item i is calculated by adding its current estimated click-through rate, {circumflex over (P)}, with V (D), which is a variance calculation. For example, a quantity that intuitively represents variance is",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":["ln","n"]},"msub":{"mi":["n","i"]}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["i ","i","i ","1"],"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C"],"b":["201","202","203","204","202","210","202","211","202"]},"In one embodiment of the invention shown in , the first step  in deciding what to show for each visit in the designated future time period, t, is to take a snapshot of the entire set of historical data, D. Next, in step , the priority for each item is computed using the priority function, \u0192, as well as the historical data for each item i, Dand the experiment data gathered to this point for each item i, D\u2032. The priority function is evaluated as \u0192(union of Dand D\u2032). In the case of the first item to be selected, the set of experiment data will be empty. In step , the item with the highest priority score, denoted i, is selected to be hypothetically served to a hypothetical user in the experiment. The hypothetical data set for item i, D\u2032, is updated to reflect the hypothetical selection of item i. This update records the following: (1) that the hypothetical user clicked on item ia fraction of times, equal to {circumflex over (P)}, at step , and (2) the number of views of item ihas increased by one, at step .","After the hypothetical data set D\u2032is updated, the simulation process repeats itself starting from step  until the number of hypothetical views by the simulation reaches the number of views that is expected at the portal page during time interval t, as illustrated in decision .","The above-described technique amounts to a simulation of user behavior for the future time period t. In one embodiment of the invention, the percentage of times each item was hypothetically served is used as a sampling plan. The content items are presented to users during the designated time period, t, based on the percentage corresponding to each item in the sampling plan.","For a non-limiting example of creating a sampling plan, the result of a particular experiment regarding a particular time interval is that item iwas presented hypothetically to hypothetical users two times out of ten, or 20% of the time, and item iwas presented hypothetically to hypothetical users eight times out of ten, or 80% of the time. For the purposes of the experiment, the subject time interval is a future time interval. However, when the sampling plan\u2014created as a result of the experiment\u2014is put into practice, the subject time interval is the present time. Thus, the plan created from the particular experiment indicates that item iis to be presented to actual users 20% of the time during the subject time interval and that item iis to be presented to actual users 80% of the time.","A more detailed discussion of the modification of priority-based solutions to the multi-armed bandit problem is located in Section 4 of Appendix A.","In another embodiment of the invention, the problem of selecting content for a portal page such that the CTR is maximized can be put into a Bayesian formula for which the optimal solution can be found. Again, this discussion focuses on CTR as the pertinent performance metric, but performance can be measured in other ways. This equation takes into account a changing content pool, a shifting CTR for each content item, and the delay between presenting a particular content item to a user and receiving feedback regarding the success of the particular content item. However, the solution for such an equation is calculation-intensive. Therefore, Lagrange relaxation and normal approximation are implemented in one embodiment of the invention to allow for calculation of a near-optimal solution of the equation in real time.","Each item in the content pool is associated with a probability distribution (for example, probability distributions - in ) measuring the potential for the CTR associated with the item to increase or decrease. As an illustration, probability distribution  represents an approximation of the probability distribution associated with item i, and probability distribution  represents an approximation of the probability distribution associated with item i.","The probability distribution associated with each item indicates the probability that an item will get a better or a worse click-through rate than that item's current CTR if the item continues to be served to users. Because the goal is to maximize the total click-through rate, focus is placed on the possibility of obtaining a better click-through rate as opposed to the possibility of producing a worse click-through rate. If, for example, item ihas a current estimated click-through rate of 0.5 (indicating that out of 10 views, item ihas been clicked on an average of 5 times), probability distribution  can be used to estimate the chance that users will click on item imore often than 5 out of 10 times if the item continues to be presented to users. Probability distribution  shows a 50% chance that the click-through rate of item iwill improve from 0.5, as shown in  as an area  under the probability distribution .","Of particular interest is the area under the curve to the extreme right, known as the tail area, where the gain in click-through rate is potentially the greatest. This tail area is used herein for explanation purposes only; the Bayesian solution does not use or calculate the tail area. An example of a tail area is indicated in  by an area , which shows a probability of 5% that the click-through rate for item i, which is associated with probability distribution , could be higher than 0.6. Given a goal of maximizing the total CTR, the optimization problems discussed in the cases hereafter explore the possibility of a given item performing in the range of the tail area of that item's distribution, especially if the range of that tail area is better than the item with the best known click-through rate.","In one embodiment of the invention, the possibility that the other item will produce a higher CTR than the item with the current-best CTR is tested by serving the other item to users and monitoring the actual click-through rate of the other item. As more is known about the actual click-through rate of the other item, the probability distribution associated with the item changes, converging on a single CTR number. As the probability distribution converges, the tails area of the probability distribution gets smaller. If, as more information is gained about the items in the content pool, the probability distributions indicate that there is no longer a significant possibility that the other item will produce a higher CTR than the best known item's CTR, then the other item is no longer served. Conversely, if the other item continues to have a significant enough probability of producing a better CTR than the best known CTR, then the other item will continue to be presented to users.","In this manner, experiments are performed to get more information about the click-through rates of items with the potential to have very high click-through rates, to explore, for each item, the possibility that the item's click-through rate will improve. However, once the probability distribution indicates a poor probability of a particular item achieving a high click-through rate, the experiment with respect to the particular item is over.","The simplest problem setting in which to describe the Bayesian equation is one in which only one time interval is considered, called time interval 1. The goal is to determine the fraction of times that each available item is selected for presentation to users during time interval 1, which fraction is denoted by xfor each item i, such that the total number of clicks in time interval 1 is maximized. In this scenario, the maximum number of clicks is obtained by assigning 100% of the page views to the item with the highest expected CTR.","A slightly more involved scenario is one in which two items are available to display to the user and two time intervals, Tand T, are remaining. In order to further simplify the scenario, the CTR of the first item is exactly known without uncertainty. The known and certain CTR of the first item is denoted by qand q, in time intervals Tand T, respectively, as indicated by the subscripts of the respective variables. The uncertain CTR of the second item is denoted by p\u02dcP(\u03b8) and p\u02dcP(\u03b8) in time intervals Tand T, respectively. P(\u03b8) is a posterior distribution of pand \u03b8is a vector representing the hyperparameter or state of the distribution. The vector represented by \u03b8is a known quantity, while the vector represented by \u03b8is random because it is a function of a random number of clicks obtained in interval 0. Furthermore, Nand Ndenote the number of respective page views for each time interval and x and xdenote the fraction of page views to be given to the uncertain item. The quantities (1\u2212x) and (1\u2212x) are the fractions to be given to the certain item. The variable c denotes a random variable representing the number of clicks that the uncertain item gets in time interval 0. Finally, {circumflex over (p)}=E[p] and {circumflex over (P)}(x,c)=E[p|x,c].","The value of xdepends on x and c. To emphasize that xis a function of x and c, xis at times expressed as 0\u2266x(x,c)\u22661. Let Xdenote the domain of x, which is the set of all possible such functions that return a number between 0 and 1 for given (x,c). The goal is to find x\u03b5[0, 1] and x\u03b5Xthat maximize the expected total number of clicks in the two time intervals, which maximization problem is denoted

As with the previous cases, the goal is to determine xand x, for all i, in order to maximize the total number of clicks in the two time intervals. The variable xis used to generally denote [x, . . . . , x]. These initial decisions are based on a known \u03b8.

In contrast, each xrepresents a function of xand c. Also, it is assumed that, for any \u03b8, each (x,c) uniquely identifies a next state \u03b8(x,c). This is true for many common models, e.g., the Beta-Binomial model. Thus, it follows that xcan be considered as a function of \u03b8(x,c).

Again, this constraint requires that the sum of all of the xfor each of the K items equal one. The difficulty is that the constraint is for every possible value of \u03b8, which translates into a constraint per possible value of \u03b8.

Because of this property, maximization (over x) can be done for each item i independently to compute the V function. Generally, the problem of comparing probability distributions associated with content items in order to select the item with the greatest probability of a high click-through rate is a very complex problem. To split this calculation up into smaller calculations, the relaxed constraint introduces a representation of a hypothetical CTR associated with a hypothetical content item about which everything is known. Instead of having a probability distribution, this hypothetical item has an exact CTR value. For example, in , a dotted line  represents a hypothetical item with a known click-through rate of 0.4. Instead of comparing probability distributions  and  to each other, the Lagrange relaxation technique allows the probability distribution for each item to be compared separately to hypothetical item , as is illustrated in  and . In , probability distribution  is compared to hypothetical item , and in , probability distribution  is compared to hypothetical item .","Each problem represented by  can be computed separately because they hypothetical item  is the same in each separate computation. As such, the hypothetical item  preserves the relative qualities of the different probability distributions  and . The inter-dependencies between each item's probability distribution is captured by the hypothetical item . Thus, in a system with K items, like the general case described below, the Lagrange relaxation changes what would be a K-dimensional optimization problem into K problems of one dimension.","This independent maximization reduces to the gain maximization discussed in connection with the Bayes 2\u00d72 case and can be solved efficiently. Without the separability property, computation of function V involves joint maximization (over x, . . . , x) jointly), which would have to be done in a K-dimensional space. Even if function V is concave (which may not be true) in x, . . . , x, this joint maximization is expensive.","Therefore, the near optimal solution attained using Lagrange relaxation is computationally feasible, and thus preferable to the exact optimal solution attained without Lagrange relaxation.

This general solution is a generalization of the Bayes K\u00d72 solution discussed above, and one embodiment of the invention involves a two-stage approximation for multiple time intervals. As such, this general case involves K items and T+1 future time intervals (t=0, . . . , T). It is assumed that all of these K items are available in every future time interval. Similar to the bayes K\u00d72 case after Lagrange relaxation is applied, the convexity and separability properties still hold (though the formulas need to be slightly modified). However, the computational complexity increases exponentially in T. Because a scalable serving method is desirable, the T+1 interval case is approximated by only considering two stages: The first stage (indexed by 0) contains interval 0 with Npage views, while the second stage (indexed by 1) contains the rest of the T time intervals with \u03a3Npage views. The second stage is treated similarly to the second time interval in the Bayes 2\u00d72 case. Thus, the approximate solution is obtained by solving the Bayes 2\u00d72 case where Nis replaced by \u03a3N.","The general solution case takes into account a dynamic set of items. Items in a content optimization system come and go. For example, to ensure freshness, a business rule might specify that the lifetime of each item available to be presented to users is at most one day. Thus, the decision of what fraction of page views to allocate to each item logically focuses on the set of live items in the next time interval (indexed by 0). Generally, the solution to the present case is to apply the two-stage approximation to each individual item such that the lifetime constraint of each item is also satisfied. The theoretical justification is that the separability property still holds if the lifetime constraint for each item is included in the calculation.","The quantities start(i) and end(i) denote the start interval and end interval of item i. The variable Idenotes the set of live items, which are items i with start(i)\u22660. The variable T=maxend(i) denotes the end time of the item in Ihaving the longest lifetime. Variable I denotes the set of items i with 1\u2266start(i)\u2266T, which are also called future items. For ease of exposition, end(i) represents min{T,end(i)}.

The xthat maximizes the Gain function at q=q* and q=q* is the fraction of page views to be given to item i in the next time interval. The above V function is now expounded.","Live items (I) require different treatment than future items (I). Thus, there are two separate summation terms. The two-stage approximation is applied for each item. For a live item i, time interval 0 is the first stage, while the second stage includes time intervals 1, . . . . , end(i). For a future item i, the first stage is start(i)\u22600, and the second stage includes intervals start(i)+1, . . . . , end(i). Again, the goal is to determine what fraction x, of page views should be given to each live item i in the immediate next interval (interval 0). Therefore, a different variable, i.e., y, is used to denote the first-stage decision for future item i, which enters the system later than interval 0.","With respect to Lagrange multipliers, qis used to ensure that \u03a3x=1 for live items. Because future items are not available in interval 0, their gains do not include q. The variable qis used to ensure that the expected total number of page views given to items between interval 1 and T in the optimization matches the actual number of page views (i.e., \u03a3N). Thus, qis in both gain functions. Furthermore, in the gain function for future items, there are two occurrences of qbecause both stages for future items are between interval 1 and T.","With respect to item lifetime the following expressions, N, \u03a3N(in the gain function of live items) and N, \u03a3N(in the gain function of future items) incorporate item lifetimes into the optimization.","With respect to prior distribution, \u03b8represents the current belief about the CTR of item i. For live items, \u03b8is the current state, which has been updated by all of the observed clicks by users in the past. For future items, there are no observations. Thus, \u03b8is estimated (or initialized) based on analysis of historical data.","The approach to non-stationary CTR is by using dynamic models. When the state is updated from \u03b8to \u03b8after observing cclicks in xNpage views, instead of assuming that the CTRs of item i at time t and t+1 are the same, the CTRs are allowed to have small changes. In one embodiment of the invention, exponentially weighted Beta-Binomial (EWBB) and Gamma-Poisson (EWGP) models are used for handling non-stationary CTR. Under these models, CTR is p\u02dcBeta(\u03b1,\u03b3) or Gamma(\u03b1,\u03b3), i.e., \u03b8=[\u03b1,\u03b3], where \u03b1 and \u03b3 can be thought of as the number of clicks and the number of views that were observed in the past for item i. After observing c clicks in \u03bd page views, if CTR does not change over time, the state is updated by \u03b8=[\u03b1+c,\u03b3+\u03bd].","The EWBB and EWGP models are simple. The variable w, such that 0\u2266w\u22661, is a user-specified weight that needs to be tuned. The state is updated by \u03b8=[w\u03b1+c,w\u03b3+\u03bd]. If w is set to 0, then the instant CTR is tracked by ignoring all the past observations. This is an unbiased estimate of the current state, but the variance (uncertainty) would be large unless the item is allocated a large number of page views in time t. If w is set to 1, then this setting practically assumes a stationary CTR. In this case, although variance is reduced by using all the past observations, the estimate of current state is biased toward the past. A good w value needs to be found based on application-specific characteristics and analysis of historical data. The difference between EWBB and EWGP is in the way that the variance is computed.","Using the EWBB\/EWGP model in the Bayesian framework set forth in the embodiments of the invention is also simple. For each interval, after observing users' actual clicks, the EWBB\/EWGP model is used to update the state of each item.
