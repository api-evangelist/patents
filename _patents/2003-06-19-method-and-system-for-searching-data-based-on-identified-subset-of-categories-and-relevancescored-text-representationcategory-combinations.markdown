title: Method and system for searching data based on identified subset of categories and relevance-scored text representation-category combinations
abstract: A method and system for analyzing natural language text to identify a set of categories of data in a knowledge base associated with the natural language text and selecting a category from the set of categories is provided. The method and system further provides automatically providing a single category if the set of categories only contains the single category. The method and system also provides that each category in the knowledge base is associated with a stored text representation of a sample natural language text and a score for the text representation-category combination, wherein the score is representative of a relative relevance of the text representation-category combination. The method and system further provide for modifying the score associated with the text representation-category combination of a selected category using feedback provided upon the selection.

Field of the Invention","This invention relates to searching for data and, more particularly, to analyzing a natural language message, determining a category in a knowledge base corresponding to the content of the message, and intelligently providing documents from the knowledge base category in response to the message.","2. Description of the Related Art","With the ubiquitous nature of the Internet, most people are familiar with searching for data using a search engine. On the Internet, a search engine is a coordinated set of programs that can include the following:\n\n","The general concepts and problems encountered when searching for data are explained herein in the context of Internet searching by search engines, although the same concepts apply for searches performed on documents that are not web pages by other types of software, such as database searches by database management systems.","An alternative to using a search engine on the Internet is to explore a structured directory of topics. The Yahoo web site is a widely-used directory on the Web, although Yahoo also allows a user to use a search engine. A number of Web portal sites offer both the search engine and directory approaches to finding information.","Before a search engine can tell you where a file or document is, the file or document must be locatable. To find information on the hundreds of millions of Web pages that exist, a search engine employs spiders to build lists of the words found on Web sites. When a spider is building its lists, the process is called Web crawling. To build and maintain a useful list of words, a search engine's spider examines a very large number of web pages.","A spider typically begins with lists of heavily-used servers and very popular pages. The spider begins with a popular site, indexing the words on its pages and following every link found within the site. In this way, the spider quickly begins to travel, spreading out across the most widely used portions of the Web, to build an index.","Searching through an index involves a user building a query and submitting it through the search engine. The query can be quite simple, a single word at minimum. Building a more complex query requires the use of Boolean operators that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search.","The searches defined by Boolean operators, such as AND, OR, NOT, and so on, are literal searches\u2014the search engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as they are entered. This characteristic can be a problem when the entered words have multiple meanings. \u201cBed,\u201d for example, can be a place to sleep, a place where flowers are planted, the storage space of a truck, or a place where fish lay their eggs. If the user is interested in only one of these meanings, the user might not want to see pages featuring all of the others. The user can build a literal search that tries to eliminate unwanted meanings, but it is preferable that the search engine assist with the elimination.","One of the areas of search engine research is concept-based searching. Some of this research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases in the search, in order to find other pages in which the user might be interested. The information stored about each page is greater for a concept-based search engine than for a keyword searching engine, and far more processing is required for each search. Still, many groups are working to improve both results and performance of this type of search engine. Others have moved on to another area of research, called natural language queries.","The idea behind natural language queries is that the user can type a question in the same way the user would ask the question to a human being; there is no need to keep track of Boolean operators or complex query structures. A popular natural language query web site today is AskJeeves.com, which parses the query for keywords that it then applies to the index of sites it has built. AskJeeves.com only works with simple queries; but competition is heavy to develop a natural-language query engine that can accept a query of great complexity.","All three of these types of search engines search for words in the index matching the words used in the search query. As mentioned above, even concept-based searching typically involves analysis of actual words in the result document and matches those word combinations to words in the search text. The analysis and searching in a context-based search is typically much slower and more expensive than keyword searching.","What is needed is a way to combine the advantages and capabilities of these different searching techniques. Preferably, the user should be able to enter his or her query in natural language text, rather than as a Boolean expression. The search engine should provide intelligence to search based on concepts, rather than solely based on words appearing in both the search query and the search result. In addition, the search engine should find documents quickly and present the results in order of perceived relevance to the search query.","The present invention provides searching functionality to search a variety of types of documents for material related to concepts expressed in a natural language text. The invention includes analyzing the natural language text to determine an underlying concept and identifying one or more categories of searchable material in a knowledge base that are related to the underlying concept. The invention includes intelligently providing documents from the knowledge base in these categories, both automatically and with the assistance of a customer service agent.","In one embodiment, a method includes analyzing natural language text to identify a set of categories of data in a knowledge base. When the set includes one category, the method further includes providing data associated with the category from the knowledge base. When the set includes more than one category, the method includes presenting the set of categories for selection of a category and providing data associated with the selected category from the knowledge base.","The method can further include associating the selected category with a representation, such as a statistical representation, of the natural language text in the knowledge base. The method can further include automatically sending a response to the natural language text or providing materials to an agent for inclusion in a response. The set of categories can be presented with a score for each category, with the score based upon how closely the category matches the concept expressed in the natural language text. Data in the knowledge base can include solutions, resolutions, and pre-defined answers, also referred to as templates. In one embodiment, a solution to a problem stated in the natural language text can be made available in multiple language-specific versions. Each solution is associated with one category, and each language-specific version of the solution is associated with that category.","In one embodiment, an application program interface includes an analyzing function to analyze natural language text to identify a set of categories of data in a knowledge base. The application programming interface further includes a providing function to provide data associated with a category from the knowledge base and a presenting function to present the set of categories for selection of a selected category. The application programming interface can further include an associating function to associate a given category with a representation of the natural language text.","Other embodiments of the invention include a system, computer system, and computer program product to provide the functionality of the methods described above.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","For a thorough understanding of the subject invention, refer to the following Detailed Description, including the appended claims, in connection with the above-described Drawings.","References in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d mean that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover, various features are described that may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly, various requirements are described that may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.","Introduction","The present invention provides a method, system, computer system, computer program product, and application programming interface for searching a variety of types of documents for material related to concepts expressed in a natural language text. The invention includes analyzing the natural language text to determine an underlying concept and identifying one or more categories of searchable material in a knowledge base that are related to the underlying concept. The invention includes intelligently providing documents from the knowledge base in these categories, both automatically and with the assistance of a customer service agent, also referred to herein as a \u201ccall center agent.\u201d","An example usage scenario includes a call center agent at Company A receiving a call from a user who is experiencing a new problem that the user can't solve internally. The call center agent can enter information about the problem into a \u201cservice request\u201d form and then use an intelligent search engine such as that provided by the present invention to search for potential solutions to the problem. In one embodiment of the invention, when an agent begins to prepare a response corresponding to a service request, a searching user interface opens with information about the problem, automatically populates information from the service request, and sends text associated with the service request to a message analysis engine and search engine. The searching user interface can display a list of categories from which the call center agent can search for documents. In one embodiment, the intelligent search engine may provide a number of possible solutions and allow the call center agent to preview solutions, see further detail about a given solution, and, if the call center agent finds the best solution, attach the solution document to the response to the customer's service request. In one embodiment, a call center agent can also browse a catalog of categories in a hierarchical view and associate a document, such as a Solution or Response Template, with a category.","Another example of a usage scenario is an administrator for Company B for the intelligent search engine described above. Company B is now releasing a new product, and the administrator determines that new categories should be used to categorize materials related to the new product. The administrator adds those new categories and-trains the intelligent search engine by associating the new categories with materials containing responses to frequently asked questions (FAQs) expected to be related to the new product. In one embodiment, an administrative interface enables an administrator to create, delete, import, and export both categories and catalogs of categories. Furthermore, the administrator can place materials into categories as well as train the intelligent search engine to associate a representation of a natural language text with a given category. For example, a statistical representation of the natural language text can be developed by a message analysis component of the intelligent search engine and associated with the given category.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIGS. 2A and 3A","FIGS. 2B and 3B"],"b":"100"},"The embodiment of system  shown in  includes capabilities to obtain natural language text from either queries generated within an application program or from an external message source. It is not a requirement of the invention that the natural language text be generated by any particular source, whether internal or external to system . In , an embodiment of system  is shown as being in communication with an external message server , which receives messages from an external message client . In other embodiments, the functionality of external message server  and external message client  can be included in system . System  includes application program  and message analysis engine . Application program  can interact with a user, which can be a person and\/or another program (not shown). In the embodiment shown, application program  includes inbound communication manager , which communicates with external message server , search engine , and search client . Search engine  also generates natural language text queries that can be analyzed by message analysis engine . In other embodiments, the functionality provided by message analysis engine  can be included within application program , inbound communication manager  can be external to application program , and\/or search engine  and search client  can be either external to application program  or included within message analysis engine .","Application program  is in communication with knowledge base , which includes data that can be included in a search result provided by search engine . Knowledge base  is not limited to any particular type of knowledge base, database, or other implementation. Knowledge base  can be considered to represent generally any collection of data organized according to categories of knowledge. Example data are shown in , including three records for materials residing in knowledge base . The material  field included in the records shown includes an article X, a solution to a frequently asked question (FAQ) Y, and a pre-formulated resolution for a given problem, called a template, here template Z. Article X and FAQ Y have a category  value of \u2018A,\u2019 and template Z has a category  value of \u2018B.\u2019 Article X has a document type  value of \u2018literature,\u2019 FAQ Y has a document type  value of \u2018solution,\u2019 and template Z has a document type  value of \u2018resolution.\u2019","In one embodiment of the invention, an administrator can load a set of materials into knowledge base  and assign a value for category  and a value for document type  for each material. The administrator can create a new category  values and \u201ctrain\u201d message analysis engine  to recognize characteristics of natural language text corresponding to each category  value. In one embodiment, changes such as adding materials, categories, and document types and forming relationships between them can be made by adding respective values and\/or records to database . These changes can be made without changing application program  or any components included within application program . In some situations, data can be added to or changed within database  dynamically, without stopping execution of application program , inbound communication manager , search engine , or search client .","For example, it may be helpful for a customer support agent receiving a service request for help with a user's problem to search other service requests for similar problem reports. Assume that a new document type  is to be added to database  having the value \u201cService Request.\u201d An example scenario for implementing such a change includes adding a new value of \u201cService Request\u201d to a document type table (not shown). In addition, a material  having a value identifying a \u201cSearch Request #\u201d with a category  value of \u201cA\u201d can be associated with the document type  value of \u201cSearch Request.\u201d","In one embodiment, the functionality provided by search engine  can be selected as a \u2018search option\u2019 implemented by search client  from within application program , such as a call center application program. For example, the searching functionality may be invoked by pressing a button in a user interface for application program , wherein the button in the user interface is represented by search client . Pressing the button invokes a searching business service, implemented by search engine . In this embodiment, the user of application program  can search for documents related to the concept expressed in the original message or query and view those documents from within application program .","In one embodiment, application program  and search engine  are integrated to share data. By sharing data, application program  and search engine  enable users to see materials from various business components related to application program , such as Solutions, Literature, and Resolution Documents, as search results. Each business component may be included in database  as a document type or other type of object. As mentioned above, new document types or other types of objects can be added and relationships with other objects, such as documents, made without changing the implementation of application program  or any components included within application program . Data can be populated from application program  and used to build a natural language text for which a matching category is to be obtained.","In one embodiment, a commercially-available product serves as the core \u201cclassification engine\u201d in message analysis engine . This commercially-available classification engine is Banter Relationship Modeling Engine (RME), provided by Banter, Inc. of San Francisco, Calif. Banter RME uses a knowledge base file of categories, category relationships, and a statistical model that represents each category as it relates to the entire set of categories. This statistical model is used when natural language text from an original message or query is sent to the classification engine to find the most relevant categories. While this particular commercially-available product is used in this embodiment, any program that can derive a concept expressed in natural language text and use that concept to determine related categories of information in a knowledge base can be used to provide the functionality of message analysis engine .","The model that represents categories inside a knowledge base, such as knowledge base , can be built by providing representative sample text for each category in the knowledge base. The model can be either a statistical model or a rule-based model. In one embodiment, knowledge base  is loaded by sending sample texts for all categories at one time to knowledge base . Rather than storing the natural language text itself in knowledge base , each sample text is analyzed to determine a text representation for the sample text, and that text representation is associated with at least one related category in knowledge base . Message analysis engine  builds the base model that defines knowledge base  from text representations for the sample text. In one embodiment, the model includes calculating a score for a given category\/text representation combination, where the score indicates the relative relevance of the category to the concept represented by the text representation.","Once a base model is built for a knowledge base and is deployed, automated learning can be applied for categories based on actual usage of the knowledge base. Learning takes the form of positive or negative feedback for a text representation\/category combination. This feedback is used to modify the base model to add to the set of acceptable combinations or eliminate combinations that should not be associated. In one embodiment, a user can provide feedback to the message analysis engine  for a particular knowledge base, such as knowledge base . The score for a given category\/text representation combination is not required and is not limited to a particular implementation. The score can be calculated by a trained statistical or rule-based model based upon feedback, assigned by an algorithm developed specifically for a particular application environment, and\/or manually assigned or adjusted by an administrator when new content is introduced and\/or modified in the knowledge base.","In one embodiment, multiple application programs and\/or multiple instances of a single application program can share a given knowledge base. Providing feedback from different sources to a single knowledge base helps ensure the accuracy of categories associated with a given text representation of a natural language text. Furthermore, multiple instances of a search engine, such as search engine , can be running for different application programs and\/or for different instances of a single application program. It is within the scope of the invention that feedback can be provided to different instances of search engine .","Feedback can be performed as a separate, asynchronous process from the process of receiving and providing a search result and\/or message response for a given natural language text. Feedback related to the associated category\/text representation for that given natural language text can be provided to the specific instance of search engine  that originally processed that natural language text. A selected category can be compared with a category generated by that particular instance of search engine  to determine whether feedback is necessary. This feedback enables, for example, the selected category for the natural language text to be properly associated with the correct text representation of the natural language text.","In the following descriptions of , either search client  and inbound communication manager  is shown, but not both, depending upon the particular data flows involved. As mentioned previously, it is not a requirement that application program  include components such as inbound communication manager  and search client . If application program  does include both inbound communication manager  and search client , one of skill in the art will recognize that inbound communication manager  can operate simultaneously with search client  in obtaining and processing natural language texts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":"152"},"In action A., search client  obtains and provides original query BA to message analysis engine .

The analysis does not include searching for keywords in the message, but rather examining the message's natural language text to intelligently determine a concept expressed by the message. The content of the message, represented by text representation A, is then used to identify a category of related data in knowledge base , in this case category A.

The RAM is generally the main memory into which the operating system and application programs are loaded and typically affords at least 64 megabytes of memory space. The ROM or flash memory may contain, among other code, the Basic Input-Output system (BIOS) which controls basic hardware operation such as the interaction with peripheral components. Applications resident with computer system  are generally stored on and accessed via a computer readable medium, such as a hard disk drive (e.g., fixed disk ), an optical drive (e.g., CD-ROM drive ), floppy disk unit  or other storage medium. Additionally, applications may be in the form of electronic signals modulated in accordance with the application and data communication technology when accessed via network modem  or interface .","Storage interface , as with the other storage interfaces of computer system , may connect to a standard computer readable medium for storage and\/or retrieval of information, Such as a fixed disk drive . Fixed disk drive  may be a part of computer system  or may be separate and accessed through other interface systems. Many other devices can be connected such as a mouse  connected to bus  via serial port , a modem  connected to bus  via serial port , and a network interface  connected directly to bus . Modem  may provide a direct connection to a remote server via a telephone link or to the Internet via an internet service provider (ISP). Network interface  may provide a direct connection to a remote server via a direct network link to the Internet via a POP (point of presence). Network interface  may provide such connection using wireless techniques, including digital cellular telephone connection, general packet radio service (GPRS) connection, digital satellite data connection or the like.","Many other devices or subsystems (not shown) may be connected in a similar manner (e.g., bar code readers, document scanners, digital cameras and so on). Conversely, it is not necessary for all of the devices shown in  to be present to practice the present invention. The devices and subsystems may be interconnected in different ways from that shown in . The operation of a computer system such as that shown in  is readily known in the art and is not discussed in detail in this application. Code to implement the present invention may be stored in computer-readable storage media such as one or more of system memory , fixed disk , CD-ROM  or other optical device, or floppy disk . Additionally, computer system  may be any kind of computing device, and so includes a personal data assistant (PDA), network appliance, X-window terminal or other such computing device. Computer system  also supports a number of Internet access tools, including, for example, an HTTP-compliant web browser having a JavaScript interpreter.","Advantages of the present invention are many. Problems can be expressed in natural language text, rather than as a Boolean expression, and queries can be based on natural language messages or on data processed by an application program. The search engine provides intelligence to search based on concepts, rather than solely based on words appearing in both the search query and the search result. The search engine finds documents quickly and presents the results in order of perceived relevance to the search query. Materials of different types can be associated with a common category, so that the form of the knowledge does not interfere with the ability to find the knowledge during a search.","Other Embodiments","The foregoing describes an embodiment wherein some components are contained within other components (e.g., inbound communication manager  of application program  in ).
