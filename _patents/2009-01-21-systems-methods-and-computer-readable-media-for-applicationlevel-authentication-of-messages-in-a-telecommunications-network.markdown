No. 61\/022,076, filed Jan. 18, 2008; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The subject matter described herein relates to application-level authentication in a telecommunications network. More particularly, the subject matter described herein relates to systems, methods, and computer readable media for application-level authentication of messages in a telecommunications network.","Users of telecommunications networks increasingly desire to use a cell phone or other personal communications device to make on-line purchases, perform banking or other transactions, redeem coupons or use gift cards during in-store transactions, and a wide variety of other activities that may benefit from, or even require, authentication of the identity of the person seeking to perform the transaction. Short messaging service (SMS) messages are an increasingly popular mechanism for performing transactions using a personal communications device, but there is no defined standard for authentication of SMS messages. Wireless network protocols such as GSM include some level of authentication, but many wired network protocols do not. Furthermore, wireless network authentication is limited to the network, transport, or session layer of a typical network protocol stack. While this level of authentication is useful to verify that the user's cell phone is allowed access onto the wireless network, it does not address the need to verify to a bank, for example, that the person using the cell phone to transfer money out of an account is the actual owner of that account.","Consequently, messages that originate from or transfer into wired networks may not be authenticated or may have authentication that is insufficient for the task at hand. Moreover, the problem is not limited to SMS messages. Other types of messages that are sent through a telecommunications network may require or benefit from authentication. For example, networked games, such as massively multiplayer role-playing games, involve communication of messages back and forth between a player and the game server. In some games, the play involves a form of commerce in the game currency, such as where players buy and sell virtual property. Thus, for both real and virtual commerce, for example, it becomes vitally important that there be authentication of messages at the application level. Without application level authentication, these transactions pose a security risk, and present opportunities for fraudulent transactions to be performed.","Accordingly, there exists a need for application-level authentication of messages in a telecommunications network.","According to one aspect, the subject matter described herein includes a method for application-level authentication of messages in a telecommunications network. The method includes, at a node in a telecommunications network, receiving, from a personal communications device having a user, a message requiring application-level authentication, the message including information associated with the user and incorporating first authentication information associated with the user, the first authentication information being provided from a source that is not the user of the personal communications device. A request for second authentication information associated with the user is sent to an authentication server. Second authentication information associated with the user is received from the authentication server, and the authenticity of the message is determined based on the second authentication information associated with the user.","As used herein, the term \u201capplication-level authentication\u201d refers to authentication that is performed at the application level or equivalent of a network protocol stack, and specifically excludes authentication that occurs at levels below the application level in a network protocol stack, such as the physical, data link, network, transport, session, or presentation layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network protocol stack or equivalent.","As used herein, the term \u201cauthentication information\u201d refers to information that is used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message.","As used herein, the term \u201cauthentication server\u201d refers to an entity, such as an application server or other node on a network, that provides an authentication service, usually in response to receiving a request for authentication from an authentication client or other entity requesting authentication from the authentication server. The authentication server may perform the authentication itself, or it may provide to the requesting entity information that the requesting entity may use to perform the authentication.","According to another aspect, the subject matter described herein includes a method for application-level authentication of messages in a telecommunications network. The method includes, at a personal communications device for communicating with a telecommunications network, receiving, from an authentication information source that is not a user of the personal communications device, authentication information associated with a sender of a message, and sending a message requiring application-level authentication, the message incorporating the authentication information.","As used herein, the term \u201cpersonal communications device\u201d refers to any device by which a user may communicate with another entity. Example personal communication devices include cell phones, mobile phones, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc.","As used herein, the term \u201cauthentication information source\u201d refers to any source of authentication information, and the term \u201cauthentication information providing entity\u201d refers to any provider of authentication information.","According to yet another aspect, the subject matter described herein includes a system for application-level authentication in a telecommunications network. The system includes a personal communications device configured for sending a message requiring application-level authentication in a telecommunications network, the message including information associated with a sender of the message and incorporating first authentication information associated with the sender of the message, the first authentication information being provided from a source that is not the user of the personal communications device. The system also includes a node in the telecommunications network configured for receiving the message requiring application-level authentication, and, in response to receiving the message, for sending a request for second authentication information associated with the sender. The system also includes an authentication server for receiving the request for second authentication information associated with the sender, and, in response to receiving the request, providing, to the node, the second authentication information associated with the sender. The node, upon receiving the second authentication information, determines the authenticity of the message requiring application-level authentication based on the second authentication information.","According to yet another aspect, the subject matter described herein includes an apparatus for performing application-level authentication. The apparatus includes an authentication information module for providing authentication information and a personal communications device, locally communicatively coupled with the authentication information module, for communicating with a telecommunications network and for receiving authentication information from the authentication information module, generating a message requiring application-level authentication and incorporating the authentication information, and sending the generated message.","As used herein, an entity is \u201ccommunicatively coupled\u201d to another if the entities can communicate messages, data, or other information to and from each other. As used herein, an entity is \u201clocally communicatively coupled\u201d to another if the two entities that are communicatively coupled to each other are in close proximity to each other.","The subject matter described herein for application-level authentication of messages in a telecommunications network may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. As such, the terms \u201cfunction\u201d or \u201cmodule\u201d as used herein refer to hardware, software, and\/or firmware for implementing the feature being described.

In addition, a computer program product that implements the subject matter described herein may be located on a single device or computing platform or may be distributed across multiple devices or computing platforms.","As used herein, the terms \u201cgaming server\u201d, \u201con-line gaming server\u201d, \u201cmultiplayer networked game server\u201d, and \u201cinteractive gaming application\u201d collectively refer to entities that provide access to a game or gaming program. A gaming server may provide gaming services to one or more local gaming clients. An on-line gaming server may provide gaming services to local and\/or remote gaming clients. A multiplayer networked game server may provide gaming clients access to a multiplayer networked game, which may be distributed across multiple game servers, for example. An interactive gaming application may be a game application that does not use the client\/server type of communication.","As used herein, the term \u201cinstant messaging service message\u201d refers to any message sent using a form of real-time communication between two or more people, which may be based on typed text (e.g., short message service, or SMS) and which may involve transmission of media streams (e.g., multimedia messaging service, or MMS), and conveyed via devices connected over a telecommunications network, such as the Internet or mobile communications networks.","As used herein, the term \u201cencryption key\u201d refers to one input of an encryption algorithm used to encrypt or decrypt data. As used herein, the term \u201cencryption parameter\u201d refers generally to any aspect of the encryption algorithm that may be changed, including not only the encryption key value but also the encryption key length, the input block length, the encryption method (such as electronic code book, output block chaining, and cipher block chaining), number or rounds or operations performed, and so on.","As used herein, the term \u201cshort code\u201d refers to telephone numbers, significantly shorter than full telephone numbers, which can also be used to address SMS messages from mobile phones or fixed phones.","As used herein, the term \u201cfob\u201d refers to a physical device that is locally communicatively coupled to another physical device. The fob may be physically connected to and disconnected from the other device in order to effect communication between the two devices, or the fob may communicate to the other device wirelessly with the other device, usually when the two devices are in close proximity to each other.","As used herein, the terms \u201cnetwork provider\u201d and \u201cnetwork carrier\u201d refer to an entity, such as a business entity, that provides access to a telecommunications network or that provides and maintains at least some portion of the telecommunications network.","As used herein, the term \u201capplication\u201d refers to a program, module, functional routine, applet, or other entity that may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof.

The message includes information associated with a sender of the message, such as information identifying the sender of the message. The message also includes first authentication information associated with the sender of the message. For example, the message may include a username and password, a user account number and personal identification number (PIN), and the like. System  may include an authentication-requesting node  for receiving the message, and, in response to receiving the message, for sending a request for second authentication information associated with the sender. System  may include an authentication server  for receiving the request for second authentication information associated with the sender, and, in response to receiving the request, providing the second authentication information to the authentication-requesting node . Upon receiving the second authentication information, node  may determine the authenticity of the message requiring application-level authentication based on the second authentication information. The operation of system  is described in more detail in , below.","Device  may be a mobile communications device, such as a cell phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or a mobile communicating device\/platform, for communicating with network  via an air interface , such as a base station subsystem (BSS) of a GSM network.","The message requiring application-level authentication may take many forms. For example, the message may be a short message service (SMS) message, an unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) message, a multimedia messaging service message, a SIP messaging service message, an instant message, or an application-specific message, such as a hypertext markup language (HTML) message, an extended markup language (XML), or a simple object application protocol (SOAP) message. The message may include a request for a particular service or for a particular transaction. In one example, the message may be a request for a banking transaction, such as a commercial transaction or a request to transfer money to or from a bank account. In another example, the message may contain information conveyed between an on-line gamer and a networked gaming application. For communications utilizing a stateless protocol, each message may require its own authentication. The message may contain text, binary data, or both.","The information associated with the sender of the message requiring application-level authentication may include a personal identifier number (PIN), a username, an international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), a mobile subscriber ISDN (MSISDN) identifier, a mobile identification number (MIN), a uniform resource identifier (URI), and a directory number associated with the sender, or other information that may be used to identify the sender of the message, including message parameters, such as calling party number.","The first and second authentication information associated with the sender may include a PIN, a password, a one-time password (OTP), an encryption key, an encryption parameter, or other information useful for authenticating a sender of a message.","In one embodiment, the first authentication information may be provided to device  by an authentication information providing entity that is locally and communicatively coupled to device , such as a security fob  that is physically connected to device  or connected to device  via Bluetooth, infra-red, near-field communication (NFC) or other wireless connection. For example, security fob  may provide to device  an encryption key  that may be used, for example, to decrypt or encrypt messages sent to or from device .","In an alternate embodiment, the first authentication information may be provided by a network entity for providing the first authentication information in response to requests for authentication information. For example, the first authentication information may be provided by authentication server  in response to a request from device  for the first authentication information.","In another alternate embodiment, the first authentication information may be entered by the user of device . For example, a user of device  who wants to send a message may enter a personal identification number or password via a keypad on the device.","In the embodiment illustrated in , authentication-requesting node  is an application server (AS). In alternate embodiments, the request for authentication information associated with the sender may be issued by other nodes in system . For example, the request for authentication information may come from a session initiation protocol (SIP) application server, a service control point (SCP), a home location register (HLR), a visitor location register (VLR), a gaming server, an on-line gaming server, a multiplayer networked game server, an interactive gaming application, or any other network entity for providing a service or performing a transaction in response to receiving a service or transaction request. The request for authentication information may come from a gateway , such as a mobile switching center (MSC) or a service switching point (SSP), a signal routing node , such as a signal transfer point (STP), a call session control function (CSCF) node, an Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS) node, or other network entity that processes and routes network messages.","The request for authentication information, hereinafter referred to as an authentication query, may be characterized as being \u201ctriggered\u201d or \u201ctriggerless\u201d. An authentication query is said to be \u201ctriggered\u201d if the query is sent in response to a specific request to perform the query. In contrast, an authentication query is said to be \u201ctriggerless\u201d if the query is sent as a result of a determination, in the absence of a specific request to authenticate, that a received message is of a type that requires application-level authentication. Signaling message routing nodes and gateways are logical candidates to perform triggerless application-level authentication, while application servers or other nodes providing a service are logical candidates for performing triggered application-level authentication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","200","102","200","202","204","206","102","208","208","208","210","208","208","210","210","210","112","212","212","212"]},"In the embodiment illustrated in , fob  is an RSA fob provided by the provider of banking application A, and thus may communicate only with banking application A. In one alternate embodiment, a single fob  may operate with all applications. In other alternate embodiments, a separate fob  may be required for each application , for each application provider, for each user, and\/or for each device .","In one embodiment, the authentication information may be generated using an algorithm that uses various types of information as some form of input, such as seed data, parameter data, encryption keys, etc., into the algorithm. The information that may be used as input into the algorithm may include information associated with the sender of the generated message, the authentication information module, and\/or the personal communications device. The information may include the time that the message is generated, the date on which the message is generated, the geographic location of the personal communications device, and\/or the network with which the personal communications device is communicating. The information may include information about the provider of an application existing on the personal communications device, and may include information provided by the sender of the message at the time that the message is generated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","106","102","104","110","1","116","2","118","106","102"]},"The message may incorporate the first authentication information in a variety of ways. For example, some or all of the first authentication information may be included in the message payload. In the scenario described above, the request for a banking transaction may include the user's personal information number (PIN) or password, which may be used to authenticate the user's identity. Some or all of the first authentication information may be used to modify, compress, or encrypt some portion of the message or message payload. For example, the first authentication information may include an encryption key or encryption parameter, which device  may use to encrypt the all or some portion of the message or message payload.","The first authentication information may be provided to device  by a authentication information provisioning module. In one embodiment, the authentication information provisioning module may be a locally communicatively coupled device, such as fob . For example, fob  may provide a one-time password, or OTP , to device  upon request. Fob  may be connected to device  physically, such as via a USB or other bus or serial connection, or via a wireless link, such as an infra-red connection (e.g., IRDA\u00ae), a near-field communications (NFC) connection, or a radio-frequency connection such as a BLUETOOTH\u00ae connection.","In an alternate embodiment, the authentication information provisioning module may be a network entity, such as authentication server . For example, prior to sending the message requiring authentication, device  may request a one-time password from authentication server . In one embodiment, device  may request the first authentication information (e.g., the OTP) by sending an SMS message to a short code. For example, device  may send an SMS message to \u201cSC=100\u201d, where \u201c100\u201d is the short code for authentication server . Device  may receive the one-time password from authentication server  and incorporate it into the message requiring authentication. The message requiring authentication is then sent to node .","At block , a request for second authentication information associated with the user is sent to an authentication server; at block , the second authentication information associated with the user is received from the authentication server; and at block , the authenticity of the message is determined based on the second authentication information. These operations will now be described in more detail.","In one embodiment, node  may send an authentication request to authentication server , where the request for authentication includes both the information associated with the user and the first authentication information associated with the user (, message ). In this embodiment, node  is essentially asking authentication server  to perform the authentication and inform node  of the results. Using the banking example above, node  may send to authentication server  an authentication request that includes the identity of the user and the one-time password provided to device  by fob . The user may be identified by a variety of means, including by PIN, username, international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, mobile subscriber ISDN (MSISDN) number, mobile identification number (MIN), uniform resource identifier (URI), directory number (DN), and so on. Authentication server  may perform the authentication step by using the user's ID to perform a lookup in a table, database, or other data store to find second authentication information associated with the user, and then determine whether the message can be authenticated based on a comparison of the first authentication information to the second authentication information. For example, node  may receive a message that includes the user's PIN. Node  may extract the PIN and MSISDN number from the message and include them in an authentication request to authentication server . Authentication server  may use the MSISDN number to look up the user's PIN from its database. If the PIN from the database matches the PIN sent from the user, authentication server  may return an \u201cauthentication successful\u201d message to node ; otherwise, authentication server  may return an \u201cauthentication failed\u201d message to node  (, message ).","In an alternate embodiment, node  may request authentication information from authentication server , which node  may then use to make its own authentication determination. For example, node  may send to authentication server  a request for authentication information, the request including information identifying the user. Since node  is making the determination of authenticity, the request for authentication information need not include the first authentication information associated with the user. Authentication server  may use the information associated with or identifying the user to perform a lookup as described above to determine the second authentication information associated with the user. Authentication server  may then send the second authentication information to node . In this embodiment, node , rather than authentication server , may compare the first and second authentication information and make a determination of authenticity based on that comparison.","Although the authentication steps described above illustrate authentication interactions between node  and authentication server , the scope of the subject matter described herein is not so limited: the same interactions may occur between another network entity and authentication server . As stated above, a request for authentication (or a request for authentication information) may be generated triggerlessly, in which case the authentication steps described above with respect to node  and authentication server  may be performed by signal routing node  and authentication server , or by gateway  and authentication server , for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","402"]},"As described above, the authentication information may be provided to device  by the user (e.g., by entering data via a key pad, touch screen, microphone, etc.), by a locally communicatively coupled device, such as fob , by a network entity, such as authentication server , or some combination of the above. In one embodiment, fob  continually generates a series of one time passwords, generating a new OTP periodically, such as every 30, 60, or 120 seconds, for example. Once the new OTP is generated, the previous OTP is considered to have expired and can no longer be used for authentication purposes. In one embodiment, fob  may generate the OTPs in a pseudo-random sequence, using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) in hardware or an equivalent function in software. The pseudo-random sequence for each fob is duplicated at authentication server . In these embodiments, the fobs are typically synchronized with the server prior to being distributed to the users, and from the point of synchronization, the fob and server will generate the same pseudo-random sequence of OTPs. The server typically maintains separate LFSRs or equivalent for each fob. The OTP sequence for one fob may be distinct from the OTP sequence for another fob, based on the seed, or initial value, programmed into the LFSRs of the fob and server at the time of synchronization.","In these embodiments, a new OTP is generated periodically, and the old OTP expired, whether or not the OTP is used; fob  will send the value of the current OTP to device  whenever the device  requests an OTP. Once device  receives the current OTP, device  has only a limited time during which the OTP remains valid. If the message requiring authentication does not arrive at node  with enough time for node  to and authentication server  to perform the authentication before the period of validity (e.g., 60 seconds) expires, the message cannot be authenticated. This constraint makes \u201cman in the middle\u201d attacks, in which a malicious party intercepts the message from device , breaks the encryption, decodes the message, and recodes the message using the malicious party's authentication information before sending it on to the destination node , extremely difficult due to the very limited time in which to perform the above-mentioned steps before the OTP expires.","In an alternate embodiment, fob  may contain a large number of one time passwords in a true random sequence, where each OTP can be used only once. For example, fob  may be a large secure flash memory, programmed to provide device  the next available OTP value, after which that entry in memory is cleared or otherwise obfuscated. In these embodiments, authentication server  may store a duplicate copy of the list of OTPs for each fob. When a message requiring authentication is received by authentication server , it may retrieve the next available OTP from its list for the user's fob , and perform the authentication steps as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["112","102","106","108"]},"In one embodiment, authentication server  may include an RSA authentication server RAS , for receiving authentication queries or authentication information queries, indicated on  as \u201cA_QUERY\u201d and \u201cI_QUERY\u201d, respectively, and for returning authentication responses or authentication information responses, indicated on  as \u201cA_RESP\u201d and \u201cI_RESP\u201d, respectively. Authentication server  may store its authentication information in an authentication database DB , which may be a table, a database, a data structure, a memory, or other form of data store, including combinations of the above.","The authentication operations described in blocks , , and  of  may be implemented in various ways. Three different variations are illustrated in , and will now be described in turn. In , the first authentication information is provided by a locally communicatively coupled authentication information providing entity, such as fob .","In one embodiment, authentication server  performs the authentication operation and returns the result to the node that requested authentication, which in this example is node . Referring to , in message , fob  sends a first authentication information associated with a sender to device . In this example, the first authentication information is a one time password OTP. This information may be sent from fob  to device  in response to a request from device , such as in preparation for sending an SMS or USSD message that requires authorization. Device  creates the SMS message , which includes information associated with the user, such as information identifying the user (UID), and the first authentication information associated with the user (OTP). For the purposes of illustration, message  may be a request to perform a brokerage operation involving shares owned by the sender of the message.","Message  is received by node , which extracts the UID and OTP and sends an authentication query (A_QUERY) message , including the extracted UID and OTP, to authentication server . Within authentication server , RAS  receives the A_QUERY and may query DB  (message ) to determine if there is any authentication information associated with the user identified by UID. RAS  may receive a response from DB  (message ) containing second authentication information (OTP) associated with the sender.","Authentication server  may determine the authenticity of the message requiring authentication (message ) based on the relationship between the first and second authentication information. For example, authentication server  may compare OTP and OTP (block ), and if they are the same, authentication server  may determine that message  is authentic. Authentication server  may then send to node  an authentication response message, such as A_RESP message , to indicate whether the authentication was successful or not successful-e.g., a \u201cgo\u201d or a \u201cno-go\u201d (GO\/NG). Based on the authentication response message , node  may choose to allow or deny the brokerage transaction (block ). For example, node  may allow the transaction if the A_RESP message indicated a \u201cGO\u201d and deny the transaction if the A_RESP message indicated a \u201cNG\u201d.","In another embodiment, authentication server  provides authentication information to node , and node  performs the authentication operation. Referring again to , the descriptions of messages  and  are the same as for messages  and , respectively, and will not be repeated herein.

If RAS  receives second authentication information, e.g., OTP, from DB , authentication server  may send an authentication information response (I_RESP) message  to node .","Node  may determine the authenticity of the message requiring authentication (message ) based on the relationship between the first and second authentication information. For example, node  may compare OTP and OTP, and if they are the same, node  may determine that message  is authentic (block ) and subsequently allow or deny the transaction (block ).","In yet another embodiment, the first authentication information is used to encrypt the payload of the message requiring authentication. In this example, the payload of the message includes private information, such as the user's PIN. The description for message  is the same as for message , and will not be repeated herein. In preparation for a financial transaction, a user may be required to provide additional identifying information. For example, an application  may prompt the user to enter the user's PIN. This operation is illustrated in message . In one embodiment, the first authentication information, e.g., OTP, may be an encryption key used by an encryption algorithm to encrypt all or part of the message payload. In this example, the user's PIN is encrypted using OTP as a key, as indicated by the notation \u201cOTP{PIN}\u201d, and sent as part of an SMS message . As in examples above, SMS message  also includes information associated with a user, such as information identifying a user UID.","The descriptions of messages , , , and , are the same as for messages , , , and , respectively, and will not be repeated herein.

Message  is a response message sent from RAS  to device  and containing the first authentication information, which in this example is a one time password, OTP. As stated above, the first authentication information returned by RAS  may take other forms, and is not limited to one time passwords.","Message  contains additional first authentication information provided by the user, such as a PIN, an account number, another password, etc. The first authentication information may be incorporated into a message requiring authentication  sent from device  to node . For example, message  may include a payload containing the user's PIN encrypted using OTP as an encryption key or parameter. Upon receipt of message , node  may generate an A_QUERY  including the information identifying the sender of the message requiring authentication  UID and the encrypted payload OTP{PIN}. RAS  may use the UID or other information identifying the sender to retrieve second authentication information associated with the sender OTP from authentication database DB  (messages  and ), and use OTP to attempt to decrypt the encrypted payload OTP{PIN} (block ). If the decryption is successful, e.g., generating a valid PIN or message (block ), RAS  may send an A_RESP message  indicating a \u201cGO\u201d. If the decryption is unsuccessful, or if the resulting PIN or message is invalid, RAS  may send an A_RESP message  indicating a \u201cNG\u201d. In block , node  may allow or deny the requested transaction based on the results of the authentication operation.","In one embodiment, the message requiring authentication may be a request for a transaction. In this scenario, the result of authentication will determine whether or not the requested transaction will be allowed. In alternate embodiments, the message requiring authentication may be of a nature such that the result of authentication informs other determinations, such as whether or not the message will be delivered to its destination, whether or not the contents of the message will be recorded (e.g., in an event log), whether or not the sender or receiver of the message will be billed for the message, etc. For example, an unauthorized message may be allowed to proceed but may cause a higher level of scrutiny to be given to subsequent messages from that sender.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","106","106","102","104","110","110","1","116","116","2","106","118","102","104","110","106","116","118","108"]},"In one embodiment, signal routing node  includes a triggerless SMS authentication function , which intercepts messages, determines whether a message requires authentication, and if so, performs an authentication function. SMS authentication function  may maintain a table, database, data structure, or other data store which it may use to determine whether a message requires authentication. In one embodiment, SMS authentication function  may maintain an authentication table  for determining whether authentication is required for a particular message based on message characteristics, such as message type, sending party ID, receiving party ID, and so forth. For example, SMS authentication function  may intercept the Forward_SM message, determine that the message type is a mobile application part (MAP) SMS message, that the directory number of the party sending the message is \u201c9193803814\u201d and that directory number of the receiving party is a short code, SC=100. SMS authentication function  may use these and\/or any other message characteristic to perform a lookup into authentication table . In this example, SMS authentication function  may find a matching entry in authentication table  and determine that authentication is required (e.g., the value of the \u201cObtain RSA Key\u201d field in authentication table =\u201cYES\u201d). If SMS authentication function  determines that the message requires authentication, SMS authentication function  may send a query message (, message ) to authentication server . The query message may include information identifying the sender of the message, such as the user's PIN.","In one embodiment, authentication server  may be an RSA Authority, which may send a query response (, message ) to SMS authentication function . The response may include first authentication information associated with the sender, such as an RSA key. SMS authentication function  may then insert the first authentication information, i.e., the RSA key, to the original Forward_SM message, and forward the modified Forward_SM message to node  (, message ). Alternatively, SMS authentication function  may create a new Forward_SM message (, message ) including some information from the original Forward_SM message (, message ) plus the first authentication information (the RSA key), and send the new message to node .","Upon receipt of the Forward_SM message from SMS authentication function , node  may extract the first authentication information, such as the PIN and RSA key, and send an authorization query (, message ) to authentication server . Authentication server  may send an authentication response message (, message ) to node . For example, authentication server  may use the PIN to retrieve the RSA key associated with the sender and compare the RSA key retrieved to the RSA key included in the authentication query (, message ). If the RSA keys match, authentication server  may send an authentication response (, message ) indicating authentication success; else the authentication response may indicate failure to authenticate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["108","118","3","4","118","3","4","5","5","6","7"]},"In alternate embodiments, authentication server  could be co-located or integrated with another entity on the network. For example, authentication server  could be co-located with an SMS gateway, a USSD gateway, a session initiation protocol (SIP) server, a call session control function (CSCF) node, a signaling gateway, or other entity that processes messages in a telecommunications network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["118","118","900","902","904","900","902","904","906","906","900","902","904","906"]},"LIM  includes various functions for sending and receiving signaling messages over SS signaling links. In the illustrated example, LIM  includes a message transfer part (MTP) level  and  function , an I\/O buffer , a gateway screening (GWS) function , a discrimination function , a distribution function , and a routing function . MTP level  and  function  performs MTP level  and  functions, such as error detection, error correction, and sequencing of signaling messages. I\/O buffer  stores inbound signaling messages before the messages are processed by higher layers. I\/O buffer  also stores outbound signaling messages waiting to be transmitted over a signaling link by MTP level  and  function . Gateway screening function  screens inbound signaling messages based on destination point code and, optionally, based on originating point code to determine whether the messages should be allowed into the network. Discrimination function  analyzes the destination point code in each received signaling message to determine whether the signaling message should be processed by an internal processing module within node  or whether the message should be routed over an outbound signaling link. Discrimination function  forwards messages that are to be internally processed to distribution function . Discrimination function  forwards messages that are to be routed over an outbound signaling link to routing function .","Distribution function  distributes messages that are identified as requiring internal processing to the appropriate internal processing module. For example, distribution function  may forward SCCP messages to database services module  for SCCP processing. Routing function  routes signaling messages that are addressed to point codes other than the point code of node . For example, routing function  may forward messages to another link interface module (not shown in ) or to data node  for transmission over an outbound signaling link.","DCM  includes various functions for sending and receiving SS messages over IP signaling links. In , these functions include a physical layer function , a network layer function , a transport layer function , an adaptation layer function , and SS MTP functions - as described with regard to LIM . Physical layer function  may be any suitable physical layer function for sending and receiving frames that encapsulate network layer packets. In one exemplary implementation, physical layer function  may be implemented using an Ethernet transceiver. Network layer function  may be implemented using Internet protocol, such as IPv or IPv. Transport layer function  may be implemented using any suitable transport layer protocol. Examples of transport protocols suitable for use with embodiments of the subject matter described herein include user datagram protocol (UDP), transmission control protocol (TCP), and stream control transmission protocol (SCTP). Adaptation layer function  may be implemented using any suitable adaptation layer for sending SS messages over IP. Examples of adaptation layers suitable for use with the subject matter described herein include MUA, MPA, SUA, and TALI, as described in the correspondingly named IETF Internet drafts and RFCs. The remaining functions of DCM  are the same as those described with regard to LIM . Hence, a description thereof will not be repeated herein.","DSM  includes various functions and databases for processing signaling messages. In the illustrated example, DSM  incorporates the SMS authentication function  and associated authentication table , and also the functions of authentication server .","Service selection function  receives messages from the interface processors and determines the type of service required for each message. For example, service selection function  may determine whether further screening of messages is required or whether the messages are simply to be global title translated and routed. In one embodiment, service selection function  may forward all CAP, INAP, SMS, or USSD messages to target message screening function . For example, target message screening function  may identify CAP or INAP queries as potentially needing to be directed to authentication server . Similarly, target message screening function  may identify SMS or USSD messages as targeted message types that should be directed to SMS authentication function  to determine whether the message requires authentication. The functions of authentication server  and SMS authentication function  are described above, and will not be repeated herein.","It will be understood that various details of the subject matter described herein may be changed without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein.
