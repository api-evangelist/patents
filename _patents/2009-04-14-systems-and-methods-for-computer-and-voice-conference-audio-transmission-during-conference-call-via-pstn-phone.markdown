{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/423,451 filed concurrently and entitled \u201cSystem and methods for computer and voice conference audio transmission during conference call via VoIP device,\u201d by Albert Alexandrov et al. and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","A conference call is a telephone call between two or more callers or users (referred to herein as a group of participants) at geographically distributed locations, which allows each participant to be able to speak to, and listen to, other participant(s) simultaneously. A conference call among a plurality of participants can be conducted via a voice conference bridge or centralized server, which connects numerous endpoint devices (VoIP devices or PSTN telephones) associated with the participants using appropriate communication protocols and mixes the various incoming voice streams from the plurality of participants either at the endpoint devices or at the conference bridge.","A Web conferencing tool enables the group of participants to organize and attend meetings online during a conference call by allowing a presenter in the group of the participants at the conference call to run a computer application or present a material via a hosting device and share the application or material with the rest of the group (the viewers) to view in real time. For non-limiting examples, such web conferencing tool enables the presenter to perform live demonstrations in real time, collaborate on documents with colleagues, and provide training to customers and employees.","During the Web conferencing, an outgoing audio stream of the material being presented and\/or the application being run via the hosting device (also referred to herein as the computer audio) may often need to be transmitted to the conference in addition to, and in separation from, an outgoing voice conference audio stream of the presenter or viewer speaking at the conference call (also referred to herein as the presenter or viewer audio, respectively). In the meantime, an incoming voice audio stream needs to be received from the rest of the group speaking at the conference call (also referred to herein as the voice conference audio). When there are more than one person need to listen to and\/or to speak at the conference call at the same location as the presenter or the viewer, the presenter or viewer may have to \u201copen up\u201d the conference call by using a separate speaker associated with the hosting device. Consequently, the computer audio may leak from the speaker to the PSTN phone together with the presenter or viewer audio, causing deterioration in the audio quality of the conference call. Conversely, it is important to make sure that the two outgoing audio streams\u2014the computer audio and the presenter or viewer audio are transmitted separately without interfering with one another.","The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent upon a reading of the specification and a study of the drawings.","The approach is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to \u201can\u201d or \u201cone\u201d or \u201csome\u201d embodiment(s) in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.","A new approach is proposed that contemplates systems and methods to support canceling audio streams leaked from a speaker to a PSTN device so that only the audio stream of a presenter or viewer speaking at a conference call (presenter or viewer audio) is transmitted. Here, the audio streams being canceled includes the computer audio stream of an application being run or a material being presented online during a web conference (computer audio). The voice audio stream of a presenter or viewer is then transmitted in addition to the computer audio stream, clean from any other audio stream of echoes or feedbacks captured by the hosting device during the conference call. Such an approach enables \u201cclean\u201d transmission of presenter\/viewer audio without mixing of audio streams from other sources during a web conference at which open speakers are used (in place of an integrated headset) and multiple audio streams are captured, leaked into, or mixed with one another.","As used herein, \u201ccanceling\u201d means suppressing and removing with the best effort from one audio stream the echo and feedback of another. The resulting audio stream after such cancellation effort is considered as \u201cclean\u201d even if certain residue of the echo and feedback may possibly remain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1(","i":"a"},"In the example of ), the system  includes hosts (hosting devices)  deployed for each of a presenter and a viewer at a conference call, wherein various components running on each host  include at least an optional display component , and a computer audio engine ; and a voice conference bridge  running on a separate host.","As used herein, the term \u201cengine\u201d, \u201ccomponent\u201d, or \u201cbridge\u201d refers to a software, firmware, hardware, or other component that is used to effectuate a purpose. The engine, component, or bridge will typically include software instructions that are stored in non-volatile memory (also referred to as secondary memory). When the software instructions are executed, at least a subset of the software instructions is loaded into memory (also referred to as primary memory) by a processor. The processor then executes the software instructions in memory. The processor may be a shared processor, a dedicated processor, or a combination of shared or dedicated processors. A typical program will include calls to hardware components (such as I\/O devices), which typically requires the execution of drivers. The drivers may or may not be considered part of the engine, but the distinction is not critical.","In the example of ), the host  can be a computing device, a communication device, a storage device, or any electronic device capable of running a software component. For non-limiting examples, a computing device can be but is not limited to, a laptop PC, a desktop PC, a tablet PC, an iPod, a PDA, or a server machine. A storage device can be but is not limited to a hard disk drive, a flash memory drive, or any portable storage device. A communication device can be but is not limited to a mobile phone.","In the example of ), the optional display component  enables the presenter to display, manipulate, and share an application he\/she runs or a material he\/she presents at the conference call and the viewer to hear or view the application run or material presented by the presenter. Here, the display component  can be a monitor, a screen, or any other displaying device associated with the host  known to one skilled in the art. The application or material can be any type of digital document, application, or program that produces sound and\/or displayable on the display component  of the host , including the entire displayable desktop of the host .","In the example of ), the computer audio engine  is a software component that utilizes one or more sound capturing devices of the host , such as a sound card or on the host , a separate physical device of a microphone and\/or a speaker, to capture and\/or to playback audio streams by invoking Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to the sound capturing devices, such as the Window APIs.","In the example of ), the voice conference bridge  is operable to provide conferencing services over a communication network by establishing a conference call among a group of participants including at least a presenter and one or more viewers, receiving and mixing communication (voice, video, and\/or data) signals generated by each of the group of participants, and providing the mixed signals to each of the group of participants. Here, each of the group of participants is able to both simultaneously listen to and to speak to the rest of the participants in the group while listening and\/or watching the application or material presented on the display component  of the host  during the conference call. Here, each of the group of participants may represent a group of people gathering at a geographically distributed location, such as a conference room or office, where everyone in the group can listen to or speak to the conference call via a telephony endpoint device.","In the example of ), the hosts  and the voice conference bridge  can communicate and interact with each other via communication interfaces (not shown) following certain communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP protocol, over a network (not shown). Here, the network can be a communication network based on certain communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP protocol. Such network can be but is not limited to, internet, intranet, wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN), wireless network, Bluetooth, WiFi, and mobile communication network. The physical connections of the network and the communication protocols are well known to those of skill in the art.","While the system  depicted in ) is in operation, a presenter and viewer participate in a conference call by speaking a presenter or viewer audio stream to the conference and listening to conference audio from other participants at the conference call through the voice conference bridge  via their associated PSTN phones. A first host  is associated with the presenter during the conference call, where the optional display component  of the first host enables the presenter to display, manipulate, and share a presentation material or an application at the conference call. While the application is being run and\/or the material is being presented, a computer audio engine  of the first host  provides an audio stream of the application or material to one or more speakers and transmits the computer audio stream to a viewer at the conference call over a separate channel. During the conference call, the computer audio may leak from the speakers to the PSTN phone associated with the presenter and a mix of the computer audio and the presenter audio is captured by the voice conference bridge  as a result. For transmission of clean presenter audio to the conference call, the computer audio engine  may further provide the computer audio stream to other engines or components, such as the voice conference bridge , for the purpose of canceling the computer audio leaked from the speakers through the PSTN phone associated with the presenter from the mix of the presenter audio and the computer video captured by the voice conference bridge . Correspondingly, a second host  is associated with the viewer during the conference call, where an optional display component  of the second host receives and displays the presentation material or application originated by the presenter to the viewer at the conference call. While the material is being shared with the viewer, the computer audio engine  of the second host accepts the incoming computer audio stream for the viewer to listen to and feeds the computer audio to one or more speakers at the second host . Similar to the presenter side, the computer audio may leak from the speakers to the PSTN phone associated with the viewer and a mix of the computer audio and the viewer audio is captured by the voice conference bridge  as a result. For transmission of clean viewer audio to the conference call, the voice conference bridge  cancels the computer audio leaked from the speakers through the PSTN phone associated with the viewer from the mix of the viewer audio and the computer video captured by the voice conference bridge .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2(","FIG. 1("],"i":["a","a"]},"In the example of ), the flowchart  starts at block  where a presenter is enabled to manipulate, share, and optionally display a presentation material or an application at a conference call.
