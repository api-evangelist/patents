title: Water parachute for surface vessel motion impedance
abstract: A projectile includes an instant adhesive rubber directly connected to a high tensile strength rope and a water parachute. The projectile can be aimed at, for example, the front one-third of the vessel. Upon impact, an energetic material, such as lead azide, can be initiated to push the rubber onto the vessel and simultaneously deploy the water parachute. The parachute may be weighted to cause the parachute to submerge in the water. A tension generated by the vessel dragging the water parachute would arrest the motion and limit the speed and mobility of the vessel without significant damage to the surface vessel or occupants.

While generally effective at stopping small surface craft, all are limited in terms of flexibility due to their small area of effect. Stationary barriers take time to set up, restrict both desirable and undesirable maritime traffic, and are, by nature, passive defenses. Deployable nets, either shot from some launching apparatus or dropped into the water by a boat or aircraft, have limited range, cover a limited area, and require the target vessel to collide with the nets in order to be effective.","There is a need for an improved ranged vessel arrestment system and method for arresting the motion and limiting the speed and mobility of a surface vessel.","According to one aspect of the current invention, a vessel arrestment system comprises an adhesive; a rope attached at a first end thereof to the adhesive; a water parachute attached at a second, opposite end of the rope; and a projectile housing the adhesive, rope and parachute, the projectile adapted to be externally propelled or self-propelled toward a vessel to impede its motion.","According to another aspect of the current invention, a vessel arrestment system for impeding motion of a surface vessel comprises an instant bonding adhesive; a rope attached at a first end thereof to the adhesive; a parachute attached at a second, opposite end of the rope; one or more weights attached to the water parachute; a projectile housing the adhesive, rope and parachute, the projectile adapted to be externally propelled or self-propelled toward the surface vessel; and an energetic (compressed air, sodium azide or any other chemical reaction that can produce thrust to both adhere the adhesive compound to vessel and deploy the water parachute) system to deploy the parachute from the projectile.","According to a further aspect of the current invention, a method for impeding motion of a surface vessel comprises directing a projectile toward a hull of the surface vessel; instantly bonding a first end of a rope contained in the projectile upon impact of the projectile with the hull of the surface vessel; and releasing a water parachute from the projectile, the water parachute attached to a second, opposite end of the rope.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular assembly embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention: the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.","Broadly, the current invention provides a projectile that includes an instant adhesive rubber directly connected to a high tensile strength rope and a water parachute. (Alternatively, the properties of the rope can be designed to yield adhesion to the vessel upon contact.) The projectile can be aimed at, for example, the front one-third of the vessel. Upon impact, an energetic material, such as lead azide, can be initiated to push the rubber into the vessel and simultaneously deploy the water parachute. The parachute may be weighted to cause the parachute to submerge in the water. A tension generated by the vessel dragging the water parachute would arrest the motion and limit the speed and mobility of the vessel without significant damage to the surface vessel or occupants.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , a vessel arrestment system  may include a projectile  (within the dash envelope), whose payload is an adhesive , a weighted parachute , and a rope  connecting the adhesive  with the parachute . The rope  may be a high tensile strength tether, such as a Kevlar\u00ae or Spectra\u00ae rope.","The adhesive  may be a compounded natural rubber that provides a strong, water-impervious spontaneous bond to a hull  of a surface vessel , such as a trawler yacht as shown. A release mechanism (such as a shock-sensitive spring-mounted sabot not shown) would release (i.e., unfurl) the rope from the projectile and deploy the parachute , while weights  attached to the parachute  would ensure that the parachute  deploys clear of the propeller of the surface vessel . The parachute  may produce a constant torque on the surface vessel , causing a continuous change in heading while severely limiting the velocity of the vessel  from asymmetric drag, providing an effective mobility-kill. The projectile  could be either kinetic (e.g., gun-launched) or have its own propulsive mechanism  (e.g., rocket motor). Guidance systems (not shown) may provide a high level of accuracy, but are not necessary.","To use the projectile  to impede the surface vessel , typically a vessel that is 25 feet in length or smaller, the projectile  may be projected toward or self-powered toward the surface vessel . The impact of the projectile  on the hull  of the surface vessel  may cause one end of the rope  to be affixed to the hull . The energetic system may then cause the projectile  to disintegrate into its components, enabling the rope  to be released and the parachute  to be deployed.","The vessel arrestment system  may be used in, for example, security applications, such as water patrol, port security, and the like, as a non-destructive technique to slow down surface vessels.","In an alternate embodiment of the current invention, netting may be deployed by the projectile instead of the parachute. The netting may be of sufficient size and the rope may be of sufficient length to permit the netting to entangle the propeller of the vessel. In other embodiments, the projectile may include both the netting and the parachute.","While  show the projectile impacting the hull of the surface vessel above the surface of the water , the projectile may be designed to impact the hull of the surface vessel either above or below the water line.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed; obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
