title: Method and apparatus for providing rule-based recommendations
abstract: An approach is provided for providing rule-based recommendations. The approach involves a processing of one or more user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags and/or other context information. The approach further involves a determination of one or more weighting factors of one or more of the user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags and other context information. The approach also involves an application of one or more rule sets that bases a determination of a recommendation on the weighting factor. The approach, then, generates one or more recommendations.

One area of development has been the use of recommendation systems to provide users with suggestions or recommendations for content, items, etc. available within the services and\/or related applications (e.g., recommendations regarding people, places, or things of interest such as companions, restaurants, stores, vacations, movies, video on demand, books, songs, software, articles, news, images, etc.). For example, a typical recommendation system may suggest an item to a user based on a prediction that the user would be interested in the item\u2014even if that user has never considered the item before\u2014by comparing the user's preferences to one or more reference characteristics. Such recommendation systems historically have been based on collaborative filters that rely on often large amounts of user data (e.g., historical rating information, use history, etc.). However, such user data often is not available or has not been collected with respect to a particular service or application. Accordingly, service providers and device manufacturers face significant technical challenges to enabling development and generation of recommendation systems and models which are not based on having large sets of user data.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for providing rule-based recommendations that do not depend on collaborative filters and\/or extensive user data.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises processing and\/or facilitating a processing of one or more user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags, other context information or any combination thereof. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, a determination of one or more weighting factors of one or more of the user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags and other context information. The method further comprises causing, at least in part, an application of one or more rule sets that bases a determination of a recommendation on the weighting factor. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, generation of one or more recommendations.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to process and\/or facilitate a processing of one or more user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags, other context information or any combination thereof. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, a determination of one or more weighting factors of one or more of the user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags and other context information. The apparatus is further caused to cause, at least in part, an application of one or more rule sets that bases a determination of a recommendation on the weighting factor. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, generation of one or more recommendations","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carries one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to process and\/or facilitate a processing of one or more user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags, other context information or any combination thereof. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, a determination of one or more weighting factors of one or more of the user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags and other context information. The apparatus is further caused to cause, at least in part, an application of one or more rule sets that bases a determination of a recommendation on the weighting factor. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, generation of one or more recommendations","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for processing and\/or facilitating a processing of one or more user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags, other context information or any combination thereof. The apparatus also comprises means for causing, at least in part, a determination of one or more weighting factors of one or more of the user profile tags, context tags, content tags, channel tags and other context information. The apparatus further comprises means for causing, at least in part, an application of one or more rule sets that bases a determination of a recommendation on the weighting factor. The apparatus also comprises means for causing, at least in part, generation of one or more recommendations.","In addition, for various example embodiments of the invention, the following is applicable: a method comprising facilitating a processing of and\/or processing (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on (including derived at least in part from) any one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating access to at least one interface configured to allow access to at least one service, the at least one service configured to perform any one or any combination of network or service provider methods (or processes) disclosed in this application.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating creating and\/or facilitating modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based, at least in part, on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods or processes disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising creating and\/or modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based at least in part on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","In various example embodiments, the methods (or processes) can be accomplished on the service provider side or on the mobile device side or in any shared way between service provider and mobile device with actions being performed on both sides.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for providing rule-based recommendations are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to use an intelligent filter and processing engine for providing rule-based recommendations. More specifically, the system  determines or generates one or more profile tags, context tags, channel tags and\/or other context information, determines a weighting factor for each of the tags, and applies a rule set for making a recommendation based on the weighted tags.","As used in the descriptions of the various embodiments described herein, the term \u201ccontext\u201d refers to data that indicates the state of a device or the inferred state of a user of the device, or both. The states indicated by the context are, for instance, described according to one or more \u201ccontext parameters\u201d including time, recent applications running on the device, recent World Wide Web pages presented on the device, keywords in current communications (such as emails, SMS messages, IM messages), current and recent locations of the device (e.g., from a global positioning system, GPS, or cell tower identifier), movement, activity (e.g., eating at a restaurant, drinking at a bar, watching a movie at a cinema, watching a video at home or at a friend's house, exercising at a gymnasium, travelling on a business trip, travelling on vacation, etc.), emotional state (e.g., happy, busy, calm, rushed, etc.), interests (e.g., music type, sport played, sports watched), contacts, or contact groupings (e.g., family, friends, colleagues, etc.), among others, or some combination.","In one embodiment, the rule sets are determined by extracting (e.g., via a semantic analysis) language tokens or tags from content information (e.g., a general web page, document, etc.) associated with a particular context. Accordingly, when an application requests recommendation information, the system  can determine a target context or context combination (e.g., the context or contexts of interest specified in the request) and then obtain the corresponding rule sets for generating the recommendation information.","In one embodiment, the rule sets can be used to select the language tokens or tags that are associated with a given context parameter and context. The system  can then search a database (e.g., a content database) associated with the application to provide recommendation information to the application or a user of the application. In one embodiment, the system  advantageously separates the rule sets from the data over which the recommendations are made. Accordingly, the system  can be used to generate recommendation information for any number of applications because the rule sets enable the system  to identify general key words associated with a given context parameter and context. The key words are then used to query the application for information that is related to the tokens or tags. The results of the query are provided as recommendations. In other words, the rules sets are used to derive the \u201cnature\u201d (e.g., topics) of what is to be recommended. The \u201cnature\u201d then decides the actual data to recommend by querying a separate database or source.","For example, if a context tag is related to a location such as \u201cNew City,\u201d then a context or context type associated with the node can be a \u201cbus station.\u201d The system  can then semantically analyze documents related to the bus station within the New City (e.g., newspaper articles, bus station information brochures, search histories) to extract or determine language tokens that are, for instance, most commonly or most closely associated with the location (e.g., a context parameter) and a given context (e.g., bus station) within the context parameter. For example, common language tokens that arise may include: \u201cnewsstand,\u201d \u201cfast food,\u201d \u201ctime tables,\u201d and the like). When an application such as a mapping application requests a recommendation with respect to the bus station in New City, the system  locates the rule set associated with the \u201cNew City\u201d and \u201cbus station.\u201d On applying the rule set, the system  outputs \u201cnewsstand\u201d and \u201cfast food\u201d as language tokens related to the New City bus station. In one embodiment, these tokens are then used to query a database of the mapping application for points of interest related to the tokens. The resulting points of interest are then provided as recommendations to the mapping application.","By way of example, in one embodiment, external users can contribute to the rule sets by specifying one or more of the language tokens or tags from which the rule sets are built. The users may also personalize the rule sets by specifying particular contexts of interests (e.g., places of interests, favorite or common activities, etc.) for higher weighting factors. The approach allows dynamic editing of rule sets (addition, removal, modifications, etc.) that the recommender is able to process thereby allowing an evolutionary and adaptive recommendation behavior. While weighting factors may be customizable, for example, this is no need for user ratings data. Rule sets may be based on domain understanding, and utilize content tags (that may be extracted through machine learning processes). Further, multiple rule sets may be linked or combined to address different context scenarios that may not be a known priority, for example. Tags for context may be location specific tags or time tags. Tags may also be based on user preferences. The approach may manage all data independent of a recommendation engine or a recommendation model. Rather, all data may be accessed through a Data Access Objects (DAO) module.","In certain embodiments, a matcher module calls the recommender to provide recommendation tokens for a particular session. The recommender fetches all needed tags through DAO. A profile engine works independently and updates user profile tags and weighting factors. The recommender fetches updated tags and related weighting factors. In this embodiment, the recommender logic can be represented as XML. This representation makes changes to logic possible. In certain embodiments, inputs to the recommender, for example, are: resolved location, resolved time, user id, resolved contexts (or context data that can be resolved through DAO). While the recommender may take a recommendation input object as an input, the input object may be extended later.","In certain embodiments, the recommender receives tags from: user profile tags provided by the profile engine, and context tags comprising: location specific tags provided by location resolver, time specific tags provided by time resolver, and other contexts provided by respective resolvers. In certain embodiments, the recommender also receives tags (e.g., channel tags) that semantically describe a channel for which content is to be recommended. More specifically, a recommendation channel may be a more finely grained category of interest that specifies one or more tokens and\/or one or more rules applying those tokens to generate recommendations. For example, a Restaurant recommendation channel might have tokens: restaurant, breakfast, dinner, menu, a la carte, dining, lunch, etc. Content matching the tokens may be a restaurant website that qualifies as an entry in the Restaurant channel. In some embodiment, the tags that define that channel may be given additional weightage and combined with contextual and preference tags for content search.","In certain embodiments, the recommendation engine fetches all needed tags from a database. A matcher module drives the recommendation engine providing it with the needed data to fetch appropriate tags from the database. Data, as discussed above, thereby is not integrated with the recommendation logic. A profiler provides a continuous stream of modified tag sets for each user through a process that is independent of the recommender process. The profiler monitors user behavior and either modifies, removes or adds new tags to the user database along with weights indicating level of preference for each tag. The recommender takes in a user id and fetches all current tags that are specific to that user from the user database. Each tag, be it from context sources (i.e., separate table in database) or from user tables may have a weight associated with it. The weight could be in a range that is between 0 and 1, except in user profile tags where weights can be negative. In addition to the weight for each tag, each type of tag will have an addition or a multiplier (typically a whole number) that is indicated declaratively through a separate XML rule logic declaration. This number is also applied to the individual weights when providing a set of tags back to the matcher.","In certain embodiments, the recommender builds three sets of tags that are output to the matcher:\n\n","Once the above tag sets are prepared, the recommender packages them into a particular structure for output. The output may contain each segment where primary context would be explicitly provided where applicable. In some embodiments, aspects of an explicit profile may be included in the package such as language preferences when providing this to a matcher module.","Even though the recommender and matcher are separate modules, both entities function together to produce the recommendations. The recommender recommends tags and computed weights which are then used by the matcher. The matcher fetches content from the database using the recommended tags as search criterion. The tag weights are then used to arrive at a metric score for each content that is fetched. The top N content with top metrics are then sent to the client.","The recommender, as discussed above, outputs three sets of tags. One set provides context-specific tags with statements on what the associated context is. This can be location, time or other context. The second set may provide profile specific tags while third are a combination of profile and context tags. The matcher will use each of these sets to build metrics. The top N matches are taken and then checked whether they are from context only, preference only or context and preference combined. This information is also embedded in the response that is sent back to the user.","In certain embodiments, the system  can localize or translate the recommendation information from its native language to a target language. In one approach, the system  can localize information by performing a translation of the one or more language tokens and\/or results of the query based on the language tokens into the target language. In addition or alternatively, the system  can extract a target-language specific set of tokens from related content documents that are already in the target language.","As noted previously, defining rule sets for generating recommendations as described herein enables the system  to provide recommendations that can be adapted to any number or combination of contexts without need for user data models typical of traditional collaborative approaches to generating recommendations.","As shown in , the system  comprises a user equipment (UE)  or multiple UEs -(or UEs ) having connectivity to a recommendation platform  via a communication network . A UE  may include or have access to an application  (or applications ), which may comprise of client programs, services, or the like that may utilize a system to provide recommendations to users. As users access the applications  on their respective UEs , the recommendation platform  may generate and\/or provide recommendation information (e.g., data indicating how a user might rate an item) for the applications  according to the approach described herein. As described above, the recommendation information is generated according to a one or more rule sets defined for a given context or combination of contexts. Because of the system  uses rule sets to generate recommendations, the system  need not rely only user data such as historical content rating information that is typically collected by, for instance, asking a user to rate an item on a scale of one through ten, asking a user to create a list of items that the user likes, observing items that the user views, obtaining a list of items that the user purchases, analyzing the user's viewing times of particular items, etc. Instead, the recommendation platform  may provide the applications  with content recommendations even when content rating information or other collaborative data are not available to produce intelligent recommendations. In one embodiment, the recommendation platform  may include or be connected to a profile database  in order to access or store user preferences and other setting related to requesting, generating, or otherwise obtaining rule-based recommendations. By way of example, the preferences or settings of the recommendation platform  include: default language settings, search settings, references to external search engines, priority of tokens or tags, rule processing options, translation settings, input settings, etc.","As shown, the UEs  and the recommendation platform  also have connectivity to a service platform  hosting one or more respective services\/applications -(also collectively referred to as services\/applications ), and content providers -(also collectively referred to as content providers ). In one embodiment, the services\/applications -comprise the server-side components corresponding to the applications -operating within the UEs . In one embodiment, the service platform , the services\/applications -, the application -, or a combination thereof have access to, provide, deliver, etc. one or more items associated with the content providers -. In other words, content and\/or items are delivered from the content providers -to the applications -or the UEs  through the service platform  and\/or the services\/applications -","In some cases, a developer of the services\/applications -and\/or the applications -may request that the recommendation platform  generate one or more recommendations with respect to content or items obtained from the content providers -. The developer may, for instance, transmit the request on behalf of the application  and\/or the services\/applications  to the recommendation platform  for the purpose of generating recommendation information and\/or the rule sets, contexts, etc. After receiving the request for recommendation information, the recommendation platform  may then retrieve the rule sets, language tokens, and\/or the like from one or more profiles associated with the application , the services\/applications , one or more other applications, or a combination thereof. The recommendation platform  may further generate the content recommendation based at least in part on the retrieved rule sets, etc. Because the content recommendation information may be derived from one or more rules that apply via an agnostic or nonspecific recommendation model, the same rule sets are applicable to any number of the application , the services\/applications  and\/or one or more other applications. Thus, even if in the absence of user data, the recommendation platform  is able to provide recommendation information that represents accurate predictions with respect to suggesting items of interest to users for a requesting application  and\/or services\/applications .","By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UE , the recommendation platform , and the application  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application headers (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) as defined by the OSI Reference Model.","In one embodiment, the application  and the corresponding service platform , services -, the content providers -, or a combination thereof interact according to a client-server model. It is noted that the client-server model of computer process interaction is widely known and used. According to the client-server model, a client process sends a message including a request to a server process, and the server process responds by providing a service. The server process may also return a message with a response to the client process. Often the client process and server process execute on different computer devices, called hosts, and communicate via a network using one or more protocols for network communications. The term \u201cserver\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that provides the service, or the host computer on which the process operates. Similarly, the term \u201cclient\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that makes the request, or the host computer on which the process operates. As used herein, the terms \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d refer to the processes, rather than the host computers, unless otherwise clear from the context. In addition, the process performed by a server can be broken up to run as multiple processes on multiple hosts (sometimes called tiers) for reasons that include reliability, scalability, and redundancy, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","201","103","201","107","113","113"],"i":["a","m. "]},"In one embodiment, with respect to creating the rule sets, the recommendation engine  receives configuration information specifying one or more context parameters (e.g., location, time, activity, or a combination thereof) from a context resolver , a time resolver  and\/or a location resolver  from which to generate a recommendation.","In certain embodiments, the one or more context parameters may be combined to provide for more complex contexts. For example, location may be combined with time to generate the rule set. In this case, each location input may be further qualified or supplemented with time information. For instance, a context might specify a city with time broken out as morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night, etc. In this example, each permutation of city and time represents a separate node or context. It is contemplated that any number of context parameters may be combined to create contexts of varying complexity and intricacies.","In one embodiment, the recommendation engine  interacts with the logic processing module  to define one or more rule sets for generating a recommendation. In one embodiment, the logic processing module  can build a rule set based on manual input, thereby enabling, for instance, a service provider, network operator, and the like to provide input to write and\/or build the rule sets. In one embodiment, the logic processing module  in cooperation with a XML parser  can formulate one or more rule sets that correlate a context or context type with one or more language tokens or tags. By way of example, in one embodiment, external users can contribute to the rule sets by specifying one or more of the language tokens or tags from which the rule sets are built. The users may also personalize the rule sets by specifying particular contexts of interests (e.g., places of interests, favorite or common activities, etc.) for higher weighting factors.","In another embodiment, the user can manually specify one or more of the tokens, rule sets, contexts, context parameters, etc. Then the logic processing module  can automatically build out or infer additional rules or weighting factors based on the manual input.","In one embodiment, to generate the language tokens or tags, the logic processing module  and\/or the XML parser  and an XML logic definition module  in cooperation with the recommendation engine  identifies or determines a set of content information associated with the context and\/or context type. The content information may be any document or source that includes language related to the context and\/or context type (e.g., a Wikipedia article). In one embodiment, the recommendation engine  then creates a language model that describes the most prevalent or main words or terms that appear in each of the content information. By way of example, for each content information or information resource, text or other information is extracted as language tokens or tags (e.g., each language token represents a word or phrase). For instance, each of the content information is crawled and parsed to obtain text. Since the text data are largely unstructured and can comprise tens of thousands of words, automated topic modeling can be used for locating and extracting language tokens from the text.","In one embodiment, the recommendation engine  extracts the noun tokens, and then performs a histogram cut to extract the least common nouns. To extract the noun tokens, the recommendation engine  can deploy a part-of-speech tagging (POST) to mark up nouns in the text. POST is a process of marking up nouns in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition, as well as its context. Part-of-speech tagging is more than just having a list of words and their parts of speech, because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times. For example, \u201cdogs\u201d is usually a plural noun, but can be a verb. The recommendation engine  then extracts nouns using a language dictionary, and stores the noun tokens as a noun set.","The noun set obtained is then used to build a model to represent the content information associated with the contexts by extracting tokens with similar probability and range from a larger language model (e.g., Wikipedia or other large collection of meaningful words) or performing other similar probabilistic analysis of the tokens. In one example, topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections. For example, LDA is generative probabilistic model as well as a \u201cbag of words\u201d model. In other words, the words or tokens extracted from text of the content information are assumed to be exchangeable within them. The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a probability distribution over the vocabulary. As a consequence, LDA represents documents as vectors of word counts in a very high dimensional space, while ignoring the order in which the words or tokens appear. While it is important to retain the exact sequence of words for reading comprehension, the linguistically simplistic exchangeability assumption is essential to efficient algorithms for automatically eliciting the broad semantic themes in a collection of language token.","Another example of a modeling algorithm is the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model. PLSA is a statistical technique for analyzing two-mode and co-occurrence data. PLSA was evolved from latent semantic analysis, and added a sounder probabilistic model. PLSA has applications in information retrieval and filtering, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and related areas. Regardless of the model used, it is contemplated that the recommendation engine  in cooperation with the logic processing module  and\/or XML parser  can generate the language tokens associated with a particular context or context type. In one embodiment, the XML parser  generates the rule set in eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or other similar language. The declarative form is parsed by an XML parser and provided to Logic Processing Module (LPM) where the different combinations provided are taken to account. This allows for dynamic editing of recommender logic as well as selective logics based on context under which the server performs.

The API may run, for example:\n\n","In some embodiments, the logic processing module  can also interact with the output tag constructor  to translate or otherwise convert the language tokens and\/or rule sets to a target or specified language, thereby enabling interoperability of the tokens among multiple languages. For example, a recommendation request may come from web pages or service  in multiple languages even when operating within a particular region. The tags mentioned with the rule may be for one language. In one embodiment, the rule set does support explicit language definitions within regions but not all languages may be supported. In such cases, the logic processing module  can deploy the output tag constructor  that can translate tags or tokens from one language to another. In one embodiment, the translation can be performed after resolution of the tags in one language (e.g., English or whatever the language may be within the rules for a particular area).","As shown in , the recommendation platform  has connectivity to a database  of rule sets for storing the generated rule sets and corresponding language tokens. As described previously, the rule sets operate to determine the appropriate set of language tokens to apply to generate recommendation information for a given context and\/or context type.","From the perspective of generating rule-based recommendations, the recommendation engine  interacts with an interface application programming interface (API)  by way of a recommender API  to receive requests for recommendations from, for instance, the application  and\/or services . In one embodiment, the request may include parameters such as context information (e.g., a set of one or more contexts) associated with the application  or UE  associated with the request. It is noted that these parameters are optional. In one embodiment, the default behavior in case no parameters are provided would be a temporal recommendation that is based on the most general or root level rule set.","In one embodiment, due to the universally applicable nature of the rule sets, complexity of assigning rules to specific values, desire to reduce complexity, the recommendation engine  can interact with the input object processor  to receive the request and\/or parameters and process them via an input object processor . In this example, the input object processor  normalizes or maps input values or parameters to specific boundaries of the context parameters (depending on how context parameters are interpreted) that makes them easier to process via the applicable rule sets.","In the example of , the input object processor  has connectivity to a location resolver , a time resolver , and context resolver . Although these three types of input resolvers are depicted, it is contemplated that the recommendation platform  may include any one or more of the input resolvers in any combination. In one embodiment, the location resolver  relies on an external location database (e.g., considered as part of the location resolver ). The location database contains, for instance, border point definition for places. The location resolver  is able to map a given coordinate within the border point definitions and to a specific place name within the database. The resolved place name form a given coordinate is then used for rule resolution.","In another embodiment, a second database may be employed that maps a place name to a specific path in the rule set. For example, the path can assist the recommendation platform  to speed up identification of the specific rule sets to be applied for a resolved location. In one embodiment, the recommendation rule sets can be based on location, and it is assumed that given a location, a rule can be identified within the rule set for that location. In one embodiment, the raw location data is not used directly in the rule set, but is used in the location resolver  to identify a place name. However, in other embodiments, the raw location data can be used directly to determine an applicable rule or rule set.","In one embodiment, the input object processor  also has connectivity to a time resolver . By way of example, the time resolver  resolves the given time relative to, for instance, the client device (e.g., the UE ) to a given part of day. This process essentially maps a given time of day into one of enumerated part-of-day definitions for the rule set.

In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, any other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU)  which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal  to provide rule-based recommendations. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, magnetic disk storage, flash memory storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims. Although features of the invention are expressed in certain combinations among the claims, it is contemplated that these features can be arranged in any combination and order."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The embodiments of the invention are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIGS. 3 and 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
