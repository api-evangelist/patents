{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a U.S. National Phase filing of International Serial No. PCT\/EP2011\/062028 filed Jul. 14, 2011, and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/364,135 filed Jul. 14, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Prostacyclin (or PGI2) is a member of the family of lipid molecules known as eicosanoids. It is a potent vasodilator, antiproliferative, anti-thrombotic agent that mediates its effects as an agonist of the IP receptor. The IP receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor that, upon activation by prostacyclin, stimulates the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Prostacyclin counteracts the vasoconstrictor and pro-thrombotic activity of endothelin.","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease characterized by a progressive pulmonary vasculopathy leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. Exogenous administration of an agonist of the IP receptor has become an important strategy in the treatment of PAH. (See, e.g., Tuder et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med., 1999, 159: 1925-1932; Humbert et al, J. Am. Coll. Cardiol., 2004, 43:13S-24S; Rosenzweig, Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs, 2006, 11:609-619; McLaughlin et al, Circulation, 2006, 114:1417-1431; Rosenkranz, Olin. Res. Cardiol., 2007, 96:527-541; Driscoll et al, Expert Opin. Pharmacother., 2008, 9:85-81.).","The prostacyclin analogue epoprostenol (flolan) is at least as effective as transplantation in terms of survival. Despite this, it is not used as frontline therapy due to significant tolerability, convenience and cost issues. Instead, patients with PAH are often treated first with either endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g. bosentan) and\/or PDE5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil), which are better tolerated but can have limited efficacy. Prostacyclin analogues are used mainly as add-on treatment as severity of the disease progresses and tolerability and convenience become less of an issue.","Two key issues prevent current prostacyclin analogues being used as frontline therapy in PAH. Firstly, they are very unstable with an extremely short half-life, meaning they must be constantly infused via an in-dwelling intra venous (i.v.) catheter that is both inconvenient for the patient and also associated with a significant risk of infection and sepsis. Secondly, they are associated with significant side effects including nausea, jaw pain, headache and other side effects associated with systemic hypotension.","One solution to these issues is iloprost, which is available as a nebulized formulation that has reduced tolerability issues, but the short half life results in a 6-9 times daily dosing regime. More recently, researchers made efforts to generate stable, orally available IP receptor agonists. These ligands would improve patient convenience and compliance, but high levels of systemic drug is required to achieve pharmacodynamic effects in the lung; thus, possibly generating similar side effects to those observed with i.v. flolan.","The present invention describes stable, highly selective IP receptor agonists that are suitable for oral and inhaled delivery. The present invention offers a significant improvement over existing prostacyclin analogues and enables their use in less-severe patients. In addition, long term activation of the IP receptor has been shown to reverse remodeling associated with PAH; therefore, earlier intervention with the present invention may have significant effects on disease progression and potentially may show reversal.","In addition, pharmaceutical research has considerable interest in developing IP receptor agonists for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. IP deficient mice have been shown to be more susceptible to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis than wild-type animals (Lovgren A K et al. (2006) 291:L144-56), and the IP receptor agonist iloprost increases survival in bleomycin-treated mice (Zhu et al (2010) Respir Res. 11(1):34).","Furthermore, IP receptor signaling has been shown to exert beneficial effects in fibrotic conditions of various organs in animal models and in patients. Benefits of IP receptor agonist were shown for fibrosis of the heart, lung, skin, pancreas and liver, and in systemic sclerosis. (Gayraud M (2007) 74(1):e1-8; Hirata Y et al (2009) 63(10):781-6; Kaneshige T et al (2007) 69(12):1271-6; Sahsivar M O et al (2009) 32(5):498-502; Sato N et al (2010) 59(4):1092-100; Shouval D S et al (2008) 26(3 Suppl 49):S105-7; Spargias K et al (2009) 120(18):1793-9; Stratton R et al (2001) 108(2):241-50; Takenaka M et al (2009) 80(5-6):263-7; Watanabe M et al (2009) 30(1):1-11; Yano T et al (2005) 166(5):1333-42; Zardi E M et al (2007) 7(6):785-90; Zardi E M et al (2006) 20(3):377-80; Rehberger P et al (2009) 89(3):245-9). Fibrotic conditions can occur in most organs secondary to chronic inflammation indications throughout the body and are likely to share common causes.","Therefore, antifibrotic agents such as IP receptor agonists of the present invention are of potential benefit in all indications that are associated with fibrotic tissue remodeling.","There is considerable, interest in developing agonists of the IP receptor for use in the treatment of other diseases, such as atherothrombosis, preeclampsia. It is highly desirable to develop a stable, inhaled agonists of the IP receptor, which may lead to improved management of PAH.","The invention pertains to the compounds, methods for using them, and uses thereof as described herein.

It is understood that a substituent may be attached at a chiral center of a carbon atom. Therefore, the invention includes enantiomers, diastereomers or racemates of the compound. \u201cEnantiomers\u201d are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a \u201cracemic\u201d mixture. The term is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. \u201cDiastereoisomers\u201d are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R\u2014S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon may be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (\u2212) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers or axes and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. If the compound contains a double bond, the substituent may be E or Z configuration. If the compound contains a disubstituted cycloalkyl, the cycloalkyl substituent may have a cis- or trans-configuration. All tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.","Any asymmetric atom (e.g., carbon or the like) of the compound(s) of the present invention can be present in racemic or enantiomerically enriched, for example the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)-configuration. In certain embodiments, each asymmetric atom has at least 50% enantiomeric excess, at least 60% enantiomeric excess, at least 70% enantiomeric excess, at least 80% enantiomeric excess, at least 90% enantiomeric excess, at least 95% enantiomeric excess, or at least 99% enantiomeric excess in the (R)- or (S)-configuration. Substituents at atoms with unsaturated bonds may, if possible, be present in cis-(Z)- or trans-(E)-form.","Accordingly, as used herein a compound of the present invention can be in the form of one of the possible isomers, rotamers, atropisomers, tautomers or mixtures thereof, for example, as substantially pure geometric (cis or trans) isomers, diastereomers, optical isomers (antipodes), racemates or mixtures thereof.","Any resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the constituents, into the pure or substantially pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereomers, racemates, for example, by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization.","Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g., by separation of the diastereomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. In particular, a basic moiety may thus be employed to resolve the compounds of the present invention into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of a salt formed with an optically active acid, e.g., tartaric acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, diacetyl tartaric acid, di-O,O\u2032-p-toluoyl tartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid or camphor-10-sulfonic acid. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g., high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral adsorbent.","Since the compounds of the invention are intended for use in pharmaceutical compositions it will readily be understood that they are each preferably provided in substantially pure form, for example at least 60% pure, more suitably at least 75% pure and preferably at least 85%, especially at least 98% pure (% are on a weight for weight basis). Impure preparations of the compounds may be used for preparing the more pure forms used in the pharmaceutical compositions; these less pure preparations of the compounds should contain at least 1%, more suitably at least 5% and preferably from 10 to 59% of a compound of the invention.","Compounds of the present invention are either obtained in the free form, as a salt thereof, or as prodrug derivatives thereof.","When both a basic group and an acid group are present in the same molecule, the compounds of the present invention may also form internal salts, e.g., zwitterionic molecules.","The present invention also provides pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention that converts in vivo to the compounds of the present invention. A pro-drug is an active or inactive compound that is modified chemically through in vivo physiological action, such as hydrolysis, metabolism and the like, into a compound of this invention following administration of the prodrug to a subject. The suitability and techniques involved in making and using pro-drugs are well known by those skilled in the art. Prodrugs can be conceptually divided into two non-exclusive categories, bioprecursor prodrugs and carrier prodrugs. See , Ch. 31-32 (Ed. Wermuth, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 2001). Generally, bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds, which are inactive or have low activity compared to the corresponding active drug compound that contain one or more protective groups and are converted to an active form by metabolism or solvolysis. Both the active drug form and any released metabolic products should have acceptably low toxicity.","Carrier prodrugs are drug compounds that contain a transport moiety, e.g., that improve uptake and\/or localized delivery to a site(s) of action. Desirably for such a carrier prodrug, the linkage between the drug moiety and the transport moiety is a covalent bond, the prodrug is inactive or less active than the drug compound, and any released transport moiety is acceptably non-toxic. For prodrugs where the transport moiety is intended to enhance uptake, typically the release of the transport moiety should be rapid. In other cases, it is desirable to utilize a moiety that provides slow release, e.g., certain polymers or other moieties, such as cyclodextrins. Carrier prodrugs can, for example, be used to improve one or more of the following properties: increased lipophilicity, increased duration of pharmacological effects, increased site-specificity, decreased toxicity and adverse reactions, and\/or improvement in drug formulation (e.g., stability, water solubility, suppression of an undesirable organoleptic or physiochemical property). For example, lipophilicity can be increased by esterification of (a) hydroxyl groups with lipophilic carboxylic acids (e.g., a carboxylic acid having at least one lipophilic moiety), or (b) carboxylic acid groups with lipophilic alcohols (e.g., an alcohol having at least one lipophilic moiety, for example aliphatic alcohols).","Exemplary prodrugs are, e.g., esters of free carboxylic acids and S-acyl derivatives of thiols and O-acyl derivatives of alcohols or phenols, wherein acyl has a meaning as defined herein. Suitable prodrugs are often pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid, e.g., lower alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters, lower alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or di-substituted lower alkyl esters, such as the \u03c9-(amino, mono- or di-lower alkylamino, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, the \u03b1-(lower alkanoyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl or di-lower alkylaminocarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester and the like conventionally used in the art. In addition, amines have been masked as arylcarbonyloxymethyl substituted derivatives which are cleaved by esterases in vivo releasing the free drug and formaldehyde (Bundgaard, 2503 (1989)). Moreover, drugs containing an acidic NH group, such as imidazole, imide, indole and the like, have been masked with N-acyloxymethyl groups (Bundgaard, , Elsevier (1985)). Hydroxy groups have been masked as esters and ethers. EP 039,051 (Sloan and Little) discloses Mannich-base hydroxamic acid prodrugs, their preparation and use.","Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, F, P, P, S, Cl, I respectively. The invention includes various isotopically labeled compounds as defined herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes, such as H, C, and C, are present. Such isotopically labeled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (with C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example H or H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an F or labeled compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent of a compound of the formula I, Ia, II or IIa. The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term \u201cisotopic enrichment factor\u201d as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted deuterium, such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation).","Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula I, Ia, II or IIa can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagents in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.","Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. DO, d-acetone, d-DMSO.","Synthesis","Generally, compounds according to Formula I, Ia, II or IIa or pharmaceutical salts thereof can be synthesized by the routes described in Schemes A-M and the Examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0290","num":"0305"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00009","num":"00009"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00009","he":"111.93mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US08754085-20140617-C00009.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Scheme A begins with a Step 1 reaction taking commercially available starting material or starting material that one skilled in the art can synthesize and condensing the material as shown.

The compounds in free or salt form can be obtained in the form of hydrates or solvates containing a solvent used for crystallisation. Compounds of formula I, Ia, II or IIa can be recovered from reaction mixtures and purified in a conventional manner.

This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention.","The various substituents on the synthetic intermediates and final products shown in the following reaction schemes can be present in their fully elaborated forms, with suitable protecting groups where required as understood by one skilled in the art, or in precursor forms which can later be elaborated into their final forms by methods familiar to one skilled in the art. The substituents can also be added at various stages throughout the synthetic sequence or after completion of the synthetic sequence. In many cases, commonly used functional group manipulations can be used to transform one intermediate into another intermediate, or one compound of formula I, Ia, II or IIa into another compound of formula I, Ia, II or IIa. Examples of such manipulations are conversion of an ester or a ketone to an alcohol; conversion of an ester to a ketone; interconversions of esters, acids and amides; alkylation, acylation and sulfonylation of alcohols and amines; and many others. Substituents can also be added using common reactions, such as alkylation, acylation, halogenation or oxidation. Such manipulations are well-known in the art, and many reference works summarize procedures and methods for such manipulations.

It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. Multiple protecting groups within the same molecule can be chosen such that each of these protecting groups can either be removed without removal of other protecting groups in the same molecule, or several protecting groups can be removed using the same reaction step, depending upon the outcome desired.

The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of symptoms of PAH.","Antiplatelet Therapies (Conditions Related to Platelet Aggregation)","Antiplatelet agents (antiplatelets) are prescribed for a variety of conditions. For example, in coronary artery disease they are used to help prevent myocardial infarction or stroke in patients who are at risk of developing obstructive blood clots (e.g., coronary thrombosis).","In a myocardial infarction, the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood as a result of a blockage in the coronary blood vessels. If taken while an attack is in progress or immediately afterward (preferably within 30 min), antiplatelets can reduce the damage to the heart.","A transient ischemic attack (\u201cTIA\u201d or \u201cmini-stroke\u201d) is a brief interruption of oxygen flow to the brain due to decreased blood flow through arteries, usually due to an obstructing blood clot. Antiplatelet drugs have been found to be effective in preventing TIAs. Angina is a temporary and often recurring chest pain, pressure or discomfort caused by inadequate oxygen-rich blood flow (ischemia) to some parts of the heart. In patients with angina, antiplatelet therapy can reduce the effects of angina and the risk of myocardial infarction.","Stroke is an event in which the brain does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood, usually due to blockage of a cerebral blood vessel by a blood clot. In high-risk patients, taking antiplatelets regularly has been found to prevent the formation of blood clots that cause first or second strokes. Angioplasty is a catheter based technique used to open arteries obstructed by a blood clot. Whether or not stenting is performed immediately after this procedure to keep the artery open, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of forming additional blood clots following the procedure(s).","Coronary bypass surgery is a surgical procedure in which an artery or vein is taken from elsewhere in the body and grafted to a blocked coronary artery, rerouting blood around the blockage and through the newly attached vessel. After the procedure, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of secondary blood clots.","Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Atrial fibrillation affects about two million Americans every year. In atrial fibrillation, the atria (the heart's upper chambers) rapidly fire electrical signals that cause them to quiver rather than contract normally. The result is an abnormally fast and highly irregular heartbeat. When given after an episode of atrial fibrillation, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the brain (embolism).","There is evidence that an IP receptor agonist will inhibit platelet aggregation and thus be a potential treatment as an antiplatelet therapy (see, e.g., Moncada et al., Lancet, 1977, 1: 18-20). It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the IP receptor in mice leads to an increased propensity towards thrombosis (Murata et al, Nature, 1997, 388:678-682).","IP receptor agonists can be used to treat, for example, claudication or peripheral artery disease as well as cardiovascular complications, arterial thrombosis, atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction caused by serotonin, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and restenosis of arteries following angioplasty or stent placement. (See, e.g., Fetalvero et al, Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat., 2007, 82:109-118; Arehart et al, Curr. Med. Chem., 2007, 14:2161-2169; Davi et al, N. Engl. J.

Res., 2008, Mar. 6.).","IP receptor agonists can also be used alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy, for example, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), to provide cardioprotection following MI or postischemic myocardial dysfunction or protection from ischemic injury during percutaneous coronary intervention, and the like, including complications resulting therefrom. IP receptor agonists can also be used in antiplatelet therapies in combination with, for example, alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), echistatin (a disintegrin) or, in states of hypercoaguability, heparin. (See, e.g., Chan., J. Nutr., 1998, 128:1593-1596; Mardla et al, Platelets, 2004, 15:319-324; Bernabei et al, Ann. Thorac. Surg., 1995, 59:149-153; Gainza et al, J.

It is the leading cause of mortality in many countries, including the United States. Atherosclerosis, as the term is used herein, shall be understood to encompass disorders of large and medium-sized arteries that result in the progressive accumulation within the intima of smooth muscle cells and lipids.","It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can confer protection from atherosclerosis, such as from atherothrombosis (Arehart et al, Curr.

The prevalence of asthma has dramatically increased worldwide in recent decades. It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the IP receptor in mice augments allergic airway inflammation (Takahashi et al, Br J Pharmacol, 2002, 137:315-322). It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can suppress not only the development of asthma when given during the sensitization phase, but also the cardinal features of experimental asthma when given during the challenge phase (Idzko et al, J. Clin. Invest., 2007, 117:464-72, Nagao et al, Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., 2003, 29:314-320), at least in part through markedly interfering with the function of antigen-presenting dendnuc cells within the airways (Idzko et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2007, 117:464-472; Zhou et al, J. Immunol., 2007, 178:702-710; Jaffar et al., J. Immunol., 2007, 179:6193-6203; Jozefowski et al, Int. Immunopharmacol., 2003, 3:865-878). These cells are crucial for both the initiation and the maintenance phases of allergic asthma, as depletion of airway dendritic cells during secondary challenge in sensitized mice abolished all characteristic features of asthma, an effect that could be completely restored by adoptive transfer of wild-type dendritic cells (van Rijt et al., J. Exp. Med., 2005, 201:981-991). It has also been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can inhibit proinflammatory cytokine secretion by human alveolar macrophages (Raychaudhuri et al., J. Biol.

Taprostene, an IP-receptor agonist, suppressed the generation of the CD8 T cell chemoattractants CXCL9 and CXCL10 from human airway epithelial cells in vitro. (Ayer, L. M., S. M. Wilson, S. L. Traves, D. Proud, M. A. Giembycz. 2008. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 324: 815-826.) Beraprost, an IP-receptor agonist, protected rats against the development of experimental cigarette smoke-induced emphysema, possibly by means of a concerted inhibitory action on alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, oxidative burden, matrix metalloproteinase expression, and proinflammatory cytokine generation.

Pharmacol., 2003, 367:607-614). Agonists of the IP receptor promote vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation. Improving microvascular blood flow is able to benefit diabetic complications (Cameron, Diabetologia, 2001, 44:1973-1988).","It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can prevent and reverse motor and sensory peripheral nerve conduction abnormalities in streptozotocin-diabetic rats (Cotter et al., Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch.

Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., 1987, 28:470-476).","Agonists of the IP receptor have been shown to have activity for regulation of vascular tone, for vasodilation, and for amelioration of pulmonary hypertension (see, e.g., Strauss et al, Clin Chest Med, 2007, 28:127-142; Driscoll et al, Expert Opin.

In particular, the compounds are suitable IP receptor agonist and may be tested in the following assays.","Activity of compounds at the IP receptor (IP receptor) is assessed by measuring cAMP accumulation in CHO cells stably expressing the IP receptor (CHO-IP) using the PerkinElmer AlphaScreen assay. This technology measures the endogenous production of cAMP, in a non-radioactive luminescence proximity homogenous assay. A biological reaction occurs between streptavidin coated donor beads, biotinylated cAMP and anti-cAMP acceptor beads, bringing the donor and acceptor beads close enough together so that upon excitation a fluorescence signal is produced. On production of endogenous cAMP, competition between the biotinylated cAMP and cellular-derived cAMP causes a reduction in the fluorescent signal. The reduction in signal is proportional to the amount of cAMP being produced, thus it is possible to quantify the amount of cAMP being produced on stimulation with agonist.","Test and reference compounds are prepared at 100\u00d7[final] in 100% DMSO, and diluted 1:3 using a Biomek Fx (Beckman Coulter). This is followed by an intermediate dilution to give 5\u00d7[final] in assay buffer (HBSS containing 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% (w\/v) BSA). 5 \u03bcL of 5\u00d7[final] test compounds, reference compounds and buffer\/DMSO control are then transferred to a 384-well white OptiPlate, containing 20 \u03bcL CHO-IP cell suspension (15,000 cells\/well, prepared from frozen), and plate is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. A cAMP standard curve is constructed for each experiment (concentration range of 10000 nM to 0.001 nM, in assay buffer) and 25 \u03bcL of each concentration added to the last two columns of the assay plate. The incubation is terminated by the addition of lysis buffer (dHO; 0.3% (v v) Tween-20) containing 20 units mLstreptavidin coated donor beads and biotinylated cAMP (pre-incubated for 30 minutes) and 20 units mLanti-cAMP acceptor beads, which are added to the lysis buffer just before addition to the assay plate. The assay plate is then incubated at room temperature in the dark, for 60 minutes with gentle shaking, and read on the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer).","The raw data of the reference compounds, test compounds and controls are converted into cAMP concentrations, using the cAMP standard curve, in GraphPadPrism (GraphPad Software Inc). ECas well as maximal values of the agonist curves are determined using a 4-parameter logistic equation. The % maximum response values of all test compounds are determined using the top of the treprostinil concentration-response curve.","Compounds of the Examples, herein below, generally have ECvalues in the data measurements described above below 5 \u03bcM.
