{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to caching network content.","The Internet provides a vast amount of information. The individual pieces of information are often referred to as \u201cnetwork content\u201d and may have various formats, such as, for example and without limitation, texts, audios, videos, images, web pages, documents, executables, web or news feeds, blog posts, etc. The content items are stored at many different sites, such as on computers and servers, in databases, etc., around the world. These different sites are communicatively linked to the Internet through various network infrastructures. Any person (e.g., network user) may access the publicly available network content via a suitable network device (e.g., a computer, a smart mobile telephone, etc.) connected to the Internet.","This disclosure generally relates to caching network content.","In particular embodiments, downloading one or more content items; determining which ones of the one or more content items are popular among a plurality of users; categorizing the one or more content items into one or more groups, wherein each group comprises one or more related content items; associating one or more keywords with each group, wherein the one or more keywords describe content of the one or more related content items in the corresponding group; and caching the one or more content items categorized into the one or more groups and the one or more keywords associated with each group.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","This disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of this disclosure. However, this disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure this disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","There is a vast amount of information available on the Internet. Such information is often referred to as \u201cnetwork content\u201d, and each specific piece of information may be referred to as a \u201ccontent item\u201d. Any network user may access the publicly available network content using a suitable network-ready device (e.g., a computer, a smart telephone, a game console, etc.).","During a particular time period, some content items may be more trendy or popular among the users than others. For example, in the hours and days immediately following the 2011 T\u014dhoku Earthquake in Japan, which occurred on 11 Mar. 2011, news stories, videos, blog posts, etc. about the earthquake were frequently accessed and viewed by many network users around the world. Similarly, in the hours and days following Michael Jackson's sudden death on 25 Jun. 2009, many network users searched for and viewed web pages, news feeds, images, videos, etc. about the celebrity artist and the circumstances surrounding his death.","Sometimes, when many users are attempting to access the same content item (e.g., a piece of breaking news) at the same time, there may be some delay due to the high-volume network traffic. A user may have to wait for a long time (e.g., some minutes) before the content item is downloaded and displayed on the client device used by that user. To prevent such delays, avoid content server overload or crashing, and improve network experiences for users in general, in particular embodiments, content items may be downloaded and cached by individual proxy servers. Given a specific proxy server, it may download content items from various content providers (e.g., other content servers) and cache these content items locally. It may determine which of the cached content items are more popular among the network users (e.g., by determining popularity ratings for the cached content items). The cached content items may be categorized, and similar content items of various formats may be grouped together into the same content group. The proxy server may proactively send some of the more popular content items to other proxy servers associated with this proxy server so that the other proxy servers may also cache these content items, which have been deemed popular by this proxy server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","110"]},"Each proxy server  may be coupled to any number of datastores  for storing cached network content. In particular embodiments, given a specific proxy server (e.g., proxy server A), proxy server A may cache content items received from various content sources  as a result of serving requests from client devices A. These cached content items may be stored locally in datastores A. In some cases, proxy server A may cache as many content items as possible (e.g., for as long as there is storage capacity in datastores A). It may determine a popularity rank for each cached content item, which indicates how popular the corresponding content item is among the network users. Proxy server A may proactively send those cached content items that have high popularity ranks (e.g., content items whose popularity ranks are above a threshold) to other proxy servers (e.g., proxy server B) to be cached by those other proxy servers (e.g., stored in datastores B). In some implementations, proxy server A may predict the popularity trend and send potentially popular content items (e.g., based on the predicted popular trend) to the other proxy servers to be cached by those other proxy servers.","Each proxy server  may serve any number of client devices . For example, proxy server A is coupled to datastores A and serves client devices A; and proxy server B is coupled to datastores B and serves client devices B. Note that a particular client device  may be served by one proxy server  at one time and by another, different proxy server  at another time.","In particular embodiments, specific proxy servers  may be physically located in different locations around the world. These different locations may belong to different time zones. Two proxy servers  may be communicatively linked (e.g., via the Internet or an intranet) to each other so that they may exchange data (e.g., content items) between them.","There may be any number of content sources , such as websites, databases, etc. Each content source  may supply any number of content items. A content item may have any format, such as, for example and without limitation, text, audio, video, executable, blog post, web page, document, web or news feed, etc. A proxy server  may be communicatively linked (e.g., via the Internet) to any number of specific content sources  in order to download specific content items from these content sources . Note that multiple proxy servers  may be communicatively linked to the same content source .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"In particular embodiments, a proxy server (e.g., proxy server A or B) may serve a number of client devices (e.g., client devices A or B). When a specific client device sends a request to a content server (e.g., a content source ) requesting for a specific content item, the request may go through the proxy server. The proxy server may check whether a copy of the requested content item has been cached locally with the proxy server. If so, the proxy server may send the cached content item to the client device. In this case, the client request is served by the proxy server, without having to actually contact the content server to obtain the requested content item from the content server. On the other hand, if the requested content item is not cached with the proxy server, the proxy server may forward the client request to the content server and obtain the requested content item on behalf of the client device. The content item is then sent to the client device by the proxy server. The proxy server may cache the requested content item locally so that if this same content item is requested again in the future, the proxy server can serve those subsequent requests itself","In particular embodiments, as a result of serving requests from various client devices, a proxy server may download content items from various content sources (STEP ). These content items may have different formats, such as, for example and without limitation, text, audio, video, executable, web page, blog post, web or news feed, etc.","In particular embodiments, the proxy server may filter out unsafe or undesirable content items (STEP ). As an example, when a particular content item (e.g., a piece of breaking news) is accessed by a large number of users, multiple content sources may provide multiple copies of the same content item. The proxy server may de-duplicate the multiple copies of the same content item so that only one copy of a content item remains. As another example, sometimes, advertisement or pornographic material may be incorporated into a popular content item. The proxy server may remove the advertisement or other undesirable material from the content item so that only the main, relevant information remains. As a third example, criminals often take advantage of popular content items or subject matters to attempt to scam or defraud users. After the  Tohoku Earthquake, there were many websites on the Internet asking for donations to various charity groups and organizations for earthquake relief funds. Not all of these websites were legitimate. In fact, many were sponsored by criminals attempting to scam users into giving them money or financial information (e.g., credit card numbers). A user searching for information relating to the earthquake may inadvertently fall prey to one of the illegitimate websites. The proxy server may reject content items from questionable or suspicious sources to safeguard the users against scams and other criminal activities. As a fourth example, sometimes, malware (e.g., virus, worm, adware, spyware, etc.) may be incorporated into a content item. Without adequate anti-malware protection, a user may inadvertently download the malware when the user accesses the content item. The proxy server may scan each downloaded content item for possible malware and reject infected content items.","In some implementations, the proxy server may use WebPulse, a cloud-based anti-malware product developed by Blue Coat Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., to filter content items obtained from various content sources. In this case, the proxy server incorporates a security component to guard the users against unsafe or undesirable content items. Only those content items that are deemed safe and appropriate are cached locally by the proxy server. The unsafe or undesirable content items are rejected (e.g., deleted).","In particular embodiments, the proxy server may determine which downloaded content items are popular (e.g., among the network users) during a specific time period (STEP ). Note that what is considered popular during one time period may differ from another time period. For example, shortly after 25 Jun. 2009, content items relating to Michael Jackson and his sudden death may be considered popular because a great number of users was searching for and accessing these content items. However, these same content items may not be considered popular six months or a year later because not many users were still interested in accessing these content items. Furthermore, some content items may be considered popular for time periods longer than other content items. Therefore, the proxy server may periodically (e.g., once per hour, per day, or per week) determine what the popular content items are during the current time period. In some implementations, the proxy server may determine the popular content items during the current hour, the current day, or the current week.","In particular embodiments, there may be a default time period for the proxy server. For example, the default time period may be one day. Thus, the proxy server may determine which content items are considered popular during each day. However, this default time period may be overridden (e.g., by a proxy administrator). For example, an administrator may change the time period to four hours, and as a result, the proxy server may determine which content items are considered popular during every four-hour period.","In some implementations, a content item is considered popular when it is accessed many times by many users during a specific time period. For example, the proxy server may compare the average access frequencies (e.g., number of user access per second or number of user access per minute) of individual content items. If the average access frequency of one particular content item is significantly higher than the average access frequencies of other content items during a specific time period, then that particular content item may be considered popular during that specific time period. Thus, since on 25 Jun. 2009, content items relating to Michael Jackson and his sudden death were accessed much more frequently than other content items, the proxy server may consider these content items popular during the day of 25 Jun. 2009. Alternatively, if the average access frequency of a particular content item is above a threshold, then that particular content item may be considered popular.","In some implementations, the proxy server may analyze search queries submitted by users to search engines. These search queries often include keywords that suggest what the popular subject matters searched by the users are during a specific time period. The content items relating to these popular subject matters may be considered popular during that specific time period. For example, since on 25 Jun. 2009, a great number of users has submitted search queries such as \u201cMichael Jackson\u201d or \u201cMichael Jackson death\u201d or \u201cMichael Jackson dead\u201d, the proxy server may consider content items relating to the keywords \u201cMichael Jackson\u201d or \u201cMichael Jackson death\u201d popular during the day of 25 Jun. 2009. When deciding whether a particular subject matter searched by network users is popular, the proxy server may consider the number of search queries relating to the subject matter submitted by the user during a specific time period. If the number is above a threshold, the subject matter may be considered popular. Alternatively, if the number of search queries relating to the particular subject matter is significantly higher than the number of search queries relating to other subject matters, then the subject matter may be considered popular.","In some implementations, a content item may be considered popular if it is related to a trendy subject matter. For example, Apple's iPhone is a very fashionable product among many network users, especially younger users. Consequently, many users pay close attention to information relating to various aspects of the iPhone, such as when Apple shall release the next generation of the iPhone (e.g., iPhone 5). The proxy server may consider content items relating to the iPhone as popular. In some cases, a subject matter may remain fashionable or trendy for a relatively long time period (e.g., months or years). For example, Apple's iPhone became popular since its initial release and remains to be popular for years. Content items relating to such subject matter may be considered popular for time periods longer than other types of content items (e.g., content items relating to breaking news).","In particular embodiments, the proxy server may search for and locate popular content items among information posted on frequently accessed websites (e.g., content sources ) on the Internet, such as \u201cnews.yahoo.com\u201d, \u201cnews.google.com\u201d, \u201cnews.bing.com\u201d, \u201cwww.cnn.com\u201d, \u201cwww.bbc.com\u201d, \u201cwww.msnbc.com\u201d, \u201cwww.nytimes.com\u201d, or \u201cwww.foxnews.com\u201d. In some implementations, the proxy server needs to be aware of the structure of a website before it can determine the subject matter of a content item and which content items are popular among the users, and extract those popular content items. The structure of a website indicates the relationships among the individual web pages of the website (e.g., which web page is linked to which other web pages), and the layout of the individual web pages (e.g., the components, such as frames, contained in each web page, the content items contained in each component, etc.). In some implementations, a number (e.g., 100) of the most frequently accessed and most credible websites on the Internet are selected. The structure of each of these website is manually determined. The structural information of each website is maintained and manually updated from time to time.","In particular embodiments, the proxy server may determine a popularity rank for each content item cached by the proxy server. The popularity rank of a content item indicates how popular the content item is among the network users during the current time period. The more popular the content item, the higher its popular rank.","In particular embodiments, the proxy server may analyze the content items provided by various content sources (e.g., content sources , such as websites, databases, feeds, posts, etc.) to predict which content items may become popular (e.g., among the network users) in the near future and download (i.e., pre-fetch) these potentially popular content items from the appropriate content sources proactively. For example, the proxy server may predict trends among the users (e.g., based on currently available information), such as social trend, cultural trend, fashion trend, product trend, etc. The proxy server may then predict which content items may become popular based on these trends and proactively download these content items, which may potentially become popular in the near future, from the appropriate content sources.","In some implementations, there may be a pre-selected list of content sources. This list may be configurable so that the content sources on the list may be updated as needed. Knowing the trend of a subject title, the proxy server may pre-fetch, from the content sources on the list, specific content items that match the trend. For example, the proxy server may download a twitter text for mobile devices, a well known blogger page for mobile devices, a video clip from CNBC (which is considered by many the authoritative source for business news), a web page from CNBC, a web page from CNN (which is considered by many internationally as the authoritative source for international news), and so on. These pre-fetched content items may be combined with those content items already stored in the cache. A list of content items may be created that include some of the content items that are considered popular as well as some of the pre-fetched content items that may become popular. The indices of these content items may be offered to the user so that the user can select a specific index to view the detailed content of the corresponding content item.","the content items and categorize the content items according to their content so that related content items are grouped into the same content group (STEP ). There are different means to determine the subject matter or content of a particular content item, and this disclosure contemplates any applicable means. As an example, for a text content item, such as an article, a blog post, or a document, the proxy server may parse the text to locate keywords, either in the title or in the body, that describe the subject matter of the content item. A news story about the 2011 T\u014dhoku Earthquake may include keywords such as \u201cearthquake\u201d, \u201cJapan\u201d, \u201cT\u014dhoku\u201d, and \u201ctsunami\u201d. These keywords indicate the main content of the news story. As another example, for an audio or video content item, there may be tags or other metadata associated with the audio or video content item. In addition, when an audio or video content item is included in a web page, there may be text near the content item, also included in the web page, that describes the subject matter or content of the content item. The proxy server may parse the metadata or the text associated with the content item to locate and extract keywords that describe the subject matter or content of the content item. In some implementations, when doing so, the proxy server may rely on the known layout of the web page, if the layout of the web page has been manually determined and maintained. For example, if it is known that in a particular web page that includes several video clips arranged in a row, a brief summary of the content of each video clip is included below the corresponding video clip, then the proxy server may parse each summary to locate and extract keywords for the corresponding video clip.","Content items relating to the same subject matter may be grouped together into the same content group. For example, shortly after the 2011 T\u014dhoku Earthquake, there were many content items, such as news stories, feeds, posts, video clips, etc., relating to the earthquake. These content items of various formats may be grouped together into the same content group.","In particular embodiments, keywords are associated with each content group (STEP ). Any number of keywords may be associated with a particular content group. The keywords describe the subject matter or content of the content items in the group. For example, for the group that includes content items relating to the 2011 T\u014dhoku Earthquake, the keywords may include \u201cearthquake\u201d, \u201cJapan\u201d, \u201cT\u014dhoku\u201d, and \u201ctsunami\u201d. In some implementations, the keywords associated with a content group may reflect the keywords that describe the individual content items included in the group. The keywords may provide indexing information for the content groups as well as the individual content items included in each group.","In particular embodiments, the proxy server caches the content groups (STEP ). The content items in each group as well as the keywords associated with that group may be stored. For example, proxy server A may cache content groups, together with their associated keywords, it has obtained and processed in datastores A; and proxy server B may cache content groups, together with their associated keywords, it has obtained and processed in datastores B.","In particular embodiments, there may be multiple proxy servers located at different geographical locations around the world. These locations may belong to different time zones. For example, proxy server A may be located in New York, while proxy server B may be located in San Francisco. Thus, proxy server A is located in a time zone (i.e., Eastern Time Zone) that is three hours ahead of the time zone (i.e., Pacific Time Zone) in which proxy server B is located. Proxy server A may serve mainly users on the East Coast, while proxy server B may serve mainly users on the West Coast.","Sometimes, when there is a significant event occurring over night or early in the morning, users on the East Coast may learn of the event before users on the West Coast because the users on the East Coast usually wake up and begin their days a few hours before the users on the West Coast. As the users on the East Coast learn of the event, they are likely to search for and access content items on the Internet relating to the event. These content items thus become popular due to the large number of user accesses they receive. Consequently, proxy server A may download, filter, categorize, index, and cache these content items relating to the event.","Moreover, proxy server A may also send the cached content items, including their group affiliations and associated keywords, to proxy server B to be cached with proxy server B as well. In other words, a proxy server may send popular content items it has downloaded, filtered, categorized, and indexed to other proxy servers (STEP ) so that the other proxy servers may also cache these content items. In the example with proxy servers A and B, proxy server B receives the popular content items from proxy server A and caches these content items locally (e.g., in datastores B). By the time the users on the West Coast wake up and being their days, the popular content items are cached and ready to be accessed by the users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","303","305"]},"A search engine is a computer-implemented tool designed to search for information relevant to specific subject matters or topics on a network, such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, or an intranet. To conduct a search, a network user may submit a search query to the search engine. The search query generally contains one or more words that describe a subject matter. In response, the search engine may identify one or more content items available on the network that are likely to be related to the search query, which may be referred to as \u201csearch results\u201d. The search engine may organize the search results and present them to the user. Often, each search result is presented in the form of a clickable link. A user may click on a specific link to access the actual content of the corresponding search result (i.e., content item).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"Alternative, in some embodiments, when a user submits a search query, a search engine may identify a list of search results (i.e., content items) and present them to the user on the user's client device. Suppose that the user clicks on a link to view the content of a corresponding search result. If the search result can be retrieved from its original source on the Internet and presented to the user on the client device quickly (e.g., within a threshold time period such as a few seconds), then nothing needs to be done by the proxy server. On the other hand, if there is a delay (e.g., longer than a threshold time period such as 30 seconds or a minute) in retrieving the search result from its original source on the Internet and a copy of the search result has been cached with the proxy server, the proxy server may step in, retrieve the cached copy of the search result, and send it to the user's client device to be presented to the user. Alternatively, even if a copy of the specific search result requested by the user has not been cached by the proxy server, if the proxy server has cached other content items that are similar as or related to the specific search result requested by the user, the proxy server may still suggest these other cached related content items to the user. The user may view some of these cached related content items while waiting for the search result to be downloaded from the Internet.","In some embodiments, while a user is viewing a content item, either cached by a proxy server or downloaded from the Internet, the proxy server may suggest other related content items, cached by the proxy server, to the user. When the proxy server downloads content items for caching, the proxy server may categorize them so that related content items are grouped together into the same content group. Keywords describing the subject matter of the content items in a group are associated with the group. Subsequently, while a user is viewing one content item, if there is a cached content group relating to that content item, the proxy server may suggest other content items from the cached group as related content items to the user. The user is given the option to select and view any related content item. The user may also ask for additional related content items.","Given a group of related content items that has been cached by a proxy server, in particular embodiments, the content items may be ranked based on their respective degrees of popularity. The more times a content item is accessed by users, the more popular it is. When suggesting related content items to a user, the content items in a group may be suggested according to their respective popularity ranks so that the more popular content items are suggested to the user before the less popular content items.","A group of related content items may have different formats. For example, some may be texts and others may be audio or video clips. Consequently, different content items may have different amounts of data (e.g., different numbers of bits). When suggesting and sending several related content items to a client device for presentation to a user, in particular embodiments, a proxy server may take into consideration the type and capabilities of the client device used by the user, such as its processor speed, memory size, network connection bandwidth, etc. For example, if the client device is a desktop computer having a wired network connection (e.g., an Ethernet connection), where the connection has a relatively high bandwidth, the proxy server may suggest and send content items (e.g., audio or video clips) that have relatively large amounts of data to the client device. Since the client device has a relatively fast network connection, the content items may be downloaded to the client device within a relatively short time (e.g., less than a minute). On the other hand, if the client device is a mobile telephone having a wireless network connection, where the connection has a relatively low bandwidth, the proxy server may suggest and send content items (e.g., texts) that have relatively small amounts of data to the client device first. This way, the user is able to view some content items right away and does not have to wait long for the content items to be downloaded to the client device. If the user chooses to (e.g., the user asks for more related content items), the proxy server can still suggest and send additional content items (e.g., audio or video clips) that have relatively large amounts of data to the client device.","In addition, when the proxy server downloads content items for caching, the proxy server may filter out unsafe or undesirable content items. Consequently, any cached content item presented to the user is guaranteed to be legitimate, safe, and free of malware.","In some embodiments, a proxy server may serve a group of users via their respective client devices. When a user accesses a web page (e.g., the user's home page), the proxy server may incorporate cached content items that are considered popular during the current time period in the web page for presentation to the user.  illustrates an example web page  that includes popular network content. In this case, web page  is divided into two portions. Portion  includes the regular content of web page . Portion  is reserved for the cached content. A number of the most popular subject matters (e.g., the top 10 most popular subject matters) during the current time period may be listed in portion . Each subject matter may correspond to a cached content group and be described by some keywords and associated with a clickable link. The user may click on a link to access and view cached content items in the corresponding group, which relate to the corresponding subject matter.","Sometimes, a web page may include a number of components (e.g., frames), and each component may include some specific content. The cached content items may be incorporated in a particular component of a web page.  illustrates an example web page  that incorporates popular content items cached by a proxy server. In this case, web page  includes four frames , , , , and each frame includes some content. Fames , , and  each include the regular content of web page . However, frame  is customized to include some content items cached by the proxy server.","For example, a proxy server may serve a group of users who are employees of a company. When a particular employee served by the proxy server accesses his\/her home page, the proxy server may include content items made popular by other employees (e.g., the other employees have accessed those content items many times) in the home page. The employee now has a chance to view those content items that his\/her colleagues consider important or interesting.","Particular embodiments may be implemented on one or more computer systems.  illustrates an example computer system , which may implement a proxy server (e.g., proxy servers A and B). In particular embodiments, one or more computer systems  perform one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein. In particular embodiments, one or more computer systems  provide functionality described or illustrated herein. In particular embodiments, software running on one or more computer systems  performs one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein or provides functionality described or illustrated herein. Particular embodiments include one or more portions of one or more computer systems .","This disclosure contemplates any suitable number of computer systems . This disclosure contemplates computer system  taking any suitable physical form. As example and not by way of limitation, computer system  may be an embedded computer system, a system-on-chip (SOC), a single-board computer system (SBC) (such as, for example, a computer-on-module (COM) or system-on-module (SOM)), a desktop computer system, a laptop or notebook computer system, an interactive kiosk, a mainframe, a mesh of computer systems, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a server, or a combination of two or more of these. Where appropriate, computer system  may include one or more computer systems ; be unitary or distributed; span multiple locations; span multiple machines; or reside in a cloud, which may include one or more cloud components in one or more networks. Where appropriate, one or more computer systems  may perform without substantial spatial or temporal limitation one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein. As an example and not by way of limitation, one or more computer systems  may perform in real time or in batch mode one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein. One or more computer systems  may perform at different times or at different locations one or more steps of one or more methods described or illustrated herein, where appropriate.","In particular embodiments, computer system  includes a processor , memory , storage , an input\/output (I\/O) interface , a communication interface , and a bus . Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular computer system having a particular number of particular components in a particular arrangement, this disclosure contemplates any suitable computer system having any suitable number of any suitable components in any suitable arrangement.","In particular embodiments, processor  includes hardware for executing instructions, such as those making up a computer program. As an example and not by way of limitation, to execute instructions, processor  may retrieve (or fetch) the instructions from an internal register, an internal cache, memory , or storage ; decode and execute them; and then write one or more results to an internal register, an internal cache, memory , or storage . In particular embodiments, processor  may include one or more internal caches for data, instructions, or addresses. This disclosure contemplates processor  including any suitable number of any suitable internal caches, where appropriate.
