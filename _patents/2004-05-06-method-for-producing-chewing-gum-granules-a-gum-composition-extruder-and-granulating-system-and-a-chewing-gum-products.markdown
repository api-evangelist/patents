{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to a method for producing chewing gum granules, which method comprises at least the steps of a) feeding a gum composition into an extruder; b) pressurizing the gum composition in the extruder; c) extruding the gum composition through a die means; d) cutting the extruded gum composition in a liquid filled chamber. The present invention further relates to a gum composition extruder and granulating system comprising an extruder with at least one inlet and an outlet, and granulating device communicating with the outlet of the extruder and having a die means for extruding the gum composition.","A method with the steps a) to d) is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,117,645. Here the gum composition is mixed and blended in molten state at an elevated temperature of about 120\u00b0 C. and subsequently cooled somewhat in a heat exchanger and fed to the inlet of an extruder. The extruder delivers the gum composition for extrusion through orifices in a pellet cutting head located in a water-filled chamber. As the pellets are formed in the chamber a slurry of pellets and water is formed in the chamber, and the pellets are conveyed hydraulically to a holding tank. Although the water in the chamber at the cutting head cools the extruded and cut pellets after the extrusion, the blended gum composition is nevertheless subjected to elevated temperature influences for an extended period. According to U.S. Pat. No. 4,117,645 the gum pellets are kept suspended in water until they are to be used in the formulation of a chewing gum composition.","WO 02\/094032 describes a similar process of pelletizing. A gum composition is also in this case mixed and blended together in bulk at an elevated temperature, and flavours and sweeteners are added and blended together with the other ingredients. Then the gum composition is cooled and cut into centre pieces. These centre pieces are conveyed to the extruder where they are re-heated and extruded through the pellet cutting head. After cooling in the water, the cut pellets are dried, dusted with an anti-agglomerating compound, classified, and then coated by conventional panning techniques to create finished gum products.","It is a purpose of the present invention to improve the taste quality of the gum product, in particular in relation to delicate tastes in the gum.","With a view to this, the method according to the present invention is characterized in that at least one flavour including fragile flavour components is added to the gum composition in the extruder and that the temperature and pressure of the thus flavoured gum composition is controlled so that the temperature of the flavoured gum composition is below 70\u00b0 C. when the pressure of the flavoured gum composition is in the range from 1 to 5 hPa, whereas the pressure of the flavoured gum composition is of at least 5 hPa if the temperature of the flavoured gum composition exceeds 70\u00b0 C.","By adding flavour to the gum composition in the extruder the flavour is added immediately before the composition is extruded through the die means into the water filled chamber where the extruded and cut chewing gum composition is immediately cooled to low temperatures. The flavour is only subjected to elevated temperatures during the extrusion, such as only during the latter part thereof, and the short duration of the extrusion and the quick cooling in the water prevents or reduces decomposition of fragile flavours components, thus preserving a maximum of flavour components. This is especially important for natural flavours in order, to maintain the full natural taste of the flavour. Beside one or more flavours, sweeteners and other ingredients can of course be added to the gum composition in the extruder.","By controlling the temperature of the flavoured gum composition to be below 70\u00b0 C., when the pressure of the flavoured gum composition is in the range from 1 to 5 hPa, many of the flavours of temperature sensitive type in gum compositions will well accept temporary temperature rises of up to 70\u00b0 C. In case the flavours have a low boiling point of about 25\u00b0 C. it can be an advantage to keep said temperature below 50\u00b0 C.","During extrusion through the die means higher temperatures are often required in order to obtain an acceptable production speed. The higher temperatures than 70\u00b0 C. can be acceptable without evaporation of flavours by keeping the flavoured gum composition at pressures of at least 5 hPa.","The mixing of gum composition and flavour in the extruder causes heating. Although it is possible to cool the mixed composition in an open cooler prior to the final extrusion through the die means, it is preferred that the flavoured gum composition is maintained enclosed in the extruder and possible subsequent equipment until the extrusion in step c). By keeping the mixed composition enclosed in the extruder evaporation of flavour components is avoided, and the mixed composition is furthermore more quickly extruded into the liquid filled chamber when an intermediate cooling is avoided.","It is preferred that the extruder controls the temperature and pressure of the flavoured gum composition, e.g. by adjusting the speed of the extruder screw in dependency of the formulation of the flavoured gum composition and according to the actual configuration of the die means, or by adjusting the amount of heat delivered from the extruder to the composition. The extruder can alternatively have fixed operating parameters with the consequence that no actual control is done by the extruder. In that case it is required to finely adapt the formulation of the gum composition to the extruder and die means, and such adaptation influences the final gum product and is thus not preferred.","The flavour(s) added can take several forms, such as liquid flavour agents, e.g. an essence or oil, which can be encapsulated in a protective matrix. Other flavour(s) such as dry flavour, or mixtures of liquid and dry flavours can also be used.","In addition to adding flavours it is, if desired, also possible to add at least one sweetener to the gum composition in the extruder. Such a sweetener can be a natural sweetener, but preferably it is a high potent sweetener, such as one or more selected from the group comprising dipeptides and N-sulfonylamides.","When both sweetener and flavour are to be added in dry form it is possible to add each of them by individual supply devices on the extruder. It is, however, preferred that the dry flavour and powder sweetener are blended before entering the extruder as this allows a more simple extruder construction.","The extruder can typically have a hopper for feeding gum base particles or pellets into the extruder, and such a hopper can be utilized for addition of several different ingredients by blending the gum base pellets with dry flavour and\/or powder sweetener before entering the extruder.","The very advantageous full flavour taste obtained by the method according to the present invention can be utilized to produce high-quality gum tablets by conveying the flavoured and extruded gum composition, cut into granules, to a tablet pressing apparatus and including it in compressed chewing gum tablets. The compression can be performed at suitably low temperatures, such as well below 50\u00b0 C., so that all flavour components are fully utilized.","As mentioned above the flavoured gum composition can, if considered suitable in relation to the desired properties of the final gum product, be provided with a sweetener, such as a high potent sweetener, that is slowly released from the chewing gum composition. If a quick release of sweetness during the initial chew is also desirable the tablet pressing apparatus can in addition to the granulated gum composition also be supplied with at least one bulk sweetener, preferably sorbitol, for it to be included in the compressed gum product.","The extruded and cut, flavoured gum granules can have a rather large average diameter, e.g. in the range from 3 mm to 5 mm and can be provided with a suitable coating for use as a flowable final gum product. In case the granulated gum composition is for use in tableted compressed gum products, the extruded and cut gum composition has preferably an average diameter in the range from 0.1 mm to 2.5 mm, suitably from 0.25 to 1.95 mm in order to provide easy and comparably compact filling of the tableting apparatus and a good texture in the compressed gum tablets.","As mentioned above gum base can be provided as pellets to the extruder. However, it is also possible to feed gum base in a viscous, non-solid state to the extruder. In an advantageously embodiment the gum base is obtained from a gum base production line. In this embodiment the gum base is lead directly from the production line to the extruder. Thus storage of the gum base and an optional pelletizing step can be avoided. The viscous, non-solid gum base can be provided in pure form to the extruder or it can be mixed with e.g. a sweetener to form a gum composition. Such mixing is easy to perform, e.g. at the inlet to the extruder because the gum base is in a non-solid state.","According to an embodiment the gum base from the production line has a temperature in the range 95\u00b0 C.-135\u00b0 C., preferably in the range 105\u00b0 C.-125\u00b0 C.","For some purposes it is preferred that the gum base is cooled to a temperature of 70\u00b0 C. and below, suitable below 55\u00b0 C. This may be necessary when the pressure in the extruder is low, e.g. in the range 1 hPa-5 hPa, to e.g. avoid evaporation of flavour.","The present invention furthermore relates to a gum composition extruder and granulating system comprising an extruder with at least one inlet and an outlet, and a granulating device communicating with the outlet of the extruder and having a die means for extruding the gum composition. In order to achieve the abovementioned advantages, the system according to the invention is characterized in that said at least one inlet of the extruder communicates with a supply for gum composition and at least a supply for gum flavour.","In an embodiment said at least one inlet of the extruder communicates with a supply for at least one sweetener so that both flavour and sweetener are added to the composition in the extruder in order to obtain during mastication the desirable extended release for both high-quality flavour and sweetener.","Instead of using several inlets on the extruder, the system can include a blender device which blends gum composition and gum flavour and possibly also gum sweetener before it supplies the blended gum materials to the inlet of the extruder.","In an embodiment of a suitable simple design said supply for gum flavour includes a nozzle for spaying liquid flavour onto gum composition pellets. Apart from having a simple construction, the nozzle for spaying liquid flavour onto pellets can also be used as retro-fit equipment for installation on existing extruders so that provision for separate liquid inlets on the extruder is avoided.","In another embodiment a hopper for supplying gum composition pellets is mounted at one inlet, and said supply for gum flavour includes a liquid dosing device mounted at another inlet of the extruder. This embodiment can e.g. be of use when addition of very fragile flavours is to take place at a shorter distance from the die means than the distance to said one inlet.","As used herein the term \u201cgum base\u201d refers in general to a commercially available gum base suitable for production of chewing gum. Such gum bases normally comprise natural and\/or synthetic resins and optionally other ingredients.","The term \u201cgum composition\u201d as used herein may be a gum base as defined above, a gum base comprising one or more ingredients (e.g. colouring agents, fillers, non-sensitive flavours capable of sustaining mixing of gum base at temperatures of about 120\u00b0 C. for longer periods of time, such at 10 to 15 minutes, etc.), or it may be a chewing gum composition as defined below.","The term \u201cchewing gum composition\u201d is the final formulation, which constitutes at least a part of the compressed chewing gum product ready for sale to or use by the consumer. The chewing gum composition comprises at least flavour an typically also sweeteners and optionally other ingredients like colouring agents, pharmaceutical agents, enzymes, humectants, flavour enhancers, anticaking agents etc. Furthermore \u201cchewing gum product\u201d denotes a ready for use chewing gum, e.g. comprising compressed granules of chewing gum composition possibly mixed with bulk sweeteners, or other ingredients and optionally coated.","The term \u201cgum granules\u201d or \u201cgranules\u201d as used herein refers to particulate material of gum composition. The granules can have the size of pellets, viz. sizes in the range from 3 to 6 mm, but preferably they have average diameters below about 3 mm, such as in the range of 0.1 to 2.5 mm.","The term \u201caverage diameter\u201d as used herein is defined as the diameter of a sphere having the same volume as the granule. Although the granules produced according to the present invention mostly are substantially spherically, variations in shape may occur, and according to the definition granules having the same volume also have the same average diameter.","Unless otherwise indicated all percentages are weight % (denoted % Wt.).","In  a chewing gum granulating system generally denoted  comprises at least an extruder  and a granulating apparatus  having a chamber  with a die plate . The extruder  is equipped with a first inlet  for feeding gum composition to the extruder  and with a second inlet  for feeding flavour to the gum composition in the extruder . The gum composition is fed from a gum supply device to the first inlet, and the flavour is fed from a flavour supply device to the second inlet. There can also be further inlets for feeding e.g. one or more sweeteners. When several flavours with very different capabilities to cope with elevated temperatures are to be added to the gum composition in the extruder, one inlet for the more stable flavour can be provided together with or in proximity to the first inlet , and another inlet for the less stable flavour can be located in closer proximity to the outlet end of the extruder. In this manner it is possible to control the holding time of the individual flavours within the extruder to the sensibility of the flavours to exposure to elevated temperatures.","The extruder  delivers pressurized chewing gum composition to the inlet side of die plate  via a flow connection between an outlet on the extruder and an inlet of the granulating apparatus. The flow connection is provided with a valve , which in one position provides unrestricted passage from the extruder to the die plate, and in another position connect the extruder outlet with a drain pipe  leading to a receptacle  for discharged gum composition. Although it is possible to re-cycle discarded gum composition to inlet  it is not preferred because the added flavour will also be re-cycled.","The extruder  is a single screw extruder provided with a drive motor , preferably an electric motor with settable speed, or a hydraulic motor. The extruder can have one or more heating devices ,  which can be included in the barrel of the extruder or can be associated with the screw. The heating devices can e.g. be of electrical heater type or heat exchanger type where the latter can be supplied with heating fluid such as hot water or hot oil.","The granulating chamber  has an inlet  for cooling liquid and an outlet  for a slurry of suspended granules and cooling liquid. A pump  supplies cooling liquid via an inlet pipe . The pump can be fed with fresh cooling liquid from a source (not shown) or it can be supplied with re-circulated cooling liquid from a strainer unit  via a pipe . A control valve (not shown) regulates the degree of re-circulation. The system can also have an intercooler (not shown) for cooling re-circulated cooling liquid.","Cutting means, such as rotating knives , act on the outlet side of the die plate. The chewing gum composition extruded through openings in the die plate is cut into granules by the cutting means. The cutting means can be reciprocating knives, but is preferably embodied as rotating knives mounted at the end of a drive axle  which is driven by a motor , such as an electric motor or a hydraulic drive motor. The motor preferably has settable speed.","The die plate is exchangeable so that several different die plates with different configuration of the openings can be used in the same granulating apparatus. The actual die plate configuration is chosen according to the desired size of granules.","An outlet pipe  connects outlet  with a dryer device in the form of strainer unit , in which the granules are separated from the cooling liquid. The dryer device can be of any commercially available type. The dryer can be associated with a mixer  wherein the granules are mixed with e.g. anti-agglomerating agent, sweetener, flavour, tabletting aids etc. to form a mixture. The system can optionally includes a classifying unit  with one or more sieves. Granules are either directly after straining and possible dusting or coating or after a possible intermediate storage and\/or mixing with granules of different sizes or types fed to a tablet pressing machine  in which the granules are included in compressed gum tablets.","In the following description of further embodiments the same reference numerals as used in  are for the sake of simplicity used to denote features of the kind and function. Only difference with respect to the previous embodiment(s) are described.","The extruder depicted in  has two screws journalled side by side in the extruder barrel and two motors  for independent control of the individual screw. The screws are preferably counter-rotating, and it is also possible to use only one motor  in combination with a suitable gearing.","The pump  feeding the granulating chamber is connected to a supply  for cooling liquid, and spent cooling liquid is discharged from strainer  to a drain .","The first inlet  includes a hopper mounted on the extruder barrel above the first inlet. The supply for gum composition includes a storage unit for gum pellets and a gravity feeder with a control valve for dosing the desired amount of gum pellets down into the hopper. The storage unit with gravity feeder and controls are e.g. available from the German company Brabender Technologie KG.","The supply is for liquid flavour, which from a container  and a metering device  is supplied under pressure to a nozzle in a spray device . The spray device can be mounted within the hopper or above the hopper and is directed at the supplied pellets. The liquid flavour is sprayed onto the pellets.","The embodiment of  is in particular suitable for mixing the gum pellets with dry flavour and possibly also sweetener. A blender  includes a motor  with a vertical drive shaft for blades  inside the blender. The blender is connected to a storage  for gum pellets, a storage  for flavour, and a storage  for sweetener. Each storage has dosing or metering units to individually control the amounts of material supplied to the blender so that the desired gum composition is obtained in the extruder. The blender and storage system can be of the type \u201cGraviBatch Blender\u201d from the German company Brabender Technologie KG. The extruder can also be supplied with supplies for liquid flavour as described above.","The gum base used in the method according to the invention may be any water-insoluble gum base well known in the art. Illustrative examples of suitable polymers for gum base include, natural and synthetic elastomers, resins and rubbers. For example, suitable polymers include substances of vegetable origin such as rubber latex solids, chicle, gelutong, nispero, rosidinha, pendare, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, gutta percha, or crown gum. Synthetic elastomers such as butadiene-styrene copolymers, isobutylene-isoprene copolymers, polyethylene, polyisobutylene, petroleum wax or polyvinylacetate and mixtures thereof are also useful in gum base.","Gum base may also contain elastomer solvents to aid in softening the gum base. Such materials may include methyl, glycerol or pentaerythritol esters of rosins; methyl, glycerol or pentaerythritol esters of modified rosins, such as hydrogenated, dimerized or polymerized rosins; mixtures thereof and the like.","A variety of traditional ingredients such as plasticizers or softeners, such as lanolin, stearic acid, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, glyceryl, triacetate, glycerine, natural waxes, petroleum waxes such as polyurethane waxes, paraffin waxes and microcrystalline waxes, may also be incorporated into a gum base to obtain a variety of desirable textures and consistency properties.","Other conventional ingredients that may be present in a gum base include a hydrophilic-type detackifier that will absorb saliva and become slippery. The hydrophilic type detackifier should preferably be incompatible with the elastomer and solvent for the elastomer.","Gum base may also include hard waxes that serve as lubricants. Examples of such hard waxes include candelilla wax, paraffin wax, carnauba wax, ozokerite, oricuri, microcrystalline wax and the like.","Gum base may also include a softening agent and\/or lubricant that may comprise one or more hydrogenated vegetable or animal fats preferably having a high melting point above about 22\u00b0 C.","Gum base may also include an emulsifier to impart hydrophilic properties to the gum base. The emulsifier causes saliva to be absorbed into the gum base, thereby making the gum base slippery. Examples of such emulsifiers may include glyceryl monostearate, phosphatides such as lecithin and sephalin, mixtures thereof and the like.","The gum base may also include particles of chalk or the like as a bulking agent and\/or texturizer. Examples of such texturizing agents or inert fillers suitable for use in gum base include, calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, alumina, magnesium carbonate, talc, aluminum silicates, mixtures thereof and the like.","The flavouring agents suitable for use in the present invention can e.g. be a natural, natural-identical, or artificial flavouring substance, or a mixture thereof. At room temperature the flavouring agent may be in solid state as a dry powder or flavour granules, or in liquid state as an essence or oil, or mixtures thereof. The dry flavours may include standard powder (i.e. a liquid flavouring agent mixed homogeneously with a powder carrier material), spray dried powder whereby the flavouring agent is coated by a protective layer (i.e. microencapsulated), freeze dried powder, or flavour granules. Flavour granules differ from the powders by substantially larger particle sizes (approximately 500-1500 \u03bcm) compared to powders (approximately 10-150 \u03bcm). Optionally these flavour granules may also comprise a colouring agent and thereby provide a visual effect in the product. Furthermore, seeds derived from berries and fruits may also be included as dry flavouring agents.","The liquid flavouring agents may include essences also known as extracts which are concentrated flavouring agents produced either by reducing a liquid until it is a syrup or by dissolving a spice or flavouring oil in alcohol, and essential oils also known as flavouring oils which are highly concentrated essences.","Preferably, the solid and the liquid flavouring agents are encapsulated in a protective matrix protecting them from heat and moisture and thereby reducing the oxidation and evaporation of the liquid flavouring agent. As a result the stability of the flavouring agent is markedly improved extending the shelf life of the product. These encapsulating processes are well known to those skilled in the art.","A variety of one or more flavouring agents may be used. Flavouring agents suitable for use in the present invention include natural, natural-identical, and\/or artificial flavouring substance, or mixtures thereof, in their solid and\/or in their liquid state.","The person skilled in the art will recognize that natural and artificial flavouring agents may be combined in any sensorially acceptable blends.","Sweeteners can e.g. be selected among bulk sweeteners such as sugar sweeteners, less or non-sweet sugars or polysaccharides, non-sugar sweeteners, such as the polyols isomalt, sorbitol, sorbitol syrup, mannitol, xylitol, hexa-resorcinol, maltitol, isomaltol, erythriol, lactitol, xylose, tagatose and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (maltitol syrup); artificial high potent sweeteners or intense sweeteners such as the dipeptides aspartame, neotame and alitame; N-sulfonylamides such as saccharin including the salts thereof and acesulfam including the salts thereof; or any combination thereof.","The gum composition and gum base may optionally be mixed with colouring agents to obtain desirable visually effects. Useful commercially available colouring agents are DUA LAKE or EURO LAKE, which can be provided in various colours. Natural colours like e.g. riboflavin, beta-carotene, chlorophyll and hibiscus are also suitable. Optionally gum granules in different colours may be used to provide a tablet with more colours.","During extrusion of the gum composition the differential pressure between the gum composition in the extruder and the gum composition in the liquid filled chamber, i.e. over the die device is suitable above 10 bar, preferably above 18 bar, such as in the range of 25 to 90 bar.","The tablet pressing machine  may be any conventional tablet pressing machine capable of pressing tablets comprising gum granules. The final tablets preferably have a weight in the range of 0.5 to 3.5 g, conveniently in the range of 1.0 to 2.5 g.","As mentioned previously, the gum composition or gum base may be feed to the extruder as conventionally pellets or it may be feed to the extruder as a hot viscous coherent composition directly from the gum base production line. The hot composition will normally have a temperature in the range of 95 to 135\u00b0 C., preferably in the range 105 to 125\u00b0 C., which is sufficient to heat the extruder. In this case it is not necessary to have heating means on the extruder. Sometimes it may be advantageously to cool the gum base before it enters the extruder to obtain temperatures below 70\u00b0 C. The cooling may be cooling using gas or liquid as cooling medium. After being extruded to the die plate, the gum composition is cooled by the water in the granulating chamber. Optionally the gum base production line may feed several extruders to obtain granules with different size and characteristics.","A commercially available gum base based on synthetic resins (DANfree T firm 1, available from Gumlink A\/S, Denmark) was used to produce chewing gum products according to the invention.","Gum base in the form of pellets and menthol flavour crystals (MENTHOL BP\/USP, available from SHARP MENTHOL INDIA LIMITED, India), aspartame powder (Aspartame, available from ZHUN YONGXINRONG BIOCHEMICAL PRODUCTS CO., LDT, China), and acesulfame-K (Sunett, particle size A, available from Nutrinova GmbH, Germany) were added to the hopper at the first inlet . Mint oil (PD3-68H, type 1100102, available from A.M.TODD COMPANY, U.S.A) in an amount of 4.22% Wt. was dosed to the second inlet and mixed to the gum composition in the extruder.
