{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This invention relates to a route guidance system for vehicles.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a route guidance system for vehicles, comprising central computing apparatus, transmitting apparatus by way of which the central computing apparatus is informed of the positions of respective vehicles on a road network and by way of which the vehicles are supplied with route guidance data calculated by the central computing apparatus as to the best routes for the respective vehicles to take to respective desired destinations, said transmitting apparatus including transmitting devices for carrying by the respective vehicles and by way of which the central computing apparatus is informed as to their respective desired destinations, informing apparatus serving to inform the central computing apparatus as to traffic congestion on said network, and presenting devices for carrying by the respective vehicles and arranged to present respective instructions to the drivers of respective vehicles as to the routes to be taken to their respective desired destinations.","According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a route guidance method for vehicles, comprising informing central computing apparatus of the positions of respective vehicles on a road network, informing said central computing apparatus as to traffic congestion on said network, informing said central computing apparatus as to the respective desired destinations of vehicles, supplying to the vehicles route guidance data calculated by the central computing apparatus as to the best routes for the respective vehicles to take to their respective desired destinations, and presenting respective instructions to the drivers of respective vehicles as to the routes to be taken to their respective desired destinations.","Owing to these aspects of the invention, drivers can be informed as to the best routes for their vehicles to take to their respective destinations, in such manner that traffic congestion pertinent to the routes is taken into account.","Advantageously, the transmitting apparatus transmits to a vehicle a short burst of route guidance data relating to the best route to the desired destination of the vehicle and then ceases transmitting route guidance data to that vehicle, preferably ceases transmitting to that vehicle any data whatsoever, unless and until a need for further transmission arises, for example the traffic congestion pertinent to the given route changes significantly.","Thus, according to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a route guidance system for vehicles, comprising central computing apparatus, transmitting apparatus by way of which the central computing apparatus is informed of the positions of respective vehicles on a road network and by way of which the vehicles are supplied with route guidance data calculated by the central computing apparatus as to the best routes for the respective vehicles to take to respective desired destinations, said transmitting apparatus including transmitting devices for carrying by the respective vehicles and by way of which the central computing apparatus is informed as to their respective desired destinations, and presenting devices for carrying by the respective vehicles and arranged to present respective instructions to the drivers of respective vehicles as to the routes to be taken to their respective desired destinations, and wherein, in respect of each vehicle, said transmitting apparatus provides a channel of communication which is opened to transmit said route guidance data to the vehicle in a short burst and is then closed, so that transmission to the vehicle via said channel ceases, unless and until a need for further transmission via said channel to said vehicle arises.","Similarly, according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a route guidance method for vehicles, comprising informing central computing apparatus of the positions of respective vehicles on a road network, informing said central computing apparatus as to the respective desired destinations of vehicles, supplying to the vehicles route guidance data calculated by the central computing apparatus as to the best routes for the respective vehicles to take to their respective desired destinations, and presenting respective instructions to the drivers of respective vehicles as to the routes to be taken to their respective desired destinations, said supplying of said route guidance data to the vehicles comprising, for each vehicle, opening a channel of communication to transmit the route guidance data to the vehicle in a short burst and then closing said channel of communication so that transmission to that vehicle via said channel ceases, unless and until a need for further transmission via said channel to said vehicle arises.","A particular advantage of these two aspects of the invention is that the transmission channel need not be kept permanently open.","Moreover, it is advantageous if, when a driver of a vehicle wishes to inform the central computing apparatus of his desired destination, that apparatus is informed by way of a human operator to whom the desired destination is communicated by presenting means, preferably verbal and aural, and who not only feeds the relevant information into the central computing apparatus, but also communicates orally with the driver. In this way, the driver does not need to communicate with the central computing apparatus by way of a key pad, for example, and he has the comfort of dealing with a fellow human being.","If desired, upon the central computing apparatus being given the desired destination of a vehicle, the driver is informed as to the likely journey time.","In order that the invention may be clearly and completely disclosed, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawing which shows a diagram of a route guidance system for road vehicles.","Referring to the drawing, the system includes an off-board call centre  with which respective in-vehicle devices (of which one is shown and reference ) can communicate via respective connections  of respective channels  of communication provided by a mobile telephone network. The in-vehicle devices are installed in respective vehicles of subscribers to the system and each device contains a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver, a mobile telephone device, a speech synthesiser, a control microprocessor and a memory for speech synthesis. The memory of the device  stores a vocabulary of words and phrases. Each word or phrase is activated by a token in a compressed data message supplied by the computer  via a connection  and giving a calculated best route to a desired destination. The compressed data message is received by the in-vehicle device  at the commencement of the journey and comprises a stream of what are called \u201croute points\u201d, which are GPS positions along the best route, the message including, for some of the route points, respective strings of tokens. For any best route, route points are provided frequently and in particular at every position at which an instruction to the driver is required to be made (for every manoeuvre that the driver is required to make, there may be up to three route points where instructions are given and in advance of the actual position where the manoeuvre must be made), and both before and after each possible diversion from the best route, and, in any case, at intervals not greater than, say, 1 mile. A string of tokens generates speech in at least one spoken sentence by assembling the words and phrases in the order that the relevant tokens are triggered by the arrival of the vehicle at a given latitude and longitude.","A human operator in the call centre  and an off-board central computer  for route guidance can communicate with each other, whilst the operator and an off-board central computer  for traffic congestion can also communicate with each other. The computer  receives information as to traffic congestion from a number of sources, such as roadside speed sensors and traffic reports for a road network. The computers  and  can also intercommunicate so that the computer  can supply to the computer  RTTI (real time traffic information) and HTI (historical traffic information). HTI is formatted traffic information that has been compiled over preceding weeks and months as an output of the computer .","The computer  intercommunicates with a website  so that the user can access the computer  via the website  to supply route preferences in particular; with an off-board traffic repository  which stores historical traffic information and road closures data that overrides the default link impedances (speeds) from an off-board map database ; and with an off-board API (application programming interface)  which provides an interface to the map database . The API intercommunicates with the map database  via requests and responses. The map database  has, in effect standard default link impedances which are dependent upon the expected speeds of traffic along respective links of the road network. The computer  intercommunicates with an off-board historical traffic information database  so that the computer  can access the database  to supply HTI to the database  which stores HTI and which supplies HTI to an off-board map compiler  which is used to format map data from an independent vendor together with RTTI, HTI and the standard impedance (speed) for each road link. The map compiler  in turn communicates with the map database . The computer  also intercommunicates with an off-board database  so that the computer  can access the database  to supply user data to the database  and to update RTTI and HTI relevant to the routes. The database  stores data as to the user's profile (such as the user's name and address and his type of vehicle), the user's preferred routes (such as the shortest route, the fastest route, or a route using motorways or avoiding motorways), and predefined routes for which the user would wish to be alerted to changing traffic conditions. The database  also intercommunicates with the operator in the call centre  so that the operator can access the information in the database and can amend it at the request of the user; with the website  so that the user can access via the website the information in the database  and can amend it via the website; and with a customer service department  so that the department can access the information in the database and can amend it as required. The computer  can also communicate directly with each in-vehicle device via a connection . For ease of explanation the connections ,  and  for one device  are shown as separate connections but, in practice, they will all be a single channel  of communication, for example a single mobile telephone connection.","The method of operation of the system is as follows. A driver in a vehicle uses the device  to telephone the call centre operator, giving his intended destination, while the device  supplies automatically over the connection  to the computer  initially its CLI (calling line identity) and then the GPS position of its vehicle. The operator supplies the desired destination to the computer , which calculates the best route, taking into account the user's route preferences and also the traffic conditions, particularly traffic congestion, as supplied by the computer  and the repository . The computer , via the connection , downloads in a single transmission to the device  a compressed data message including all route points in respect of the entire best route to the desired destination, these route points including \u201ctrigger\u201d points along the route where strings of tokens attached to the trigger points will cause the driver to be given spoken instructions by the speech synthesiser. The route points included in the compressed data message are representations of respective positions, i.e. latitudes and longitudes, such that, when the vehicle attains a particular position, i.e. latitude and longitude, as determined by the GPS receiver, the appropriate instructions are given by the speech synthesiser. The communication channel  is then closed, so that the computer  ceases to communicate with the device  for the rest of the journey, unless the driver requests a different route or destination, or unless traffic conditions have changed, in which case the user is alerted of that change by the channel  being re-opened. At each trigger point, identified by its GPS position, the control microprocessor in the device  identifies the relevant position, whereupon the relevant token(s) cause(s) the speech synthesiser to instruct the driver as to what action to take (for example, at a roundabout, \u201cturn left\u201d, \u201cturn right\u201d, or \u201cstraight over\u201d). If the driver is alerted to a change of traffic conditions by the computer  re-opening the channel , he can, by simply pressing a button of the device , request to have a new best route calculated and downloaded from the computer  in a new compressed data message.","If the driver switches off the vehicle ignition, the route is retained for, say, one hour and navigation is resumed when the vehicle moves off again. Beyond one hour, the device  automatically re-sets and the driver will need to re-start the route guidance method from scratch.","The device  internally checks that the vehicle has not left the best route. In the compressed data stream which has been downloaded to the device , the distance between each pair of route points is defined. The device  continuously checks the distance actually travelled from the first route point of a pair and, if the vehicle is detected as having travelled a greater distance than the reference distance between the two route points without having reached the second point of the pair, the device  warns the driver by a spoken message from the speech synthesiser that he has left the best route. The driver may then request a re-route to the desired destination by pressing the button on the device  to open the channel  and obtain a new best route from the computer . Alternatively, if the user has configured on the website  that automatic re-routing is required, then the device  will automatically request a new best route by opening the channel  and communicating with the computer  when it detects that the vehicle has left the best route.","The system described with reference to the drawing has the advantages of being relatively easy to use and of being relatively inexpensive both as regards the cost of equipment (because a minimal amount of equipment is provided in-vehicle) and the running costs (particularly because the channel of communication between the computer  and the in-vehicle device  is open only when necessary and for a very short time period)."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
