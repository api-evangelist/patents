title: Method and system for automated online college scholarship donations
abstract: In one example, we describe methods and systems for automated online merchant charity donations. In one embodiment, a donation agent interacting with a merchant website can offer an online user an option to allocate at least a portion of a payment for or price of a purchase, associated with a transaction made by the user via the merchant website, to be donated by a merchant corresponding to the merchant website on behalf of the user to a charity of the user's choosing. If the online user exercises the option, the donation agent can calculate an amount of the donation to be made and store the calculated donation amount in a database. The donation agent can disburse the calculated donation amount to the charity selected by the customer. The method also works for the off-line model. The points earned can be combined with a college scholarship award mechanism. The system and method describe authentication and the way the charity funding is distributed, with respect to the college tuition and scholarship award.

","Example 2","See FIG. ","Example 3","See FIG. ","Example 4","See FIG. "],"p":["This application is related to a provisional application 61\/840,286, filed 27-Jun.-2013. All the teachings of the provisional application are incorporated here by reference. The current application claims priority to the filing date of the provisional application.","Nowadays almost anything can be bought online. In ever-increasing numbers, merchants are offering goods and services via websites. On a typical merchant website, a customer can navigate the website by entering commands via a computing device that provides a connection and an interface to the website. Using the computing device and the interface, the customer can, for example, search an inventory, select goods or services from the inventory, and add the selected items to a virtual shopping cart. When the customer has finished his or her selections, the customer can go through a check-out process to finalize a purchase of the items in the virtual shopping cart.","The check-out process can be interactive. For example, as part of the check-out process, the website can present interface displays, via the computing device, that solicit information from the customer, such as the customer's name, address, phone number, credit card information and the like. The customer, in response to prompts, dialog boxes and the like presented via the interface displays, can manipulate the computing device to provide requested information. Software responsible for the interface displays can process the information, either independently in communication with other software. Processing the information can include, for example, generating queries to solicit further information, performing error checking, performing arithmetic and logical operations on information, storing information, retrieving information in response to queries, and the like.","A company, SocialVest Ventures LLC, in Atlanta, Ga., USA, is in the charity business (www.socialvest.us). Another site is \u201cwww.IGive.com\u201d which is in the same field. However, the inventions and embodiments described here, below, have not been addressed or presented, in any prior art.","This disclosure relates to generally to embodiments of methods and systems for automated online merchant charity donations. More specifically, according to the embodiments, a donation agent interacting with a merchant website can offer an online user an option to allocate at least a portion of a payment for or price of a purchase, associated with a transaction made by the user via the merchant website, to be donated by a merchant corresponding to the merchant website on behalf of the user to a charity or charities of the user's choosing. If the online user exercises the option, the donation agent can, in response, calculate an amount of the donation to be made and store the calculated donation amount in a database.","The donation agent can disburse the calculated donation amount to the charity or charities selected by the customer. Further, pursuant to an agreement with the merchant corresponding to the merchant website, the donation agent can bill the merchant for services. The services can include, among others, the offering to the user of the donation option via the merchant website and the calculating and storing of the donation amount. The services can further include the disbursing of the calculated donation amount to the charity or charities selected by the user. The amount billed to the merchant can be predetermined by agreement. The amount billed to the merchant can be, for example, a predetermined percentage of the payment for or price of the purchase.","The arrangement described in the foregoing can be advantageous, among other reasons, because it can encourage donation to charitable causes. For example, merchants may be motivated to seek the favorable publicity of being associated with charitable causes by way of their websites. By providing the interactive donation capability on merchant websites, thereby providing the sought-after favorable publicity, the donation agent can facilitate the linking of e-commerce to the funding of charities. The donation agent can also encourage the participation of merchants by off-loading from the merchants the tasks of calculating and disbursing the charitable donations, in exchange for a modest fee.","The term \u201cdonation agent\u201d as used herein encompasses at least software and machines and\/or articles of manufacture that store and execute the software to perform the operations described herein. A donation agent can also include at least a portion of a network, such as the Web or the Internet.","Let's start with an example:","Description of donation agent:","Embodiments of the donation agent can provide a charitable service at online checkouts that allows shoppers to purchase what they like, through sites they already trust, while supporting their favorite causes. Customers can be twofold\u2014shoppers who currently purchase goods online and partner merchants who are enabled to make charitable donations. Shoppers who \u201ccheckout\u201d through the donation agent are able to have a portion of their purchase donated to a charity of their choice. The merchant donates the portion of the purchase for the shopper.","I. Avenues of Charitable Donation","There are at least two avenues in which the charitable giving can be done, in this example. One avenue includes embedding of the donation agent into the website of the merchant as another option for checkout. A second avenue includes providing an independent website that acts as an agent and drives member customers to the merchants' sites that are participating in charitable programs facilitated by the donation agent. The independent website also allows members to track their donation activities and donate directly to charities without having to make a purchase.","Note that \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour network\u201d or \u201cdonation network\u201d or \u201cSparo\u201d or \u201cour web site\u201d or \u201cour system\u201d refers to the donation agent\/website\/network. When referring to charities in this disclosure, the reference include non-profit organizations, as well.","A user performing a transaction via a merchant website can see, in a display of the merchant website associated with the transaction, a virtual \u201cshopping cart\u201d containing an item or items to be purchased by the user. The user can subsequently perform operations facilitated by the merchant website to finalize the transaction. For example, the operations can include the known \u201ccheckout\u201d process.","During the operations to finalize the transaction, operations by the donation agent can be invoked. The operations by the donation agent can include presenting, via a display, a list of selectable charities. The display can be by way of a display device associated with a computing device linked, for example via a network, to the merchant website. In response to an input indicating a choice of charity from the selectable list, the donation agent can automatically capture information associated with the transaction. The information can be captured by a \u201cback-end\u201d associated with the donation agent. Here, \u201cback-end\u201d encompasses at least software for processing the information, machines for executing the software, storage devices for storing the captured information, and portions of a network for linking the machines and the storage devices.","In particular, the donation agent can automatically calculate and store an amount of a charitable donation to be made to the selected charity based on the transaction. The amount of the charitable donation can be a variable amount, a fixed amount, an amount selected from a range of options, and the like. For example, the donation agent can calculate a predetermined percentage of a purchase price or payment associated with the transaction as the amount of the charitable donation, or based on the income level of the user, or based on the prior donations, or history, or preferences, or question\/answer, or personal folder\/data, or gift certificate, or proxy donation by friends or family or on a person's behalf, or anonymous. Or, it can be based on season or day of the calendar, e.g. Earth's Day, somebody's birthday, triggered by an event, Father's Day, July 4, Independence Day, or periodically applied, or formulated, or by an equation, or from a table or list, or from a curve or diagram, or randomly generated donation value and\/or date.","After the foregoing operations, the donation agent can bill (e.g., transmit an invoice to) the merchant associated with the merchant website for services performed by the donation agent. The amount billed to the merchant can be, for example, a predetermined fraction, percentage or share of the purchase price or payment associated with the transaction, or a fixed value, or a value with a min. amount, or a value with a max. amount, or a step-wise formula, or graduated amount with steps, or linear relationship, or quadratic relationship, or a polynomial relationship, or closed-form formula, or open-form formula, or linear relationship with a cap and\/or min., or rounded number, or truncated number, or from a table or list, or step function, or logarithmic function, or exponential function, or n-th power function of a variable, or a value from a range of numbers, or an integer value, or a real value, or random number, or a predetermined number, or based on a rule, based on a rule engine, based on if-then rules, based on conditions, or the like.","Further, the donation agent can disburse the amount of the charitable donation to the selected charity as part of services billed to the merchant. The billing and disbursement can be performed by the donation agent, for example, after payment pursuant to the transaction is made and verified.","The operations facilitated by the donation agent can further include presenting, via an interactive display, an option for a user to make an additional donation, beyond the amount automatically calculated as described in the foregoing. The additional donation can be from the user's personal funds, for example. The donation agent can further present an option for the user to become a member of a charitable program facilitated by the donation agent. In response to user input indicating that the user wants to exercise the option, the donation agent can enable the user to navigate to an independent website generated and supported by the donation agent, as described in more detail further on.","In non-limiting embodiments, the donation agent can include a charity application for each of known e-commerce platforms (e.g., Magento, OsCommerce . . . etc.), for example. Participating merchants can incorporate a charity application on respective websites, to be invoked during, e.g., the check-out process similar to PayPal. \u201cCharity application\u201d as used here encompasses at least software that is customized or customizable to various e-commerce platforms and\/or websites, and executable by a computing device to perform operations described herein. The charity applications could be customized for each of several existing ecommerce platforms, for example, or could be designed from scratch where needed. The donation agent can include APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for various charity applications that can facilitate customization.","A.

Similar to Categories and Products the donation agent can include a complete section for Charities and related programs. This section can allow adding Charities, managing Charity pages and other specifications, which can be completely customizable.","C. Custom Website Template Design\u2014Donation Agent Website.","D. Content & Product Upload to donation agent website.","Uploading content pages and website functionality including content from Charities and their Logos.","E. Social Network Tools and Implementation.","F. Application Programming Interface (API) Design.","The donation agent can include a Charity API for clients to use for custom deployment of a donation agent charity application onto their website. This can require secure authentication with encryption, placement of order and other activity in order to calculate donations. This can allow website backend and process the charities functionality and contributions.","G. Application Add-on for eCommerce Platforms\u2014e.g., Magento","H.

Contact Office Address #2","Embodiments of methods and systems for automated online merchant charity donations via the donation agent described in the preceding can include the following:","Software to implement the donation agent can execute in association with a merchant website. The software can generate interface displays on a display device, for example. The interface displays can accept inputs from a user entered via a computing device connected to a network such as the Internet, for example.","For example, the user may access a merchant website via the Internet, navigate the merchant website and execute one or more transactions to culminate in one or more purchases having a total purchase price. Pursuant to the purchase(s), functionality for collecting payment of the purchase price from the user may be invoked by the merchant website. For example, the functionality can be the regular \u201ccheckout\u201d process.","In non-limiting embodiments, the software to implement the donation agent can be invoked in connection with the checkout process. More specifically, as part of the checkout process, the software can issue an invitation to a user to have a merchant corresponding to the merchant website donate a portion of the purchase price or payment for the purchase to a selected charity or charities. The portion of the purchase price or payment to be donated by the merchant can be an agreed-on (e.g., between the merchant and the donation agent) percentage of the purchase price or payment, for example. The invitation can be in form of a pop-up box or other graphical display, for example, containing text, images and fields for accepting input. Based on an input or inputs supplied in response to the invitation, the software can perform a number of operations.","For example, the software can offer a selection from any or all of a local charity or charities, a state charity or charities, a national charity or charities, an international charity or charities, or other charity or charities. To provide a list of selectable local charities, for example, the software can solicit entry of a zip code. Based on an entered zip code, the software can, for example, search a database or databases to identify corresponding charities, and return a corresponding list for display via the interface.","For example, if a response to the invitation indicates acceptance of the invitation, the software can collect information associated with the one or more transactions executed on the merchant website. The information can include, for example, the information as shown above. The software can perform calculations based on the information, and store both the information and calculated results in a machine-readable storage device, such as a volatile memory coupled to a processor and\/or a bulk, non-volatile memory such as disk storage on a server.","In particular, for example, the software can calculate and store the merchant donation value as shown above. Further, the software can facilitate disbursement of the merchant donation value to the selected charity or charities, and bill the merchant based on an agreement with the merchant.","In non-limiting embodiments, the software can offer the user an option to donate to a selected charity or charities from the user's personal funds, as shown above.","In non-limiting embodiments, software for the donation agent can be implemented in the form of a downloadable \u201cplug-in\u201d to a merchant website. The plug-in can be fully customizable to each individual merchant website's requirements. The plug-in could be automatically invoked during a check-out process for a merchant website, as described in the foregoing. The donation agent, however, is not limited in this respect and could be invoked at the merchant website on demand, for example, or automatically invoked by or during operations other than check-out.","The donation agent can further supply functionality to cause the merchant website to be exited in response to user input, and a different, independent website associated with the donation agent (hereafter, \u201cindependent website\u201d) to be entered. The independent website can also be otherwise accessed, that is without necessarily first entering a merchant website. For example, a user can log directly into the independent website.","In any event, the donation agent can execute security-related operations either in connection with logging into the independent website or in response to being invoked via a merchant website. In particular, if invoked via a merchant website, the donation agent can create a secure session within another secure session. More specifically, a checkout session of a merchant website is typically secure. Therefore, because the donation agent can be invoked and executed within the checkout session, performing security-related operations associated with its own donation-related session while executing within the checkout session, the donation agent can create a secure session within another secure session.","The software for implementing the donation agent can generate and support the independent website. The independent website can generate and support a plurality of interface displays. One non-limiting example of such an interface display is a login webpage. The login webpage can include input fields for accepting user input, such as login and password information of registered members of the independent website, and information as shown above, for registering new members. The login page can also include a logo of the donation agent. Some of these are shown in the Figures.","Any person or entity can be a member of the independent website and\/or a participant in a charitable program(s) associated with the donation agent. For example, merchants and charities can be registered members of the independent website and\/or participants in the charitable program(s). Individuals, such as customers of member merchants, can be registered members of the independent website and\/or participants in the charitable program(s).","The independent website can generate and support another interface display. The webpage can include fields responsive to user input, such as a navigation field listing items selectable by, e.g., clicking with a user input device such as a mouse or touchpad, a search field to accept search terms for, e.g., searching for charities to which to donate, a field providing for selectable options to query, e.g., an amount of total donations to date and total donations for the current week, as a running sum or averages or typical data or goals or percentage of goals\/amounts achieved so far, a field showing a running total of donations compared to a threshold or target donation total, a field showing selectable banners or logos of member merchants (e.g., merchants participating in the charitable program(s) and subscribing to services of the donation agent), where, e.g., clicking on a banner causes navigating to the corresponding merchant's website, a field showing selectable banners or logos of member charities (e.g., charities participating in the charitable program(s) and subscribing to services of the donation agent), where, e.g., clicking on a banner causes navigating to the corresponding charity's website, and a field showing various selectable options for navigating to or invoking other features of the independent website.","The independent website can generate and support still another interface display. The webpage can correspond to a member's personal account, and therefore, display a personal identifier such as a user's image and\/or name (\u201cChristine\u201d). The webpage can further display information concerning the user's personal record of donations. The information can include, for example, an amount of total donations to date by the user, a weekly total of donations and a current amount in the user's personal account for charity, or \u201ccharity bank.\u201d The user's personal charity bank account (also, e.g., \u201cpiggy bank\u201d) can be funded, for example, by a user's personal donations as described previously, or by merchant donations directed by the user to the piggy bank. The charge\/money can be from a credit card, debit card, credit line, cash, checking account, foreign currency, regular periodic salary, direct deposit, wire, cashier check, fund backed by the bank, government securities, regular stock, third party authorized account, from somebody's will or trust or inheritance, or other funding sources.","The webpage can also offer selectable navigation or donation options. For example, in response to clicking on the \u201cSHOP MORE\u201d button the donation agent software can enable the user to navigate to one or more merchant websites. In response to clicking on the \u201cDONATE FROM PIGGY BANK\u201d button the donation agent software can enable the user to donate part or all of the user's charity bank account to a selected charity via services of the donation agent.","The donation agent can facilitate accumulation of funds in the user's personal piggy bank over time, and then disbursement of an amount of the accumulated funds at a time of the user's choosing, or it can get the fund at some time in future, per calendar setting and user's choice, e.g. 1day of the month, automatic withdrawal from the checking account. In more detail, in addition to the functionality of the donation agent described previously, the donation agent can further enable a user to direct a merchant's donation, calculated or specified pursuant to a transaction via a merchant website, to the user's piggy bank. Additionally or alternatively, the donation agent can enable the user to direct a personal donation to the user's piggy bank. To this end, the donation agent can generate and support one or more interactive interfaces along lines discussed previously. Thus, the donation agent can enable donations that are substantially immediate or donations that are discretionary. The substantially immediate donations can be substantially immediate in the sense that they are automatically calculated and allocated to a charity or charities for disbursement by the donation agent after a transaction on a merchant website. The discretionary donations can be discretionary in the sense that they can accumulate over time in the user's piggy bank, and then be disbursed at a time and to a charity or charities of the user's choosing. The donation agent can facilitate safeguards to ensure that funds in the piggy bank are used for charitable purposes.","The security, biometrics, certification of approval, PKI, encryption, and password can be used for authentication and validation. The charities can be approved by IRS, government, third-party, independent agents, or rated by people. The charities' overhead and types of fund usage or transparencies are also listed for users' review, e.g., as a portal for charities or comparison table, or can be searchable for topics, emphasis, goals, location, budget, overhead percentage, and rating, by the user, from our web site, as a service to the user, for selecting the desired charities or groups of charities, which can be stored as a set for each person, as a database, for future referral and usage. This makes the experience easier and more convenient for the users.","Alternatively, in response to clicking on the \u201cDONATE DIRECTLY TO CHARITIES\u201d the donation agent software can enable the user to donate directly to a selected charity.","The webpage can further display at least a portion of a charity-related activity history corresponding to the user, or for her friends' or her family members\u2032, based on permission to access for the user.","The independent website can generate and support still another interface display(s) analogous to the webpages described in the foregoing, for displaying a running tally of donations targeted to some specific purpose, along with a threshold amount that, when reached, triggers an automatic award of the accumulated donations. For example, the specific purpose could be tuition assistance, and the threshold amount could be $5000.","In more detail, the donation agent can support a \u201clive feed\u201d or real-time display of donations targeted to the specific purpose. The live feed or real-time display can be driven by finalized and verified transactions executed via various merchant websites, for example. The real-time display could be in the form of a status bar that shows the threshold amount and the verified amount accumulated toward the threshold amount based on the most recent data available. The appearance of the real-time display, however, is in no way limited by the examples described herein.","The donation agent can perform operations to calculate the accumulated amount and compare the accumulated amount to the threshold amount. Based on the comparing, the donation agent can determine whether the accumulated amount has reached or exceeded the threshold amount. If the donation agent determines that the accumulated amount has not reached or exceeded the threshold amount, the donation agent can continue to monitor and display the verified amount accumulated toward the threshold amount based on the most recent data available.","On the other hand, if the donation agent determines that the accumulated amount has reached or exceeded the threshold amount, the donation agent can announce an award of the threshold amount to a recipient. The donation agent can randomly select the recipient, for example. The announcement of the award can take the form of a display via the live feed or real-time display, for example, but the announcement can take various alternative or additional forms, such as emails or other electronic notifications, U.S. postal service notifications, and the like.","As noted, the donation agent can randomly select an award recipient, using any of known randomization techniques, for example. Recipients can be members of the donation agent website, for example, or any other persons or organizations who register as part of an award program supported by the donation agent. In the case where the specific purpose is tuition assistance, for example, candidates for receiving the award could be students who register with the award program via, for example, the independent website. Each registered student could be assigned a number by the donation agent; a winning number could be randomly selected by the donation agent after the threshold is reached, and the donation agent could award the threshold amount to the student assigned the winning number.","After the award is made, the donation agent can reset the accumulated amount to zero, and again begin to monitor and report on the accumulated amount as it grows. The donation agent can also reset or change the threshold amount if this is desired.","As noted previously, application of an automated, randomly-assigned award with real-time reporting supported by the donation agent is not limited to the example of tuition assistance. Any charitable cause could serve as the specific purpose toward which donations are accumulated.","As depicted for example in , the donation agent can provide an interactive input field for navigation (). For example, the input field can be a display or portion of a display that is generated during a session within the independent website, but wherein a user has navigated to a merchant website, for example, from within the independent website session. The input field can display information for reminding a user that the user is currently interacting with a session that was entered or invoked via the independent website, and the donation agent can navigate back to the independent website in response to user input in the input field. In one embodiment, the donation agent can track user activity with the merchant website session.","In one embodiment, the cross domain scripting is addressed for example by creating script elements and setting the source to a script file from another domain, e.g., via JSON web services and dynamic script tags. One embodiment dynamically creates <script> tags on a page where the JavaScript source is executed. A<script> tag references a remote JavaScript source, and a dynamically created script tag that references a source on another domain that source outputs JSON. In one embodiment, message posting is used to communicate information. In one embodiment, an agent plug-in or extension is used (e.g., running in the browser), e.g., to examine the document object model and interact with third party server. As depicted in , in one embodiment, a user interface is provided on top or floating above the store website (e.g., in iFrame) with links for jumping to various websites or information sites.

After the selection, the checkout is completed and the user is presented with the confirmation(s) for such a donation\/transaction. In such an embodiment, a reference ID is generated by the donation agent (e.g., as a primary key to a database table) to associate with the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, the merchant's confirmation code or transaction ID is captured (e.g., via API or script\/plug-in running on client's side) and associated with the reference ID generated by the donation agent. In one embodiment, the amount of the transaction used for determining the donation amount is captured and recorded by donation agent. In one embodiment, the confirmations are in form of both on-screen and email or TXT.","An embodiment, as for example depicted in , a donation interface is displayed to the customer after the checkout confirmation, for the customer to choose charities of choice for donation. In one embodiment, the confirmation code (e.g., at checkout) and\/or purchase information is captured for determining the amount of the donation based on the merchant's settings queried from the database such as the current percentage rate. In one embodiment, the browser session ID is captured and used to query the purchase information (e.g., amount and merchant's confirmation code\/transaction ID) to associate with a transaction ID generated by the donation agent. In one embodiment, the customer may still invoke the donation interface (if previously dismissed it after the checkout process). In one embodiment, the user logs into donation agent (e.g., by signing in as a returning member or signing up as a member), e.g., to bring the customer's favorite charities into the interface. In one embodiment, the customer uses a social network posting feature to share the information about the donation on one or more social networks. In one embodiment, the shared message is automatically constructed based on a template with the merchant's information and rules. In one embodiment, the customer enters own comments about the donation activity in the message. In one embodiment, the customer can select the charities of choice without logging into or signing up with the donation agent and the donation is recorded and associated with a generic guest in the database. In one embodiment, as for example depicted in , the donation interface is displayed after the checkout process (e.g., for merchants who work on a time-sensitive basis such as ticket sales). In one embodiment, after the customer selects the charities for donation, the donation agent captures the transaction information and associates it with a reference ID. If subsequently the customer logs into donation agent, the transaction is associated with the member by looking up the reference ID. In such an embodiment, the transaction will show up when the member logs into the donation portal.","In one embodiment, for example as depicted in ), customers are provided with a user interface prior to the checkout process, e.g., a \u201cSparo\u201d button to participate. In one embodiment, this presents an option for merchants to have the donation agent appear more subtle as a more intention-driven feature during the checkout process, to filter in customers who purposefully want to purchase with a purpose of donating to charities. In one embodiment, a promotional banner alerts new customer to what Sparo\/donation agent is. In one embodiment, donation agent codes\/scripts are downloaded from the merchant's website, referenced\/imported via merchant's webpage, or invoked via an extension or plug-in installed at the user's browser. In one embodiment, the merchant's application interacts with the donation agent in the backend, e.g., via an API. In one embodiment, the banner indicates based on the items in the shopping cart (e.g., total purchase amount), the amount of donation anticipated by the merchant. In one embodiment, the donation agent and merchant's application communicate via e-commerce platform (e.g., a shared platform type or predetermined APIs). In one embodiment, the buttons or banners on the webpage are generated via scripts embedded or referenced on the webpage. In one embodiment, upon customer's selecting the buttons\/interface corresponding to the donation agent, the donation interface is displayed to the customer to select charities of choice. The customer may sign-in, sign-up or participate a guest with donation agent in selecting such charities. In one embodiment, the customer is provided with an interface to also personally donate to the charities of choice (for example as depicted in )). In one embodiment, a minimum (and\/or maximum) threshold amount(s) (e.g., based on merchant's settings, donation agent's settings, the member's settings (if logged in), or a default values) are used to limit such personal donations from the customer. In one embodiment, personal donation from the customer is captured at the checkout as a separate donation item to be processed by the same payment process\/system. In one embodiment, the donation agent captures both the personal donation and the merchant's donation associated with the transaction. In one embodiment, the customer (if logged in a member of the donation network), specifies donation to charities from the corresponding charity (piggy) bank, based on the amount available in the charity bank and the rules\/limitations imposed by the merchants associated with the portions available in the charity bank associated with the member.","In one embodiment, as for example depicted in ), the checkout process is done via donation agent (e.g., for fast checkout for returning members\/customers). In one embodiment, the customer is provided with a choice to checkout as a guest or as a returning member (e.g., as depicted in )). In one embodiment, the customer proceeds as a guest (e.g., as depicted in )). In one embodiment, the customer choosing to proceed as a returning member, is provided with an interface to choose (or enter) payment information (e.g., previously stored). In one embodiment, the customer's own donation, purchase amount are processed based on the payment information\/authorization, and the authorization (or confirmation ID) is returned to the merchant's server (e.g., via API) to complete the checkout at the merchant's side. In one embodiment, the donation amount and fees corresponding to the transaction is communicated to the merchant upon the completion of the checkout (e.g., as information or as part of invoicing process).","In one embodiment, a user selects default (e.g., favorite or a subset of favorite) set of charities for donations to be given. In one embodiment, the donation interface during checkout is suppressed or not presented to the user based on merchant's setting and\/or user's settings (e.g., if logged in or determined based on browser's history or cookie). In one embodiment, the default charities are used as pre-selected donees without presenting the donation interface. In one embodiment, the distribution of the donation amount between the selected charities is based on their priority (e.g., high, medium, or low, as for example depicted in  for associated matching causes). In one embodiment, the distribution of donation amount is driven based on a stochastic process to choose a set of charities based on the corresponding priorities.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0187"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0189","num":"0188"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0190","num":"0189"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0191","num":"0190"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0192","num":"0191"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0193","num":"0192"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"Here are some examples for charities\/non-profits:","Animals\n\n","Arts, Culture, Humanities\n\n","Education\n\n","Environment\n\n","Health\n\n","Human Services\n\n","International\n\n","Public Benefit\n\n","Religion\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0204","num":"0236"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0205","num":"0237"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0238"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0239"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0208","num":"0240"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 21"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0241"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 23"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0242"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0211","num":"0243"},"figref":["FIGS. 25","FIG. 26"],"i":["a","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0212","num":"0244"},"figref":"FIG. 27","sup":"rd "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0213","num":"0245"},"figref":"FIG. 28","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0019-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020","list-style":"none"},"li":["Invoice billed every 30 Days or 1 month.","30 Days or 1 month to pay Invoice, before incurring interest.","60 Days or 2 months to report returns, since last invoice billed, to be reflected as credits on the next invoice.

In one embodiment, as for example depicted in ), an entity (e.g., ABC Utility) provides a gift certificate or coupon from a merchant (or advertiser) (e.g., XYZ Shop) to its customers for an incentive (e.g., to go paperless for billing statements). An interface is provided to the customers to donate such certificates\/coupons to charity of their choice. In one embodiment, the certificate or coupon is presented by a code (e.g., identifying the specific coupon and other identifying information for the issuer of the coupon). In one embodiment, the information is packaged in an object\/file (e.g., signed electronically using PKI). In one embodiment, the user selects charities of choice and authorizes the donation of the coupon or certificate for use of charities. In one embodiment, the authorization is associated with a Ref. ID by donation agent and\/or merchant(s). In one embodiment, a cash value for the coupon\/certificate is extracted, e.g., via a marketplace or auction to purchase by a third party to use the certificate\/coupon at the issuer merchant. In one embodiment, the payment (subtracted by the fees) are provided as donation to the selected charities and captured in the member's donation (via XYZ Shop) in the member's account at the donation agent.","In one embodiment, as for example depicted in ), a merchant can donate to a customer's charity of choice a non-cash item. For example, a clothing shop may donate clothes to a charity (e.g., Salvation Army). In one embodiment, charities and\/or merchants can specify in their settings the type of non-cash donations that they may offer\/accept. In one embodiment, such settings can be matched by the donation agent to allow a merchant provide its donation in a non-cash form. In one embodiment, the merchant, e.g., via the donation agent, creates a coupon or certificate reflecting the amount of donation to be redeemed by the charity as non-cash item purchase. In one embodiment, the beneficiaries of the charity redeem the donation by purchase at the merchant. In one embodiment, the donation agent accumulates such donations to a charity until a (e.g., minimum) threshold (e.g., set by the merchant) to provide the charity.","In one embodiment, we can have donation to special events, such as unexpected flood, or school as special charity, appearing as a special case in our network or system, e.g. run by Sparo (us), as a donor, as well as others contributing, e.g., people as consumers or non-members, and merchants, for goodwill. In one embodiment, the users or merchants\/stores can aggregate their contributions, e.g. via group email or invitation, with acceptance box, with suggestions for amount of contributions, and the goal to reach, in a social media or friends' circle environment.","In one embodiment, we can have donation before payment for purchase. In one embodiment, we have donation after payment for purchase\/transaction. In one embodiment, the user can contribute to charity from piggy bank or from, e.g., her own credit card, which either Sparo (we) or store add and process the total charges, based on those corresponding accounts\/forms.","In one embodiment, we have regional classification of charities, e.g., local, state, national, and international, with a tab shown on screen, for ease of use. In one embodiment, we have subject classification of charities, e.g., homeless, medical-related, children-related, environmental-related, food-related, and the like. In one embodiment, the system gets the donation to charity from the store, and with no charge to the customer, or invoices that to the store at a later date, or does a batch process for many items at the end of the period. In one embodiment, we have a portion of the proceeds going to the other usage, e.g. student tuition or expense scholarship or grant. Then, the rest is used for our expense or overhead, as well as company's shareholders, if any.","In one embodiment, we have the list of charities prioritized, by us, users, government, based on lower overhead, based on past history, or preference of the user on categories, types, geography, country, or lower overhead percentages. In one embodiment, we have plug-ins in any web site or store, or using cookies for tracking or behavioral analysis, on an individual basis, or aggregated for all users, as average or trend analysis or statistical analysis. In one embodiment, we have APIs to partner sites or entities or developers associated with our program. In one embodiment, we have charities getting a percentage of our company as stock, for encouraging more participation and good-will.","In one embodiment, we have 3 types of the accounts: (1) merchant\/stores, (2) consumer, as a customer of merchant and a member of the Sparo, and (3) charities or non-profit organizations, e.g. certified by the government, IRS, or a neutral third party. The certification for validation of charity can be in the form of PKI, or certificate with public\/private keys, to make sure the money or correspondences are coming or going to the right place or account. In one embodiment, we have piggy bank for each consumer, so that they can accumulate for later for a specific charity or above a threshold amount, for grant of the money to happen. In one embodiment, we have tax break for the business (that gives to charity), as well as goodwill for customer, plus more sales through public, as an edge in the marketing.","In one embodiment, we have the customer\/consumer as a member of Sparo (or charity network or portal or central or HQ), with piggy bank account and other relations built up.

That is, due to tax codes, for proper year, it has to be spent or released from the piggy bank. Otherwise (in case of no action by the user), the default is to release the fund before deadline for tax purposes, by Sparo, automatically before deadline, to a random or listed charities or schools. In one embodiment, the system does not let the fund stay in the accounts indefinitely, enforcing a known deadline or giving warning to user or forcing a distribution of a fund to charities or schools, if the user fails to act or respond on time, causing tax violations or legal problems, which can be avoided by this method, automatically, and also certified\/sent, accordingly, for IRS or the CPA.","In one embodiment, the system subtracts school funds directly from merchant contribution. In one embodiment, the system uses our profit or income as the source of school funds, which has different tax consequences for the parties involved, as the donor for deductions.

Of course, the identity of the user is checked with PKI\/encryption, keys, passwords, certificates, by a validation authority, and\/or biometrics. In one embodiment, in case of lost signup information by any party, the system helps to recover password and other account parameters, if the user can prove the identity in other forms, e.g. by re-emailing a new password to the original email, using a unique ID for the user's account. In one embodiment, the system lets user log in or sign up and create a new account before or after the donation, and\/or before or after purchase\/transaction.","In one embodiment, the system shows how much in each account is accumulated, up to now, or in average, or monthly, or weekly.

In one embodiment, the system uses the local, relative to user location, currently or permanently, as options. In one embodiment, the system uses the list of search parameters as filters, on screen, by user.","In one embodiment, the system uses multiple items from merchant, e.g. one with deep discount, not eligible for any charity contributions, making it a separate account for tracking, as eligible and not-eligible items, as well as an account for returned items, for accountability and subtractions from total, especially against fraud against the system.","In one embodiment, the system uses a pop-up or regular window for menu for display for parties to choose the options or see the options. In one embodiment, the system uses this model:","1. Start with the index page","2. Click on \u201cShopping Bag\u201d on top right","3. Click on Sparo Button","4.
