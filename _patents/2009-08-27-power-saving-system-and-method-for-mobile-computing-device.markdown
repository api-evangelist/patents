Each position fix or series of position fixes may be available at device  and\/or at the remote computer  depending on the location determination mode. In some cases, data calls may be made and position assist data may be sent to device  from the remote computer  for every position fix (e.g., in an ad hoc mode).

For example, the transceiver module  and the antenna system  may comprise GPS receiver or transceiver hardware and one or more associated antennas coupled to the radio processor  to support location determination.","The host processor  may comprise and\/or implement at least one LBS (location-based service) application. In general, the LBS application may comprise any type of client application executed by the host processor , such as a GPS application, configured to communicate location requests (e.g., requests for position fixes) and location responses.

For example, the user of device  may interact with a data input device to command the LBS application to send a location request. The LBS application also may send a location request in response to receiving input from an external network element or computing device that is attempting to locate the user of device . In some cases, the LBS application also may be configured to automatically, periodically, and\/or autonomously send location requests.","Although other applications may operate without regard to the location of device , in various embodiments, the LBS application may request and receive position information to enhance the functionality of one or more of the other applications. For example, position information may be provided in conjunction with a messaging application to locate the sender or recipient of a message. Position information may be provided to a web browser application to generate directions to a location associated with a particular website. Positioning information may be provided to a personal management application to generate location-based alerts and\/or directions to a meeting place.","The radio processor  may be configured to receive location requests from an LBS API handler on host processor  and may forward location responses to the LBS API handler for delivery to the LBS application through the LBS API. Radio processor  may be configured to communicate securely over a network with remote computer  (e.g., PDE, LPS or MPC) configured to provide authentication and authorization services and\/or a variety of geo-services.

Examples of request\/response parameters may include current location, latitude, longitude, altitude, heading, vector information such as horizontal and vertical velocity, sector-based position location, position fix method, level of accuracy, time offset, position uncertainty, device orientation, client initialization and registration, and so forth.","The radio processor  may comprise or implement a position engine such as a GPS engine. In various embodiments, the position engine may be configured to provide location determination capabilities for device .

In one embodiment, the position engine may be implemented as a QUALCOMM\u00ae gpsOne\u00ae engine.","In various implementations, the position engine may employ one or more location determination techniques such as GPS, CGI, CGI+TA, EFLT, TDOA, AOA, AFLT, OTDOA, EOTD, AGPS, GPS\/AGPS, hybrid techniques, and so forth. The position engine also may be configured to operate in one or more location determination modes including a standalone mode, an MS-assisted mode, and an MS-based mode.

Examples of position information may include, without limitation, current location, latitude, longitude, altitude, heading information, vector information such as horizontal and vertical velocity, sector-based position location, position fix information, position uncertainty, device orientation, and so forth.","In various embodiments, device  may be used in connection with a variety of applications that require determination of the location of device . For example, various navigation and mapping applications may be utilized to provide various types of data and information to users, including driving directions, map information, point of interest (POI) information, and so on. A location determining circuit or system such as location determining circuit  (see ) may periodically determine (e.g., obtain, request or determine a position fix, update a location, etc.) the location of device  at a standard rate or period (e.g., every second, twice per second, etc.) on a continuous, ongoing basis. Utilizing a location determining system in such a manner, however, typically requires significant power. Should a device rely on a power source such as a battery (e.g., as in the case with typical mobile phones, smart phones, and other mobile devices), the available usage time of the device may be significantly decreased because of the power requirements of the location determining system.","Referring to , according to various embodiments, device  may be configured to adjust (e.g., increase, decrease, etc.) the rate or period at which the location of device  is updated (e.g., the rate at which position fixes are obtained or updated) based on various factors. These factors may include, among others, a distance to be traveled prior to reaching a turn (e.g., a significant change in direction, etc.) or a point of interest (e.g., a restaurant, gas station, tourist shop, etc.), the street density of an area (e.g., the total length of street in an area, etc.), the number of intersections in a predetermined area, the number of points of interest in a predetermined area, and so forth. Many other factors may be taken into account in determining whether to modify the rate at which location determining system  updates the location of device  according to various alternative embodiments.","For example, a user of device  may be traveling along one of routes , ,  shown in . Routes , ,  may be provided (e.g., calculated, determined, etc.) in a variety ways, including through the use of a navigation or mapping application running on or in communication with device . Route  includes a current location  of device  and an anticipated future destination  (e.g., an expected future location, a destination point, etc.) for device . The anticipated future destination may be calculated or determined by a route calculation algorithm using input data from a user (e.g., current location and\/or destination) and a geographic element data from a geographic information database. Alternatively, the anticipated future destination(s) may be input by a user (e.g., waypoints, points of interest, etc.). The expected or anticipated future destination may be anticipated or expected by a user of device , an application on device , or another entity. Route  includes a current location  of device  and an anticipated destination  for device . Route  includes a current location  of device  and an anticipated destination  of device . Further, points of interest ,  or other significant points may be located along a route of travel, and may include turns, cross-streets, restaurants, hotels, gas stations, tourist destinations, and so on.","As shown in , routes , ,  may travel through different types of geographic areas, and may include varying numbers of stops, turns, and so on. For example, route  is provided in an area with a relatively high street density (e.g., the total length of street in a predetermined area, the number of streets that cross the path of route , etc.) and includes a number of turns between various streets through the area. Further, points of interest ,  may be adjacent to portions of route . Route  may be typical of a route through, for example, an urban area with a relatively dense arrangement of streets, intersections, points of interest, and so on. Accordingly, a user utilizing a navigation or other system in connection with location determining system  may wish to maintain the rate at which the location of device  is updated at a standard (e.g., a default, a maximum, a user-defined, etc.) rate while traveling along route . In one embodiment, the standard rate may be once per second. In other embodiments, a slower or faster standard rate may be utilized. In some embodiments, the user may wish to increase the standard rate while in areas such as route .","Referring further to , route  may be provided in a geographic area with a lower street density and fewer intersections than route . Further, there may be only a single point of interest  adjacent route . Thus, it may not be necessary to update the location of device  at the standard rate over certain portions of route , as the user may be traveling along a route without any turns, intersections, points of interest, etc. Device  may be configured to reduce the rate at which the location of device  is updated along at least portions of route  in order to reduce the power consumed by location determining system . For example, a second, reduced rate may be once per 30 seconds, less than once per second, less than once per 10 seconds, less than once per 20 seconds, etc., although any reduced rate may be used, and the reduced rate may be determined in a variety of ways.","Referring further to , route  may be provided in a geographic area having a street density that is lower than that of both routes  and . Further there may be no intersections or points of interest along route  (as determined by a route-generating algorithm in response to user inputs). Accordingly, device  may be configured to reduce the rate at which the location of device  is updated to a rate (e.g., less than once per minute, less than once per two minutes, etc.) lower than that used with one or both of routes  and  in order to provide even further power savings, as there may be a relatively lower risk that a user will require position updates at the relatively higher rates utilized in connection with routes , .","Referring now to , a flow chart  of a method that may be implemented using device  according to one embodiment is shown, and, that may be utilized to manage power consumption of a mobile device utilizing a system such as location determining system . First, location determining system  determines the location of device  utilizing a standard, or default update rate or mode, such as once per second (step ). Next, device  determines whether one or more thresholds (e.g., a \u201cpower-saving\u201d threshold such as a distance to the next turn or point of interest, a maximum street density or number of intersections within a predetermined area, a current vehicle velocity, etc.) has been satisfied (step ). If the one or more thresholds is satisfied, then device  and location determining system  may enter a power savings mode where location determining system  utilizes a power saving mode such that the rate at which location determining system  updates the location of device  is reduced (step ). If the thresholds are not satisfied, device  and location determining system  continue to update the location of device  at the standard rate (return to step ). While in the power savings mode (step ) device  and location determining system  may continue to monitor one or more threshold values (step ) to determine whether to remain in a power savings mode (step ) or return the device to the standard location determining mode where the location of device  is updated at the standard rate (step ). Upon returning to the standard mode, device  may continue to monitor whether the power saving thresholds are satisfied in order to determine whether to again enter the power savings mode.","According to various exemplary embodiments, device  may consider a number of factors in determining whether one or more power savings thresholds have been met (steps  and\/or  in ). For example, one factor may be whether the distance from the current location of device  to a second location exceeds a threshold distance value. The second location may represent a turn off of a current street or highway, etc., a point of interest, a planned intermediate stop along a route, a destination or end point along a route, etc. Another factor may be whether the \u201cstreet density\u201d (e.g., the number of streets, the total length of street, the number of intersections, etc.) of a geographic area within a certain distance of a route or a portion of a route is less than a density threshold. Other factors may also be considered in various alternative embodiments, including the number of points of interest within a given area, whether a user has traveled a given route in the past, the speed of a user, the expected travel time to a second location, the types of points of interest in a given area, the history of a user in visiting or looking up points of interest (e.g., a user frequently looks up pizza restaurants, etc.), etc.","As an example of the operation of the method shown in , a user traveling along route  () may utilize a device such as device . While at point , device  may determine its location (e.g., a current location), route , and determine that it is 20 miles to planned destination  (e.g., a future location or destination). Device  may utilize a threshold value of 5 miles, such that device  determines that 20 miles exceeds the distance threshold value of 5 miles and enters a power savings mode at point . Device  may then update its position at a reduced rate to conserve power (e.g., the update rate may be reduced from once every second to once every 30 seconds). After each location update, device  may determine the distance from device  to point , and upon coming within 5 miles of point , device  returns to the standard mode of updating the location of device  (e.g., once per second). Device  may monitor other parameters while in a power saving mode, including street density, whether a time period has expired (e.g., based on a user's speed), and so on.","Referring now to , a flow chart  of a method that may be implemented using device  according to another embodiment is illustrated and may be utilized to manage power consumption of a mobile device utilizing a position system such as location determining system . Flow chart  is similar to flow chart  shown in  except that flow chart  provides a step  that generally corresponds to an expanded version of step  shown in . As shown in , location determining system  may determine the location of device  utilizing a standard, or default update rate or mode, such as once per second (step ). Next, device  determines whether to enter a power savings mode (step ).","As part of step , device  may first determine whether a distance threshold is satisfied (step ). In one embodiment, determining whether a distance threshold is satisfied includes determining whether the distance from a current location of device  to a second location is greater than a threshold distance value. As discussed above, the second location may represent a destination location, a point of interest, a turn along a route, etc. The threshold distance value may be any distance (e.g., 1 mile, 10 miles, etc.) and may further take into account a current rate of travel of device  (e.g., such that the threshold distance value is increased\/decreased as the speed of travel of device  increases\/decreases). If the distance threshold is satisfied, device  enters power savings mode (step ).","If the distance threshold is not satisfied, device  then determines whether a user is likely to be familiar with a particular area or route (step ). In some embodiments, determining whether a user is familiar with an area or route includes analyzing past travel patterns of device  to determine that all or a part of the current route or nearby streets had been previously-travelled by device . In other embodiments, other factors may be considered, including proximity to a user's home, place of work, etc. If device  determines that a user is likely to be familiar with a particular area or route, then device  may provide the user with a \u201cmanual override\u201d feature, such as providing a prompt to a user asking whether the user would like to utilize a power saving mode on device  for at least a portion of a particular route (e.g., \u201cEntering power savings mode, is this OK?\u201d). If the user wishes to utilize the power savings mode, device  enters power savings mode (step ). The \u201cmanual override\u201d or manual approval feature may be used in any of the embodiments disclosed herein.","If device  determines that the user is likely not familiar with a particular route or area, device  proceeds to determine whether the speed of device  is known (step ), such that device  may compute an estimated amount of time it will take for device  to reach a particular point such as a point of interest or destination. If the estimated time satisfies a time value threshold (e.g., 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.) (step ), device  may enter a power saving mode (step ). If the estimated time does not satisfy a time value threshold, or the speed of device  is not known, device  remains in a standard mode of updating the location of device  (return to step ).","If device  enters a power saving mode (step ), device  may continue to monitor various threshold parameters (step ) to determine when device  should be returned to a standard operating mode (return to step ). In some embodiments, monitoring the various thresholds includes evaluating one or more of the factors considered as part of step  (including one or more of steps -). Alternatively, different or additional factors may be considered in determining whether to maintain device  in a power savings mode, including monitoring the expiration of a time period, monitoring street density, and so on.","In another embodiment, device  may be configured to consider a plurality of different threshold parameters along with a weighting or other multiplier to weight each threshold individually, wherein the sum of the weighted thresholds determines whether to enter the power saving mode. Referring now to , a flow chart  of a method for managing power consumption of a mobile device utilizing a position system such as location determining system  is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The embodiment shown in  assumes that at point (A) in flow chart  a device such as device  is already operating in a power saving mode (e.g., see step  shown in ). Generally, flow chart  provides a method for device  to determine whether to (i) return to a standard mode (e.g., using a standard update rate for determining the position of device ), (ii) remain in a power saving mode (e.g., using a reduced update rate for determining the position of device ), or (iii) utilize an \u201cadvanced\u201d power saving mode, where the update rate for determining the position of device  may be reduced even further based on one or more factors, or other power saving techniques may be implemented by device , such as reducing the power consumption of a display, reducing the frequency of audio and\/or visual prompts (e.g., automated direction prompts), and so forth.","First, device  may determine whether any predetermined time limits have been reached (step ) and whether a density threshold has been exceeded (step ). Such time and\/or density thresholds may be determined and\/or evaluated in a manner similar to that discussed with respect to . If a time limit has been reached or a density threshold exceeded, device  returns to a standard mode (step ). Otherwise, device  then determines whether a first distance threshold value is satisfied (step ). If the first distance threshold value is satisfied, device  enters an advanced power saving mode (step ). If the first distance threshold is not satisfied, device  determines whether a lesser, second distance threshold is satisfied (step ). If the second distance threshold is satisfied, device  remains in power savings mode. If the second threshold is not satisfied, device  returns to a standard mode (step ).","According to an exemplary embodiment, the first distance threshold value (used in step ) is greater than the second distance threshold value, so that, for example, if a device is a significant distance away from a second location (e.g., a turn, point of interest, etc.), an advanced power savings mode may be used. As the distance from device  to the second location decreases, device  will change to the power savings mode (e.g., when the second, but not the first, distance threshold values are satisfied), and eventually return to the standard mode (e.g., when neither the first nor the second distance threshold values are satisfied).","According to one embodiment, providing \u201cadvanced\u201d power savings includes taking steps in addition to reducing the rate at which the location of device  is updated. For example, this may include turning portions of a display off, reducing the number of audio and\/or visual prompts that may be provided by a navigation application, reducing the update rate further (relative to the non-advanced power saving mode), and so on. Other power-saving steps may be implemented according to various other embodiments. Any of the power savings modes may further include shutting down certain activities performed by device , such as tracking satellites, downloading position-assist data, and so on.","According to any of the embodiments disclosed herein, location determining system  may be configured to obtain or determine the location of device  in response to a variety of user inputs or other activities. For example, a user may be in a power savings mode and also be browsing the web. The user may provide an input while browsing that triggers location determining system , including various searches for restaurants (e.g., a location-based search), points of interest, etc. Further, certain inputs may cause a display such as a display screen to \u201cwake up\u201d from a \u201csleep\u201d (e.g., reduced power) mode. In some embodiments, location determining system  may be configured to determine the position of device  while a display screen or other feature remains in a \u201csleep\u201d mode. In further embodiments, a user may be provided with the option to \u201copt-in\u201d or \u201copt-out\u201d of utilizing various power saving features by providing inputs to device .","In some embodiments, a method may include periodically determining a location of a mobile computing device at a first rate, determining a street density of a geographic area associated with the location of the mobile computing device, and adjusting the first rate based on comparing the street density of the geographic area with a threshold density value. The method may further include reducing the first rate to a slower second rate upon determining that the street density is less than the threshold density value. The street density may be based on at least one of the length of street in the geographic area, the number of intersections in the geographic area, and the number of streets intersecting a route of the mobile computing device. Further, the second rate upon determining that the street density is greater than or equal to the threshold density value.","Various embodiments disclosed herein may include or be implemented in connection with computer-readable media configured to store machine-executable instructions therein, and\/or one or more modules, circuits, units, or other elements that may comprise analog and\/or digital circuit components configured or arranged to perform one or more of the steps recited herein.
