Nos. 60\/357,291 filed on Feb. 15, 2002, 60\/412,756 filed on Sep. 23, 2002, and 60\/412,875 filed on Sep. 23, 2002.","1. Technical Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of wireless telecommunications; and, more particularly, to a mobile multimedia system for a mobile terminal for a wireless telecommunications system.","2. Description of Related Art","Since cellular phones were first introduced in the 1980's, mobile terminals (Mobile Stations) utilized in the systems have become increasingly more complex. Initially, mobile terminals were designed primarily to provide voice telephony services, i.e., to transmit and receive voice communications. In later years, mobile terminals were developed that also included the ability to transfer user data not related to that of a voice telephone call. Such user data included, for example, data to be transferred over a dial-up networking connection initiated via a personal computer.","Currently, so-called \u201cthird generation\u201d (3G) systems are being developed for future cellular telecommunications systems. 3G systems will combine high-speed Internet access with traditional voice communication, and will provide a user with access to Internet browsing, streaming audio\/video, positioning, video conferencing and many other capabilities in addition to voice communication.","The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) was established to ensure compatibility among the several 3G systems that are being developed around the world. The Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) is being developed by 3GPP to provide a 3G system that includes terrestrial and satellite systems capable of delivering voice, data and multimedia anywhere in the world.","The drastically increased functionality that is being included in cellular telecommunications systems via the 3GPP standardization has placed substantial demands on the developers of mobile terminals to be used in the systems. This demand is exacerbated by the fact that a mobile terminal is a \u201cresource scarce\u201d environment that is limited in size, memory and power.","Traditionally, mobile terminal manufacturers have designed, fabricated and marketed substantially complete mobile terminal systems that include all the hardware and software needed for basic terminal operation as well as the software needed to provide the features and capabilities desired by the manufacturer or a particular user based on their perception of market needs. Such a design approach does not provide the flexibility to quickly adapt to rapid changes in market demands or to satisfy the diverse requirements of multiple users.","Recognizing the above inadequacies of current mobile terminal designs, commonly assigned, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/359,835, filed Feb. 7, 2003, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, describes a mobile terminal platform system for a mobile terminal for a wireless telecommunications system. The mobile terminal platform system includes a mobile terminal platform assembly, comprising both software and hardware, for the mobile terminal, and which is adapted to be designed, implemented (assembled) and tested as a complete, enclosed unit separate from application software. With the mobile terminal platform assembly described in the above-referred to application, users (the term \u201cusers\u201d as used herein includes manufacturers, end users and other customers and users) can develop or otherwise acquire their own application software and add that software to the mobile terminal platform assembly at a later time to complete the platform system. The mobile terminal platform assembly can, accordingly, be sold or otherwise transferred to a plurality of different users, each of which can complete the platform system by loading, installing and running their own application software in the assembly in order to satisfy their own particular requirements for the platform system.","An important capability of current and future mobile terminals is the provision of multimedia functionality. In existing mobile terminals having a multimedia functionality, the multimedia applications themselves are required to provide much of the functionality, and this necessitates applications that are relatively complex and difficult to develop. This requirement also makes it difficult to develop a mobile terminal having multimedia functionality that will meet the diverse desires and requirements of multiple users.","There is, accordingly, a need for a mobile multimedia system for a mobile terminal for a wireless telecommunications system that permits the easy creation of powerful multimedia applications and that is capable of enabling multimedia applications that will meet the diverse needs of a plurality of users.","The present invention provides a mobile multimedia system for a mobile terminal for a wireless telecommunications system. The mobile multimedia system according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention comprises a mobile terminal platform assembly that includes a mobile multimedia engine having a software services component and a hardware component associated with and controlled by the software services component, and an interface component having at least one interface for providing access to the mobile multimedia engine. The mobile multimedia system further includes multimedia application software loaded, installed and run in the mobile multimedia engine of the mobile terminal platform assembly via the at least one interface in the interface component (the term \u201cloaded\u201d as used herein is intended to include any mechanism by which the application software can be combined with the software of the mobile multimedia engine via the interface including, for example, downloading from the Internet or installing a hardware chip).","The hardware and software components of the mobile multimedia engine of the mobile multimedia system of the present invention work together to provide the functionality needed to enable powerful multimedia applications, including the functionality to handle displays, cameras, network connections and persistent storage of multimedia content. Among the functions provided are audio\/video playback, streaming audio\/video, audio\/video recording and video telephony.","The interface component of the mobile terminal platform assembly preferably comprises a middleware services layer that includes the at least one interface for loading installing and running the multimedia application software in the mobile multimedia engine; and, in addition, that isolates the mobile multimedia engine from the application software except via the at least one interface.","Further advantages and specific details of the present invention will become apparent hereinafter from the detailed description given below in conjunction with the following drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","10","16"]},"Mobile terminal platform assembly  includes a software services component , a hardware component  and an interface component .","Software services component  comprises a plurality of well-structured functional software units for providing services that are offered to users via interface component .

No. 10\/359,835, filed Feb. 7, 2003.","The software incorporated in mobile terminal platform assembly  is preferably organized in such a manner as to make the software easy to understand so that it can be more easily designed and more easily upgraded or otherwise modified.  is a block diagram that schematically illustrates the software architecture of mobile terminal platform assembly  to further assist in explaining the present invention.","As shown in , software services component , in addition to being organized into a plurality of vertical, functional software stacks as described above, is also arranged to define a plurality of horizontal layers such that the software of middleware services layer  and the software of software services component  together define a layered architecture, generally designated by reference number , in which the layers are arranged in descending order from a higher level service layer to a lower level service layer.","The highest layer is middleware services layer . The layers of software services component  include an application server layer  to provide application services, a platform services layer  to provide platform specific services for applications, a platform protocol layer  to provide session protocols and application specific protocols, a transport layer  to provide audio access\/control, datacom transport protocols, messaging transport protocols and the like, a data access layer  to provide external data IF access, structured storage services and other low level platform support services, a logical drivers layer  and a physical drivers layer  encapsulating hardware dependencies. In addition, software services component  includes basic system services layers  that provide general services that are needed by the platform assembly.","The bottom two layers  and  constitute Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL) which isolate the dependencies between the software and the hardware. Only the physical drivers layer is concerned with the details of the hardware (for example, which registers in the ASIC hardware are addressed). Logical drivers layer  provides a logical mapping to the hardware, i.e., this layer provides a bridge between the hardware and software parts of the mobile terminal platform assembly.","The software itself is organized into a plurality of software modules, e.g. modules , , . In software services component , a single module can reside in only one vertical functional stack and in only one horizontal layer within that stack. Each layer can contain from one to many modules, and all the modules in a particular layer in a particular stack have the same level of abstraction. Communication among the various modules is accomplished via a Software Back Plane (SwBP) , subject to a set of basic rules for software module-to-module access. These rules can be summarized as follows:\n\n","There is no hard coupling between the various modules and the interfaces in the SwBP. As a result, the modules and\/or the implementation of the interfaces can be freely changed without any impact on the clients to the interfaces. This is an important capability as it permits individual modules to be added, removed or changed without affecting other modules in the platform assembly.","Further details of the layered architecture, including the SwBP software structure that enables the internal communication between modules within the mobile terminal platform assembly, and of the middleware services layer are described in commonly assigned, U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10\/359,911 and 10\/359,772, both filed Feb. 7, 2003, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention, mobile terminal platform assembly  includes a mobile multimedia engine that is capable of enabling powerful multimedia applications that may be loaded, installed and run in the mobile multimedia engine via the at least one interface in the middleware services layer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","202","204","202","206","208","204","206"]},"According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, mobile terminal platform assembly  corresponds to mobile terminal platform assembly  of mobile terminal platform system  illustrated in , and mobile multimedia engine  is incorporated in MMI services software stack  and in MMI services hardware  of the system of .
