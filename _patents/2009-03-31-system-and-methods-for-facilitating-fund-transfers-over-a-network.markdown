No. 61\/083,004, filed on Jul. 23, 2008, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","1. Technical Field","The present invention generally relates to network transactions and, more particularly, to facilitating fund transfers over a network.","2. Related Art","In electronic banking and commerce, a user typically accesses accounts and conducts financial transactions through electronic communications with online service providers over communication networks, such as the Internet. Typically, when potential users sign up or use a service for processing payments and fund transfers through the Internet, the user steps through a series of steps to verify identity and a funding source. These steps ensure that funds being transferred out of or into an account is indeed an account associated with the user and not an unauthorized account.","Conventional techniques include inputting and verifying user provided information, such as account numbers, routing information, and billing address, which can often be cumbersome and time-consuming for the user. These conventional techniques may include the user typing in bank information, such as an account number and a routing number. In one instance, the online service provider may deposit a small amount of funds (e.g., 2 cents) into the user's bank account, typically a few days after the information is entered. The user then periodically checks the user's account to verify whether any small deposits have been received. Once received, the user accesses the online service provider to confirm the deposit to the account.","Unfortunately, these conventional techniques are time consuming and effort intensive and typically require the user to perform several steps and navigation events for deposit verification and settlement. As such, there currently exists a need to improve a user's experience during financial transactions including fund transfers over a network.","In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, systems and methods presented herein facilitate transactions over a network including fund transfers. In one embodiment, a method for facilitating financial transactions including fund transfers over a network includes communicating with a financial institution over the network, wherein the financial institution includes a first user account related to a user. The method includes receiving a fund transfer request from the financial institution on behalf of the user and establishing a second user account related to the user based on user information passed with the fund transfer request. The method includes processing the fund transfer request by linking the first user account to the second user account based on the user information passed with the fund transfer request, receiving funds from the financial institution associated with the first user account, and depositing the received funds in the second user account on behalf of the user, wherein the user information includes an e-mail address related to the user.","In various implementations, the method may include determining whether the user is an existing user having the second user account and verifying the identity of the user based on the user information passed with the fund transfer request. The method may include storing the second user account related to the user, wherein the user account includes information related to the user. The method may include obtaining recipient information of a recipient from the fund transfer request as provided by the user, establishing a recipient account related to the recipient based on the recipient information passed with the fund transfer request, and processing the fund transfer request by receiving funds from the financial institution associated with the first user account and depositing the received funds in the recipient account on behalf of the user. The method may include determining whether the recipient is an existing recipient having the recipient account and verifying the identity of the recipient based on the recipient information passed with the fund transfer request. The method may include storing the recipient account related to the recipient, wherein the recipient account includes information related to the recipient.","In various implementations, communicating with the financial institution over the network may comprise communicating with a bill payment service associated with the financial institution and receiving the fund transfer request from the financial institution may comprise receiving the fund transfer request from the bill payment service on behalf of the user. The financial institution may comprise a server adapted to communicate with the network, and the method may be performed by a server adapted to communicate with the financial institution over the network.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated, in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","120","140","160"]},"The user , in one embodiment, is able to establish a user account  with the financial institution , such as a bank, wherein the user  may deposit monetary funds in the user account . The financial institution  is adapted to provide the user  with access to the user account  and to a bill payment service  via the network. In one aspect, the user  may request network based transactions, such as fund transfers (e.g., deposits and\/or debits) between accounts, over the network in a manner as described in greater detail herein. In another aspect, the financial institution  may provide the user  with some form of payment media, such as an electronic payment resource, that is linked to the user account . In this instance, the user  may utilize the payment media to access funds in the user account .","In one implementation, the user  may utilize the bill payment service  to transfer funds from the user account  of the financial institution to a user account  of the service provider  via the network. The bill payment service  is adapted to process the fund transfer between the user  and the service provider  via the network. In one aspect, the bill payment service  may communicate with a clearing house to debit the user account  of the financial institution  in accordance with an amount specific to the fund transfer and credit the user account  of the service provider  over the network.","The user , in one embodiment, is able to establish one or more user accounts (e.g., the user account ) with the service provider , wherein the user  may deposit monetary funds in the user account  either directly or from the user account  of the financial institution . The service provider  is adapted to provide the user  with access to the user account  via the network. In one aspect, the service provider  may provide the user  with some form of electronic payment resource that is linked to the user account . As such, in this instance, the user  may utilize the electronic payment resource to access funds in the user account .","In one aspect, a link  may be established between the user account  of the financial institution  and one or more other accounts with other financial institutions and\/or network based service providers, such as the service provider . For example, the user  may provide an e-mail address to the service provider  as a unique identifier (i.e., a user identity verifier) so that the link  may be established between the user account  of the financial institution  and the user account  of the service provider . Accordingly, an e-mail address may be utilized by the user  to establish the user account  with the service provider , wherein the link  between the user accounts ,  is an e-mail address related to the user . After linking user accounts ,  via, e.g., an e-mail address, fund transfers may be processed seamlessly between the user accounts ,  of the financial institution  and the service provider , respectively. It should be appreciated that, in various embodiments, the unique identifier (i.e., the user identity verifier) may comprise an e-mail address, telephone number, and\/or various other types of easily remembered addresses and\/or numbers related to the user , without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","In another aspect, for security concerns, additional security verification may be obtained by the service provider  to further verify the identity of the user  and provide further security for verifying the link between the two accounts. When the user accounts ,  are considered linked, the user  is presumed to be the same person having permission to access both user accounts , . However, after a nominal fund transfer takes place, the user  may be prompted with an option to link the information related to the user accounts , , wherein the user  may be prompted by the service provider  to provide at least one of a full name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and at least part of a social security number to link the user accounts , . The user  may be prompted to verify random deposit information. For example, the service provider  may transfer nominal funds (e.g., a penny or a dollar) to the user account  with the financial institution , and the user  may be prompted to verify information related to the nominal fund transfer, such as the amount deposited into the user account  and when the deposit occurred. In another example, the user  may be prompted to login to the user account  after a nominal fund transfer has been completed by the service provider  to verify the nominal fund transfer.","In one embodiment, bank information related to the user  may be utilized to establish the user account  with the service provider . However, personal and\/or banking information related to the user account  with the financial institution  should be protected until the service provider  verifies that the user  wants to share or link the bank information related to the user account  with the user account .","In one implementation, the user  may allow or grant permission to the service provider  to transfer funds from the user account  of the service provider  to another user account of the service provider , such as a recipient account  related to a recipient  (e.g., another user, client, or customer having a user account with the service provider ). A processing component  of the service provider  is adapted to process the fund transfer between the user account  and the recipient account . In one aspect, the service provider  may directly transfer funds between the user account  and the recipient account . In this instance, the service provider  may directly debit the user account  and directly credit the recipient account  because both of the accounts ,  are established with the service provider . In another aspect, the service provider may use a clearing house to debit the user account  in accordance with an amount specific to the fund transfer and credit the recipient account  over the network. In this instance, the service provider  may optionally process the fund transfer through a clearing house even though the accounts ,  are established with the service provider .","In one embodiment, a clearing house (not shown) resolves financial transactions through validation, delivery, and settlement. As such, the clearing house may comprise an agency or institution having a system for settling indebtedness between members of that system through which accounts may be debited and\/or credited of monetary funds.","In one embodiment, one or more fund transfers between the user , the recipient , the financial institution , and the service provider  may take place over the network, such as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, the network may include the Internet and\/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of communication networks. In another example, the network may include a wireless telecommunications network (e.g., cellular phone network) adapted to interface and communicate with other communication networks, such as the Internet. As such, in one aspect, the user , the recipient , the financial institution , and the service provider  may be associated with a particular link (e.g., a link, such as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to an IP (Internet Protocol) address).","The user , in one embodiment, may utilize a network interface device, such as a personal computer (i.e., PC), a wireless telephone (e.g., cellular phone), a personal digital assistant (i.e., PDA), a notebook computer, and\/or various other generally known types of wired and\/or wireless computing devices, to communicate and interface with the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  to access respective user accounts ,  via any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over the network. For instance, the user  may utilize a network interface application (e.g., a network browser application) to communicate and interface with the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  to access user accounts , , respectively, via the network. As such, in one example, the user  may use a web browser to access the user accounts ,  over the internet.","The user device, in various embodiments, may include other applications as may be desired in one or more embodiments of the present disclosure to provide additional features available to the user . In one example, these other applications may include security applications for implementing user-side security features, programmatic client applications for interlacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over the network, and\/or various other types of generally known programs and\/or software applications. In still other examples, these other applications may interface with the network interface application for improved efficiency and convenience.","The user device, in one embodiment, may include at least one user identifier, which may be implemented, e.g., as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with the network interface application, identifiers associated with hardware of the user device, and\/or various other appropriate identifiers. The user identifier may include one or more attributes and\/or parameters associated with the user, such as personal information related to the user (e.g., one or more user names, passwords, photograph images, biometric ids, addresses, phone numbers, etc.) and banking information (e.g., one or more banking institutions, credit card issuers, user account numbers, security data and information, etc.). In various aspects, the user identifier may be passed with a login request and\/or fund transfer request to the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  via the network, and the user identifier may be used by the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  to associate the user  with user accounts , , respectively.","In one embodiment, as with the user , the recipient  may utilize a network interface device, such as a PC, a wireless telephone, a PDA, a notebook computer, and\/or various other generally known types of wired and\/or wireless computing devices, to communicate and interface with the service provider  to access the recipient account  via any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over the network. For instance, the recipient  may utilize a network interface application to communicate and interlace with the service provider  to access the recipient account  via the network. As such, in this instance, the recipient  may use a web browser to access the recipient account  over the Internet. Even though not shown, it should be appreciated that the recipient  may have a recipient account with the financial institution , without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. As such, the recipient  would also be able to access a recipient account with the financial institution  over the network.","In one embodiment, the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  may maintain one or more servers on the network for processing financial transactions including fund transfers over the network. In this instance, each of the one or more servers for the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  may include one or more databases for storing information related to the bill payment service , the user accounts , , and the recipient account , respectively. Each of the one or more servers for the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  may include some form of network interface application configured to provide access to the bill payment service , the user accounts , , and the recipient account , respectively; over the network to the user  and the recipient , respectively. For example, the user  may interact with the network interface application through a browser application over the network to access one or more of the user accounts , .","The service provider , in one embodiment, is adapted to process financial transitions including fund transfers over the network on behalf of the user  and\/or the recipient . In this instance, the service provider  may utilize some form of fund transfer and settlement application configured to interact with the user  and\/or the recipient  to facilitate fund transfers. In one example, the service provider  may be provided by PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., USA.","The service provider , in one embodiment, may be configured to maintain a plurality of accounts (e.g., user account  and recipient account ), each of which may include account information associated with user  an\/or the recipient . For example, account information may include private financial information of the user  and\/or the recipient , such as one or more account numbers, passwords, credit card information, banking information, or other types of financial information, which may be used to facilitate financial transactions including fund transfers over the network. In various implementations, the system  described herein may be modified to accommodate users and\/or recipients that may or may not be associated with at least one existing account, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","In one embodiment, the user  and\/or the recipient  may have identity attributes stored with the financial institution  and\/or the service provider , and the user  and\/or the recipient  may have credentials to authenticate or verify identity with the financial institution  and\/or the service provider . In one aspect, user attributes may include personal information and\/or banking information, as previously described. In various aspects, the user attributes may be passed to the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  as part of a login, account access request, fund transfer request, and\/or payment request, and the user attributes may be utilized by the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  to associate the user  and\/or the recipient  with the user accounts , , respectively, which are maintained by the financial institution  and\/or the service provider , respectively.","In one embodiment, the financial institution  and\/or the service provider  may be associated with at least one identifier, which may be included as part of a financial transaction including a fund transfer. The identifier may include one or more attributes and\/or parameters related to the financial institution  and\/or the service provider , such as business and\/or banking information. In one example, the identifier for the financial institution  may be passed to the service provider  when the user  requests a fund transfer from the financial institution  to the service provider . In this instance, the identifier may be used by the service provider  to identify and\/or verify the user account  in reference to the financial institution .","In one embodiment, the processing component  of the service provider  may utilize a processing module to process fund transfers between accounts, such as the user accounts ,  and the recipient account . In one implementation, the processing module is adapted to assist with resolving financial transactions including fund transfers through validation, delivery, and settlement. For example, the processing component  in conjunction with the processing module may be adapted to resolve fund transfers between the user  and the recipient , wherein the accounts , ,  may be directly and\/or automatically debited and\/or credited of monetary funds in a manner as accepted by the banking industry.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 5"],"b":["200","200","100","120","140","160","144","140","164","160","164","160","166","160"]},"In one implementation, the method  provides a process of account verification by utilizing the bill payment service  (or some other similar service) of the user's financial institution , which simplifies account verification for the user while maintaining security and reliability. Referring to , the user  provides a login request to the financial institution  (block ) to access the user account  (block ). Then, when the user  attempts to access the bill payment service , the financial institution  determines (block ) whether the user  is a current user of the bill payment service  by, e.g., verifying access privileges for the user  based on information stored with the user account . If the user  has been granted access privileges for the bill payment service , then the user  may proceed to access the bill payment service  (block ). Otherwise, the user  may be prompted to enroll in the bill payment service  (block ) to gain access privileges for the bill payment service  and then proceed to access the bill payment service  (block ).","Once the user  is granted access to the bill payment service  of the user's financial institution  (block ), the user  may add the service provider  as a biller or payee (block ) to link  the user account  of the financial institution  to the user account  of the service provider .","As previously described, the link  may be established between the user account  of the financial institution  and the user account  of the service provider . In one aspect, the user  may provide an e-mail address to the service provider  as a user identity verifier so that the link  may be established between the user account  of the financial institution  and the user account  of the service provider . In one aspect, additional security verification may be obtained by the service provider  to further verify the identity of the user  and provide further security for verifying the link between the two accounts. The additional security verification is described in greater detail herein.","As such, in one embodiment, the link  between the user accounts ,  is an e-mail address related to the user . Accordingly, an e-mail address may be utilized by the user  to establish the user account  with the service provider . After linking user accounts ,  via, e.g., an e-mail address, fund transfers may be processed seamlessly between the user accounts ,  of the financial institution  and the service provider , respectively.","Next, the user  may request a fund transfer from the user account  of the financial institution  to the user account  of the service provider  (block ). In one implementation, the user  adds the payment service  as a payee by, e.g., entering user identity information, such as one or more of an e-mail address, payee name, and\/or an account number. The user  then transfers a nominal amount, such as $1, to the service provider  through the bill payment service  and enters the user's identity information (e.g., an e-mail address of the user  for the service provider ) in a memo field of the fund transfer request. The bill payment service  then transfers the requested funds to the service provider  by, e.g., sending an electronic check or a receipt of the electronic check to the service provider , which includes the user's account number and routing number associated with the user account  of the financial institution .","In one aspect, the electronic check or receipt of the electronic check may comprise an electronic document or a physical document. The service provider  may use information from the document, including a billing address, to verify and\/or establish, the user's account  with the service provider . In one example, the service provider  may transfer the same funds or another amount of funds back to the user's financial institution . As such, in this instance, the user  may simply create and\/or access the user account  with the service provider  by simply signing up the service provider  as payee through the bill payment service  of the financial institution  instead of providing specific account information including account numbers, checking deposits, etc.","In another aspect, additional security verification may be obtained by the service provider  to further verify the identity of the user  and provide further security for verifying the link between the two accounts. Using the bill payment service  to transfer funds from the user account  of the financial institution  to the user account  or recipient account  of the service provider  may be achieved with email account information related to the user . However, for security concerns, when the user accounts ,  are considered linked, a presumption may be made that the user  is the same person having permission to access both user accounts , . Thus, in one embodiment, after an initial fund transfer takes place (block ), the user  may be prompted with an option to link the information related to the user accounts , . Accordingly, the user  may be prompted by the service provider  to provide at least one of a full name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and at least part of a social security number to link the user accounts , . The user  may be prompted to verify random deposit information. For example, the service provider  may transfer random nominal funds (e.g., a random two-digit fund transfer, such as 34 cents or 78 cents) to the user account  with the financial institution , and the user  may be prompted to verify information related to the nominal fund transfer, such as the amount deposited into the user account  and when the deposit occurred.","In another example, the service provider  may prompt the user  to login to the user account  via the service provider server after a fund transfer has been completed to verify or validate the fund transfer. The service provider  would then review information in both user accounts ,  to obtain and match information related to the fund transfer between the user accounts , . For example, the obtained and matched information may include the dollar amount, the date, the memo field (e.g., email address), and\/or the actual transaction identification number for the fund transfer. In other words, the service provider  may review the fund transfer initiated by the user account  and prompt the user  to login to the user account  via the service provider  so that the service provider  may troll, (e.g., with or without user action) both user accounts ,  to verify or validate information from the fund transfer between the user accounts , .","Accordingly, bank information related to the user  may be utilized to establish the secondary account (i.e., the user account ) with the service provider . However, in one aspect, personal and\/or banking information related to the first account (i.e., the user account ) with the financial institution  should be protected until the service provider  verifies that the user  wants to share or link the bank information related to the first account (i.e., user account ) with the secondary account (i.e., user account ). In one aspect, a reason for the additional security verification is that, if funds are transferred to another person's account, (e.g., the recipient account  related to the recipient ), through the bill payment service , any personal and\/or banking information related to the user  should be protected from disclosure to the recipient .","Moreover, since the user  is granted access to the bill payment service  of the user's financial institution  (block ), the user  may add the service provider  and the recipient  as a biller or payee (block ). Next, the user  may request a fund transfer from the user account  of the financial institution  to the recipient account  of the service provider  (block ). As such, in one implementation, the user  may transfer funds to the recipient account  if the recipient  has an existing recipient account  with the service provider . However, in another implementation, the user  may transfer funds to the recipient  via the service provider  even though the recipient  does not have an established account with the service provider . In this instance, when the recipient  attempts to access funds from the service provider , the service provider  may obtain identity information from the recipient  to create and\/or establish an account for the recipient , such as the recipient account . Accordingly, the service provider  may simply add more users to its service roster. In one aspect, if a user (e.g., the user  and\/or the recipient ) has an established account, the method  achieves a person-to-person payment network with the service provider  and the bill payment service  of the financial institution  serving as intermediaries.","As described herein, the method  utilizes inherent features of an online banking account with the bill payment service  (or other similar service) such that information needed by the service provider  to verify an existing account or to create and verify a new account are automatically provided by the user  simply accessing the user's account  and the bill payment service  of the user's financial institution . In one aspect, since the electronic payment resource (e.g., an electronic check) from the bill payment service  includes user information (e.g., user name, billing address, account number, and routing number), a new account may be easily created by the user  simply by sending a small amount of monetary funds to the service provider  through the bill payment service  of the user's financial institution . Once an account is verified, the service provider  may send a message to an e-mail address related to the user  to inform the user  that the account (e.g., the user account ) is active and accessible via the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","100","160","120","140","144","140","164","160","164","160","166","160"]},"In one implementation, the method  provides a process of account verification by utilizing the bill payment service  (or some other similar service) of the user's financial institution , which simplifies account verification for the user and the service provider  while maintaining security and reliability. Referring to , the service provider  receives a fund transfer request from the user  via the bill payment service  of the financial institution  (block ).","In one embodiment, the service provider  is adapted to extract an e-mail address related to the user  from a memo field of the fond transfer request. The e-mail address may be utilized by the service provider  to establish and\/or verify the user account  and\/or to establish the link  between the user account  of the financial institution  and the user account  of the service provider . As such, in one aspect, the user  may provide an e-mail address to the service provider  in the fund transfer request as a user identity verifier to establish and\/or verify the user account  and\/or to establish the link  between the user accounts ,  of the financial institution  and the service provider , respectively. Accordingly, an e-mail address related to the user  may be utilized by the service provider  to establish and\/or verify the user account  with the service provider  and\/or establish the link  between the user accounts ,  of the financial institution  and the service provider , respectively. After linking the user accounts ,  via, e.g., an e-mail address, fund transfers may be processed seamlessly between the user accounts ,  of the financial institution  and the service provider , respectively. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the link  between the user accounts ,  is an e-mail address related to the user .","It should be appreciated that, in various embodiments, the unique identifier (i.e., the user identity verifier) may comprise an e-mail address, telephone number, and\/or various other types of easily remembered addresses and\/or numbers related to the user , without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. It should also be appreciated that using an e-mail address and\/or a telephone number related to the user  for account identity verification makes the matching and\/or creation of another user account (i.e., the user account  with the service provider ) much easier, simpler, and safer. As such, the service provider  is adapted to utilize the e-mail address and\/or the telephone number related to the user  as an improved security measure to verify and\/or establish one or more accounts related to the user .","Next, the service provider  determines (block ) whether the user  is an existing user having an account with service provider  based on information passed with the fund transfer request, such as an e-mail address related to the user . Preferably, the service provider  utilizes an e-mail address related to the user  to determine if the user  has an existing account, such as the user account . If the user  has an existing or established account (e.g., the user account ) with the service provider , then the service provider  verifies access privileges (block ) for the user  based on information stored with the user account . Otherwise, the user  may be prompted to establish an account (block ) with the service provider  to gain access to the user account . Preferably, the service provider  utilizes an e-mail address related to the user  to verify and\/or establish the user account .","Once the user account  is verified and\/or established, then the service provider  may process the fund transfer request (block ). In one aspect, the service provider  may process the fund transfer request by, e.g., linking the user account  of the service provider  to the user account  of the financial institution . The link  facilitates seamless fund transfers between the user accounts ,  of the financial institution  and the service provider , respectively. In one implementation, the service provider  may process a fund transfer request on behalf of the user  by, e.g., receiving funds from the user account  of the financial institution  and crediting the funds to the user account  of the service provider . As previously described in reference to method  of , the user  may add the payment service  as a payee by providing user identity information, such as an e-mail address, payee name, and\/or an account number, to the bill payment service . As part of the fund transfer request, the service provider  may receive a nominal amount offends, such as $1, from the user's financial institution  through the bill payment service  and receive the user's identity information (e.g., an e-mail address of the user  related to the service provider ) in a memo field of the fund transfer request. The service provider  may then receive the requested funds and then credit or deposit the received funds in the user account . In one example, the funds may be received in the form of an electronic check or a receipt of the electronic check, which may include the user's account number and routing number associated with the user account  of the financial institution .","In one aspect, as previously described, the electronic check or receipt of the electronic check may comprise an electronic or physical document. The service provider  may use information from the electronic or physical document, including a billing address of the user , to verify and\/or establish the user's account . In one implementation, the service provider  may transfer the received funds or another amount of funds back to the user's account  with the financial institution . As such, in this instance, the service provider  may simply create and\/or verify the user account  by simply reviewing information related to the user  provided as part of the fund transfer request from the bill payment service  of the financial institution .","In another aspect, additional security verification may be obtained by the service provider  to further verify the identity of the user  and provide further security for verifying the link between the two accounts. Using the bill payment service  to transfer funds from the user account  of the financial institution  to the user account  or recipient account  of the service provider  may be achieved with email account information related to the user . However, for security concerns, after an initial fund transfer takes place, the service provider  may prompt the user  with an option to link the information related to the user accounts , . Accordingly, the service provider  may prompt the user  to provide at least one of a full name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and at least part of a social security number to link the user accounts , . In addition, the user  may be prompted to verify random deposit information. For example, the service provider  may transfer random nominal funds e.g., a random two-digit fund transfer, such as 34 cents or 78 cents) to the user account  with the financial institution , and the user  may be prompted to verify information related to the nominal fund transfer, such as the amount deposited into the user account  and when the deposit occurred.","In another example, the service provider  may prompt the user  to login to the user account  via the service provider server after a fund transfer has been completed to verify or validate the fund transfer. The service provider  would then review information in both user accounts ,  to obtain and match information related to the fund transfer between the user accounts , . For example, the obtained and matched information may include the dollar amount, the date, the memo field (e.g., email address), and\/or the actual transaction identification number for the fund transfer. In other words, the service provider  may review the fund transfer initiated by the user account  and prompt the user  to login to the user account  via the service provider  so that the service provider  may troll (e.g., with or without user knowledge) both user accounts ,  to verify or validate information from the fund transfer between the user accounts , .","Accordingly, bank information related to the user  may be utilized to establish the secondary account (i.e., the user account ) with the service provider . However, in one aspect, personal and\/or banking information related to the first account (i.e., the user account ) with the financial institution  should be protected until the service provider  verifies that the user  wants to share or link the bank information related to the first account (i.e., user account ) with the secondary account (i.e., user account ). In one aspect, a reason for the additional security verification is that, if funds are transferred to another person's account, (e.g., the recipient account  related to the recipient ), through the bill payment service , any personal and\/or banking information related to the user  should be protected from disclosure to the recipient .","Next, the service provider  may obtain recipient information from the fund transfer request (block ) as provided by the user . Then, the service provider  determines (block ) whether the recipient  is an existing user\/recipient having an account (e.g., the recipient account ) with service provider  based on information passed with the fund transfer request. If the recipient  has an established account (e.g., the recipient account ) with the service provider , then the service provider  verifies the recipient account  (block ) for the recipient  based on information stored with the recipient account . Otherwise, the service provider  may establish an account (block ) for the recipient  on behalf of the user  even though the recipient  does not have an existing account.","Once the recipient account  is verified and\/or established, then the service provider  may process the fund transfer request (block ). In one implementation, the service provider  may process a fund transfer request on behalf of the user  by, e.g., receiving funds from the user account  of the financial institution  and crediting the funds to the recipient account  of the service provider . In another implementation, the service provider  may process a fund transfer request on behalf of the user  by, e.g., debiting funds from the user account  of the service provider  and crediting the funds to the recipient account  of the service provider .","As previously described in reference to method  of , the user  may add the service provider  and the recipient  as a payee. As such, the user  may request a fund transfer from the user account  of the financial institution  to the recipient account  of the service provider . The user  may transfer funds to the recipient account  if the recipient  has an existing recipient account  with the service provider . The user  may transfer funds to the recipient  via the service provider  even though the recipient  does not have an established account with the service provider . In this instance, when the recipient  attempts to access funds from the service provider , the service provider  may obtain identity information from the recipient  to grant the recipient  access to the recipient account . Accordingly, the service provider  may simply add more users including the recipient  to its service roster. In one aspect, the method  achieves a person-to-person payment network with the service provider  and the bill payment service  of the financial institution  serving as intermediaries.","As described herein, the method  utilizes inherent features of an online banking account with the bill payment service  (or other similar service) such that the service provider  automatically utilizes information passed with a fund transfer request to verify an existing account or to create and verify a new account. In one aspect, since the electronic payment resource (e.g., an electronic check) from the bill payment service  includes recipient information (e.g., recipient name, billing address, account number, and routing number), a new account for the recipient  may be created by the service provider  simply by utilizing the recipient information passed with the fund transfer request. As such, funds may be deposited in the recipient account  by the service provider  on behalf of the user . Once an account, is verified, the service provider  may send a message to an e-mail address related to the user  to inform the user  that the recipient account  is active and the fund transfer has been processed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","140","160","120","140","160","400"]},"In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, computer system , such as a personal computer and\/or a network server, includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information, which interconnects subsystems and components, such as processing component  (e.g., processor, micro-controller, digital signal processor (DSP), etc.), system memory component.
