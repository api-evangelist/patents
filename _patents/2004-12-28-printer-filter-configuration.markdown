title: Printer filter configuration
abstract: A flexible printing subsystem is enabled with a printer filter pipeline. A configurable and arbitrary number of printer filters forming a printer filter pipeline are applied to files that are to be printed. In a described implementation, the printer filter pipeline may implement enhancement features and conversion functions as determined by the individual printer filters forming the printer filter pipeline. The printer filter pipeline is established in accordance with a printer filter configuration file. The printer filter configuration file stipulates a printer filter order and includes a printer filter entry associated with each printer filter to be part of the printer filter pipeline. Each printer filter entry identifies the associated printer filter by name and enumerates the interfaces thereof. Printer filters may be adjacently linked in a printer filter pipeline when their mating interfaces match.

Moreover, a hardcopy version of certain kinds of documents and artistic creations may always be desirable. Hence, printing is an important function provided by computing devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","101","105","107","1","101","101","103","103","101","103","105","105","107","107"]},"Each printer  is associated with a driver  and a print processor . As illustrated, printer # () is associated with driver () and print processor (), and printer #n (n) is associated with driver (n) and print processor (n). Print processors  are capable of providing printing enhancements such as transparences, watermarks, binding layouts, and n-up printing. Drivers  are responsible for converting printable file  from a computer language to a printer language.","Print processor  operates on printable file  to produce an enhanced printable file . After the enhancements are provided by print processor , driver  operates on the enhanced printable file  to create a converted (and enhanced) printable file . The converted printable file  can then be printed by a printer  that is associated with the print processor  and driver .","Each printer , or more specifically each printer queue in print spooler , has no more than a single associated driver  and a single associated print processor . Each particular driver  and print processor  pair are specifically designed to work together. Consequently, drivers  and print processors  cannot be freely interchanged with one another. Print spoolers  are designed to utilize at most one driver  and one print processor  per printer . Consequently, a new enhancement feature or conversion function can be added only by installing a completely new print processor  or driver , respectively, which replaces a previous one.","In short, existing printing subsystems are designed to utilize one driver  and one print processor  for any given printer . The order in which they operate is predefined with print processor  operating prior to driver . Both the input and the output interfaces for drivers  and print processors  are fixed. Finally, the data types with which drivers  and print processors  interact are also fixed.","Accordingly, there is a need for general schemes and\/or techniques that can facilitate printing flexibility and\/or adjustability across a range of printing features and functions.","A flexible printing subsystem is enabled with a printer filter pipeline. A configurable and arbitrary number of printer filters forming a printer filter pipeline are applied to files that are to be printed. In a described implementation, the printer filter pipeline may implement enhancement features and conversion functions as determined by the individual printer filters forming the printer filter pipeline. The printer filter pipeline is established in accordance with a printer filter configuration file. The printer filter configuration file stipulates a printer filter order and includes a printer filter entry associated with each printer filter to be part of the printer filter pipeline. Each printer filter entry identifies the associated printer filter by name and enumerates the interfaces thereof. Printer filters may be adjacently linked in a printer filter pipeline when their mating interfaces match.","Other method, system, approach, apparatus, device, media, procedure, arrangement, etc. implementations are described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","212","212","210","210","210","212","210"]},"As illustrated, flexible printing scenario  includes an application , a print spooler , and \u201cn\u201d printers ( . . . n), where \u201cn\u201d is an integer equal to one or greater. Application  may be, for example, a word processor, a spreadsheet program, an email client, a web browser, an artistic and\/or entertainment program, an installation program, some combination thereof, and so forth. Printers  may be any type of printer, including professional or consumer printers, ink jet or laser printers, networked or directly-connected printers, and so forth.","Each printer  corresponds to a respective printer filter pipeline  and is associated with multiple printer filters  thereof. As illustrated, printer # () corresponds to printer filter pipeline () and is associated with filter A A(), filter B B(), filter C C(), . . . and possibly more such filters  as indicated by the ellipses. Printer #n (n) corresponds to printer filter pipeline (n) and is associated with filter A A(n), filter B B(n), filter C C(n), filter D D(n) . . . and possibly more such filters . As is described further herein below with particular reference to , individual printer filters  are capable of providing at least one printing enhancement feature and\/or are responsible for at least partially converting printable file  into a printer-compatible language from a computer-compatible format.","In operation, application  creates or otherwise has access to a printable file . Printable file  is provided (e.g., as a stream of bits) to print spooler  after a user activates a print command through application  (or using another software construct). By way of example only, when application  provides printable file  to print spooler , printable file  may be in a computer-compatible format such as an enhanced metafile format (EMF). Print spooler  accepts printable file  from application  to effectuate the printing process.","It should be understood that application  may not directly provide printable file  to print spooler  and that print spooler  likewise may not directly accept printable file  from application . There may be one or more intervening system components. For example, application  may directly provide printable file  to a graphics subsystem (not shown), which may modify printable file  and then provide (modified) printable file  to print spooler . For instance, application  may call an API of the graphics subsystem. Regardless, application  effectively provides printable file  directly or indirectly to print spooler .","In a described implementation, print spooler  is a component that is capable of managing one or more printers  and orchestrating print jobs with printers . More specifically, print spooler  is capable of utilizing at least one designated printer filter pipeline  when orchestrating print jobs. Print spooler  is adapted to apply printable file  to the print filters  of the designated corresponding printer filter pipeline . After printable file  is passed through printer filters  of the corresponding printer filter pipeline  for conversion and possible enhancement, printable file  comprises a printer-compatible file that may be consumed for printing by printer .","Differently-formatted versions of printable file  may concurrently exist within a scenario or device. Differently-formatted versions of printable file  may arise, for example, as printable file  is applied to and traverses printer filter pipeline . For instance, there may simultaneously be a (e.g., residual) computer-language compatible printable file  and a printer-language compatible printable file , as well as any intermediate versions. Also, a copy of printable file  (in any format) may be stored when an original is forwarded from application  to print spooler , for example, or a copy of printable file  (in any format) may be forwarded when an original is stored.","Application  and printers  may optionally be specially designed and\/or modified to operate in conjunction with a printing subsystem that is capable of utilizing a printer filter pipeline . For example, an application  may add a printer filter  to a printer filter pipeline  and\/or rely on features or functions of a particular printer filter  or a combination of printer filters . Also, a printer  may be capable of following an instruction that results from one or more printer filters . Applications  and printers  may alternatively entail other special designs or modifications to improve and\/or facilitate their operation in conjunction with printer filter pipelines .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 7"],"b":["300","304","306","300"]},"As illustrated, device  includes an operating system , one or more applications , and printing subsystem . Optionally, printing subsystem  may be fully or partially part of and\/or integrated with operating system . Alternatively, printing subsystem  may run on top of or along side of operating system .","In a described implementation, printing subsystem  includes print spooler  and \u201cN\u201d printer filters ( . . . N), with \u201cN\u201d comprising an integer of one or greater. Filter A A, filter B B, filter C C, filter D D . . . filter N N are specifically shown in . However, one, two, three, or more printer filters  may be present at device .","Printing subsystem  also includes \u201cn\u201d printer filter configuration files . Specifically, printer filter configuration file # () . . . printer filter configuration file #n (n) are stored at device  as part of printing subsystem . Although no one-to-one correspondence need be established or otherwise exist, in a described implementation there is a respective printer filter configuration file ( . . . n) for each installed printer ( . . . n).","In a described implementation, each printer filter configuration file  includes sufficient information to enable printing subsystem  to establish a printer filter pipeline  (of ) as well as to utilize the established printer filter pipeline  in a print job. For example, a printer filter configuration file  may identify the printer filters  of a given printer filter pipeline , may enumerate input and output interfaces for the individual printer filters , may stipulate an order for the printer filters  of the given printer filter pipeline , and so forth. An example printer filter configuration file  is described further herein below with particular reference to .","Printer filters A-N, individually and in groups of two or more, may provide any printing enhancement(s) and\/or perform any language or format conversion(s). Eight examples of printer filters A-N are described below. First, a printer filter  may be a watermark filter that underlays a specified watermark on at least one page of a print job. Second, a printer filter  may be a selector filter that selects between or among different available versions of a current print job. For instance, different versions may be based on language (e.g., English, French, or German), on colors (e.g., grayscale versus color, color depth, etc.), and so forth.","Third, a printer filter  may be an N-up filter that places \u201cN\u201d logical pages on each printed sheet. Fourth, a printer filter  may be a binding filter that changes directional orientation of printed pages depending on what type of binding (e.g., book form, top binding, side binding, etc.) is intended. Fifth, a printer filter  may be a transparency filter that ensures that color mixtures are appropriate to properly reflect the transparency of objects as well as the relative depths of respective objects.","Sixth, a printer filter  may be a renderer filter that performs a conversion from a computer format to a printer language. For instance, a conversion from EMF to either Postscript or printer control language (PCL) may be performed. Seventh, a printer filter  may be an accounting filter that tracks a number of printed pages and may assign each printed page to a different category (e.g., personal\/employee, customer number, corporate number, file number, etc.). Eighth, a printer filter  may be a color enhancement filter that tunes color combinations. One or more other printer filter  realizations may alternatively be implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["306","306","304","212","212","306","210","408","306","210","210","210","408","408","408"]},"The printer filter configuration information for the \u201cN\u201d printer filters A-N may be arranged and\/or organized in any manner. In a described implementation, however, filter names  and filter interfaces  are arranged together with regard to their respective printer filters  in respective printer filter entries . As illustrated, printer filter entry A A includes a filter name A A and a filter interface A, printer filter entry B B includes a filter name B B and a filter interface B . . . and printer filter entry N N includes a filter name N N and a filter interface N.","Printer filter configuration file  also includes a printer filter order . The printer filter order information for printer filter order  includes a stipulated order in which printer filters A-N are to be established for a printer filter pipeline  that corresponds to the printer filter configuration file . Printer filter order  may be realized in any of many possible manners. For example, printer filter order information may be inherently included in printer filter configuration file  by the order of filter entries . Alternatively, printer filter configuration file  may include a field that comprises the printer filter order information of printer filter order . An example of a printer filter order  and the resulting printer filter pipeline  is described further herein below with particular reference to .","It should be noted that a printer filter configuration file  need not employ all printer filters  that are available on a given device. Similarly, a printer filter order  of a given printer filter configuration file  need not stipulate all of the printer filters  that have an associated filter entry  in that given printer filter configuration file . Although printer filter configuration file  may be realized in any manner, in a described implementation printer filter configuration file  is realized as an assembly (in managed code environments) or as a dynamic link library (.dll) file (in traditional or pre-compiled code environments). An example of a printer filter configuration file  that is in an extensible markup language (XML) format is presented below after the description of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["212","210","212","406","406","210","212","212","210","210","210"]},"As illustrated, printer filter pipeline * includes three filters: (1) printer filter B B, (2) printer filter D D, and (3) printer filter A A. Each printer filter  includes an input interface  and an output interface . As printable file  is applied to printer filter pipeline * and as it traverses each printer filter , each printer filter  receives printable file  at its input interface  and forwards a filtered printable file  at its output interface .","Printer filter B B has an input interface  of type \u0398 and an output interface  also of type \u0398. Printer filter D D has an input interface  of type \u0398 and an output interface  of type \u0394. Printer filter A A has an input interface  of type \u0394 and an output interface  of type \u03a3. With reference also to , each filter interface  can enumerate both an input interface  and an output interface . Examples of printer filter interface types include, but are not limited to: a stream interface type, a visual tree (VT) interface type, a fixed document interface type, a document sequence interface type, a fixed page interface type, other present and future interface types, some combination thereof, and so forth.","For a printable file  to traverse printer filter pipeline *, mating interfaces between any two adjacent printer filters  are matched. Two interface types match if they are identical or known to be compatible such that data formatted as one interface type can be understood and correctly processed as data formatted as the other interface type. By way of example only, an interface type of an output interface  may be a subset of an interface type of an input interface  and still be compatible.","As shown, the mating interfaces (i) between printer filter B B and printer filter D D and (ii) between printer filter D D and printer filter A A do match. More specifically, the output interface  of printer filter B B and the input interface  of printer filter D D are both of an interface type \u0398. Also, the output interface  of printer filter D D and the input interface  of printer filter A A are both of an interface type \u0394. Consequently, a printable file  may be passed (i) between printer filter B B and printer filter D D and (ii) between printer filter D D and printer filter A A.","For printer filter pipeline * overall, printable file  is applied thereto as input data . Input data  represents printable file  in a computer-language-compatible format. As printable file  traverses each respective filter  from its associated input interface  to its associated output interface , printable file  is filtered in some manner, as is described herein above with particular reference to . After traversing the printer filters  of printer filter pipeline *, printable file  is produced as output data . Thus, output data  represents printable file  in a printer-language-compatible format after filtering. Printable file  as output data  may therefore be forwarded by print spooler  (of ) to a printer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 2-5"],"b":["600","600","600","602","616","600","600","304","300"]},"At block , a printer filter configuration file is accessed. For example, a printer filter configuration file  may be accessed. At block , a printer filter order that stipulates an order for printer filters is extracted. For example, a printer filter order  that stipulates an order for printer filters  for a printer filter pipeline  may be extracted (i) from a (e.g., separate) field of printer filter configuration file  or (ii) by analysis of an instrinsic order of printer filter entries  of printer filter configuration file .","At block , for each stipulated printer filter, an associated printer filter entry is extracted. For example, for each printer filter  that is stipulated in printer filter order , an associated printer filter entry  may be extracted from printer filter configuration file . Each extracted printer filter entry  may include an identified printer filter name  and an enumerated printer filter interface . Each enumerated printer filter interface  may include an input interface  and an output interface .","At block , it is verified that mating interfaces of the stipulated printing filters along the printer filter pipeline match. For example, it may be verified that mating interfaces of adjacent printer filters  of printer filter pipeline  match. More specifically, it may be verified that an interface type of an output interface  for each printer filter  is compatible with an interface type of an input interface  for a succeeding printer filter  in printer filter pipeline .","At block , it is determined if a non-matching mating interface is detected based on the verification. For example, it may be determined if two mated interfaces \/ of adjacent printer filters  are detected to be non-matching during the verification. If yes, a non-matching mating interface is detected, then at block  a non-matching printer filter error notification is provided. For example, printing subsystem  in conjunction with operating system  may provide an error notification to a user that indicates an incompatible printer filter pipeline  has been stipulated by the order of printer filters  in printer filter order .","If, on the other hand, no non-matching mating interface is detected (as determined at block ), then at block  a printer filter pipeline is constructed (using printer filters) responsive to a printer filter order and based on printer filter entries. For example, printer filter pipeline  may be constructed using printer filters  responsive to printer filter order  and based on printer filter entries  of printer filter configuration file . For instance, with a printer filter order * (of ), a printer filter pipeline * may be constructed.","At block , the constructed printer filter pipeline is utilized with one or more print jobs. For example, a printable file  may be applied to printer filter pipeline  such that printer filters  thereof filter printable file  so that printable file  is converted from a computer-language format to a printer-language format and optionally enhanced.","The actions of flow diagram  may be performed in many different alternative orders.

The components of computer  may include, but are not limited to, one or more processors or processing units , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including processor  to system memory .","Processors  are not limited by the materials from which they are formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein. For example, processors  may be comprised of semiconductor(s) and\/or transistors (e.g., electronic integrated circuits (ICs)). In such a context, processor-executable instructions may be electronically-executable instructions. Alternatively, the mechanisms of or for processors , and thus of or for computer , may include, but are not limited to, quantum computing, optical computing, mechanical computing (e.g., using nanotechnology), and so forth.","System bus  represents one or more of any of many types of wired or wireless bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a point-to-point connection, a switching fabric, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, such architectures may include an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, an Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, a Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, a Peripheral Component Interconnects (PCI) bus also known as a Mezzanine bus, some combination thereof, and so forth.","Computer  typically includes a variety of processor-accessible media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer  or another (e.g., electronic) device, and it includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media, and storage and transmission media\u201d with \u201cComputer  typically includes a variety of processor-accessible media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer  or another (e.g., electronic) device, and it includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media, and storage media.","System memory  includes processor-accessible storage media in the form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM) , and\/or non-volatile memory, such as read only memory (ROM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules\/instructions that are immediately accessible to and\/or being presently operated on by processing unit .","Computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable and\/or volatile\/non-volatile storage media. By way of example,  illustrates a hard disk drive or disk drive array  for reading from and writing to a (typically) non-removable, non-volatile magnetic media (not separately shown); a magnetic disk drive  for reading from and writing to a (typically) removable, non-volatile magnetic disk  (e.g., a \u201cfloppy disk\u201d); and an optical disk drive  for reading from and\/or writing to a (typically) removable, non-volatile optical disk  such as a CD, DVD, or other optical media. Hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are each connected to system bus  by one or more storage media interfaces . Alternatively, hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  may be connected to system bus  by one or more other separate or combined interfaces (not shown).","The disk drives and their associated processor-accessible media provide non-volatile storage of processor-executable instructions, such as data structures, program modules, and other data for computer . Although example computer  illustrates a hard disk , a removable magnetic disk , and a removable optical disk , it is to be appreciated that other types of processor-accessible media may store instructions that are accessible by a device, such as magnetic cassettes or other magnetic storage devices, flash memory, compact disks (CDs), digital versatile disks (DVDs) or other optical storage, RAM, ROM, electrically-erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROM), and so forth. Such media may also include so-called special purpose or hard-wired IC chips. In other words, any processor-accessible media may be utilized to realize the storage media of the example operating environment .","Any number of program modules (or other units or sets of processor-executable instructions) may be stored on hard disk , magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM , and\/or RAM , including by way of general example, an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . These processor-executable instructions may include, for example, one or more printer filter configuration file  data structure(s), a program\/module for print spooler , applications  and operating system , one or more printer filters , a printable file , and so forth.","A user may enter commands and\/or information into computer  via input devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device  (e.g., a \u201cmouse\u201d). Other input devices  (not shown specifically) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, serial port, video camera, scanner, and\/or the like. These and other input devices are connected to processing unit  via input\/output interfaces  that are coupled to system bus . However, input devices and\/or output devices may instead be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, a game port, a universal serial bus (USB) port, an infrared port, an IEEE 1394 (\u201cFirewire\u201d) interface, an IEEE 802.11 wireless interface, a Bluetooth\u00ae wireless interface, and so forth.","A monitor\/view screen  or other type of display device may also be connected to system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . Video adapter  (or another component) may be or may include a graphics card for processing graphics-intensive calculations and for handling demanding display requirements. Typically, a graphics card includes a graphics processing unit (GPU), video RAM (VRAM), etc. to facilitate the expeditious display of graphics and performance of graphics operations. In addition to monitor , other output peripheral devices may include components such as speakers (not shown) and a printer , which may be connected to computer  via input\/output interfaces .","Computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computing device . By way of example, remote computing device  may be a peripheral device, a personal computer, a portable computer (e.g., laptop computer, tablet computer, PDA, mobile station, etc.), a palm or pocket-sized computer, a watch, a gaming device, a server, a router, a network computer, a peer device, another network node, or another device type as listed above, and so forth. However, remote computing device  is illustrated as a portable computer that may include many or all of the elements and features described herein with respect to computer .","Logical connections between computer  and remote computer  are depicted as a local area network (LAN)  and a general wide area network (WAN) . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, the Internet, fixed and mobile telephone networks, ad-hoc and infrastructure wireless networks, mesh networks, other wireless networks, gaming networks, some combination thereof, and so forth. Such networks and logical and physical communications connections are additional examples of transmission media.","When implemented in a LAN networking environment, computer  is usually connected to LAN  via a network interface or adapter . When implemented in a WAN networking environment, computer  typically includes a modem  or other component for establishing communications over WAN . Modem , which may be internal or external to computer , may be connected to system bus  via input\/output interfaces  or any other appropriate mechanism(s). It is to be appreciated that the illustrated network connections are examples and that other manners for establishing communication link(s) between computers  and  may be employed.","In a networked environment, such as that illustrated with operating environment , program modules or other instructions that are depicted relative to computer , or portions thereof, may be fully or partially stored in a remote media storage device. By way of example, remote application programs  reside on a memory component of remote computer  but may be usable or otherwise accessible via computer . Also, for purposes of illustration, application programs  and other processor-executable instructions such as operating system  are illustrated herein as discrete blocks, but it is recognized that such programs, components, and other instructions reside at various times in different storage components of computing device  (and\/or remote computing device ) and are executed by processor(s)  of computer  (and\/or those of remote computing device ).","Although systems, media, devices, methods, procedures, apparatuses, techniques, schemes, approaches, procedures, arrangements, and other implementations have been described in language specific to structural, logical, algorithmic, and functional features and\/or diagrams, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or diagrams described.
