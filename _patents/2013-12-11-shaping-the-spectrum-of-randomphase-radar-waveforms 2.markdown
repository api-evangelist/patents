title: Shaping the spectrum of random-phase radar waveforms
abstract: The various technologies presented herein relate to generation of a desired waveform profile in the form of a spectrum of apparently random noise (e.g., white noise or colored noise), but with precise spectral characteristics. Hence, a waveform profile that could be readily determined (e.g., by a spoofing system) is effectively obscured. Obscuration is achieved by dividing the waveform into a series of chips, each with an assigned frequency, wherein the sequence of chips are subsequently randomized. Randomization can be a function of the application of a key to the chip sequence. During processing of the echo pulse, a copy of the randomized transmitted pulse is recovered or regenerated against which the received echo is correlated. Hence, with the echo energy range-compressed in this manner, it is possible to generate a radar image with precise impulse response.

The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","A typical pulse-Doppler radar system emits a series of pulses, and further can collect echo signals. For each pulse, the echo signal(s) is correlated against the transmitted waveform to provide a range sounding, whereby the range soundings are compared against each other across pulses to discern Doppler information. The correlation function may be implemented as an equivalent matched filter, or as a direct correlation.","Radar modes that typically operate in this fashion include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inverse-SAR (ISAR), various Moving Target Indicator (MTI) radars, radar systems which are generically range-Doppler radars, coherent search radar systems, etc.","The choice of waveforms to utilize can depend on the objectives of the radar system with respect to ease of waveform generation, downstream processing issues, and desires for probabilities of detection, interception, spoofing, etc. Typically waveforms are required that offer a large time-bandwidth product to afford both high energy and wide bandwidth for improved range resolution. There are a plethora of waveforms from which to choose. These include, but are not limited to, Linear-Frequency-Modulated (LFM) chirp, Non-Linear FM (NLFM) chirp, stepped frequency systems, various phase-coded modulation schemes, and random and pseudo-random noise waveforms. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.","A conventional radar system employs a final transmit power amplifier that is normally operated in compression to maximize transmitted power output and\/or efficiency. However, such operation of the amplifier is non-linear and, accordingly, may not faithfully reproduce amplitude modulations, etc., and further, may act to limit such modulations.","It is well-known to a person having skill in the art that the output of a matched filter, when input with a signal to which it is matched, is the autocorrelation function of the waveform. Furthermore, the autocorrelation function is related by the Fourier Transform (FT) to the Energy Spectral Density (ESD) of the waveform. That is, the autocorrelation function and ESD are FT-pairs. Matched filters have a principal advantage of maximizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of energy in a final range-Doppler map. Most radar processing seeks to implement matched filters, or at least nearly so.","A problem with matched filters for many waveforms is undesirably high processing sidelobe levels in a range-Doppler map. The high processing sidelobe levels are usually mitigated with additional filtering, often by using data tapering, or window functions, during the processing. Although this may \u2018un-match\u2019 the filter to a degree, which can result in a slight degradation of the range-Doppler map SNR, this tradeoff is usually deemed worthwhile. While the SNR degradation is termed as \u201cslight\u201d, it is typically in the 1-2 dB range.","An alternative is to use waveforms designed to exhibit desirable ESD properties, where the autocorrelation of the waveform exhibits desirable, or at least acceptable processing sidelobe levels directly, that is, without additional filtering and the attendant SNR loss.","Various techniques relate to noise radar (radar that uses noise as a transmitted waveform), however, most techniques fail to address issues relating to sidelobe suppression. Where sidelobe suppression is addressed, a conventional technique operates on received data only, by reducing SNR, or operates in a non-linear fashion with resultant adverse effects to some subsequent exploitation schemes. Other techniques relate to shaping the ESD, but typically, such techniques may be limited to specific functions like a Gaussian distribution of frequencies to reduce processing sidelobes in a SAR image.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","Various exemplary embodiments presented herein relate to generating a randomized radar pulse waveform. A method is presented comprising determining a waveform spectrum profile, the determining being based on at least one parameter. The method further comprising assigning sample frequencies of the waveform spectrum profile to a set of chips and configuring an order of chips in the set of chips based upon a randomizing key to form a randomized sequence of chips, wherein the method further comprising transmitting a pulse signal having a waveform that is based upon the randomized sequence of chips.","Another exemplary embodiment pertains to a radar system for generating and processing randomized waveforms. The radar system comprises a chip frequency component configured to slice a radar waveform into a plurality of chips, wherein the plurality of chips have an original sequence. The system further comprising a chip randomizer component configured to re-sequence the original sequence of chips into a randomized sequence of chips. The system further comprising a phase accumulator component configured to accumulate frequencies of the randomized sequence of chips to facilitate production of a phase function for each chip in the randomized sequence of chips.","Another exemplary embodiment pertains to a method for utilizing a randomized radar pulse waveform. The method comprises slicing a waveform into an original sequence of chips. The method further comprising obtaining a randomization key and randomizing the sequence of chips with the randomization key to form a transmittable pulse comprising a randomized sequence of chips. The method further comprising transmitting the pulse and receiving an echo pulse, wherein the echo pulse is based at least in part on an interaction of the transmitted pulse and a target. The method further comprising applying the randomization key to re-sequence the randomized sequence of chips into the original chip sequence and generating a radar image based at least in part on comparing an energy of a first chip in the original sequence of chips with an energy of the first chip in the re-sequenced original sequence of chips derived from the echo pulse.","The above summary presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and\/or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Various technologies pertaining to randomizing a waveform are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.","Further, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor\u201d. That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form. Additionally, as used herein, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something, and is not intended to indicate a preference.","The various embodiments presented herein relate to generation of a desired waveform profile in the form of a spectrum of apparently random noise (e.g., white noise or colored noise). Hence, the shape of a waveform profile that can be readily determined (e.g., by a spoofing system) is effectively obscured. The obscuration is achieved by dividing the waveform profile into a sequence of chips (or slices), whereby each chip is a portion of a waveform formed by slicing the waveform into sub-portions as a function of any suitable parameter such as frequency, time, etc. The sequence of chips within a pulse frame can be subsequently randomized. Accordingly, the randomized sequence of chips can appear to be a noise transmission. Randomization can be a function of the application of a factor, key, seed or other randomizing variable(s) to the chip sequence. During decoding of an echo radar pulse (e.g., a reflection off a target of the waveform having the randomized chip sequence) received at the radar system, the received echo signal is compared against a copy of the transmitted waveform having the same randomized chip sequence. Hence, by having knowledge of the specific randomized order of the chips in the transmitted waveform, it is possible to regenerate the same chip sequence for comparison to the received echoes, and furthermore, it is possible to determine any deviation in the reflected pulse from the transmitted waveform and hence identify artifacts (or other target characteristics) in the reflected pulse to facilitate generation of a radar image. While a single, randomized, pulse may appear to comprise of a greater degree of noise compared with the desired waveform, when a plurality of randomized pulses are averaged (e.g., with ensemble averaging), the average tends to replicate the desired waveform properties, in particular the shape of its ESD. For example, the randomization can be applied to a sequence of pulses, with a degree of randomization being introduced based upon the number of pulses in the sequence. Hence, the randomization of the pulses can also be applied collectively such that the randomization is not only applied to a single pulse in isolation, but the randomization is also applied to obtain the desired waveform properties when the randomization of the pulses is averaged by the ensemble average.","It is to be noted that a random-phase signal can have a white spectrum, or it may have a shaped (non-white) spectrum. Further, a sampled-data random-phase signal can have a non-zero ESD over the bandwidth equal to the sampling frequency. Furthermore, a random phase signal can also have random phase differences between two independent random phases. A phase increment across a time increment is a phase-rate, or frequency, while a phase-rate change can be considered a frequency-hop. By controlling the phase-rate (the characteristics of phase increments), it is possible to control the energy spectrum of the random-phase signal. In an aspect, spectrum precision and sharpness can be enhanced by holding a frequency for a given chip length. Hence, when considering digitally generated phase samples, the chip length may require a plurality of samples, which can be considered a time-bandwidth issue. The definition of \u2018a plurality\u2019 can depend on the sharpness desired, but several tens' of samples may be adequate. Accordingly, to facilitate shaping of the ESD of a random-phase signal, control of the average energy at various phase-rates may be required. The ESD shaping can be achieved by controlling the likelihood of specific phase increments, controlling the duration of a specific phase increment chip length, or a combination thereof. For range-Doppler images, the 2-dimensional impulse response (IPR) may be of principal concern. This may tend to average out the random effects of any single pulse.","The various embodiments presented herein facilitate generation of random-phase waveforms which are capable of relatively precise IPR shapes in a range-Doppler map. The capability is achieved by controlling the statistical characteristics of the phase \u2018increments\u2019, or instantaneous frequencies. Further, it is possible to shape the ESD of such a waveform by controlling the instantaneous frequencies themselves, or the durations of the frequency chips, or both. Furthermore, it is possible to shape the ensemble average ESD to match a specified window taper function, thereby precisely providing a desired shape to the IPR, particularly in the mainlobe, in a range-Doppler map. Also, a range-Doppler map or image can tend to average out fluctuations in the ESD of any single pulse. Consequently, the coherent processing interval (CPI) of the random signals can be considered as a whole.","To facilitate understanding of the various embodiments presented herein, various random-phase waveforms are developed and presented (where such random-phase waveforms can be compared with frequency modulated (FM) chirp waveforms that are readily known in the art). Throughout the various examples and embodiments presented herein, and unless otherwise noted, a digitally generated phase with the following radar parameters is utilized as a reference:","f, sampling frequency, =1 GHz;","B, waveform bandwidth (desired)=500 MHz;","T, pulse width=10.24 \u03bcs;","N, number of pulses=1024;","where, a sampling frequency, f, can be a function of a limitation of one or more hardware components utilized during generation of a waveform; the waveform bandwidth, B, can be calculated based upon a required range resolution of a radar system; the pulse-width, T, can be chosen to meet timing requirements for the ranges of interest to prevent occlusion, and the number of pulses, N, can be calculated to facilitate achieving Doppler resolution requirements and\/or SNR requirements. It is to be appreciated that while the various embodiments are presented herein, each is based on analyses respectively comprising N=1024 pulsed waveforms, the according ensemble averages include according artifacts (e.g., lack of a fully smoothed average waveform) which may not be present in systems using a greater number of pulsed waveforms. For example, a SAR image may be formed from 10,000-100,000 pulses, and accordingly the ensemble average will likely be much smoother with the low level artifact of a jagged waveform being smoothed out by averaging over a much larger number of pulses.","Additional parameters that can be defined are:","b, fractional bandwidth=B\/f;","T, sample spacing or period within pulse=1\/f;","I, number of sample periods within pulse=T\/T.","In an aspect, the various embodiments presented herein can be utilized by a pulse-Doppler system, e.g., a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based system. Further, the various examples and embodiments presented herein can be directed towards an IPR sidelobe mitigation technique, for example, at a level consistent with a \u221235 dB Taylor weighting (=4). Such an IPR shape is common for SAR. It is to be appreciated that any other characteristic may be chosen, e.g., for another mode of operation. Further, to facilitate understanding, the following presumes no system noise exists in the generated or processed waveforms, hence, any uncertainty in a waveform is purely a function of the waveform, and not of measurement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2"},"Moreover, the acts described herein may be computer-executable instructions that can be implemented by one or more processors and\/or stored on a computer-readable medium or media. The computer-executable instructions can include a routine, a sub-routine, programs, a thread of execution, and\/or the like. Still further, results of acts of the methodology can be stored in a computer-readable medium, displayed on a display device, and\/or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110"]},"At , the various parameters for transmission of a signal having the waveform can be identified. Such parameters can include what the sidelobe levels are, what window function to utilize, etc. In an embodiment, a window function can be utilized that minimizes mainlobe width while maintaining a peak sidelobe constraint, where such window functions can include a Taylor window, a Dolph-Tschebysheff window, a Hamming window, a Gaussian-based window, etc. For example, a Taylor window can approximate a Dolph-Tschebysheff window near its mainlobe, but unlike the Dolph-Tschebysheff window, a Taylor window can allow sidelobes to decay at a rate of 1\/f beyond some distance from the mainlobe. Sidelobe levels and the point beyond which sidelobes roll off are effectively parameters to the Taylor window. In the various embodiments presented herein, a \u221235 dB Taylor window (=4) is utilized.","At , the spectral shaping for the desired waveform can be defined, whereby sample frequencies of the desired waveform spectrum profile can be assigned to a set of chips. Spectral shaping can include a number of parameters including frequency, frequency range, frequency distribution, etc. In an embodiment, the frequency range of the waveform can be divided (or sliced) into a number (or plurality) of chips (which may also be referred to as slices), whereby the chips can form a sequence across the frequency range. For chirp waveforms, these chips can also form a sequence across the time duration of the pulse. In an aspect, the sequence of chips at this stage can be considered to be an original chip sequence, while the later referenced randomized sequence of chips can be considered to be a randomized chip sequence of the original chip sequence. In an embodiment, the chips can be of a constant frequency increment across a particular band, while in another embodiment, the chips can be of a non-constant frequency increment across a particular band, etc. In an embodiment, based upon the chosen frequency distribution, the frequency distribution with non-constant increments in frequency (e.g., a non-constant frequency spacing for the sequence of chips) can generate the required spectral shaping (e.g. required waveform). In another embodiment, where a constant increment in frequency is utilized then the required spectral shaping can be obtained as a function of adjusting a duration of a chip, adjusting a probability of selection of a chip of a particular frequency, or a combination of both, to facilitate obtaining a required energy for that particular chip, and accordingly, the required spectral shaping. In another embodiment, a duration for transmission of each individual chip can be configured to facilitate attaining the desired spectral shaping. Hence, by determining a frequency for a chip, and also a duration of transmission at the chip frequency, a spectral shaping can be achieved where a first chip, at a first frequency, is transmitted for a first duration (e.g., to obtain a low magnitude or energy at the first frequency), while a second chip, at a second frequency, is transmitted for a second duration where the second duration can exceed the first duration (e.g., to obtain a high magnitude or energy at the second frequency relative to the first frequency).","At , a randomization key can be generated. The randomization key can be generated in real-time (e.g., on-the-fly) or the randomization key can be retrieved from a look-up table (e.g., retrieved from a data store) comprising a plurality of randomization keys to achieve the desired randomization (e.g., to achieve a desired result of ensemble averaging). In an aspect, the randomization key can be generated as a function of a seed value being applied to an algorithm in a pseudo-random number generator, whereby the algorithm can be constrained to achieve the desired chip randomization (e.g., constrained to a number of chips) and the output of the pseudo-random number generator is a key (or pseudo-random code) to be applied to the original sequence of the plurality of chips.","At , the sequence of the plurality of chips (e.g., defined for the set of frequencies for a given duration) can be randomized based upon application of the randomization key to the original, sequentially defined plurality of chips. The randomization operation can form a randomized sequence of chips.","At , the sequence of randomized chips can be compiled to generate and\/or form a waveform that appears to be comprised of random noise. Such a waveform can be referred to as a radar pulse profile.","At , a radar pulse signal having the radar pulse profile can be transmitted, whereupon, the flow can return to  where the next randomization key can be generated and another pulse comprising the randomized sequence of chips can be transmitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","140","150","160","100","210"]},"At , a copy of the transmitted waveform is recovered and\/or regenerated that exhibits the same randomized order in its sequence of chips, thereby serving as a reference waveform for the subsequent processing of the reflected radar pulse.","At , based upon the recovered and\/or regenerated copy of the randomized sequence of chips in transmitted pulse, the radar received echo pulse can be processed to facilitate detection of a target(s), etc. For example, an energy of a first chip in the randomized sequence of chips can be compared with an energy of the first chip in the received chips (which matches the transmitted sequence of chips) derived from the reflected (echo) radar pulse, an energy of a second chip in the randomized sequence of chips can be compared with an energy of the second chip in the received chips, and so on. Based at least in part on the comparison between a transmitted pulse and an echo pulse, at least one characteristic of the target can be determined, e.g., a difference in energy between the first chip in the randomized sequence of chips and the first chip in the received chips, a difference in energy between the second chip in the randomized sequence of chips and the second chip in the received chips, etc. Acts - can be performed for multiple radar pulses (and thus multiple chip sequences), and the difference in energies across all the chip sequences can be utilized to generate a radar image.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["310","320"],"sub":["1","2","1","2 ","1","2","3","4","4","5","3","4","4","5"]},"As shown in , a conventional stepped-frequency chirp waveform  can be constructed by sequencing across the plurality of frequencies  that form the ESD  in a monotonic direction, whereby each frequency can be held for some duration, e.g., its chip length. Further, as shown in , the spectral energy magnitude can be varied for each sample or chip frequency. For example, chip frequency Ccan have a shorter transmission duration (or other energy effecting operation) than chip frequency C, thereby enabling a difference in energy between chip frequency Cand chip frequency C. Further, as shown in , a randomization key  can be obtained (e.g., from a pseudo-random number generator or from a database), and applied to facilitate re-ordering of the sequence of chips shown in  (from the original stepped frequency waveform ) to a pseudo-randomized sequence . A waveform  generated from the randomized frequency chips of  can be a radar pulse profile. A signal having the radar pulse profile (e.g., of waveform ) can be transmitted and appears to be noise, but still retains the essential ESD characteristics of . It is to be appreciated that the lengths of the respective randomized portions  are likely much greater than the length of the randomized portions which would be generated in a real application. For example, to illustrate the various concepts presented herein, waveform ESD  has been sampled into approximately 27 chip frequencies, however, in a real world scenario the number of chip frequencies can be much greater, e.g., about 600 samples. Accordingly, as shown in , the randomized waveform  can be formed based on identifying a sample frequency for each randomized time chip , and then generating the waveform  based upon sequentially moving from a frequency (e.g., a sample frequency) of a first randomized time chip to a frequency (e.g., a sample frequency) of a second randomized time chip.","As previously mentioned, a signal having the waveform  (or a close approximation thereto) can be transmitted by a radar system, reflected off of a target (e.g., a landscape, building, vehicle, etc.), and subsequently received at the radar system. At the radar system, the randomization key  can be obtained (e.g., by re-application of a seed value to the pseudo-random number generator or retrieved from a data store), and values output thereby can be utilized to reconstruct the original sequence of chips (e.g., the transmitted waveform can be recovered, regenerated, or otherwise reconstructed). This transmitted waveform copy then serves as a reference signal or kernel for matched filter processing of the received echo signals. Based upon a deviation of the received echo waveform in comparison with the transmitted waveform , a radar image can be formed (e.g., based in part on a variation in energy between the received echo waveform in comparison with the transmitted waveform ). Since essential characteristics of the ESD  are unaffected by the random order of the sample frequencies (i.e. chips), the IPR of the matched filter output is essentially unaffected. The pulse averaging afforded by Doppler processing of multiple pulses (or related pulse-averaging techniques) serves to additionally reduce anomalies due to the random nature of the waveforms.","To facilitate understanding of the various concepts presented herein, a number of waveforms are presented. In an aspect, the series of waveforms can comprise a phase having a random nature, and accordingly, the waveforms can have a frequency that is, to a degree, also random. As is known in the art, the phase is the integral over time of the frequency. The instantaneous frequency is the time-rate of change of phase, whereby, in a sampled data system, the instantaneous frequency is the phase increment per sample time. Thus, it is possible to shape the spectrum of a pulse waveform by manipulating the statistics of randomness relating to the phase, frequency, etc. A form of the phase expression in terms of an accumulated instantaneous frequency, can be expressed as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03a6","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["i","n"],"mo":","}}},{"msub":{"mi":["\u03d5","n"]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["i","\u2032"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"I"},"mo":"\/","mn":"2"}},"mi":"i"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"\u03a9","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["i","\u2032"]},"mo":",","mi":"n"}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eqn","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"where the component parameters can be defined, as pulse index n=\u2212N\/2\u2266n<N\/2, waveform sample index i=\u2212I\/2\u2266i<I\/2, \u03c6is the reference phase for the npulse, and \u03a9(i,n) is an instantaneous frequency function. The difference between various waveforms can be in the nature of \u03a9(i,n). Generally, \u03a9(i,n) can be centered on a reference frequency, and exhibit a random offset, where the instantaneous frequency of the waveform can have the form:\n\n\u03a9()=\u03c9+\u0394\u03c9\u2003\u2003Eqn. 2\n\nwhere \u03c9is the reference frequency for an npulse, and \u0394\u03c9is the frequency offset for the isample of the npulse.

It is to be noted that it can be difficult to define an edge to the ESD to readily identify the waveform bandwidth. In other words, there is a degree of \u2018spillage\u2019 outside the band of interest. The spillage can be due to the frequency being allowed to change over its entire interval for each increment in index i. To sharpen the edges, more correlation from sample to sample may be required. In accordance with the previously described methodology, a way to achieve the sharpening is with the concept of a \u2018chip\u2019 (e.g., any of chips ), where the frequency may randomly jump only at chip boundaries where a chip is some number of individual samples. The sharpness of the band edges then becomes a time-bandwidth issue for the chip. However, as shown in , the ESD is beginning to be shaped.\n","The edges of the spectrum may be sharpened by allowing frequency changes only at chip edge boundaries.

The \u2018once\u2019 criterion facilitates formation of a complete spectrum for each pulse, as desired. However, it is to be appreciated that the \u2018only once\u2019 aspect can be relaxed without compromising the formation of the complete spectrum for each pulse. For example, if each chip frequency appeared exactly twice, albeit with proper duration but equal probability, then similar results would be achieved. Of course, if any chip frequency appeared, say, twice, then for a given pulse width there would need to be a corresponding reduction in the duration of any one chip, or a coarsening of the frequency quantization. These effects would have to be evaluated with respect to the IPR. Such an approach can be considered akin to choosing a card from two combined and shuffled decks, where each deck is a complete set of chip frequencies. In a further embodiment, any number of decks can be shuffled together to extend this concept. Furthermore, other variations might also be employed. For example, in an embodiment, a number of decks of integer N, (where N is an integer greater than zero) for a single pulse can be shuffled together with a random subset of an additional deck. Or, in another embodiment, a deck of frequency chips can be dealt across multiple pulses. Other combinations are also conceived based on the various embodiments presented herein.","Based on the preceding, a particular structure of random-phase waveforms can be designed in accord with the following:","(a) Each pulse is divided into two or more contiguous frames.","(b) Each frame is an independently shuffled complete deck of frequency chips.","(c) Otherwise, each deck has characteristics as defined in the last section.","The resulting structure is illustrated in , whereby the depicted embodiment can cause each frame (e.g., frame 1, frame 2, . . . frame M) to have the same spectral characteristics as the entire pulse (e.g., pulse n, pulse n+1, etc.). Such an approach enables a fraction of an entire pulse to offer the same resolution as the entire pulse. In an aspect, it may be desired that the waveform segments in individual frames do not correlate well with each other, as this would cause enhanced undesirable sidelobes in the overall waveform autocorrelation function. Furthermore, the embodiment presented in  may be preferred for longer pulses to mitigate quantization effects in both time duration and frequency.

For example, based upon the number of chips  and the desired waveform , the frequency for each chip can be defined to facilitate formation of the waveform with ESD . The chip frequencies can be selected based on the entered parameters or other applicable statistics to facilitate ESD shaping of a pulse waveform.","A chip duration component  can, also based on the parameters entered in the parameter component , determine and specify a required duration for each chip, for example to achieve a required energy at the frequency for the chip. Chip durations may be selected based on desired statistics to facilitate ESD shaping of a waveform (e.g., waveform ESD ). For example, with reference to chip Cin a lower ESD region of plot , the duration of transmission of this chip can be maintained for a shorter time than the duration of transmission for another chip (e.g. chip C) in the higher ESD region of the plot .","A chip randomizer component  can be utilized to randomize the chip sequence.
