{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service providers and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services and advancing the underlying technologies. One area of interest has been the development of services and technologies for media and content sharing (e.g., live video feeds, broadcast television on mobile device, etc.). As a result, there are thousands of media sources available through the Internet and other broadcast networks (e.g., live video feeds, broadcast television, radio, etc.). This ever expanding library of media sources, however, can pose significant technical challenges for service providers and device manufacturers to provide effective mechanisms for enabling a user to select media sources that provide content of interest to the user without the burden of sifting through a vast collection of content.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for efficiently presenting media sources and content in segments that are relevant to the user.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises receiving an input, from a device, for specifying a plurality of segments. Each of the plurality of segments corresponds to one or more media streams and is associated with a respective duration of time. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, presentation of the plurality of segments in a predetermined order based on the input and the respective durations of time.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprising at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to receive an input, from a device, for specifying a plurality of segments. Each of the plurality of segments corresponds to one or more media streams and is associated with a respective duration of time.

Each of the plurality of segments corresponds to one or more media streams and is associated with a respective duration of time. The apparatus also causes presentation of the plurality of segments in a predetermined order based on the input and the respective durations of time.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for receiving an input, from a device, for specifying a plurality of segments. Each of the plurality of segments corresponds to one or more media streams and is associated with a respective duration of time. The apparatus also comprises means for causing, at least in part, presentation of the plurality of segments in a predetermined order based on the input and the respective durations of time.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for presenting media segments are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"To address this problem, the system  of  introduces the capability to define media segments for displaying one or more media sources or media streams from those sources (e.g., live video feeds, audio feeds, broadcast television, streaming media, etc.) for a predetermined duration or period of time. In other words, as used herein, a media segment is one or more media streams presented for a specific amount of time. In one embodiment, multiple segments can be presented in a predetermined to order to provide, for instance, \u201cinteractive channel hopping,\u201d whereby the user defines the duration for how long each segment (e.g., containing one or more media streams or sources) is presented before the next segment is presented. In one embodiment, the user may manually specify one or more of media streams that are to be presented in each segment. For example, the user may selected the media stream by selecting the media source (e.g., Internet address of a video feed, broadcast channel frequency, file location, etc.) associated with the stream. It is contemplated that any number of segments may be presented as a set. At the end of the final segment, the presentation can begin again from the first segment. Because many of the media streams are live, the looping of the segments generally results in display of different media content or different portions of media content as segments are repeated. In this way, the user can follow and control the presentation of multiple media sources.","In a sample use case, a user may define, for instance, four media segments (e.g., Segments -). The media segments are configured to play in a looping sequential order with Segment  playing for 90 seconds, Segment  for 60 seconds, Segment  for 15 seconds, and Segment  for 120 seconds. The sequence of segments is then repeated until the user stops the loop. In this example, the user specifies a mix of manually and automatically selected media sources to play during each segment. For example, in Segment , the user specifies that a live football game on a particular television channel is to be presented. In Segment , the user defines criteria for automatically selecting live videos feeds that are shared by the user's friends from a social networking web site. Accordingly, when it is Segment 's turn to be played, the system  applies the criteria (e.g., searches the social networking web site for live videos feeds originating from any of the user's defined friends) and plays any live video feeds that meet the criteria during the time period (e.g., 60 seconds) allotted to Segment . If more than one live video feeds meet the criteria, the system  may play just one of the video feeds during the allotted time and then play another one of the video feeds in the next loop of media segments. Alternatively, the system  may allot a certain portion of the allotted time for playing each of the matching video feeds during the allotted time for the video segment. In Segment , the user may specify playing of a live news radio broadcast. In Segment , the user may specify criteria for selecting photographs available from a photo sharing website that are related to the football team watched in during Segment . The system  then queries the photo sharing website using, for instance, an application programming interface specific to site to retrieve the photos and initiates a slideshow of the photographs for the duration of the segment. The system  can then present an continuous loop of the four segments to provide interactive or user-defined channel hopping over a variety of available media sources.","As shown in , system  comprises one or more user equipment (UEs), e.g., UEs -, having connectivity to a media segment manager  and one or more media content providers -via a communication network . For the sake of simplicity,  depicts only two UEs (e.g., UEs -) in the system . However, it is contemplated that the system may support any number of UEs  up to the maximum capacity of the communication network . For example, the network capacity may be determined based on available bandwidth, available connection points, and\/or the like. The UEs -are any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including mobile handsets, mobile phones, mobile communication devices, stations, units, devices, multimedia tablets, digital book readers, game devices, audio\/video players, digital cameras\/camcorders, positioning device, televisions, radio broadcasting receivers, Internet nodes, communicators, desktop computers, laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), or any combination thereof. Under this scenario, the UEs -employ wireless links (e.g., cellular radio links) to access the communication network  and\/or the media content providers -. In addition or alternatively, it is contemplated that the UEs -may have also have wired connections (e.g., wired Ethernet connections) to the network  and\/or media content providers -. It is also contemplated that the UEs -can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.). The UEs -also include one or more media player applications (not shown) to present media content on a user interface of the UEs -","In one embodiment, the media segment manager  collects media feeds, streams, or content from multiple sources (e.g., the media content providers -) and presents these streams as media segments on the UE . In another embodiment, the media segment manager  may also harvest media content from other sources (e.g., a music service, a video service, or other service platform) and present these at the UE . More specifically, the media segment manager  receives commands and\/or other information for defining media segments for presentation on the UE  or other device. As described with respect to the sample use scenario, the media segment manager  enables users to define segments (e.g., comprising media content or streams and an associated duration or period of time) for aggregating and automatically displaying media sources of interest to the user. The media segment manager  also provides a user interface (e.g., a graphical user interface (GUI)) for controlling the functions and settings of the media segment manager . By way of example, the GUI presents icons (e.g., horizontal bars) of several incoming media sources (e.g., TV channels or live video streams from the Internet). The length of the icon defines how long content from a media source will be shown to the user before the media segment manager  switches to showing the next source or stream. As noted previously, in one embodiment, the media sources or streams that are displayed in any one segment can be specified by the user or automatically defined using criteria specified by the user.","As one advantage of the approach described herein, the UE  need not expend resources receiving all incoming media sources. Instead, the UE  uses resources (e.g., bandwidth, processing resources, memory, etc.) to process only the currently playing stream and can then begin to buffer the next media source of the next segment. Thus, the segment manager  advantageously uses fewer resources (e.g., less data is transferred between the media content providers -and the UE ).","In one embodiment, the media segment manager  store information related to defined media segments, corresponding media sources, media selection criteria, and the like in a database  of segment data. In addition or alternatively, the segment database  can reside on one or more nodes connected directly or indirectly to the service manager  over the communication network . In other embodiments, the segment database  resides on one or more nodes in the communication network. More specifically, the segment database  includes one or more processes (not shown) and one or more data structures that store media segment related information as well as data, configurations, user profiles, variables, conditions, and the like associated with operation of the media segment manager  and\/or the media segment applications -. The media segment manager  may also direct the display of a user interface for interacting with media segments and the associated media content and\/or streams. In one embodiment, these interactions include defining the content and duration of segments, specifying associated media streams, specifying criteria for automatically selecting media stream, generating a user interface, generating a programming guide of the media streams, and the like.","In certain embodiments, the media segment manager  interacts with one or more media segment applications -executing at the UEs -to coordinate the display of media segments. By way of example, the media segment applications -may include or be associated with one or more media player applications which allow the user to define which media streams to receive (e.g., from the Internet, from nearby devices such as other UEs  or set-top boxes, from local file storage, from network file storage, etc.). The media segment applications -may also define how long each segment is to be presented, the playback order of the segments, whether the segments should be looped, etc. In other embodiments, the media segment applications -may perform the functions of the media segment manager . In this way, the system  need not include a media segment manager , and the media segment applications -may operate in a peer-to-peer network topology to provide media content or streams for display in media segments.","In the example of , the media content or streams are provided by one or more of the content providers -(e.g., music service content providers, online application or content stores, etc.). For example, the content providers -may offer any combination of media content or streams originating from any number of sources including radio and television (TV) broadcasts received by the device (e.g., FM radio, DVB-H television, Internet Protocol TV, etc.), Internet media (e.g., live video feeds, web pages containing periodically or continuously updated content), media content stored on the UE , media content stored on other peer UEs -, media content stored over the network , video games, etc.","In certain embodiments, the segment application -handle the various sources of media content consistently without regard to the actual delivery method of the content. In other words, the segment applications -and the segment manager  present the different available media content or streams from the various content providers -as equally available. By way of example, application programming interfaces (APIs) specific to each provider , each type of media source (e.g., streaming media, downloaded media, etc.), or each media format can be used to implement a consistent media access frontend.","In some embodiments, the media segment manager  includes a web server or other online component (not shown) to provide access to media segment services and\/or functions using, for instance, via browser applications -executing on the UEs -. In this way, the UEs -need not execute specific media applications (e.g., segment application -) to access the media content or streams as media segments. In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the functions of media segment manager  may be accessed on a first UE  for presentation one or more other UEs -via the browser application  and\/or the media segment application .","In one embodiment, the media segment manager  and one or more of the media content providers -can be implemented via shared, partially shared, or different computer hardware (e.g., the hardware described with respect to ). In another embodiment, the media segment service is a managed service provided by an operator of the communication network  or other service provider.","By way of example, the communication network  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like.","Moreover, the UEs s-, the media segment manager , and the media content providers -communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application headers (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) as defined by the OSI Reference Model.","In one embodiment, the pair of the media segment application  and the media segment manager  and\/or the pair of the media segment application  and the media content provider  interact according to a client-server model. It is noted that the client-server model of computer process interaction is widely known and used. According to the client-server model, a client process sends a message including a request to a server process, and the server process responds by providing a service. The server process may also return a message with a response to the client process. Often the client process and server process execute on different computer devices, called hosts, and communicate via a network using one or more protocols for network communications. The term \u201cserver\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that provides the service, or the host computer on which the process operates. Similarly, the term \u201cclient\u201d is conventionally used to refer to the process that makes the request, or the host computer on which the process operates. As used herein, the terms \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cserver\u201d refer to the processes, rather than the host computers, unless otherwise clear from the context. In addition, the process performed by a server can be broken up to run as multiple processes on multiple hosts (sometimes called tiers) for reasons that include reliability, scalability, and redundancy, among others.","As noted previously, in other embodiments, the media segment applications -may interact according to peer-to-peer protocols to share and distribute media content among the UEs -without need of the segment manager  and\/or the media content providers -. In this way, each UE may provide the functions of a segment manager as well as serve media content or streams to other UEs -over the communication network  for presentation in media segments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["115","103","201","103","201","203","111","113","105","117"],"i":"a "},"Next, the control logic interacts with the segment selection module  to determine what media stream is to be played in each of the defined media segments. In one embodiment, the media segment manager  enables either a manual or automatic mode of operation. In a manual mode of operation, the user explicitly defines what media streams to present in each media segment. Referring to the sample use case described above, an example of a manually defined media segment is Segment  in which the user specified the presentation of a media stream (e.g., live broadcast) of a football game on a particular channel. To assist in making this manual selection, the segment selection module  can direct the guide module  to generate a programming guide listing the available media content or streams. In one embodiment, the guide module  sorts and presents the available media streams according to time and topic. The time, for instance, may be specified generally according to whether a particular media stream is scheduled for a future time, is occurring live, or has occurred in the past. In addition, the guide module  can organize the available media streams according to topics. By way of example, these topics may be based on the subject matter of the media content, user defined categories, or any other classification of the content. In an automatic mode of operation (also described previously), the user specifies criteria for the segment selection module  to use in automatically selecting the appropriate media stream.","After selection of the media streams for each media segment, the control logic  interacts with the with the presentation module  to initiate display, rendering, and\/or playback of the segments in the user-specified predetermined order for the specified periods of time. In one embodiment, because the available media content or stream can take many forms (e.g., live video feeds, photographs, audio files, etc.) and can be delivered using any number means (e.g., streaming media, downloaded media, spontaneously created media, etc.), the presentation module  includes one or more sub-modules or APIs (not pictured) for receiving the media content in its native format or for converting the media content to a media format compatible with the presentation module . In other embodiments, the presentation module  may initiate the download or installation of the components (e.g., codecs, player applications, etc.) needed to playback the content or stream.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 12"],"b":["103","300","111","101","400","401","103","101","103","101","107"]},"Next, the media segment manager  determines whether the input includes information specifying whether the media segment manager  should operate in a manual or automatic mode of operation (step ). If the information indicates or specifies a manual mode of operation, the media segment manager  can request that the UE  provide the user's input for specifying the media streams to play in each defined segment. In step , the media segment manager  receives the input (step ). In one embodiment, the media segment manager  can determine whether the media stream is already specified in the input received at step  and extract the information from the input accordingly.","If the information indicates or specifies an automatic mode of operation, the media segment manager  requests and then receives input specifying criteria for automatically selecting media streams for presentation in each of the segments (step ). In one embodiment, one or more criteria may be input and applied with equal weight or according to a predetermined weight. In addition, the criteria may be specified in a hierarchical fashion as described in more detail with respect to . The media segment manager  then apply the criteria to the set of media content or streams available over the communication network  (step ). For example, the media segment manager  can construct queries based on the criteria and apply the queries to the metadata or other information (e.g., guide information available from the content providers ) related to the media content or streams. The results of the queries are used to automatically select media streams based on the queries and criteria (step ).","After selecting the media streams for each segment (e.g., either manually, automatically, or a combination thereof), the media segment manager  presents or initiate presentation of the media segments in a predetermined order (step ). As with the selection of the media streams, the predetermined order may be specified manually or automatically according to user-defined criteria. In some embodiments, if no order of the segments is specified, the media segment manager  can default to playing back the segments in sequential order or another predetermined order (e.g., shortest segment first, longest segment first, alternating long and short segments, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","401","403","401","405","407","407","105","407","407","407","407","407","407"],"i":["a","d","a ","b ","c ","d ","d ","a "]},"In the section , the media segment manager  presents the content media stream  in a display area .

For example, to define a primary set of criteria, the user may select or \u201ctick\u201d any combination of the above criteria. For a second set of criteria, the user may select another combination and so on. By way of example, the user may define the primary criteria as follows: Content source=video sharing site; Content details=live video feed; popularity=most watched in user's social group; Age rating=suitable for all ages; and Location=Rome. Additionally, a second set of criteria may be defined as follows: Content source=television channel; content details =movie; popularity=most watched globally; Age rating=Above 15; Location=Rome.","In another embodiment, the definition of the criteria can be made by entering the criteria in free text. The free text can then be parsed using, for instance, a natural language analytical model to determine or categorize the criteria in the free text. In yet another embodiment, when a user has defined for a particular media segment the primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. selection criteria, these criteria can be considered as the rule set or hierarchy for selecting content for that segment.","In step , the media segment manager  tries to obtain media streams or content (e.g., from a selected media source or content provider ) that meet the primary criteria set of the rule set. If there is a match, the media segment manager selects the matching media stream or streams for presentation during the corresponding segment. If the media segment manager  is unable to find content matching the primary criteria or if the media segment manager  is configured to selected media streams from multiple levels of the criteria hierarchy, the media segment manager  determines whether there are any media streams that meet each subsequent set of criteria in the rule set or hierarchy (step ).

In other words, the first criterion (e.g., live video from New York) and third criterion (e.g., photos of Manhattan) select media or media streams that are broadcast from New York, and the second criterion (e.g., a Friends episode) selects for content that is about New York. The broadcast location criteria, for instance, advantageously enables a user to quickly filter and group content originating from a particular location regardless of the subject the content or media. The user can also add additional categories by selection the option . In one embodiment, the user may select the new category from a predefined list or menu.

The code may also be written directly using the native instruction set (e.g., machine language). The set of operations include bringing information in from the bus  and placing information on the bus . The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information, shifting positions of units of information, and combining two or more units of information, such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR, exclusive OR (XOR), and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions, such as an operation code of one or more digits.

A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of presenting media segments. The display  includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal (e.g., mobile telephone). Additionally, the display  and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile terminal  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP .

In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC .
