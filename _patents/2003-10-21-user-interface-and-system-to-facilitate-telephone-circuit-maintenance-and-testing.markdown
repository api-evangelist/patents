For the convenience of the reader, additional components and information will be hereinafter described with reference to the terminology and references utilized in the above-noted documents.","1. Hardware Detail and Components","As shown in , GRETA interfaces with WFA, HILDA and a REACT 2001 Host. The REACT 2001 Host System is a product of Hekimian, Inc., located in Rockville, Md. The WFA Host is a product of Bellcore, located in Murray Hill, N.J.","a connection between GRETA and the WFA Host may be provided via a TCP\/IP socket (see ) and, for example, an IBM 3270 interface of an IBM RS6000 computer, where GRETA emulates a printer port to the WFA host. Such hardware is known to those skilled in the art, and thus, is not described in detail herein. The connection between GRETA, the REACT 2001 Host and the HILDA Host, and the connection between HILDA and the NMA Host may also be provided by TCP\/IP protocols. In particular, GRETA may connect to the REACT 2001 Host and HILDA via TCP\/IP or Telnet, and HILDA may connect to the NMA Host via TCP\/IP or Telnet. It is noted that Telnet-will provide the user with an interface to execute procedures that are run on the remote device.","Although shown in  as separate systems, GRETA and HILDA may be provided on the same client\/server platform, wherein information and data are transferred via a file access or memory access. In addition, GRETA provides a system wherein a user may login and utilize a single password to access other systems, with no need to login and enter a password for each of the other systems.","As denoted by the double arrows in , GRETA may support simultaneous sessions with multiple WFA Hosts.","2. Software Detail and Functional Flow","As noted above, the user interface provides a mechanism to transfer data among the various applications and platforms connected to GRETA, such that data may be quickly and easily accessed to speed the process by which customer trouble reports are resolved.","GRETA, which was written using a High Level Language Application Programming Interface (HLLAPI) and TCP\/IP, automates the sending and receiving of data from the WFA\/C interface. GRETA connects to a plurality of servers and uses its GUI interface to communicate with WFA\/C. GRETA's scheme allows users to eliminate the need to perform redundant and tedious actions within WFA\/C by clicking a button, clicking a menu option, or hitting the \u201cENTER\u201d (\u201cRETURN\u201d) key on a keyboard. Information is laid out in a list and scrolling window form.","Two main windows are displayed when GRETA is executed. The first window is the menu bar, which contains a series of menus that the user will need to handle routine setup, logging on and off the system, choosing colors, displaying already selected windows, and bring up on-line documentation. The second window is the toolbar. The toolbar is a row of buttons that can bring up the screens necessary for proper maintenance analysis on a given trouble ticket, bring up windows to specify circuits and ticket numbers, and call a pick-up command. From the toolbar, the user can also start up Hilda, which is an automated ISDN test tool, REACT 2001 GUI and a semi-automatic testing window. Both the menu and the taskbar are always open and can only be closed when GRETA is terminated.","The ticket window in GRETA is opened from the toolbar and gives the user the ability to view multiple trouble tickets within different centers, function level codes, and color. Unlike WFA\/C, GRETA automatically updates the ticket display window, so the user does not have to worry if the most current ticket list is being viewed. The ticket window also allows the user to sort the ticket according to the ticket status, bring up a trouble report screen, and print the ticket list, all with the click of a mouse button.","Another significant screen is the trouble report screen. The user can point-and-click to the screens that will allow quick and accurate handling of the trouble ticket, including the adding of remarks, checking the status, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["1","3","5","7"]},"As shown in , the Main Application Event Loop Process enables the user to select from a plurality of activities. These activities (routines\/options) include, but are not limited to: a routine to select and setup a desired printer (step S); an employee activity routine (step S); a time sheet routine (step S); a GRETA size routine (step S); a GRETA color routine (step S); a GRETA bell sounding routine (step S); an e-mail routine (step S); a GRETA color setting routine (step S); a Work Force and Administration (WFA) backup routine (step S); a WFA screens routine (step S); a GRETA security routine (step S); a window cascade routine (step S); a GRETA help routine (step S); a window select routine (step S); a save placement routine (step S); an about routine (step S); a maintenance ticket window routine (step S); a ticket specify routine (step S); a specify circuit window routine (step S); a pickup ticket routine (step S); an OSSTR screen routine (step S); a test routine (step S); a semi-automatic test routine (step S); a WFA screens by ticket routine (step S); and a close application routine (step S).","Each activity routine will now be described in detail below.","Printer Setup","The printer setup activity routine of the present invention is illustrated in .","When the printer setup routine is executed, step S is performed to display a list of printers on an associated monitor. Meanwhile, a determination is made as to whether the user selected a close (exit) button on the display (step S). If the close button was selected, processing proceeds to exit the printer setup routine (step S).","On the other hand, if the close button was not selected, processing proceeds to step S to determine whether a printer has been selected. As long as a printer has not been selected, the list of available printers to select from is displayed on the monitor (steps S to S is continuously repeated). However, once a printer is selected from the displayed list, step S is executed to confirm the selected printer, and a user printer file of the selected printer is created at step S.","Thereafter, processing returns to step S to display the list of available printers and determine whether the close (exit) button has selected.","Employee Activity","The employee activity routine is illustrated in .","When the employee activity routine is selected (step S), a determination is made as to whether a user is logged into the system (step S). If the user is logged in, processing proceeds to obtain WFA Employee Activity (OSSEA) information and determine whether, the OSSEA is successfully obtained (steps S and S).","If the OSSEA is not successful, an error message is produced and the user is permitted to edit the user input (steps S and S). However, if the OSSEA was successful, step S is skipped, and thus, the error message is not produced.","The WFA request is then processed step S) and a determination is made as to whether the \u201cEXIT\u201d button has been selected (step S). When the \u201cEXIT\u201d button is not selected, a determination is made to determine if the time sheet activity should be executed. If the determination is affirmative, the employee activity routine is terminated and the time sheet activity is executed (steps S, S, S and S). On the other hand, if the determination at step S (e.g., whether to execute the time sheet routine) is negative, processing loops back to step S to permit editing of the user input.","However, if it is determined that the \u201cEXIT\u201d button has been selected, processing terminates (step S) without executing the time sheet routine. Similarly, if it was determined at step S that a user is not logged in, processing exits.","Time Sheet",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["302","300","2310"]},"If it was determined that the WFA VOS1SIGN information is invalid, an error message (step S) is produced prior to allowing the user to edit the input.","After the information is processed, it is determined, at step S, whether the \u201cEXIT\u201d button has been selected. When the \u201cEXIT\u201d button is selected, processing proceeds to step S to exit the time sheet routine. Otherwise, processing loops back to S to allow the user to edit the input data.","GRETA Size",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["402","404","406"]},"GRETA Colors","The GRETA color setting activity routine, which enables the user to select desired screen display colors, is illustrated in . As shown in , a plurality of colors available to the user is displayed on the monitor. The user selects the desired color(s), and then a determination is made as to whether the user accepts the selected colors, or wishes to exit without making a color selection (steps S and S).","If the user indicates that the colors have been selected (e.g., step S is \u201cOK\u201d), processing proceeds to step S to set the selected colors. Thereafter, the displayed menus, toolbar, ticket window, etc. are redrawn using the desired colors selected by the user, and this routine exits (steps S and S).","On the other hand, if it is determined at step S that the user does not wish to change (select) display colors, processing skips steps S and S, and exits without changing the display colors.","GRETA Bell",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["602","604","606","608","604","610"]},"GRETA Default E-Mail",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["702","708"]},"GRETA Exit","This activity routine, illustrated in , is one of the activities available in the GRETA application shown in  and enables the user to either exit the GRETA application, or to close the pop up window to, for example, make another selection in the GRETA program. According to this activity, a pop up window is displayed on the monitor, asking whether the user wishes to exit the program (step S). If the user selects an \u201cOK\u201d button, step S is performed to exit the application. On the other hand, if the user selects a \u201cCANCEL\u201d button, step S is executed to close the pop up window without exiting the application.","WFA Backup",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},"When the OSSTR, OSSLOG, or OWDDOC activity is backed up, the selected ticket is backed up, and then the respective TR file, LOG file, or DOC file is read, and the respective OSSTR window, OSSLOG window, or OWDDOC window is brought up in a view only mode.","The backup activity routine writes all trouble report screens, OSSLOG screens, or OWDDOC screens that are viewed during the WFA\/C up time to a file on a server before the mainframe is shut down. The trouble report, log and word document screens can then be viewed using a view-only window to review certain circuit or trouble ticket activities.","WFA Screens By Circuit","When the user selects the Bellcore Work Force and Administration\u2014Control, the user is present with a series of activities to chose from. These options include, for example, OWDDOC; OSSCN; OSSCHI; OSSMG; OSSIMG; OSSHMD; OSSFF; OSSLR; OSSOSSTRE; and OSSOI. These activities are described in detail in \u201cWork and Force Administration\/Control (WFA\/C) User Manual\u201d, published by , BR 190-513-323, Issue 8, May 1996, WFA\/C 1.7, the subject matter of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, and thus, is not described in detail herein.","a. OWDDOC","The OWDDOC activity window is a word document window with text search capabilities. When this activity window is selected from the WFA\/C Screens By Circuit, shown in , processing proceeds to the flowchart illustrated in , which permits a user to display a WORD document and circuit\/WORD notes. The WORD document shows the end-to-end layout of a designed circuit (message, special service, and carrier). The screen produced when this window is opened is illustrated at, for example, page 4-3 of the aforementioned \u201cWork and Force Administration\/Control (WFA\/C) User Manual\u201d.","In this activity, a WORD document is retrieved (step S), and a test is performed (step S) to determine whether the retrieval was successful. If an error occurred during the retrieval of the WORD document, an error message is produced (step S), and the OWDDOC window is closed (step S).","If the document was successfully retrieved at step S, a document similar to that shown at page 4-3 of the aforementioned \u201cWork and Force Administration\/Control (WFA\/C) User Manual\u201d is brought up (step S). At this point, the user can enter data into the document. Thereafter, the user can select a Load To React activity routine (step S, to be discussed below with respect to ), a Test activity routine (step S, to be discussed below with respect to ), a word search activity routine (step S), or a print activity routine (step S). Alternatively, if the user is finished with the document, he\/she can exit the OWDDOC window (step S).","The Load To React activity routine, illustrated in , determined whether an ISDN line or analog line is to be tested. In this routine, a test is initially performed determine whether the user is logged onto the system. If the test results are affirmative, another test is performed to determine whether a ticket or circuit has been called up. If a circuit is called, a determination is made as to whether the circuit is an ISDN line. When the circuit is not an ISDN line, REACT 2001 is activated (steps S, S, S and S). When it is determined that the circuit is an ISDN line, HILDA is activated to test the line (steps S, S, S and S).","On the other hand, if it was detected, at step S, that the document is a ticket, the WFA Process is called at step S, to get a circuit ID, prior to testing whether the circuit is an ISDN line. Similarly, if it was determined at step S that the user is not logged in, an error message is produced (step S) and processing opens a WFA\/C Trouble Report\/Activity (OSSTR) window (illustrated in ), to be described below.","The Test activity routine (S) is shown in , and is similar to the Load To REACT activity routine. For an explanation of the operation of this routine, reference should be made to the Load to React activity routine.","b.
