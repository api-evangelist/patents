{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention generally relates to a system and method for redeeming points and, in particular, to a system and method in which a participant of a program which awards points to the participant allows the participant to transact a purchase using the awarded points with a vendor system which transacts purchases in currency.","Customer incentive programs, such as loyalty programs, issue points to customers (i.e., participants) as a reward for certain activities such as the purchase of certain products or services or performing a certain action. These points create a loyalty or affinity with the customer and encourage the customer to continue a desired behavior. The customer is motivated through some type of reward offering which allows the customer to redeem the points for rewards. Frequently, such loyalty programs provide the customer with a limited listing of rewards from selected redemption vendors in the form of merchandise, certificates, or other products or services (henceforth referred to as rewards) and the number of points needed to obtain one of the rewards from the list. In general, the selected redemption vendors are a limited number which have some type of relationship, contractual or otherwise, with the loyalty program. The customer selects a reward for purchase with the points and indicates to the loyalty program that the particular product or service has been selected. The loyalty program obtains the product or service on behalf of the customer from one of the limited number of selective redemption vendors and provides it to the customer. Some rewards are of a nature that human intervention is needed to redeem\/fulfill a reward. For example, if the customer selects a roundtrip airline ticket, the loyalty program on behalf of the customer or the customer directly would purchase the ticket through a selected travel agent or a selected airline employee and provide the ticket (or have it sent) to the customer. The points needed to obtain the reward (e.g., the ticket) are deducted from the customer's point account by the agent or employee.","As such, when a customer wants to redeem points for \u201chigh-touch\u201d rewards, the customer has to work through a third-party organization. There is an opportunity to eliminate the human intervention to redeem such rewards by allowing the customer to systematically redeem their points for rewards using redemption vendors that otherwise deal in currency.","The invention addresses the above needs as well as others by providing a method and system for permitting a participant of a program to transact purchases with a currency vendor using points or a combination of points and currency rather than currency alone. The invention particularly addresses the needs for permitting a loyalty program participant to purchase airline tickets by providing the ability for a system and method which integrates to the reservation system indicating what the participant is attempting to buy (redeem). In addition, it provides fulfillment capability without having to involve highly specialized third party organizations. The invention enables participants to get greater satisfaction and more immediate gratification from their loyalty program regardless of their preferred method of interaction.","In one form, the invention comprises a system for use by a participant of a program which awards points to the participant, wherein the awarded points are maintained in a point account for the participant. The system permits the participant to transact a purchase using the awarded points with a vendor system which transacts purchases in currency. An application programming interface (API) interfaces with the vendor system. The system also uses a program account for use in currency transactions. A graphical user interface (GUI) provides an interface between the participant and the API and communicates with the program. The GUI includes instructions for receiving participant-related information from the participant and providing the received participant-related information to the API. The API is adapted to receive the participant-related information from the GUI and adapted to provide the received participant-related information to the vendor system. The API is adapted to receive vendor-related information from the vendor system and adapted to provide the received vendor-related information to the GUI. The GUI includes instructions for receiving vendor-related information from the API and for providing the received vendor-related information to the participant. From the perspective of the participant, the participant uses the GUI to conduct a purchase transaction with the vendor system based in whole or in part on the points in the participant's point account. From the perspective of the vendor system, the vendor system conducts the purchase transaction with the participant based on the program account.","In another form, the invention is a method for use by a participant of a program which awards points to the participant, wherein the awarded points are maintained in a point account for the participant. The method permits the participant to transact a purchase using the awarded points with a vendor system which transacts purchases in currency. The method comprises the steps of:\n\n","In another form, the invention is a graphical user interface for use by a participant of a program which awards points to the participant, wherein the awarded points are maintained in a point account for the participant. The interface permits the participant to transact a purchase using the awarded points with a vendor system which transacts purchases in currency. The interface comprises an application programming interface (API) for interfacing with the vendor system; a program account for use in currency transactions; and a graphical user interface (GUI) for providing an interface between the participant and the API and for communicating with the program. The GUI includes instructions for receiving participant-related information from the participant and providing the received participant-related information to the API. The API is adapted to receive the participant-related information from the GUI and to provide the received participant-related information to the vendor system. The API is adapted to receive vendor-related information from the vendor system and provide the received vendor-related information to the GUI. The GUI includes instructions for receiving vendor-related information from the API and providing the received vendor-related information to the participant. From the perspective of the participant, the participant uses the GUI to conduct a purchase transaction with the vendor system based in whole or in part on the points in the participant's point account. From the perspective of the vendor system, the vendor system conducts the purchase transaction with the participant based on the program account.","In another form, the invention is a system for permitting a participant to transact a purchase using awarded points with a vendor system which transacts purchases in currency, the system comprising:\n\n","Other objects and features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","104","108","102"]},"From time-to-time, the participant  may use a communications link such as an Internet connection  to connect to a graphical user interface (GUI)  to access the loyalty program . In addition to checking the participant's point balance in the participant's account , the participant may check the rules of the loyalty program to determine how to obtain more points or to obtain the best use of points. In addition, the participant  may use the graphical user interface  to redeem points in the participant's account.","For example, suppose the participant  would like to purchase an airline ticket from an airline reservation system  using the points in the participant's account . Suppose further that the airline reservation system  is a standard third party vendor that has no particular connection to the transactions  or to the loyalty program . Suppose further that the airline reservation system  deals in currency only such as credit card transactions only and that the website provides an application programming interface (API) for use by others who desire to transact business with the third-party vendor through the website . By using the graphical user interface , a participant can access the airline reservation system via an airline reservation system API  which provides an interface between the airline reservation system  and the graphical user interface . Through the interface, the participant  can select a particular airline ticket for purchase and advise the graphical user interface  that the participant would like to purchase the airline ticket which has been selected. The graphical user interface  would then interface with the loyalty program  and the participant's point account  to confirm that the participant has sufficient points in their point account to cover the desired purchase. Assuming there are sufficient points, the graphical user interface  completes the transaction on behalf of the participant  by using a program account such as a cash account or a shadow credit card . The cash account is referred to as a program account because it is connected to the loyalty program . The program account may be an account acceptable to website  including credit or debit cards or other means of payment.","For example, the interface  may use a credit card which in the system  is referred to as a shadow credit card  because the credit card is hidden or \u201cshadowed\u201d from the participant so that the participant is not aware that the transaction is actually being transacted using the shadow credit card or other program account . Thus, the interface completes the transaction via the API  and purchases the desired ticket for the participant from the website  using the credit card . The interface  then advises the loyalty program  when the transaction has been completed so that the loyalty program can deduct the appropriate points from the participant's point account  which appropriate points correspond to the amount of points needed to purchase the airline ticket in the first place. Finally, the participant  is notified by the interface  of the completion of the purchase. In the case of an electronic ticket, the participant  would be sent a confirmation with the information relating to the ticket. In the event of a non-electronic ticket, the interface  would pass along the necessary participant information via the API  to the website  of the participant so that the website could arrange to have the ticket delivered or otherwise made available directly to the participant .","The system  as illustrated in  also contemplates that other currency vendor systems  may be available to the participant  via the interface  and a corresponding vendor API  (supplied by the vendor) so that the participant can select other goods or services by which points can be used to purchase the goods or services. For example, vendor system  may be a third party goods vendor on the Internet which vendor makes available its API  so that the graphical user interface  may provide interface between the participant and the API  of the vendor system  All that is needed is the vendor API  so that the GUI  can interface with the vendor system .","In summary,  illustrates system  for use by participants  of the loyalty program . The loyalty program  awards points to the participants  wherein the awarded points are maintained in the participants' point account . The system  permits the participants  to transact a purchase using the awarded points with vendor systems ,  which transacts purchases in currency. The transacted purchase occurs via GUI  and API  based on shadow credit card . Alternatively, it is contemplated that the GUI  and the API  may be integrated into a single software package of instructions or that the loyalty program , GUI  and API  may be integrated or that the loyalty program and the GUI  may be integrated.","The above scenario assumes that the points in the account must be sufficient to pay for or cover the entire purchase of the reward, i.e., the airline ticket. Generally, other scenarios are also contemplated. For example, the system and method may be configured to allow the participant to select an amount of points to be used by the participant to pay for a portion of a particular transaction. In this case, the participant would be provided with the ability to supplement payment with their own currency or credit or debit card. As another example, the system and method may be configured to limit the amount of points to be used by the participant for a particular transaction. In this case, the participant would be required to supplement payment with their own currency or credit or debit card. As another example, suppose the participant has insufficient points to cover or pay for a particular reward. In this case, the system and method may be configured to allow the participant to select some or all of their points to be used by the participant to pay for a portion of a particular transaction and the participant would supplement payment with their own currency or credit or debit card. Those skilled in the art will recognize other scenarios as well.","In summary with regard to , the system  includes the API  for interfacing with the currency vendor system , a program account for use in currency transactions such as the shadow credit card  and the graphical user interface  for providing an interface between the participant  and the API  and for communicating with the loyalty program . The GUI  includes instructions for receiving participant-related information from the participant via the Internet  or by other means and providing the received participant-related information to the API . The API  is adapted to receive the participant-related information from the GUI  and provide the received participant-related information to the vendor system . In addition, the API  is adapted to receive the vendor-related information from the vendor system  and provide the received vendor-related information to the GUI . In particular, the GUI  provides instructions for receiving the vendor-related information from the API  and providing the received vendor-related information to the participant  via the Internet or other means. Thus, from the perspective of the participant , the participant uses the GUI  to conduct a purchase transaction with the vendor system  using the points in the participant's account . Thus from the perspective of the vendor system , the vendor system conducts the purchase transaction with the participant  using the shadow credit card .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["202","208","204","206","204","210","204","202","206","206","202","202","208","204","206","208","202","206","204"]},"Participant-related information includes any participant information that originates from the participant such as a participant's name and address. Participant information also includes selections which the participant makes. For example, after the participant logs onto the GUI  and establishes their identity, a participant may indicate that he or she is interested in purchasing products or services from a particular vendor system and that the participant is interested in using points to make such a purchase. The GUI  will transfer the participant information to the API  of the vendor system . The API  in turn transfers the participant information to the vendor system . For example, if the participant  is interested in purchasing widgets, the participant information would include such an indication which is passed by the GUI  to the API  and then passed by the API  to the vendor system . In return, the vendor system  provides vendor-related information. Vendor-related information is any vendor information that originates from the vendor. In this example, the vendor system  would provide a listing of the widgets available and the price of each. This vendor information would be provided via the API  to the GUI  which would then provide the vendor information to the participant . The participant  could select a particular class of widgets or request additional information with regard to a particular widget which request would be participant information passed via the GUI  via the API  to the vendor system . Once again, the system  would respond to the request from the participant and provide vendor information.","In this process of exchanging participant information from the participant  to the vendor system  via the GUI  and API  and in this process of exchanging vendor information from the vendor system  to the participant  via the API  and the GUI , the participant  may eventually determine that a particular product or service is of interest to the participant  for purchase. Thus, the participant information also includes a purchase request based on points, generally referred to by reference character . Essentially the participant  is requesting a purchase based on points in the participant's account . In one preferred embodiment according to the invention, the GUI  is implemented in software which includes instructions for receiving the purchase request  from the participant , which purchase request intends to conduct a purchase with the vendor system  based on the points in the participant's account . The GUI  converts the received purchase request  into a corresponding purchase request  based on the shadow credit card . In order to accomplish this conversion, the GUI  communicates with the loyalty program  to determine the points that are available in the participant's point account . The purchase request  based on points is converted to a corresponding purchase request  based on the shadow credit card or other program account if the participant's point account  has sufficient points to cover the purchase requested by the participant. The GUI  provides the corresponding purchase request  based on the shadow credit card to the API . The API  performs its standard function of transmitting information to the vendor system  and in particular the API  is adapted to receive the corresponding purchase request  from the GUI  and provide the received corresponding purchase request  to the vendor system .","In general, the vendor system  responds to the corresponding purchase request  based on the shadow credit card in the same way that it would respond to any other purchase request from a consumer that presents a credit card. Assuming that all the information to consummate the purchase has been provided to the vendor system , and assuming that the shadow credit card is validated, the vendor system  generates a vendor purchase confirmation . The API  is adapted to receive the vendor purchase confirmation  based on the shadow credit card and provide the received confirmation  to the GUI . In its software implementation, the GUI  includes instructions for receiving the vendor purchase confirmation  based on the shadow credit card. The GUI  also includes instructions for causing the points for the purchase to be deducted from the participant's point account  in response to the received vendor purchase confirmation  based on the program account. In particular, the GUI  indicates to the loyalty program  the amount of points that have been used to complete the transaction. The GUI  also includes instructions for converting the received vendor purchase confirmation  based on the shadow credit card into a corresponding purchase confirmation  based on the points and instructions for providing to the participant  the corresponding purchase confirmation  based on the points. This is in response to the received vendor purchase confirmation  based on the program account.","Referring to , a diagram of the architectural view of one preferred embodiment of the system according to the invention is illustrated. A loyalty program database  includes information relating to the loyalty program including the listing of the accounts of the participants. In , the architecture illustrates a GUI system  for interfacing with a SABRE host system . A participant  uses a core GUI application  of the GUI system  via a com-link  and an API  to communicate with the SABRE host system . The GUI core application  also interfaces with an XML agent  to convert information provided by the SABRE host system  into XML.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["402","404","406","408","502","504","506"]},"The above discussion has generally been focused on purchase of goods or services in situations where the participant has sufficient points in their point account to cover the purchase. However, it is also contemplated that the participant could use their points to conduct a partial purchase so that the transaction may be based in whole or in part on the points in the participant's account. For example, some points may be applied to part of the purchase price and the remainder of the purchase could be paid for by the participant by their our credit or debit card, cash or other participant account. Thus, \u201cpurchase as used herein includes a partial purchase as well as a complete purchase. Sometimes, this partial purchase arrangement is structured as a discount to the participant. Also, in some configurations, it may be necessary or desirable to charge or transact the full purchase with the vendor site using the shadow credit card. In this case, the portion of the purchase price paid for by the participant would be provided to the program or to the shadow credit card or other program account.","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements.
