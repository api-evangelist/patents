No. 8,325,614 on Dec. 4, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to the field of wireless network systems. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved architecture and method for connecting, configuring and testing new wireless Machine-to-Machine (\u201cM2M\u201d) devices and applications.","2. Description of the Related Art","Virtually all wireless carriers today offer both voice and data services.  illustrates a high level architecture of a wireless service provider  communicating with one wireless device  using both voice and data channels and communicating with a second wireless device  using only a data channel. By way of example, many wireless carriers employ the Global System for Mobile Communications (\u201cGSM\u201d) standard to support voice traffic and the General Packet Radio Service (\u201cGPRS\u201d) standard to support data traffic over the same wireless network. In such a configuration, voice logic and circuitry  shown in  processes the GSM voice traffic and separate data logic and circuitry  processes the GPRS data traffic. While some of the embodiments of the invention described below implement the GPRS standard for data services and GSM for voice services, it should be noted that the underlying principles of the present invention are not limited to any particular wireless network protocol.","Using the data channel, wireless devices ,  communicate with external servers  such as Web servers, instant messaging servers and email servers via the Internet  (or other packet-based data network). One particular type of wireless device  configured for data traffic only is a \u201cMachine-to-Machine\u201d (hereinafter \u201cM2M\u201d) device. M2M devices are deployed in application-specific telemetry systems to collect data using sensors and transmit the data to a destination such as a server accessible over the Internet (or other data network). In the past, telemetry systems were the exclusive domain of very large well financed organizations. For example, large oil and gas companies and electric utilities, through the use of custom-built, proprietary data networks, were some of the first private organizations to use telemetry. In recent years, however, the cost of access to public wireless data networks has dropped, opening the door for new, cost effective M2M applications including, for example, fleet management, point-of-sale transactions, consumer electronics, healthcare monitoring, security, and surveillance, to name a few.","Even with the decreased cost for wireless data communication, however, the process of customer acquisition and onboarding remains time-consuming and inefficient, requiring a significant amount of manual effort on the part of the prospective customer. In order to develop such applications, a prospective customer must engage with the members of the sales team at the wireless service provider (typically cellular carriers or their resellers) and provide detailed plans, business projections, and technical details just to get started. Once the process is initiated, each step along the way takes a lengthy amount of time and manual effort on the part of multiple individuals inside the service provider organization. For example, it may require a significant amount of time to simply receive usable Subscriber Identity Modules (\u201cSIMs\u201d) for testing purposes. Even after receiving usable SIMs from the service provider, the prospective customer still has the daunting task of designing the final product, and very little help is provided to iron out various defects\/bugs introduced at this early stage. Moreover, the sales team at the wireless service provider has very little, if any, visibility into how the prospective customer is progressing, often resulting in time wasted chasing poor-quality prospective customers. This process can take many months (typically between 6-18 months) and during this time, both the prospective customer and the service provider waste a lot of time and effort in these discussions.","Consequently, what is needed is a more efficient system and method which addresses the current inefficiencies associated with integrating new customers and new wireless data applications.","Described below is a system and method for designing and integrating new wireless data applications on a cellular network. Throughout the description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the underlying principles of the present invention.","The embodiments of the invention described below reduce the time and cost associated with acquiring new wireless data customers and deploying new wireless applications. In particular, in one embodiment, a Web-based system and method for customer acquisition and onboarding are employed with guides for quality design, efficient techniques for testing, configuring and troubleshooting new wireless devices, and dashboards for monitoring and managing the Web-based distribution channel.","A system architecture according to one embodiment of the invention is illustrated in . In this embodiment, a control center  is communicatively coupled to a test computer  over a wireless network  operated by a wireless service provider. The control center  may also be coupled to the test computer  through an Internet connection , if one is available. This Internet connection is sometimes referred to below as a \u201cdirect channel\u201d between the Test Computer and the control center . The control center  includes a plurality of servers for implementing the various functional modules -, -,  illustrated in  (e.g., by executing program code designed to perform the various functions). The control center  also includes a plurality of databases - for storing data related to users and wireless devices.","In operation, a prospective wireless data customer visits a trial order Website  and requests trial SIMs through a Web-based user interface, certain embodiments of which are illustrated in -As shown in the Web-based user interface includes a drop-down menu  containing a selectable list of wireless modules supported by the wireless service provider. In the illustrated embodiment, the service provider is AT&T and the wireless modules include those wireless modules supported on the AT&T data network. However, the underlying principles of the invention are not limited to any particular service provider. Other information entered in the Web-based user interface include contact information  (user name, address, etc), account information  (for specifying a user name and password for a new user account), a referral code , payment information  (e.g., credit card data), billing information , and shipping information . In one embodiment, the Website  includes data verification logic to ensure that the data entered in the various data fields is in the correct data format. In addition, although not shown in the figures, the trial order Website  includes a connection to a credit card issuer system to verify the credit card payment information entered by the user. While various different platforms may be used to implement the trial order Website (and other Web-based user interface features described herein), in one embodiment, the Website is an Apache Tomcat web server running on Linux with software programmed in Java using an Oracle database.","Upon entering all requested information, the Website  verifies the transaction and transmits the user and device data to a registration system . In one embodiment, the registration system  exposes an Application Programming Interface (API) to the trial order Website  and the trial order Website communicates data to the registration system using the API. The interactions between the Web site and the registration system may be formatted as a Web services-based transaction, with user data embedded in one or more Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) files using the SOAP protocol. However, various other data communication protocols may be employed while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention.","In response to receipt of the user data, the registration system  establishes a new user account and executes a series of database operations to open new record(s) in a user database  and an accounts database . For example, the user's name and contact information may be stored in the user database  and a new account may be opened for the user in the accounts database  (including an account number, wireless device identification codes, etc.). In one embodiment, the various databases shown in  are not actually separate databases but, rather, separate data structures (e.g., tables) within a single relational database.","In one embodiment, a device management system  automatically provisions trial SIMs on behalf of the user within a wireless device database . As part of the provisioning process, an identification code for each trial SIM is automatically associated with data services offered by the wireless service provider. Each SIM includes a unique serial number, international unique number of the mobile user (\u201cIMSI\u201d), security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of services to which the user is provided access and password data. In one embodiment, the SIMs are initially provisioned with limited \u201ctrial\u201d functionality for application development and testing purposes. For example, in one embodiment, data transmission thresholds are set to limit the amount of data which the trial SIMs may utilize during the testing period. In addition, in one embodiment, the SIMs are provisioned to operate only for a specified trial period. At the end of the trial period, the SIMs are automatically disabled and\/or de-provisioned and will no longer be permitted access to the wireless service provider network.","As part of the provisioning process, the SIMs are automatically registered with the Home Location Register (\u201cHLR\u201d)  of the wireless service provider . An HLR is a central database containing details of each mobile data subscriber authorized to use the wireless network. While the HLR  is illustrated in  within the domain of the control center , in one embodiment, the HLR  communicates with a central HLR maintained by the wireless service provider. Alternatively, in one embodiment, the entire HLR is maintained by the service provider and the service provider is provided access to the data stored within the wireless device database  during the provisioning process. The underlying principles of the invention are not limited to any particular HLR\/database configuration.","Following the automatic provisioning of the trial SIMs and registration of the user, the owner\/operator of the control center  sends a wireless development kit to the user containing the trial SIMs and an M2M test device with application software for testing and configuration. As illustrated in , one embodiment of the test device comprises a wireless device  with a Universal Serial Bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) interface  for connecting to the USB port of a standard computer system . However, the underlying principles of the invention are not limited to any particular interface type. Other interface types which may be used in lieu of USB include, by way of example and not limitation, IEEE 1394b (\u201cFirewire\u201d) and eSATA. In one embodiment, the computer system  is a Windows-based computer with an Intel\u00ae Core-2 Duo\u00ae, Core i7\u00ae, or similar x86-based processor, 2-4 GBytes of DDR2 or DDR3 memory, and a 250 GByte (or larger) Serial ATA hard drive. Various other computer configurations may also be used while still complying with the underlying principles of the invention. For example, in one embodiment, the test computer  is a Macintosh\u00ae computer system such as a Macbook Pro\u00ae or Mac Pro\u00ae desktop.","One embodiment of the wireless USB device  includes a flash memory  for storing testing and monitoring program code . The flash memory  may be integrated directly within the device or may take the form of a memory card coupled to a memory card slot within the USB device (e.g., a Secure Digital card slot). In one embodiment, the USB device  includes a wireless modem module  pre-configured to communicate over the wireless network and a SIM interface into which the pre-provisioned trial SIMs may be connected for configuring, testing and debugging wireless applications. Once inserted into the SIM interface, the SIM card  authorizes the wireless USB device to communicate over the wireless service provider's network  (according to the provisioning parameters associated with the SIM card). In one particular embodiment, the USB device  is a Sierra Wireless Compass 885 or 888 which include a wide-area modem for 7.2 Mbps for HSPA networks.","In one embodiment, when the USB device  is initially inserted into the USB port of the test computer , auto-installation logic (e.g., an automatic installation script) is executed and (upon authorization by the end user), the testing and monitoring program code  is automatically installed and executed on the test computer .","In one embodiment, the USB device  is preconfigured with the Access Point Name (\u201cAPN\u201d)\u2014i.e., the network address used to identify a Gateway GPRS Support Node (\u201cGGSN\u201d)  at the control center . During the testing and configuration process, all wireless cellular communication with the control center  is routed through the GGSN . In addition to the APN, the USB device  is also configured with the hostname of the control center diagnostics system , which includes one or more test servers used for IP traffic testing.","In one embodiment, the provisioning parameters for each SIM includes a communication profile specifying the wireless services allocated to the SIM (e.g., whether Short Message Service (\u201cSMS\u201d) or voice functionality are permitted, roaming restrictions, etc). The provisioning parameters also include the rate plan associated with the SIMs including the financial parameters (i.e., the price), the amount of data permitted under the financial parameters, overage rates, etc. As previously described, in one embodiment, each trial SIM is allocated a limited amount of data usage for testing and troubleshooting purposes, and is not provided with voice or SMS communication services. In one embodiment, even though the SIM is not provisioned for voice service, the SIM is provided with GSM functionality in order to be authorized with GSM network, prior to connecting to the GPRS network.","As mentioned above, the testing and monitoring program code  automatically establishes a connection with the control center  over the wireless cellular network  and\/or a direct channel through the Internet  and executes a series of automated tests, thereby saving the end user a significant amount of time and effort in the process of developing new wireless applications. Moreover, because the SIMs received by the end user are pre-provisioned and the USB device is pre-configured by the control center , the USB device is capable of establishing a wireless connection with minimal effort on the part of the prospective customer.","One embodiment of a computer-implemented method for testing, monitoring, and debugging the USB device  is illustrated in  and a series of screenshots of a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) employed by the testing and monitoring program code  is illustrated in -","Turning initially to the method of , at step  the testing and monitoring program code  tests the provisioning of the USB device  with a particular trial SIM installed. In one embodiment, this involves checking the following parameters to determine whether traffic is allowed using the given SIM: (a) the SIM's status must be \u201cActivation Ready\u201d or \u201cActivated;\u201d (b) the SIM must not have been blocked due to excessive signaling activity; and (c) the SIM must not have been blocked due to excessive data usage beyond user-defined overage limits.","Assuming that the foregoing conditions are met, the USB device with the SIM passes the provisioning test step . A test failure indicates that one or more of the foregoing conditions were not met. For example, if the SIM' s status is not \u201cActivation Ready\u201d or \u201cActivated,\u201d or if the SIM has been blocked due to excessive signaling or excessive data usage, then the USB device with the SIM will fail the provisioning step . In response, one embodiment of the testing and monitoring program code performs troubleshooting operations to fix the problem and\/or notifies the user of troubleshooting steps to be taken. For example, if the SIM's status is not \u201cActive\u201d or \u201cActivation Ready\u201d then the testing and monitoring program may check to ensure that the SIM's status is correctly reflected in the wireless device database .","At step , the testing and monitoring program code  tests the USB device and trial SIM. In one embodiment, this test involves determining whether the given USB device and SIM are available on the network based on one of two factors (whichever comes first): (a) reporting from the device via \u201cdirect channel\u201d diagnostics, or (b) any detected wireless signaling activity. With respect to (a), the direct channel comprises the direct connection of the test computer  to the diagnostics system  through the Internet . In one embodiment, the testing and monitoring program code  reports its status to the diagnostics system  periodically through the direct channel. These reports may include local wireless statistics such as signal strength and data usage. If the device is unable to connect wirelessly due to lack of coverage or low signal strength, the direct channel provides valuable diagnostic information that would otherwise be unavailable to the diagnostics system.","If a direct channel connection or wireless connection are detected, then the USB device and SIM pass the device\/SIM testing step  illustrated in . In one embodiment, if neither connection is detected, then troubleshooting steps are implemented including instructing the user to confirm that the SIM card  is inserted properly and determining whether wireless coverage exists at the test location. For example, in one embodiment, the control center  and\/or the testing and monitoring program code  maintains a database of service coverage locations. If the current location of the wireless device is outside of the coverage location, then the testing and monitoring program code  may notify the user that coverage is not available at the current location. The user's current location may be determined manually (e.g., by requesting the current address or zip code for the user) or automatically (using GPS if the user's test computer is equipped with GPS capabilities).","The user may also be asked to verify that the USB device  has adequate signal strength (e.g., greater than 1 bar or a RSSI of 5 or more); verify that the device's antenna is properly connected; verify the USB device  is configured with the proper frequency bands (850 & 1900 MHz for the US, and 900 & 1800 MHz for Europe); and\/or verify whether other wireless devices (e.g., GSM\/GPRS cell phones) in the proximity are working. Upon verification of one or more of the above variables, the testing and monitoring program code  may re-execute step  in  to re-test the USB device\/SIM card.","At step , the testing and monitoring program code  tests the USB device's wireless network connection. In one embodiment, this involves checking the Home Location Register  to determine whether there has been any recent wireless signaling from the USB device . There are three types of wireless signaling which may be detected: a GSM authorization request; a Mobile Switching Center (\u201cMSC\u201d) Location Update; and\/or a Serving GPRS Support Node (\u201cSGSN\u201d) Location Update. The presence of any of these signaling events indicates that the device has successfully registered on the GSM (voice) network and\/or the GPRS (data) network. As such, if any of these signaling events are detected, the testing and monitoring program code  indicates that the USB device has passed the wireless network testing step  in .","If none of these signaling events are detected, then the testing and monitoring program code  may initiate one or more troubleshooting operations. For example, in one embodiment, the control center  may transmit an SMS message to the USB device . If the SMS message is successful, then GSM service is available (but perhaps not the GPRS service). In addition, the testing and monitoring program code  may check the GSM and GPRS registration using AT commands sent to the wireless modem  (e.g., to verify GSM registration, the \u201cAT+CREG?\u201d command should return \u201c+CREG:x,1\u201d or \u201c+CREG:x,5\u201d; where \u201cx\u201d is 0, 1 or 2; to verify GPRS registration, the \u201cAT+CGATT?\u201d command should return \u201c+CGATT:1\u201d and \u201cAT+CGREG?\u201d should return \u201c+CGREG:x,1\u201d or \u201c+CGREG:x,5\u201d; where \u201cx\u201d is 0, 1 or 2). Finally, the testing and monitoring program code  may perform a soft reset of the USB device  or the end user may be prompted to perform a hard reset of the USB device .","Returning to , at step , the testing and monitoring program code  tests the IP\/Internet connection of the USB device . In one embodiment, this test includes two parts:\n\n","Assuming that the above conditions are met, the testing and monitoring program code  confirms that the USB device  has passed the IP\/Internet test step . If these conditions have not been met, the possible reasons include: the APN is not configured properly; the USB device is unable to open ports or sockets; the IP address is incorrect; and\/or the IP data cannot flow bi-directionally.","In one embodiment, the testing and monitoring program code  automatically performs the following troubleshooting operations and\/or instructs the user to manually perform these operations:\n\n","In one embodiment, the results of all of the foregoing tests and troubleshooting steps are stored within a diagnostics database . If necessary, the results may be reviewed by personnel within the control center  to provide guidance to the prospective customer when troubleshooting new wireless applications. In one embodiment, local environment statistics are transmitted to the diagnostics database  such as wireless signal strength of the trial device. The local environment statistics (and other test data) are then usable for performing diagnostics for the trial device and\/or aggregated across different trial devices to construct an estimate of the conditions in a given geographical area.","One embodiment of the invention is implemented on an independent, stand-alone wireless device such as a Windows Mobile device. In this embodiment, the trial SIM may be installed and the testing and monitoring software may be executed directly on the independent mobile device (e.g., loaded from non-volatile to volatile memory and executed by the mobile device's processor). Consequently, there is no need for an additional computer system in this implementation.","Moreover, in one embodiment, the testing and monitoring software automatically checks for updates prior to executing the various tests and troubleshooting steps described above. The updates may include patches and additional tests\/troubleshooting operations. If an update is available, the testing and monitoring software automatically installs the update (upon confirmation by the end user) and then executes the tests.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 5-","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["305","501","504","401","404","501","401"],"i":"a, "},"As each step in the test script is completed, an indication of the results is provided within each graphical element -.

In the event that the USB device fails one of the test steps, a scrollable window  is generated within the graphical element corresponding to the failed step to provide troubleshooting information to the end user. For example, in response to the failure of the device\/SIM card test, troubleshooting instructions are provided to the end user to help determine the problem.","As illustrated in , one embodiment of the control center includes a Web server  which dynamically generates a Web-based graphical user interface for monitoring and managing wireless devices which have been added to the system (e.g., following the testing and troubleshooting techniques described above).
