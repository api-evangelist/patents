No. 13\/053,767, filed on Mar. 22, 2011, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING AN ELECTRONIC MEDIUM\u201d, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","There exists technology in the market today allowing users of mobile devices to keep track of other users. The use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) gives the mobile device users the capability for applications to be aware of the mobile device. These systems are able to track mobile devices to a location accurate to 5 meters. Many applications on the mobile devices (called Apps) utilize the GPS location technology to provide Location Based Services (LBS) to their users. These apps allow users to find locations of interest, locations of their friends, provide transportation directions, among other uses.","When using LBS to keep track of other mobile devices, existing apps are able to make the user aware of their friends that may be near their location. This functionality can be useful for example, if a businessman is traveling to another city and desires to either meet an acquaintance, or determine if one of their friends are in the city, or are nearby.","Advanced mobile devices (henceforth referred to as smart phones), in addition to having LBS also have cameras that can act as video cameras. Many of the smartphones are able to record hi-definition video (720p and above) in an easy manner, but most are at least capable of recording VGA quality (640\u00d7480) video. System built apps allow the user to easily point the mobile device and record video.","Smartphones regularly utilize the camera to not only take photographs and video, but to also \u201clook\u201d at the image being captured by the camera to do other functions. For example, using a Shopper App, a smartphone may allow the user to point the camera at a barcode wherein the app will automatically scan the barcode in the image and provide purchasing information of the product found. Other information can also be obtained on the product such as reviews of the product, stores near the user that sell the product along with the current price. While this is useful for the user, it is worth noting that the camera on the smartphone is not always used for capturing photos or video, but is used as a \u201cwindow\u201d used by the app.","This window functionality is useful, and can be utilized in new ways. The current disclosure utilizes this \u201cwindow\u201d functionality in a social network scenario. The application of the current invention allows the user to not only to be made aware of acquaintances near them using the GPS functionality on the smartphone, but to also view what the acquaintance(s) are seeing through their smartphones.","According to one example embodiment, a method of communicating between mobile devices is disclosed. The method may include determining a present location of a mobile device being operated by a user, determining a present location of at least one additional mobile device being operated by a respective at least one additional user via a location based service (LBS) and notifying the mobile device when the present location of the at least one additional mobile device is within a predefined threshold distance of a mobile device domain. The method may also include receiving media data captured from the at least one additional mobile device and forwarding the received data to the mobile device.","According to another example embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus may be configured to communicate between mobile devices. The apparatus may include a processor configured to determine a present location of a mobile device being operated by a user, and determine a present location of at least one additional mobile device being operated by a respective at least one additional user via a location based service (LBS). The apparatus may also include a transmitter configured to notify the mobile device when the present location of the at least one additional mobile device is within a predefined threshold distance of a mobile device domain, and a receiver configured to receive media data captured from the at least one additional mobile device and forwarding the received data to the mobile device.","The current invention discloses methods that provide enhanced functionality on a smartphone wherein a \u201cview\u201d of a user's smartphone can be seen by other users that are connected to the user through the application of the current invention. This view is captured through the camera on the smartphone.","In one embodiment of the current disclosure, acquaintances near the user (through the use of LBS) are discovered and the live image that is being captured by the acquaintance's smartphone is able to be viewed by the user. This allows the user to not only know that their acquaintance is near their location, but also allows the user to view the image being captured. This functionality enhances social networking by allowing users to feel more connected by not only knowing their acquaintance's location, but also gives them the view of their acquaintance's smartphones.","If the user's smartphone as a front facing cameras in addition to the camera on the back of the phone, this camera is also utilized by the application of the current invention. This front-facing camera is for video calls, so that the image of the user can be seen by the other user on the video call. This front-facing camera is used in the application of the current invention. The image of the user (using the front-facing camera) is sent along with the video of the rear camera. The image of the user is shown in a small square on the bottom left of the video.","In another embodiment of the current disclosure, a group functionality is described. The user of the application of the current invention can setup a group and invite other acquaintances to be part of the group. The acquaintances will receive a notification to join the group, and they can enter into the group via their smartphones. Once a group is established, members of the group all see the same live image being captured.","In addition to the user seeing a live view from an acquaintance, audio is also able to be sent and received. Therefore, communication can be made between the user and the acquaintance. For example, the user connects to an acquaintance and views the acquaintance's live video feed from the acquaintance's smartphone. The user can comment on the view, and bi-directional communication takes place between the user and the acquaintance. If a group has been established, all users in the group hear the comment, and can comment as well. The voice from all users is sent to the smartphones of all users in the group, and the users in the group can discuss through the application.","In another embodiment of the current disclosure, as the user of the smartphone travels, acquaintances of the user that are registered by the application, and who are near the geographic area of the user, are made aware by notifying the user via a notification, for example a sound, an image, or any other functionality regularly used to notify a user.","In another embodiment of the current disclosure as the user views a map of the current location, acquaintances near the user and are registered with the application of the current invention, the acquaintances are visually depicted by an icon on the map. As the user touches the icon of the acquaintance, a menu is displayed with the following options:","View information about the acquaintance","Send the acquaintance a SMS message","Call the acquaintance","Switch view","The last option, \u201cSwitch view\u201d, reflects the functionality depicted in the current invention. When \u201cSwitch view\u201d is chosen, the user's smartphone displays the live video of the acquaintance's device, and the face of the acquaintance if the acquaintance's smartphone contains a front-facing camera.","In another embodiment of the current invention, the user is able to record the live video from the acquaintance's smartphone, then send the video to anyone through regular messaging functionality on the smartphone.","In another embodiment of the current invention, when the user of the current invention is traveling, acquaintances who are registered with the application and who are within a previously determined range are automatically connected by the application. The acquaintance's live view is able to be seen by the user of the application once the connection has been accepted by the user. The user's name is displayed at the top of the live view so that the user will be aware of the acquaintance who is providing the live view. This allows the user to know that the acquaintance is nearby. If an acquaintance is not within the predetermined range, the user of the application must request to see their live view.","In another embodiment of the current invention, the application allows the user to be \u201cconnected\u201d to the acquaintance, or acquaintances with a persistent connection. This allows the connected users to speak to each other without having to utilize a voice channel through the cellular network. The ability to maintain a persistent connection is depicted in provisional application No. 61\/354,307, filed on Jun. 14, 2010, entitled \u201cMEDIA FILES IN VOICE-BASED SOCIAL MEDIA\u201d, and application Ser.
