title: Extensible content service for attributing user-generated content to authored content providers
abstract: A method and system allows a user to add content to a displayable content container (e.g., web page) that specifies at least one modifiable portion, where the modifiable portion is served by a server operated by one entity, but provided to the server by a service operated by another entity. The modifiable portion is attributable to the one entity and remaining content in the displayable content container is not editable by the users. Other features, such as user authentication mechanisms, are also described herein.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/074,568 entitled \u201cCONTENT PROLIFERATION ENGINE,\u201d filed on Jun. 20, 2008, and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/143,679 entitled \u201cEXTENSIBLE CONTENT SERVICE FOR ATTRIBUTING USER-GENERATED CONTENT TO AUTHORED CONTENT PROVIDERS,\u201d filed on Jan. 9, 2009, which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Computer users frequently rely on search engines to identify businesses or resources satisfying the users' individual interests. For example, if a user is interested in reading about the latest celebrity gossip, the user may submit a query to a search engine that includes one or more keywords or phrases, such as the celebrity's name, the word \u201cgossip,\u201d and so on. Typically, a search engine responds to a user query with several results (e.g., web pages), which are presented to the user in an order defined by the search engine. To be included within a search engine's search results, a web page must be accessible to the search engine. That is, the search engine must be able to discover the web page, store its address (e.g., URL), retrieve its contents (e.g., HTML data, metadata, etc.), and analyze\/index the retrieved contents. After a web page has been indexed, the search engine determines whether the page will be included in a response to a particular keyword or phrase and, if so, in what order (i.e., rank) the page is presented. For example, some search engines may increase the rank of a web page when that page includes the queried keywords within the text or metadata (e.g., tags) of the page.","Users' reliance on (and habitual use of) search engines has prompted many businesses to invest resources in improving their relative ranking within search results for particular keywords or phrases associated with their business, products, targeted users, etc. Typically, by improving a website's search result rank, the user base of the website increases. Moreover, by increasing a website's user base, the website tends to generate more revenue for their business, for example, through sales, advertising, and\/or investors. Indeed, businesses continue to invest an ever-increasing amount of resources in such \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d activities. The term \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d (\u201cSEO\u201d) generally refers to a process of improving the position (i.e., rank) of a web page within search results that are presented to a user in response to a query containing particular keywords or phrases, thereby increasing the number of users directed to the website.","Conventional SEO strategies have centered on keyword density (e.g., including as many keywords as possible within web page titles, metadata, headers, etc.), URL character length, page size, navigation, reducing dynamic content, among others. However, algorithms for indexing and ranking search results tend to vary among search engines. Additionally, in order to prevent website operators from unfairly manipulating search results, such algorithms are generally kept secret. Moreover, search engine operators frequently update their algorithms, not only to prevent website operators from manipulating search results (such as by \u201ckeyword stuffing\u201d), but also to improve the quality of the search results presented to its users. As a result, conventional search engine optimizations tend to be short-lived, thereby requiring more-and-more resources to be invested to develop, implement, and test new SEO strategies.","Some website operators have taken a different approach to SEO. Recognizing that search engines typically rank web pages based on their contents, some operations have focused their SEO resources on content generation to \u201corganically\u201d improve their rank, instead of endlessly attempting to \u201coutsmart\u201d the search engine. For example, such operators spend their SEO resources generating content that is \u201ckeyword dense\u201d for particular keywords or phrases that will likely be used by potential users or users that the operator is targeting. However, content generation is expensive. For example, content generation may be prohibitively expensive (in the context of SEO activities) when a business provides a diverse array of products and\/or services that may be targeted to different users segments. Moreover, generated content may become obsolete, for example, as the products and\/or services offered by businesses change overtime.","Nevertheless, to facilitate content generation, a website operator may obtain a content management system (\u201cCMS\u201d), which is used by its developers to create web pages that are dynamically built on the fly (e.g., to include newly generated content) by inserting within such web pages queries to a database operated by the website operator. That is, website operators implement a CMS to reduce the barriers associated with publishing generated content. Examples of content management systems are provided by Interwoven Inc. of San Jose, Calif., and Vignette of Austin, Tex. Although content management systems tend reduce some costs associated with static content generation, such systems must be integrated with the operator's website and require substantial technical training and developer expertise. Also, such systems operate within an enterprise, behind the firewall of that enterprise. As a result, contribution of generated content is limited to individuals within the enterprise. Moreover, existing content management systems require the website operators to pay for content generation or risk their generated content growing stale over time.","The need exists for a system that overcomes the above problems, as well as one that provides additional benefits. Overall, the examples herein of some prior or related systems and their associated limitations are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of existing or prior systems will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading the following Detailed Description.","Various examples of the invention will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these examples. One skilled in the relevant art will understand, however, that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Likewise, one skilled in the relevant art will also understand that the invention may include many other obvious features not described in detail herein. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail below, so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description.","The terminology used below is to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific examples of the invention. Indeed, certain terms may even be emphasized below; however, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.","As discussed above, conventional SEO strategies have focused on \u201ckeyword dense\u201d content generation and\/or \u201coutsmarting\u201d the algorithms used by each search engines to index and rank search results. However, such optimizations are short lived, result in substantial and increasing costs to the operator, and\/or require technical training and developer expertise. Accordingly, technology for attributing third-party, user-generated content to an authored content provider has been developed. The technology (sometimes referred to herein as an \u201cextensible content service\u201d) substantially reduces the content generation costs of an authored content provider (e.g., such as a website operator) and, at the same time, stimulates a high volume of content that increases SEO benefits. That is, an extensible content service is provided to optimize content attributed to an authored content provider, including third-party, user-generated content, in order to achieve improved search engine positioning. An authored content provider may be a company that hosts one or more websites and publishes numerous pages that describe products, services, or other offerings of that company. Employees of that company, behind the company firewall, may provide content for the company's websites. More importantly, third-party users, unaffiliated with the company and located geographically remotely from the company's operations (and outside the company firewall) can provide content that may be presented side-by-side with the company's content.","As used herein, \u201cattributable content\u201d refers to content that may be discovered, crawled, and\/or indexed by one or more search engines and appears to be owned by the authored content provider. By making user-generated content attributable to an authored content provider, the extensible content service achieves increased SEO benefit without increasing cost above traditional SEO techniques and services. That is, an authored content provider may attain SEO credit at substantially no cost to the provider (e.g., for content contributed by third-party users to a website operated by the provider). As used herein, the term \u201cthird-party user\u201d or \u201cuser\u201d refers to any individual computer user that may access authored content, such as a website, web services, etc., operated by an authored content provider, and who has not been specially trained to contribute content to authored content provider. Some third-party users may be \u201cregistered users\u201d or \u201csubscribers\u201d of an authored content provider (e.g., the authored content provider may manage profiles associated with such users), while other users may be anonymous to the authored content provider.","The web pages noted herein may not only present information from both third-party users and authored content providers, but also receive input data, such as via a form or page with fields to be filled in, pull-down menus or entries allowing one or more of several options to be selected, buttons, sliders, hypertext links or other known user interface tools for receiving user input. While described generally herein as providing editable or extendible web pages, any displayable screen of information may be used, and the terms \u201cscreen,\u201d \u201cweb page\u201d and \u201cpage\u201d are generally used interchangeably herein. When implemented as web pages, the screens may be stored as display descriptions, graphical user interfaces, or other methods of depicting information on a computer screen (e.g., commands, links, fonts, colors, layout, sizes and relative positions, and the like), where the layout and information or content to be displayed on the page is stored in a database typically connected to a server. (A \u201clink\u201d refers to any resource locator identifying a resource on a network, such as a display description provided by an organization having a site or node on the network.) A \u201cdisplay description,\u201d as generally used herein, refers to any method of automatically displaying information on a computer screen in any known format.","In some embodiments or examples, an authored content provider embeds authored content together with user-generated content. User-generated content may be both contributed to an authored content provider, and made available to the provider, through an extensible content service. That is, user's may contribute content to an authored content provider via an extensible content service, and the contributed content is then made available to the authored content provider to be rendered inline by the authored content provider with other authored content, for example. The extensible content service may be used by multiple authored content providers to respond to requests for authored content, such as web pages, that include one or more portions of extensible content to which user-generated content may be, or has been, contributed. In some embodiments, an authored content provider instantiates, or permits one or more users to instantiate, multiple portions of extensible content within an authored page. Each content portion functions independently and may include its own set of attributes and\/or revision history. Users may edit an extensible content portion by selecting a control, such as an \u201cEasyEdit\u201d button, associated with the respective extensible content portion. For example, in edit mode, if a user selects a video for editing, the user may be presented with a menu containing multiple options for manipulating the video, such as changing the video size, location, inserting content within or overlaid on a portion of the video, and so on. As used herein, the terms \u201cextensible content\u201d and \u201cuser-generated content\u201d are used interchangeably and refer to many different types of content, including, but not limited to, web page content. For example, such content may include plain text, formatted text, graphics, videos, sound files, YouTube videos, Google Calendars, maps, PhotoBucket slideshows, links to external content hosted on other servers, or any other type of content available on a network. While generally described below as \u201cediting\u201d a page, editing includes not only modifying an existing page, but adding or inserting to that page, deleting some or all content from that page, creating a new page or page portion, etc.","As described herein, an authored content provider, such as a business entity, authors content to be included in a first portion of a web page, which may include branding from the business entity. In some embodiments, the authored content provider designates a second portion of the web page for user-authored content. When a web page includes a second portion for user-authored content, the extensible content service permits users to add or edit content to the second portion of the web page. The first portion may be associated with a first file stored under the authored content provider, while the second portion is associated with a second, different file, stored under the extensible content service, but the first and second portions are displayable on a user computer concurrently by the authored content provider via the single editable web page. The term \u201cfile\u201d represents any data container that may be written to disk via a server, stored in memory, as well as any addressable location where data may be stored. Often, the file or content container includes tags, instructions, or otherwise defines a displayable content that may be displayed by a user computer.","The extensible content service may centrally manage content contributed by third-party users to multiple authored content providers. Typically, the extensible content service is not under common ownership with, or controlled by, an operator of at least one authored content provider for which the extensible content service manages user-generated content. Similarly, some authored content providers may be under common ownership, and controlled by, a single operator, while other authored content providers are not under common ownership, or controlled by, an operator of any other authored content provider.","The extensible content service may provide an application programming interface (API), sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cdata access API,\u201d through which authored content providers retrieve extensible content and\/or introduce a client application within an authored page before an assembled page is provided to the requesting user. The client application may provide client-side APIs that allow third-party users to access social publishing features of the extensible content service within an authored page. As used herein, the term API may refer to a collection of functions or a single function within a collection.","The data access API provides a function for authored content providers to designate one or more locations within an authored page as \u201cextensible\u201d or \u201ceditable\u201d portions to which third-party users may contribute and\/or edit content. As used herein, the terms \u201cedit\u201d, \u201cediting,\u201d \u201ceditable,\u201d etc. refer to any organic content creation by third-party users, such as by adding or inserting new user-generated content, modifying or deleting existing user-generated content, and so on. For example, an authored content provider may designate a location as extensible by including a server-side include (\u201cSSI\u201d) statement at that location.","When the authored page is requested, a SSI statement retrieves a client application that provides one or more client-side controls. For example, the client application includes an \u201cEasyEdit\u201d button that a user selects to contribute content to the designated location. In some embodiments, when a user selects a client-side control, such as the EasyEdit button, the client application generates a request that is sent to the extensible content service for an editable version of the content. For example, users may add images to an extensible content portion, such as by uploading an image from the user's computer, entering an image URL, searching and selecting an image from a web-based image repository (e.g., Yahoo's image repository), and so on. The client application may also provide client-side controls for manipulating such user-contributed images, for example by authoring an image caption, adding image links, defining image alignment, text wrapping, sizing, and so on. As another example, users may add widgets to an extensible content portion, for example, by including the widget URL, embedded widget code, searching and selecting a widget from a web-based widget repository, and so on. Such widgets may include YouTube Video, Google Video, Vizu Polls, RSS Feeds, Google Calendar, Photobucket Slideshow, Imeem, ZeeMaps Map, Meebo Messaging, Gabbly Chat, or other widgets, for example with embedded or Iframe output code. The client application may also provide client-side controls for manipulating such widgets, for example, defining widget alignment, text wrapping, sizing, preview, and so on. As yet another example, in some embodiments, users may add, edit, or remove keyword tags used to describe a portion of extensible content. Keyword tags aid in content discovery and increase search and SEO benefits of the user-generated content.","In some embodiments, to contribute content to an authored content provider, the extensible content service provides a client-side API through which third-party users may access one or more social publishing components within an authored page, such as a WYSIWYG (\u201cWhat You See Is What You Get\u201d) editor. A WYSIWYG editor may be provided to translate graphically entered formatting instructions, such as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201citalics,\u201d into corresponding source code tags. That is, a WYSIWYG editor may be used to transparently generate the markup of user-contributed content, thereby shielding the user from the technical details. In some embodiments, user-generated content inherits the style (e.g., \u201clook and feel\u201d) of the provider's authored content, such as a background color, font color, font type, font size, link colors, and so on, thereby providing a consistent user experience to third-party users. In other embodiments, or within certain authored pages, an authored content provider may specify a particular style for user generated content that is different from the authored content.","The client-side API may be accessed using RESTful (\u201cRepresentational State Transfer\u201d) commands to programmatically create, retrieve, update, or delete user-generated content. REST is an architecture style that describes how resources (such as portions of extensible content) are defined or addressed. In some embodiments, a user-generated content (\u201cUGC\u201d) identifier and namespace of an authored content provider are used to address a portion of extensible content to which user-generated content may be, or has been, contributed. Using RESTful commands, computing systems (such as, e.g., clients and servers) may exchange representations of one or more resources, each typically identified by a unique identifier. That is, each computing system may interact with a resource by requesting that a particular action be performed and by providing the resource identifier.","The response from a RESTful command may be provided to the requester (e.g., user application, authored content provider) in a normalized or standardized format (such as, e.g., an XML format). That is, the user-generated content may be normalized such that it does not reference any particular application format (e.g., a browser format, such as those formats preferred by Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari, and so on). In some embodiments, when the user requests to edit a portion of extensible content, the content is translated from the normalized format into the application's preferred format. A technique suitable for this purpose, is described in commonly-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/043,718 of R. Hicks et al., filed on Mar. 6, 2008 and entitled, \u201cBROWSER-INDEPENDENT EDITING OF CONTENT\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In some embodiments, if a user copies content from a format not supported by a particular authored content provider (e.g., Word), the extensible content service reformats the user-generated content to satisfy requirements specified by the authored content provider.","In some embodiments or examples, user-generated content contributed to an authored page is retrieved by the authored content provider as embedded content (such as, e.g., HTML) via a server-side include (\u201cSSI\u201d). That is, SSI statements may be used to identify editable content managed by the extensible content service, which is to be rendered inline with authored content by the authored content provider. For example, when a SSI statement is encountered by a web server responding to a request for authored content, the extensible content (if any) referenced by the statement is incorporated as part of the authored content rendered by the web server. The requesting user may be anonymous to the authored content provider. Typically, requests received from a search engine are anonymous (e.g., when a website is crawled by a search engine). Data Access APIs may be used to dynamically add user-generated content to existing authored pages, without having to serve the entire page or user-generated content via a Java applet, JavaScript, AJAX, Flash movie, or other dynamic technology that cannot be discovered, crawled, and indexed by a search engine.","As a result, content contributed by users to an authored content provider through the extensible content service, is rendered attributable to the authored content provider. That is, the extensible content service enables the user-generated content to be discovered, crawled, and indexed by search engines, thereby increasing SEO benefits enjoyed by authored content providers to which the content was contributed. Moreover, the extensible content service reduces the costs of generating content because user-generated content is attributable to the authored content provider, as if it were actually generated by the provider, at substantially no cost to the provider. Furthermore, user-generated content has the opportunity to remain fresh due to constant user interaction. Thus, the SEO benefits realized from user-generated content are less likely to become stale, particularly as more-and-more user-generated content is contributed. User-generated content may further provide a viral effect, in that, as users contribute content to the authored content provider, the authored content provider receives more-and-more SEO benefits, thereby attracting more-and-more users who contribute more-and-more content, and so on.","In some embodiments, the data access API provides a function through which an authored content provider may enable third-party users to add pages to a website operated by the provider. For example, an authored content provider may include a SSI statement within an authored \u201cparent\u201d page to enable users to add user-generated pages that are navigable from the authored parent page. When the authored page is requested, the SSI statements are used to retrieve client-side controls, such as an \u201cAddPage\u201d button. In some embodiments, when a user selects the AddPage button, the client application generates a request that is sent to the extensible content service for a new page attributable to the authored content provider. An added page may be automatically generated to include one or more portions of extensible content to which user-generated content may be contributed. In some embodiments, the added pages include a particular layout, style, navigation, branding, and\/or other authored content specified by the authored content provider. For example, a user-generated page may provide the same functionality provided by an authored page, including user authentication, client-side application, editing of user-generated content, add user-generated pages, and so on. Added pages created by users point or relate to new URLs within the authored content, which can then be found by other users, including search engines. User-generated pages are attributed to the authored content provider, thereby increasing the footprint of the authored content provider, reducing the costs associated with content generation, and increasing the search engine optimization of the provider.","In some embodiments, the extensible content service enables user-generated content to be shared between two or more authored content providers. For example, the extensible content service may provide a client-side application that includes a control to generate or return a reference to the shareable content (e.g., UGC identifier, a URL, inline frame (iframe) tag, embed tag, semantic link, java script, etc.) that may be used to add the content to another web page. As a result, user-generated content may be presented to a user by a content provider other than the authored content provider to which the user-generated content was originally contributed. That is, because user-generated content is stored external to, and independent of, the authored content provider to which the content was originally contributed, it may be requested from the extensible content service by any content provider or user (e.g., by referencing the UGC identifier). In one example, a user visits a \u201cMadonna gossip\u201d web page of an authored content provider that includes an editable portion for user-generated content. To facilitate description, it is assumed that the editable portion of the web page is shareable. Using the extensible content service, the user edits the editable portion of the web page to include a list of rumored concert dates and venues for an upcoming Madonna tour. Continuing with the current example, another user subsequently visits the \u201cMadonna gossip\u201d web page and selects the control to include the portion of user-generated content on another web page. For example, the other user may be an avid Madonna follower that maintains a personal blog about Madonna. As another example, the other user may frequently visit a different authored content provider to review the latest Madonna news and desire to have the list of concert dates and venues viewable from that authored content provider's web site. It is noted that the subsequent user need not be another user. For example, the subsequent user may be the user that originally contributed the user-generated content to the editable portion of the Madonna Gossip web page. Returning to the current example, in response to the selection of the control, the extensible content service generates or returns a reference to the content. For example, the extensible content service may generate an iframe that the other user copies and pastes into the source code of their personal blog, such as: <iframe src=\u201chttp:\/\/www.extensibleContentService.com\/getUGC.do?ns=foo&id=someid\u201d <\/iframe>. As another example, the extensible content service may return a UGC identifier. In some embodiments, the client-side application may include a control that accepts UGC identifiers as a way to add user-generated content to an editable web page. Continuing with the current example, if a user then changes a concert date or venue on the list via the extensible content service, that change is automatically reflected in both the Madonna Gossip web page and any other web page with which the content is shared. In some embodiments, when a user requests to edit user-generated content that is presented by a content provider other than the authored content provider to which the content was originally contributed, the extensible content service directs the user to sign-on using an authentication interface provided by the authored content provider to which the content was originally contributed. While in other embodiments, the extensible content provider directs the user to sign-on using an authentication interface provided by the content provider presenting the shared content.","In some embodiments, the extensible content service allows an authored content provider to specify whether its originally-contributed user-generated content may be shared and on what basis. For example, an authored content provider may specify that its entire body of originally-contributed user-generated content is shareable. As another example, an authored content provider may specify that particular pages are shareable. As yet another example, an authored content provider may specify particular portions of a page that are shareable. In some embodiments, an authored content provider may further specify whether its shared user-generated content, if any, may be attributed to other authored content providers.","In some embodiments, when user-contributed content is presented to a user by a content provider other than the authored content provider to which the content was originally contributed, the extensible content service specifies that the shared content is to be provided with a reference to the authored content provider to which the shared content was originally contributed (e.g., a link to the page at which the content was originally contributed to the authored content provider). For example, the reference may be included in the source code of the web page that presents the shared content. It is noted that the reference may or may not be visible to the user. It is further noted that the reference may be specified by the extensible content provider at the time the content is shared or at the time the shared content is requested by the content provider or user computer. By including a reference back to the originating authored content provider, the extensible content service increases the likelihood that such user-generated content will be discovered, crawled, and indexed by search engines without sacrificing its uniqueness. However, in some embodiments, shared user-generated content is attributable to multiple authored content providers.","In one example, a user creates a list of concert dates for a band. The user creates that list for one web page for a website controlled by an authored content provider, via the extensible content service that exists at a central location. The user may likewise include that list for another web page associated with another authored content provider (or another website controlled by the first authored content provider). If the user then changes a concert date or venue on the list, that change is made via the (central) extensible content service, and the change is automatically reflected in both web pages.","In some embodiments, before a third-party user may contribute content to an authored content provider, the extensible content service determines whether the user has been authenticated by the authored content provider. For example, when a user requests to edit content, the extensible content service may determine whether the user's request includes a token and, if so, whether the token is valid. If the request includes a valid token, the extensible content service returns an editable version of the requested portion of extensible content to the user. Otherwise, if the request does not include a token, or includes an invalid token, the extensible content service may direct the user to sign-on using an authentication interface provided by the authored content provider to which the user desires to contribute content. In some embodiments, the client application is used to direct the user (via a client-side API) to the authentication interface provided by the authored content provider. By directing the user via the client application to the authentication interface of the authored content provider, the user's authentication to the extensible content service is transparent to the user. That is, the extensible content service trusts the authentication process provided by the authored content provider and does not require the user to log into both the extensible content service and the authored content provider to contribute content. Details regarding user authentication are known and well documented, and thus need not be described in detail in order to gain an understanding of the concepts and operation of the technology introduced herein.","Authentication of a user by the extensible content service is transparent to the user because a user may not be required to sign-on to both the authored content provider and the extensible content service in order to contribute content to the provider through the extensible content service. Instead, the extensible content service trusts the authentication process provided by the authored content provider.","When a user is directed to the authentication interface of the authored content provider, the user may submit his or her credentials (e.g., username, password, pin, etc.) to the authored content provider. In some embodiments, when the user is authenticated, the authored content provider generates a token that is provided to the authenticated user and the extensible content service. In other embodiments, the authored content provider notifies the extensible content service of the user's authentication and, in response to the notification, the extensible content service generates a token corresponding to the authenticated user. A generated token may be a key or data structure that is used to identify the authenticated user and\/or a permission level associated with the user, such as editor, moderator, and so on. In some embodiments, a token is valid for a predetermined or specified period of time, such as 24 hours or less. No special permissions may be necessary to view content. That is, unlike requests to contribute content, requests to retrieve extensible content may be made anonymously (i.e., do not require a token).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In step  of the illustrated example, when an authored content provider receives a request from a user for an authored paged, the provider renders the authored content and any portions of extensible content (e.g., user-generated content) to the requester in a viewable state. For example, the authored web page may include an extensible portion specifying a video stored at another website (such as, e.g., YouTube). In a viewable state, the requesting user typically cannot contribute content to an extensible portion of the authored page. The viewable state of the page is the state in which the search engines access the page.","In some embodiments, the authored page includes an editing interface. For example, the interface may provide an \u201cEasyEdit\u201d button that, when selected by a user, generates a request for an editable version of the extensible content. In step  of the illustrated example, when a user requests an editable version of the extensible content rendered by the authored content provider, the extensible content service determines whether the user's request includes a token and, if so, whether the token is valid. If the request does not include a token, or includes an invalid token, then, in step , the extensible content service directs the user to sign-on using the authentication interface provided by the authored content provider. The extensible content service's direction of the user to an authentication interface of the authored content provider may be transparent to the user. That is, the extensible content service trusts the authentication process provided by the authored content provider and does not require the user to log into both the extensible content service and the authored content provider to contribute content. Otherwise, if the request includes a valid token, the extensible content service returns an editable version of the extensible content to the user in step .","The extensible content service may provide a WYSIWYG (\u201cWhat You See Is What You Get\u201d) editing environment for modifying editable portions of extensible content that are displayed together with authored content. The WYSIWYG editing experience may include text editing, formatting, spell check, controls to provide links to or embed images, rich media, widgets, etc. The extensible content service is not limited to text-based user-generated content. For example, the extensible content service may be used to edit various types of content, including, but not limited to, text, images, audio, video, RSS feeds, widgets, and so on. As such, examples of text-based user-generated content should not be taken as restrictive. In some embodiments, when a portion of the extensible content includes non-editable content, the extensible content system translates that portion into an editable placeholder and indicates the editable attributes of that portion of the extensible content represented by the placeholder. A technique for which is suitable for this purpose, is described in commonly-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/842,786 of A. Berg et al., filed on Aug. 21, 2007 and entitled, \u201cREPRESENTING EDITABLE ATTRIBUTES OF EMBEDDED CONTENT\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","In step  of , in response to a request to store edits to a portion of extensible content, the extensible content service stores any modifications to the content, thereby preparing the content for viewing (e.g., retrieval by the authored content provider) in response to a request from that user or another user. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the steps shown in  may be altered in a variety of ways. For example, the order of certain steps may be rearranged; certain steps may be performed in parallel; certain steps may be merged or divided; certain shown steps may be omitted; other steps may be added; and so on.","Before describing the extensible content service in greater detail, it is useful to consider an environment in which the extensible content service can be implemented.  is a high-level block diagram illustrating an extensible content service  for attributing user-generated content to multiple authored content providers  in one or more embodiments. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain well-known structures and functions have not been shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring the description.","In the illustrated example, an extensible content service  includes a storage subsystem  that stores user-generated content (\u201cUGC\u201d) attributable to multiple authored content providers . The extensible content service may be implemented by one or more block-based servers (e.g., used in a Storage Area Network (\u201cSAN\u201d) mode), file-based servers (e.g., used in a Network Attached Storage (NAS) mode), or a combination of server types. The UGC storage subsystem  may be, for example, magnetic disks, optical disks, magneto-optical (MO) storage, or any other type of non-volatile storage devices suitable for storing large quantities of data. In some embodiments, the UCG storage subsystem  is organized as a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), in which case the extensible content service  accesses the UCG storage subsystem  using one or more well-known RAID protocols. Of course, while certain data storage devices or systems are described herein, any other data storage environment may be used.","The Extensible content service  is also connected or coupled to multiple authored content providers and multiple user computers through a network, such as the Internet. User computers may be, for example, personal computers, search engines, Internet appliances, mobile or hand-held wireless devices, programmable or embedded consumer electronics, set-top boxes, and so on. Each authored content provider  may be implemented as one or more block-based servers (e.g., used in a SAN mode), file-based servers (e.g., used in a NAS mode), or a combination of server types. Each authored content providers  may include one or more storage subsystems  that store authored content generated by the authored content provider. The authored content storage subsystems  may be, for example, magnetic disks, optical disks, magneto-optical (MO) storage, or any other type of non-volatile storage devices suitable for storing large quantities of data. In some embodiments, the authored content storage subsystems  are organized as a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), in which case each authored content providers  accesses its corresponding storage subsystem(s)  using one or more well-known RAID protocols.","In the illustrated example, each authored content providers  receive and respond to various requests from user computers , such as, requests for authored content attributable to the authored content provider . For example, the authored content provider  may receive a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  from the user computer  to view an authored page that includes user-generated content. In response to the retrieval request, the authored content provider  generates a corresponding \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that renders the authored content together with the user-generated content in a viewable state. This may be accomplished, for example, by the authored content provider  generating a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  to retrieve user-generated content (e.g., content corresponding to a specified UGC identifier) from the extensible content service . In response to the retrieval request, the extensible content service  retrieves the specified user-generated content and generates a corresponding \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that provides the user-generated content to the authored content provider . The requested authored content provider  provides to the requesting user computer  retrieval responses  for authored content that include user-generated content as a single page. That is, in the SEO context, the page is perceived by each requesting user computer  as whole and attributable to the authored content provider .","In some embodiments, the extensible content service  may respond to a retrieval request  with both the requested user-generated content and one or more client-side controls, such as an EasyEdit button, and AddPage button, and\/or other controls, that may be selected by a user to contribute content attributable to the authored content provider . The authored content provider may then render the client-side controls together with the viewable content (e.g., authored content and user-generated content).","If a user selects a client-side control, for example the EasyEdit button, the user computer  generates an \u201cedit\u201d request  to the extensible content service  to retrieve an editable version of the user-generated content. Requests  to contribute content typically include a token that is used by the extensible content service  to identify the user and\/or determine whether the user computer  is authorized to contribute content as requested. In some embodiments, when a request  does not include a token, or includes an invalid token, the extensible content service  directs the user computer  to an authentication interface provided by the authored content provider . For example, the authored content provider  may receive an \u201cauthentication\u201d request  from user computer  to sign-on using the provider's authentication interface. In some embodiments, once the requesting user computer  is authenticated, the authored content provider  generates a corresponding \u201cauthentication\u201d response  providing the user computer  with a token. In alternative embodiments, the authored content provider  generates a \u201ctoken\u201d request  indicating to the extensible content service  that the user computer  has been authenticated and requesting that the extensible content service generate a token corresponding to the authenticated user. In response to receiving a token request, the extensible content service  may generate a corresponding \u201ctoken\u201d response , which includes a token provided to the user computer  by the authored content provider  in the provider's corresponding authentication response .","In some embodiments, after a user computer  has been authenticated by an authored content provider , the user may contribute content attributable to the authored content provider , such as by editing user-generated content or adding user-generated pages. For example, continuing with the example above, when an edit request  includes a valid token, the extensible content service  generates a corresponding \u201cedit\u201d response  that returns an editable version of the requested user-generated content to the requesting user computer . The editable version of the user-generated content may be presented to the user in a WYSIWYG or other suitable editor.","In some embodiments, the editor includes a client-side control that, when selected by the user, the user computer  generates a \u201csave\u201d request  to the extensible content service  to save the user's edits or contributions to the user-generated content. The extensible content service  stores any edits to the user-generated content, thereby preparing the content for viewing (e.g., retrieval by the authored content provider ) in response to a request from that user computer  or another user computer . In some embodiments, two or more users may edit the same or different versions of extensible content. For example, while a first user is editing a particular portion of extensible content, a second user may edit (and save) that particular portion of extensible content. In such embodiments, the extensible content system  may provide an interface (e.g., via the client application API) to notify the first user that multiple versions of the extensible content exist (e.g., user's edited version, the version prior to the second users edits, the version resulting from the second user's edits, etc.). In some embodiments, the user may choose to merge the versions, override the second user's edits, or not save their changes at all.","While various embodiments and examples are described in terms of the environment described above, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the extensible content service  may be implemented in a variety of other environments, as well as various other combinations of computing systems, or similar devices connected in various ways. For example, in some embodiments, the extensible content service  has a distributed architecture, even though it is not illustrated as such in . As another example, in some embodiments, the extensible content service  can be adapted for use in other types of storage systems that provide authored content providers  and\/or user computers  with access to extensible content, or processing systems other than storage servers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","200"]},"In the illustrated example, the extensible content service  is implemented by a computing system , such as a web server, that includes one or more processors  and memory  coupled to an interconnect system . The processors  are the central processing units (\u201cCPUs\u201d) of the computing system  and, thus, control its overall operation. The processors  accomplish this by executing software stored in memory . In some embodiments, the computing system  includes a processor  having two or more independent cores in a package composed of a single integrated circuit (referred to as a \u201cdie\u201d), one or more dies packaged together, multiple packages, and so on. In some embodiments, the computing system  includes a hyper-threaded processor  that, despite having only a single core, is capable of performing as a multi-core processor.

In some embodiments, the user interface component  includes a control to distribute or share one or more portions of the displayed user-generated content. In response to a request  from a user computer  to share a portion of user-generated content, the extensible content service generates or returns a reference to the requested content. For example, the user interface component  may return the UGC identifier of the content. In some embodiments, the user interface component  includes a control to add shareable user-generated to a web page of an authored content provider. For example, the user interface component  may include a control that, when selected by a user, presents an interface that allows the user to enter a UGC identifier of a sharable portion of user-generated content. In response to a request  from a user computer  to add user-generated content referenced by a particular UGC identifier, the user interface component  may invoke the user validation component  to determine whether the requesting user has been authenticated. If the received request  includes a valid token, the user interface component  adds the shareable user-generated content referenced by the UGC identifier to the page. As another example, the user interface component  may includes a control that, when selected by a user, presents an interface that allows the user to search for shareable user-generated content contributed to any of the subscribing authored content providers.","The edit request component  receives \u201cedit\u201d requests  from user computers  to edit user-generated content attributable to an authored content provider .

A token may be a key or data structure that is used to identify an authenticated user and\/or a permission level associated with the user, such as editor, moderator, and so on. In some embodiments, a token is valid for a pre-determined or specified period of time. The user validation component  determines whether a token is valid, for example, by evaluating a timestamp associated with the token, by determining whether the token may be used to identify a user, and so on. The user validation component  may also be invoked to evaluate the permission level of an authenticated user and to determine whether the user is authored to perform desired action (e.g., create a user-generated page). Typically, no special permissions are required to view content.

The extensible portion creation component  may receive a \u201cplaceholder\u201d request  from a user computer  to create a placeholder. For example, users may request to create a placeholder by selecting a client-side control. The extensible portion creation component  may invoke the user validation component  to determine whether the user has been authenticated and, if so, whether the user is authorized to create a placeholder. If the placeholder request  includes a valid token, and the user is authorized to a create placeholder, the extensible portion creation component  generates a placeholder.

Otherwise, the extensible content service  loops back to step . In step , the extensible content service  generates a token corresponding to the authenticated user, and the extensible content service  continues to step . In step , the extensible content service  returns the token, and the process ends. For example, the token may be provided to the authored content provider , which in turn provides the token to the user computer  of the authenticated user. A generated token may be a key or data structure that is used to identify the authenticated user and\/or a permission level associated with the user, such as editor, moderator, and so on. The token may then be included with requests generated by the authenticated user computer  to access the social publishing features of the extensible content service , including, for example, those features illustrated in , and .","Returning to , in step , an authentication (e.g., \u201csign-on\u201d) interface of the authored content provider  is invoked (e.g., via an API of the client application), and the authored content provider  continues to step . For example, the authored content provider's interface may be invoked when the extensible content service  directs the user to sign-on to the authored content provider , such as in step  of process . As another example, an authored content provider's authentication interface may be invoked by the user navigating to the authentication interface without any direction from an extensible content service .

In the illustrated example, each authored content providers  receives a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  from a user computer  for an authored page that includes to shared user-generated content . For example, authored content provider receives a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  from user computer for authored page ; authored content providers receives a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  from user computer for authored page ; and authored content provider receives a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  from user computer for authored page . In response to the retrieval requests , each authored content provider  generates a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  to retrieve the shared user-generated content  from the extensible content service . In response to the retrieval request, the extensible content service  retrieves the shared user-generated content  and generates a corresponding \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that provides the shared user-generated content  to each of the authored content providers . Each authored content provider  then generates a \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that renders the authored content page together with the shared user-generated content  in a viewable state. For example, authored content provider generates a \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that renders authored content page  together with the shared user-generated content  in a single page ; authored content provider generates a \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that renders authored content page  together with the shared user-generated content  in a single page ; and authored content provider generates a \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that renders authored content page  together with the shared user-generated content  in a single page . In the SEO context, the pages - are perceived by each requesting user computer  as whole and attributable to the authored content providers .","In some embodiments, the extensible content service  allows an authored content provider  to specify whether its originally-contributed user-generated content may be shared and on what basis. For example, an authored content provider  may specify that particular portions of user-generated content on a page that are shareable. In some embodiments, an authored content provider  may further specify whether its shared user-generated content, if any, may be attributed to other authored content providers .  is a high-level block diagram illustrating an example of an extensible content service for hyper-distribution of user-generated content that identifies the authored content provider to which the user-generated content was originally contributed. To facilitate description in the illustrated example, it is assumed that user-generated content  is shareable and was originally contributed to authored content provider within an editable portion of page . In the illustrated example, when authored content provider receives a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  from a user computer  for authored page , it generates a \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that renders the authored content page  together with the shared user-generated content  in a single page as described in connection with . However, when the shared user-generated content  is presented to a user computer  by a content provider other than authored content provider , the shared content  includes a reference  to authored content provider . To facilitate description in the illustrated example, it is further assumed that user-generated content  is shared by authored content provider and other content providers . . . . When authored content provider or other content providers . . . receives a \u201cretrieval\u201d request  from a user computer  for a page that includes shared user-generated content , the content provider generates a \u201cretrieval\u201d response  that renders requested page with a reference to the extensible content service  and a location within the UGC storage subsystem  at which the shared user-generated content  may be retrieved (e.g., the UGC identifier). For example, the source code of the response page may include an iframe identifying the extensible content service  and UGC identifier of the shared content . In the illustrated embodiment, the shared user-generated content  is provided together with a reference  to the authored content provider to which the content was originally contributed. For example, the reference  may be a link to the page  at which the user-generated content  was originally contributed to authored content provider . By including a link back to the originating authored content provider , the extensible content service  increases the likelihood that such user-generated content  will be discovered, crawled, and indexed by search engines without sacrificing its uniqueness.","Overall, an extensible content service for optimizing content attributable to an authored content provider, including user-generated content, has been described. The extensible content service described herein significantly reduces an authored content provider's costs to generate content and achieve SEO credit from such content.","Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words \u201ccomprise,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense, as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d As used herein, the terms \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201ccoupled,\u201d or any variant thereof means any connection or coupling, either direct or indirect, between two or more elements; the coupling or connection between the elements can be physical, logical, or a combination thereof.
