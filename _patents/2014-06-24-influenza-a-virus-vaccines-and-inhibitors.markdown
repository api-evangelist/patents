These annual epidemics also have a large economic impact, and cause more than 100,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States alone. Influenza A viruses, which infect a wide number of avian and mammalian species, are responsible for the periodic widespread epidemics, or pandemics, that have caused high mortality rates (Wright and Webster, 2001). The most devastating pandemic occurred in 1918, which caused an estimated 20 to 40 million deaths worldwide (Reid et al., 2001). Less devastating pandemics occurred in 1957 and 1968. Influenza B virus infections comprise about 20% of the yearly cases, but influenza B virus, which appears to infect only humans, does not cause pandemics (Wright and Webster, 2001).","Influenza A and B viruses contain negative-stranded RNA genomes, which are in the form of eight RNA segments (Lamb and Krug, 2001). Most, but not all, of the corresponding genome RNA segments of influenza A and B viruses encode proteins of similar functions. Here we will focus on influenza A virus. The three largest genome segments encode the three subunits of the polymerase, PB1, PB2 and PA. The segment encoding PB1 also encodes a small nonstructural protein, PB1-F2, which has apoptotic functions. The middle-sized segments encode the hemagglutinin (HA), the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and the neuraminidase (NA). HA, the major surface protein of the virus, binds to sialic acid-containing receptors on host cells, and is the protein against which neutralizing antibodies are produced. NP protein molecules are bound at regular intervals along the entire length of each of the genomic RNAs to form ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), and also have essential functions in viral RNA replication. The NA viral surface protein removes sialic acid from glycoproteins. One of its major functions is to remove sialic acid during virus budding from the cell surface and from the HA and NA of the newly assembled virions, thereby obviating aggregation of the budding virions on the cell surface. The seventh genomic RNA segment encodes two proteins, M1 (matrix protein) and M2. The M1 protein underlies the viral lipid membrane, and is thought to interact with the genomic RNPs and with the inner (cytoplasmic) tails of the surface proteins, e.g., HA and NA. The M2 protein is an ion channel protein that is essential for the uncoating of the virus. The smallest segment encodes two proteins, NS1A and NS2. The NS2 protein mediates the export of newly synthesized viral RNPs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The NS1A protein is a multi-functional protein not that is not incorporated into virion particles (hence the designation \u201cnon structural\u201d), and is discussed below.","The primary means for controlling influenza virus epidemics has been vaccination directed primarily against HA (Wright and Webster, 2001). However, the antigenic structure of the HA of influenza A virus can undergo two types of change (Wright and Webster, 2001). Antigenic drift results from the selection of mutant viruses that evade antibodies directed against the major antigenic type of the HA circulating in the human population. Mutant viruses are readily generated because the viral RNA polymerase has no proof-reading function. Because of antigenic drift, the vaccine has to be reformulated each year. Antigenic shift in HA results from reassortment of genomic RNA segments between human and avian influenza A virus strains, resulting in a new (potentially pandemic) virus encoding a novel avian-type HA that is immunologically distinct. The human population has little or no immunological protection against such a new virus. The viruses containing the H2 and H3 HA subtypes that caused pandemics in 1957 and 1968, respectively, resulted from the reassortment of avian and human genomic RNA segments (Wright and Webster, 2001). The HA of influenza B viruses undergoes antigenic drift, but not antigenic shift, because influenza B viruses do not have non-human hosts.","Pandemic influenza A viruses can also apparently arise by a different mechanism. It has been postulated that the 1918 H1 pandemic strain derived all eight genomic RNAs from an avian virus, and that this virus then underwent multiple mutations in the process of adapting to mammalian cells (Reid et al., 2004; Taubenberger et al., 2005). H5N1 viruses, which have already spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, appear to be undergoing this route for acquiring pandemic capability (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2005; Noah and Krug, 2005). These viruses, which have been directly transmitted from chickens to humans, contain only avian genes, and are highly pathogenic in humans. The human mortality rate has been high, approximately 55% (WHO, 2006). H5N1 viruses have not yet acquired the ability for efficient transmission from humans to humans. Recent studies indicate that efficient human transmission will require more than the acquisition of the ability of HA to bind to human sialic acid receptors in the upper respiratory tract of mammalian organisms (Maines et al., 2006). However, at least one H5N1 gene, the PB2 gene, has already undergone adaptation to mammalian cells (Hatta et al., 2001). The vast majority of pathogenic H5N1 viruses have acquired a lysine at position 627 in the PB2 protein, in place of the glutamic acid that is found at this position in avian viruses. The presence of lysine at this position apparently enhances virus replication in mammalian cells, but the mechanism of enhancement has not been established (Crescenzo-Chaigne et al., 2002; Shinya et al., 2004).","Effective control of a H5N1 pandemic will require the use of antiviral drugs because it is not likely that sufficient amounts of an effective vaccine will be available, particularly in the early phase of a fast-spreading pandemic (Ferguson et al., 2005; Longini et al., 2005; Ferguson et al., 2006; Germann et al., 2006). Antivirals can be stockpiled, and if appropriately used, should limit the spread of pandemic influenza virus. The strategies that have been proposed for the use of antivirals to stem a H5N1 pandemic would also be expected to lead to more effective use of antivirals during annual influenza epidemics. Currently, there are two classes of antiviral drugs. One class, amantadine\/rimantidine, is directed against the M2 ion channel of influenza A viruses (Pinto et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1993; Chizhmakov et al., 1996). Virus mutants resistant to this class of drugs rapidly emerge (Cox and Subbarao, 1999; Suzuki et al., 2003), and many of the human isolates of H5N1 viruses are already resistant to these drugs (Puthavathana et al., 2005). The other class of drugs is directed at NA, and is effective against both influenza A and B viruses (von Itzstein et al., 1993; Woods et al., 1993; Ryan et al., 1994; Gubareva et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1997; Mendel et al., 1998). However, H5N1 viruses that are partially, or completely, resistant to the NA inhibitor oseltamivir have been reported (de Jong et al., 2005; Le et al., 2005). The emergence of H5N1 viruses to these two classes of antiviral drugs highlights the need for additional antiviral drugs against influenza virus.","The present invention includes the structure and function of the cellular polyadenylation and specificity factor 30 (CPSF30) binding site, or \u201cbinding epitope\u201d, on the surface of the influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1). When referring to influenza A, the protein is referred to herein as NS1A. The NS1 protein of influenza A virus will be designated as the NS1A protein to distinguish it from the NS1 protein encoded by influenza B virus, which will be designated as the NS1B protein. Several fragments of the NS1A protein were identified, from various influenza strains, that provide high-level expression and solubility in expression systems. The present invention also includes expression systems and protocols for producing large quantities of the previously identified F2F3 fragment of human CPSF30, which binds to the NS1A effector domain (Twu et al., 2006). These fragments of the NS1A protein and of CPSF30 provide high quality NMR spectra, suitable for lead compound optimization. Combining these reagents and information, we have designed a gel filtration assay suitable for characterizing complex formation between NS1A and CPSF30 (or fragments thereof), as well as a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay of NS1A-CPSF30 interactions that is suitable for high throughput screening for lead compounds to develop antiviral drugs. Using these reagents, complexes of the tetrameric complex between the NS1A effector domain and F2F3 were also generated. We have also developed a process for crystallizing this complex. These crystals were used to determine the 3D structure of the NS1A effector domain: F2F3 complex, and to definitively identify for the first time all the NS1A amino acids that comprise a portion of the CPSF30 binding epitope in the NS1A protein. These reagents and structural data, together with specific site-directed mutagenesis data, have allowed us to define a structure-based process for high-throughput screening of inhibitors and lead optimization that will allow development of influenza A antiviral drugs. Also disclosed is a process using these reagents and structural data to develop attenuated strains of influenza A suitable for use as animal (e.g. avian) or human vaccines.","Using the present invention it is possible for antiviral drug(s) to be directed at a viral target that differs from that of currently available influenza antivirals. Novel approaches are important because influenza A viruses, including avian influenza virus, are developing resistance to existing antiviral drugs. The present invention also describes a process for developing vaccines using structural information that has not been previously disclosed. A vaccine using live attenuated strains of influenza A virus is expected to provide better protection than a vaccine using inactivated virus. The present invention may also be used to develop, isolate and characterize antiviral drugs and live attenuated virus vaccine for both seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infections.","More particularly, the present invention includes a complex of the F2F3 fragment of CPSF30 with the portion of the NS1A protein of influenza A virus comprising amino acid residues 85 to 215 (NS1A (85-215)). The complex can be used in a method of identifying an inhibitor of influenza A virus by preparing a reaction system comprising at least a portion of NS1A of an influenza A virus, the F2F3 fragment of CPSF30, and a candidate compound; and detecting binding between the at least a portion of NS1A and F2F3, wherein reduced binding in the presence of the candidate drug relative to the control is indicative of activity of the compound against influenza virus. Examples of the NS1A fragments are listed in Table 2, and may also include the full length NS1A, and mutations thereof. The skilled artisan will recognize that the NS1A protein fragment may be prepared from other strains of influenza A viruses, e.g., human influenza A virus, a bovine influenza A virus, an equine influenza A virus, a porcine influenza A virus, an avian influenza A virus, an avian H5N1 viral strain.","For use with the present invention, the CPSF30 may be, e.g., a full length CPSF30, F3 zinc-finger domain, an F2F3-F2F3 tandem duplex, an F1F2F3 fragment, a soluble fragment of CPSF30, combinations and mutants thereof. Detection of the binding may be by, e.g., a high throughput screening assay, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, analytical gel filtration, and combinations thereof. Other methods of detecting the interaction of the NS1A and CPSF30 (or portions thereof) may be, e.g., fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescence polarization, immunofluorescence, chemiluminescence, radioimmunoassays, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, mass spectrometry, and combinations thereof. For example, fluorescence polarization may use either a fluorescent labeled CPSF30, variant or fragment thereof or a fluorescent labeled NS 1A protein, variant or fragments thereof.","The present invention also includes a process for using 3D (three-dimensional) information of the CPSF30 binding epitope on the influenza A virus NS1A protein for identifying inhibitors of an influenza A virus by obtaining concurrently the coordinates for the molecular position of at least a portion of an influenza NS1A protein and at least a portion of a CPSF30 protein and designing a molecule that will fit between the influenza NS1A protein and the CPSF30 protein based on the coordinates. The portion of the NS1A protein and the portion of the CPSF30 protein will generally be selected to provide high quality NMR spectra, e.g., the NS1A (85-215) fragment and the F2F3 fragment may be selected to form a tetrameric complex.","In another example, the NS1A (85-215) fragment and the F2F3 fragment may form a tetrameric complex that is crystallized. Other examples may use an NS1A (85-215) fragment and the F2F3 fragment form a tetrameric complex that is crystallized and is used to determine the 3D structure of the NS1A (85-215):F2F3 complex using X-ray crystallography. The method may also include the step of identifying the NS1A amino acids that constitute the CPSF30 binding portion of the NS1A protein.","Yet another embodiment is a method of designing an inhibitor compound of an influenza A virus based on computational methods, wherein the inhibitor that binds at least one residue within the set of residues corresponds to the structure, using the crystal structure and its coordinates. The design method may be facilitated by using NMR spectra of samples of NS1A protein fragments, NMR spectra of samples of NS1A(85-215) or equivalent constructs thereof. The method may further include the step of optimizing the design of the molecule that fits between the NS1A (85-215) protein and the CPSF30 protein using X-ray crystallography, and synthetic chemistry. The method of designing an inhibitor compound may also include the step of optimizing the design of the molecule that fits between the NS1A(85-215) protein and the CPSF30 protein using X-ray crystallography, NMR, synthetic chemistry and combinations thereof. Another embodiment of method of designing an inhibitor compound may also include, optionally or in combination one or more of the following: modifying the F2F3 structure of CPSF30, or any substructure, based on its conformation bound to NS1A to rationally design one or more small molecule inhibitors; modifying the F2F3 structure of CPSF30, or any substructure, to rationally design one or more small molecule inhibitors based on its conformation bound to NS1A of the F2F3 aromatic rings, the sidechain of residue Lys101, or combinations thereof; modifying the F2F3 structure of CPSF30, or any substructure, to rationally design one or more small molecule inhibitors by virtual screening; using the three-dimensional structure of the NS1A binding pocket to select one or more small molecule inhibitors or using the three-dimensional structure of the NS1A binding pocket to select one or more small molecule inhibitors by virtual screening. Any fragments of, full length, and strains of NS1A, and fragments of, full length, and strains of CPSF30 and combinations thereof may be used in conjunction with the method of designing an inhibitor compound.","Another embodiment of the present invention includes a process for engineering a live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine by mutation of specific residues in the CPSF30-binding epitope of the NS1A protein based on the 3D structure of the complex formed between NS1A (85-215) and F2F3, a tetramer interface and combinations thereof. Specific examples of residues at the tetramer interface site include, e.g., F103, L105, M106 and equivalents thereof. Specific examples of residues at the CPSF30-binding epitope include, e.g., M106, K110, I117, I119, Q121, D125, V180, G183, G184, W187 and equivalents thereof. The process may further include mutating the double-strand RNA binding epitope.","Another embodiment of the present invention includes an attenuated influenza A virus vaccine that includes one or more of eight viral RNA segments, wherein a viral RNA segment eight has a first mutation that causes a substitution of a first amino acid corresponding to an amino acid of SEQ. ID. NO. 1 at a position F103, L105, M106, K110, I117, I119, Q121, D125, L144, V180, G183, G184, or W187; wherein the first mutation decreases the CPSF30 binding ability of the NS1A protein. In one embodiment, at least a second mutation anywhere in the NS1A protein. The vaccine may also include at least second mutation causes a substitution of at least a second amino acid corresponding to an amino acid of SEQ ID NO.: 1 at a position F103, L105, M106, K110, I117, I119, Q121, D125, L144, V180, G183, G184, W187 and equivalents thereof. Alternatively, the vaccine may also include at least second mutation with a substitution of at least a second amino acid corresponding to an amino acid of SEQ ID NO.: 1 at a position T5, P31, D34, R35, R38, K41, G45, R46, and T49 at a dsRNA binding epitope and equivalents thereof. Alternatively, the vaccine may also include at least second mutation with at least second mutation causes a substitution of at least a second and third amino acid corresponding to an amino acid of SEQ. ID. NO. 1 at a position T5, P31, D34, R35, R38, K41, G45, R46, and T49 at a dsRNA binding epitope and\/or F103, L105, M106, K110, I117, I119, Q121, D125, L144, V180, G183, G184, W187 and equivalents thereof. The influenza virus is a may be a cold-adapted influenza virus and will generally be selected to elicit an immune response. Non-limiting examples of influenza virus that may be used to make the attenuated vaccine may be is selected from, e.g., a human influenza A virus, a bovine influenza A virus, an equine influenza A virus, a porcine influenza A virus, an avian influenza A virus, an avian H5N1 viral strain.","The present invention also includes a pharmaceutical composition having a live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine by mutation of specific residues in the CPSF30-binding epitope of the NS1A protein based on the 3D structure of the complex formed between NS1A (85-215) and F2F3, a tetramer interaction site and combinations thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The vaccine may be used in a method of prophylaxis of a disease condition caused by the influenza virus by administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine by mutation of specific residues in the CPSF30-binding epitope of the NS1A protein based on the 3D structure of the complex formed between NS1A (85-215) and F2F3, a tetramer interaction site, the dsRNA binding epitope and combinations thereof.","While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention.","To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are not intended to refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.","One of the best clues to a protein's function is its structure. The present invention takes advantage of structure-based bioinformatics platforms in \u201cfunctional genomics.\u201d The structure-function data obtained from various structural determination may be used the isolation of novel biopharmaceuticals and\/or drug targets from gene sequence information with greater efficiency. One way to identify the biochemical and medical function of a gene product is to determine its three-dimensional structure. Although there are numerous examples in which the primary (i.e., linear) structure of a protein has provided key clues to its biochemical function, three dimensional (3D) structure determination is considered to be more definitive at establishing biochemical function and mechanisms underlying these functions.","Protein structure. It is a generally accepted principle of biology that a protein's primary sequence is the main determinant of its tertiary structure. Anfinsen, Science 181:223-230 (1973); Anfinsen and Scheraga, Adv. Prot. Chem. 29:205-300 (1975); and Baldwin, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 44:453-475 (1975). For over a decade, researchers have been studying the theoretical and practical aspects of the folding of recombinant proteins.","Generally, proteins are composed of one or more autonomously-folding units known as domains. Kim, et al., Ann. Rev Biochem. 59:631-660 (1990); Nilsson, et al., Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 45:607-635 (1991). Multi-domain proteins in higher organisms are encoded by genes containing multiple exons and combinatorial shuffling of exons during evolution has produced novel proteins with different domain arrangements having different associated functions. Multi-domain protein may increase the ability of higher organisms to respond to environmental challenges because, via recombinational events, because the genomes may readily add, subtract, or rearrange discrete functionalities within a given protein. Patthy, Cell 41:657-663 (1985); Patthy, Curr. Opin. Struct. Bio. 4:383-392 (1994); and Long, et al., Science 92:12495-12499 (1995).","Interpretation of a protein structure. Several methods have been used to elucidate the 3D structure of a given protein molecule, e.g., X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).","X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is a technique that directly images molecules. A crystal of the molecule to be visualized is exposed to a collimated beam of monochromatic X-rays and the consequent diffraction pattern is recorded on a photographic film or by a radiation counter. The intensities of the diffraction maxima are then used to construct mathematically the three-dimensional image of the crystal structure. X-rays interact almost exclusively with the electrons in the matter and not the nuclei. The spacing of atoms in a crystal lattice can be determined by measuring the angle and intensities at which a beam of X-rays of a given wave length is diffracted by the electron shells surrounding the atoms. Operationally, there are several steps in X-ray structural analysis. The amount of information obtained depends on the degree of structural order in the sample. Blundell et al. provide an advanced treatment of the principles of protein X-ray crystallography. Blundell, et al., Protein Crystallography, Academic Press (1976), herein incorporated by reference. Likewise, Wyckoff et al. provide a series of articles on the theory and practice of X-ray crystallography. Wyckoff, et al. (Eds.), Methods Enzymol. 114: 330-386 (1985), relevant portions herein incorporated by reference. Important techniques for X-ray crystallography include methods for determining diffraction data phases by a multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) method (described, for example, in Hendrickson, 1991), particularly using biosynthethic enrichment with seleno-methione (SeMet), and a molecular replacement method (described, for example, in Rossmann, M. G. The molecular replacement method. Acta Cryst. A46, 73-82 (1990).","Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). A general approach for the analysis of NMR resonance assignments was first outlined by Wuthrich, Wagner and co-workers. Wuthrich, \u201cNMR of proteins and nucleic acids\u201d Wiley, New York, N.Y. (1986); Wuthrich, Science 243:45-50 (1989); Billeter, et al., J. Mol Biol. 155:321-346 (1982), relevant portions of each incorporated herein by reference. For a general review of protein determination in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, see Wuthrich, Science 243:45-50 (1989); Billeter et al., J. Mol. Biol. 155:321-346 (1982). More recent improvements using multidimensional and triple resonance NMR methods (described, for example, in J. Cavanagh, W. Fairbrother, A. Palmer, and N. Skelton, Protein NMR Specroscopy, Principles and Practice, 2ed Ed, Academic Press, NY, 2006, incorporated herein), familiar to someone trained in the art, are elaborations of these basic principles.","As used herein, the terms \u201cCPSF30 binding epitope\u201d or \u201cCPSF binding site\u201d refer to that portion of the NS1 protein of influenza that interacts with one or more zinc fingers of the CPSF30 protein.","As used herein, the terms \u201cNS1A-binding epitope\u201d or \u201cNS1A binding site\u201d refer to that portion of the CPSF30 protein that interacts with the NS1 protein of influenza A.","As used herein, the term \u201ctetramer interface\u201d refers to those portions of the NS1A protein and the CSPF30 protein that interact NS1A:CPSF30 complex, which can be a dimer or tetramer.","As used herein, the terms \u201cdouble-strand RNA binding site\u201d or \u201cdoubled-stranded RNA binding epitope\u201d refer to that portion of the NS1A protein that interacts with double-stranded RNA, e.g., for suppressing host innate immune response.

The skilled artisan will recognize that an epitope may be a structure such as a \u201czinc finger,\u201d a portion of a molecular surface between two or more polypeptides that are capable of interacting, and\/or a \u201cbinding pocket\u201d or \u201cenzymatic pocket\u201d that lead to a function or interaction of the protein.","As used herein, the following nomenclature is used to define the zinc finger domains of the CPSF30 protein that interact NS1A, namely, \u201cF1\u201d, \u201cF2\u201d and \u201cF3\u201d when referring to individual zinc fingers, \u201cF1F2\u201d, \u201cF2F3\u201d when referring to a pair of zinc fingers and \u201cF1F2F3\u201d when referring to the three zinc fingers.","As used herein, the term \u201crationally design\u201d refers to a series of steps for designing, e.g., initial small molecule inhibitors that may be further refined through medicinal chemistry and\/or the selection of inhibitors that can be further modified chemically and that fit the molecular characteristics of a molecule that will meet the design criteria for modifying the interactions between or the activity of NS1A and CPSF30 based fully and\/or at least in part on the three dimensional (3D) coordinates described herein.","As used herein, the term \u201cvirtual screening\u201d refers to in silico design, using computer software to screen for possible binding ligands from a library of virtual molecules, allowing the characterization and refinement of small molecule inhibitors that will meet the design criteria for modifying the interactions between or the activity of NS1A and CPSF30 based fully and\/or at least in part on the three dimensional (3D) coordinates described herein.","As used herein, the term \u201ccorresponding positions\u201d refers to amino acids at that are generally in the same spatial location in the three-dimensional structures of homologous protein structures. In one example, a corresponding position is determined by 3D structure alignment using standard techniques known to a person skilled in the art, such as the PRISM program, described by Yang and Hong Yang, A.-S. and Honig, B. (2000) An Integrated Approach to the Analysis of Sequence and Structure. I. Protein Structural Alignment and a Quantitative Measure for Protein Structural Distance. J. Mol.

The alignment may include the introduction of gaps in the sequences to be aligned. In the absence of 3D structures for protein pairs, corresponding positions may be identified (until such time that the requisite 3D structures are available) by sequence-based alignment using standard techniques known to a person skilled in the art, such as a Needleman-Wunsch dynamic programming algorithm (described in Needleman, S.

Examples of influenza A strains for use and analysis with the present invention may include A\/Memphis\/8\/88, A\/Chile\/1\/83, A\/Kiev\/59\/79, A\/Udorn\/307\/72, A\/NT\/60\/68, A\/Korea\/426\/68, A\/Great Lakes\/0389\/65, A\/Ann Arbor\/6\/60, A\/Leningrad\/13\/57, A\/Singapore\/1\/57, A\/PR\/8\/34, A\/Vietnam\/1203\/04, A\/HK\/483\/97, A\/South Carolina\/1\/181918 (the 1918 pandemic virus H1N1 strain), and A\/WSN\/33. The sequences of these strains are available from GenBank, CDC and viral stock may be available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. or are otherwise publicly available.","As used herein, the term \u201cvariant\u201d gene or protein refers to a gene or protein that differs from the wild type gene or protein by way of nucleotide or amino acid substitution(s), addition(s), deletion(s), and combinations thereof. Depending on the context, the term mutant is also used to describe variations from the wild-type sequence that are natural, introduced at random and\/or introduced into a gene or protein sequence specifically. Likewise, a fragment is used to describe a fragment of the complete length of the translated polypeptide, whether natural or not. Often, the skilled artisan will design fragments that include or avoid certain amino acid that may affect, e.g., synthesis or cause steric hindrance or other design requirements. When designing alternate peptide constructs with enhanced anti-viral properties, substitutions may be used which modulate one or more properties of the molecule. Variants typically include the exchange of one amino acid for another at one or more sites within the peptide. For example, certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids in a peptide structure in order to enhance the interactive binding capacity of the structures. Certain amino acid substitutions can be made in a protein sequence (or its underlying DNA coding sequence) to create a peptide with superior functional characteristics. In particular, those changes that enhance the amphipathic, \u03b1-helical nature may be desired.","As used herein, the term \u201ccandidate compound\u201d refers to any molecule that may inhibit influenza viral growth. The candidate substance may be a protein or fragment thereof, a small molecule, or even a nucleic acid molecule. Various commercial sources of small molecule libraries meet the basic criteria for useful drugs in an effort to \u201cbrute force\u201d the identification of useful candidate compounds. Screening of such libraries, including libraries generated combinatorially (e.g., peptide libraries, aptamer libraries, small molecule libraries), is a rapid and efficient way to screen large number of related (and unrelated) compounds for activity. Combinatorial approaches also lend themselves to rapid evolution of potential drugs by the creation of second, third and fourth generation compounds modeled of active, but otherwise undesirable compounds. Candidate compounds may be screened from large libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. One example of a candidate compound library is an FDA-approved library of compounds that can be used by humans. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available from a number of companies including Maybridge Chemical Co. (Trevillet, Cornwall, UK), Comgenex (Princeton, N.J.), Brandon Associates (Merrimack, N.H.), and Microsource (New Milford, Conn.) and a rare chemical library is available from Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.). Combinatorial libraries are available or can be prepared. Alternatively, libraries of natural candidate compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are also available from, for example, Pan Laboratories (Bothell, Wash.) or MycoSearch (N.C.), or can be readily prepared by methods well known in the art. Candidate compounds isolated from natural sources, such as animals, bacteria, fungi, plant sources, including leaves and bark, and marine samples may be assayed as candidates for the presence of potentially useful pharmaceutical agents. It will be understood that the pharmaceutical agents to be screened could also be derived or synthesized from chemical compositions or man-made compounds.","The amino acid sequence of the NS1A protein of Influenza A virus, A\/Udorn\/72:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.:\u20031)",{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"273pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u2003\u20031","MDPNTVSSFQ\u2003VDCFLWHVRK\u2003RVADQELGDA\u2003PFLDRLRRDQ\u2003KSLRGRGSTL\u2003GLDIETATRA",{}]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["\u200361","GKQIVERILK\u2003EESDEALKMT\u2003MASVPASRYL\u2003TDMTLEEMSR\u2003EWSMLIPKQK\u2003VAGPLCIRMD"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["121","QAIMDKNIIL\u2003KANFSVIFDR\u2003LETLILLRAF\u2003TEEGAIVGEI\u2003SPLPSLPGHT\u2003AEDVKNAVGV"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["181","LIGGLEWNDN\u2003TVRVSETLQR\u2003FAWRSSNENG\u2003RPPLTPKQKR\u2003EMAGTIRSEV."]}]}}]}}},"The anti-viral agents disclosed herein may be used in conjunction with methods to reduce virus growth, infectivity, burden, shed, development of anti-viral resistance, and to enhance the efficacy of traditional anti-viral therapies.","The amino acid sequence of the relevant fragments of human CPSF30 (UniProt id 095639):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.:\u200313)",{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"238pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u2003\u20031","MQEIIASVDH\u2003IKFDLEIAVE\u2003QQLGAQPLPF\u2003PGMDKSGAAV\u2003CEFFLKAACG","\u200350",{}]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["\u200351","KGGMCPFRHI\u2003SGEKTVVCKH\u2003WLRGLCKKGD\u2003QCEFLHEYDM\u2003TKMPECYFYS","100"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["101","KFGECSNKEC\u2003PFLHIDPESK\u2003IKDCPWYDRG\u2003FCKHGPLCRH\u2003RHTRRVICVN","150"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["151","YLVGFCPEGP\u2003SCKFMHPRFE\u2003LPMGTTEQPP\u2003LPQQTQPPAK\u2003QSNNPPLQRS","200"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["201","SSLIQLTSQN\u2003SSPNQQRTPQ\u2003VIGVMQSQNS\u2003SAGNRGPRPL\u2003EQVTCYKCGE","250"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["251","KGHYANRCTK\u2003GHLAFLSGQ",{}]}]}}]}}},"The amino acid sequence of the relevant fragments of human CPSF30 discussed in this patent are:","F1 Zn-Finger Domain: residues 41-59;","F2 Zn-Finger Domain: residues 68-86;","F3 Zn-Finger Domain: residues 96-114;","F4 Zn-Finger Domain: residues 124-142;","F5 Zn-Finger Domain: residues 148-166;

Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the vectors or cells of the present invention, its use in therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients also can be incorporated into the compositions.","The active antiviral agents of the present invention may be formulated into classic pharmaceutical preparations and administered via any common route so long as the target tissue is available via that route. These routes of administration include, e.g., oral, alveolar, nasal, buccal, rectal, vaginal or topical. In particular, use of the anti-viral peptides of the present invention in a condom or diaphragm, optionally in conjunction with a spermicidal or other contraceptive substance, is envisioned. Alternatively, administration may be orthotopic, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intravenous. The antiviral agent may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions of the antiviral agent may be compounded into a free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils.

For widespread use, the antiviral agents may be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The antiviral agents will commonly be provided with a carrier, e.g., a solvent or dispersion medium that may include, e.g., water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. Proper dosage fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and\/or antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, the dosage form will include isotonic agents, e.g., sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","Generally, sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle that includes the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. Preparation of sterile powders for injectable solutions maybe prepared by, e.g., vacuum-drying, spray-freezing, freeze-drying or other techniques that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.","As used herein, a \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d refers to solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and anti-fungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like.

Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.","For oral administration, the antiviral agent(s) of the present invention may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible or non-ingestible mouthwashes and dentifrices. A mouthwash may be prepared incorporating the active ingredient in the required amount in an appropriate solvent, such as a sodium borate solution (Dobell's Solution). Alternatively, the antiviral agent(s) may be incorporated into an antiseptic wash containing sodium borate, glycerin and potassium bicarbonate. The antiviral agent(s) may also be dispersed in dentifrices, e.g., gels, pastes, powders and slurries. The antiviral agent(s) may be added in a therapeutically effective amount to a paste dentifrice that may include water, binders, abrasives, flavoring agents, foaming agents, and humectants.","The antiviral agent(s) may be formulated in a neutral or salt form. Pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric and the like. Salts may also be formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, procaine and the like.","Upon formulation, the antiviral agent(s) will be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective.

Sterile aqueous media that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2005), relevant portions incorporated herein by reference. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated for which the skilled artisan will determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Moreover, for human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards.","In one embodiment, the vaccine comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. The suitable vehicles may be both aqueous and non-aqueous. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Carriers or occlusive dressings can be used to increase skin permeability and enhance antigen absorption. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may generally comprise a liposome solution containing the liquid dosage form.

In other embodiment, the vaccine may be administered as a powder, or a cream, or an emulsion.","In another embodiment, the vaccines of the instant invention are applied by an injection, including, without limitation, intradermal, transdermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal and intravenous. According to another embodiment of the invention, the administration is oral and the vaccine may be presented, for example, in the form of a tablet or encased in a gelatin capsule or a microcapsule, which simplifies oral application. The production of these forms of administration is within the general knowledge of a technical expert.","As used herein, \u201cdetectable labels\u201d refer to compounds and\/or elements that can be detected due to their specific functional properties and\/or chemical characteristics, the use of which allows the agent to which they are attached to be detected, and\/or further quantified if desired, such as, e.g., an enzyme, an antibody, a linker, a radioisotope, an electron dense particle, a magnetic particle or a chromophore. The detectable label may be half of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair (for FRET variations see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,593,091, issued to Keys, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference). There are many types of detectable labels, including fluorescent labels, which are easily handled, inexpensive and nontoxic. Another example of a detection method relies on hydrogel-coated donor and acceptor beads providing functional groups for conjugation to biomolecules. AlphaScreen\u00ae by Berthold Technologies (Bad Wildbad, Germany) (Rouleau, N., Turcotte, S., Mondou, M. H., Roby, P. & Bosse, R. (2003) J Biomol Screen 8, 191-7.).","The present inventors recognized that certain regions of the NS1A protein can be targeted for the development of antiviral drugs. The NS1A protein is a multi-functional dimeric protein that participates in both protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions (Krug et al., 2003). The effector domain, which comprises the C-terminal two-thirds of the NS1A protein, contains the binding site for the 30-kDa subunit of the cellular cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) (Nemeroff et al., 1998; Li et al., 2001). This interaction results in the inhibition of 3\u2032 end processing of all cellular pre-mRNAs in infected cells, and as a consequence the production of mature mRNAs encoding antiviral proteins (such as interferon, IFN) is severely inhibited during infection (Shimizu et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2002; Noah et al., 2003). This inhibition is crucial to viral replication and spread, because influenza A virus, like several other RNA viruses (Yoneyama et al., 2004; Sumpter et al., 2005; Seth et al., 2006), efficiently activates the RIG-I RNA helicase and thereby triggers both the activation of IRF-3 and NF-kB and the synthesis of IFN-beta and other antiviral pre-mRNAs (Geiss et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2002; Siren et al., 2006). A recombinant influenza A\/Udorn\/72 virus expressing a NS1A protein with a mutated binding epitope for CPSF30 induced high levels of IFN-beta mRNA during infection and was highly attenuated (100-1000-fold) (Noah et al., 2003; Twu et al., 2006). A 61-amino-acid domain of CPSF30, comprising two of its zinc fingers (i.e., the F2F3 fragment), was found to bind efficiently to the NS1A protein (Twu et al., 2006). The expression of the F2F3 domain in cells leads to the inhibition of influenza A virus replication and increased production of IFN-beta mRNA, indicating that F2F3 likely blocks the binding of endogenous CPSF30 to the NS1A protein (Twu et al., 2006). These results validate the binding epitope on NS1A for CPSF30 as a potential target for the development of small molecule antiviral drugs directed against influenza A virus and as a target for engineering strains of virus that can be used as live attenuated vaccines.","Previous studies showed that residues 184-188 in the protein sequence of the NS1A protein are required for functional binding of CPSF30 (Li et al., 2001; Noah et al., 2003). Thus, this region is required for the binding of CPSF30 in vitro (Li et al., 2001), and mutation of amino acids 184-188 in the NS1A protein of a recombinant Udorn virus results in high attenuation coupled with increased synthesis of IFN-beta (Noah et al., 2003). These data demonstrate that this binding epitope is essential for virus replication. As shown by the structural studies described below, the 184-188 region of the NS1A protein sequence constitutes a subset of the CPSF30 binding epitope, observed in the 3D structure of the complex between NS1A effector domain and F2F3 which is disclosed for the first time in this Disclosure.","Studies with the NS1A proteins of H5N1 viruses established that the Met (M) residue at position 106 is required for functional F2F3\/CPSF30 binding. We showed that the NS1A protein encoded by a pathogenic H5N1 virus that was transmitted to humans in 1997 (A\/HK\/483\/97; HK97) lacks a binding epitope for CPSF30, whereas the NS1A protein encoded by a pathogenic 2004 H5N1 virus (A\/Vietnam\/1203\/04; VN04) has acquired this binding epitope. We were able to generate a CPSF30 binding epitope in the HK97 NS1A protein by changing two of its amino acids to the corresponding amino acids in the VN04 NS1A protein, specifically by changing I at position 106 to M and L at 103 to F. To determine the effects of these two amino acid changes in the HK97 NS1A protein during virus infection, a recombinant Udorn virus was generated in which the Udorn NS gene was replaced by a HK97 NS gene encoding a NS1A protein with these two mutations (Ud\/dmHK97 recombinant). The recombinant virus was then compared to the recombinant Ud virus containing the wild-type HK97 NS gene (Ud\/HK97 recombinant). During multiple cycle growth the rate of replication and virus yield of the Ud\/dmHK97 recombinant was 100-fold greater than with the Ud\/HK97 recombinant virus (), and is thus similar to the Udorn parent virus. During single-cycle growth, the Ud\/HK97 virus induced a high level of IFN-beta mRNA production, which was almost completely suppressed in the cells infected by the Ud\/dmHK97 virus (). Most importantly, the replication of the Ud\/dmHK97 virus was inhibited in F2F3-expressing cells (data not shown), indicating that the dmHK97 NS1A protein binds F2F3 in infected cells. The roles of Phe at 103 and the Met at 106 in the NS1A protein in forming the F2F3\/CPSF30 complex is elucidated by the herein disclosed X-ray crystal structure of the NS1A:F2F3 complex, which reveals that amino acids 103 and 106 are required for CPSF30 binding because their hydrophobic interactions stabilize a tetrameric structure of the NS1A:F2F3 complex (see below). It should also be emphasized that essentially all (>98%) of the influenza A viruses (H3N2, H2N2 and H1N1) that have been isolated from humans, including the 1918 H1N1 virus, and include M and F at positions 106 and 103 in their NS1A proteins, respectively, indicating that these two amino acids, which are critical for CPSF30 binding and the resulting suppression of the production of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, are conserved in human influenza A viruses. Accordingly, the tetrameric complex described in this disclosure is anticipated to be critical for the CSPF30 binding function of all such human influenza A viruses.","Novel Reagents and Structural Data. To further delineate the interface between F2F3 of CPSF30 and the NS1A protein the inventors determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the tetrameric F2F3:NS1A complex. Ninety (90) different constructs (Table 2) were screened in order to find constructs suitable for crystallization and NMR analysis. These variants, summarized in Tables 3 and 4, included 8-11 different full-length or subsequences of NS1A with N-terminal (N-His) and C-terminal (C-His) affinity purification tags, prepared as described in Acton et al., 2005 from influenza A strains A\/South Carolina\/1\/181918 (the 1918 pandemic virus H1N1 strain), HK97 (A\/HK\/483\/97, 1997 Hong Kong), VN04 (A\/Vietnam\/1203\/04, 2005 Vietnam), and Udorn (A\/Udorn\/72), respectively. These were assessed in terms of expression level and solubility (Tables 3 and 4), ability to purify, and biophysical properties, including 2D N-H heteronuclear single quantum coherence correlation spectroscopy (HSQC). Many of these reagents, disclosed for the first time here, are useful for influenza A research purposes and for structural studies. The inventors focused on two specific constructs that provide particularly high expression and solubility, making them especially useful for biochemical and biophysical studies: the C-terminal hexaHis-tagged 85-215 amino acid fragments of the NS1A proteins from (i) influenza A\/Udorn\/72 (A\/Udorn) and (ii) the H5N1 strain A\/Vietnam\/1203\/04 (A\/VN04). These highly soluble constructs can be produced in tens of milligram per liter quantities, and have been produced with SeMet labeling, for crystallography, and with N-enrichment for NMR studies. Excellent quality HSQC NMR spectra can be obtained for these two constructs in the pH range 5.5 to 6.5 (). Under these conditions, these constructs are of sufficiently good quality to indicate high feasibility for further NMR studies. They are also useful for small molecule screening studies. In addition, the F2F3 fragment of CPSF30 has been cloned into a pET expression vector with a N-terminal hexaHis tag (tag sequences are defined in Acton et al., 2005), produced with uniform C, N enrichment, and complete backbone and sidechain resonance assignments have been determined using standard triple resonance NMR methods (Montelione et al., 1999). These NMR-optimized sample conditions and resonance assignments are useful for small molecule screening, lead optimization, and structure-function studies of F2F3:NS1A interactions.","Because virus studies have used influenza A\/Udorn\/72 virus to identify CPSF30 binding activity during virus infection CPSF30 (Li et al., 2001; Noah et al., 2003), we have developed an assay for the binding of the NS1A Udorn effector domain to the F2F3 fragment of CPSF30 in vitro, using analytical gel filtration with detection of effluent by simultaneous refractive index and static light scattering measurements. The chromatography system used for this assay is described in Acton et al., 2005, in which it is used for other applications. In these studies, illustrated in , the NS1A Udorn (85-215) construct elutes as a dimer, with molecular weight of \u02dc30 kDa. When this effector domain construct is first mixed with the 8.5 kDa F3F3 fragment, the resulting complex elutes with a molecular weight of \u02dc50 kDa, indicating a stoichiometry of 2 F2F3:2 NS1A effector domains. This gel filtration assay provides a convenient qualitative measure of F2F3 binding by NS1A effector domains.","Suitable samples of NS1A Udorn (85-215); the NS1A-Udorn(85-215):F2F3 complex, and other constructs listed in Table 2 and their complexes with F2F3 and CPSF30-derived constructs, can be produced and assessed using this gel filtration assay. These can then be crystallized for X-ray crystallographic analysis. Initial crystals of the NS1A-Udorn(85-215):F2F3 complex were obtained by high-throughput robotic screening using service facilities available through the Hauptman Woodward Res. Inst. (Buffalo N.Y.) (Luft et al., 2003; Acton et al., 2005). Crystallization optimization was then carried out for the NS1A-Udorn(85-215):F2F3 complex at Rutgers, yielding diffraction quality bi-pyramid crystal of size 0.15\u00d70.15\u00d70.25 mm. Conditions providing crystals, and a description of these crystals, are presented herein below. Three-wavelength Se-Met multiple anomalous diffraction (MAD) (2.3 \u212b resolution) and a complete native (1.95 \u212b resolution) data sets were collected at X25 beam line at Brookhaven National Laboratories. The structure was solved by MAD techniques (Hendrickson, 1991) and refined to 1.95 \u212b resolution, and is currently refined to a R factor of 0.225 and R free of 0.245, respectively.","Crystallization of NS1A Udorn (85-215):F2F3 Complex. Initial crystallization conditions for NS1A Udorn (85-215):F2F3 complex were obtained by using robotic crystallization facility at the Buffalo facility described above. The most promising condition use 1.77 M potassium nitrate (KNO) at pH 5.0 as precipitant. This initial crystallization condition was optimized manually at Rutgers. Good quality crystals were obtained using 0.25-1.0 M KNOand 10-20% sucrose\/glucose as precipitant at pH 5-6. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained when P94S mutant F2F3 was used in the complex, though similar conditions are expected to provide crystals of the complex with the wild-type (P94) F2F3 sequence. The NS1A Udorn (85-215):F2F3 complex was crystallized with the symmetry of the space group P4with cell parameters a=b=50.96, c=205.39 \u212b and \u03b1=\u03b2=\u03b3=90\u00b0.

However, while Met 106\/Met106\u2032 are at the core of the tetrameric complex, they are not part of the primary F2F3\/CPSF30 binding pocket.  illustrates the F2F3 binding pocket on the surface the Udorn NS1A effector domain. Specific interactions in this primary binding pocket involve residues K110, I117, I119, Q121, V180, G183, G184, and W187 of NS1A and residues F97, F98, F103, and K110 of the F3 finger of CPSF30. It should be noted that these residues include not only amino acids in, or adjacent to, the 184-188 sequence previously identified as part of the CPSF30 binding epitope by mutagenesis studies, but also amino acids in other regions in the NS1A protein not previously recognized to be essential for CPSF30 binding. Mutation of residues G183 or G184 in NS1A(85-215) each to Arg or Asp disrupts or reduces F2F2 binding affinity and\/or tetramer formation, based on analytical gel filtration measurements without significantly disrupting the native structure of NS1A(85-215) indicated by N-H HSQC NMR spectra (data not shown), demonstrating a functional role of these sites within the CPSF30 binding epitope of NS1A. Recombinant Udorn viruses encoding NS1A proteins in which either G184 or W187 was changed to Arg are attenuated (data not shown), further demonstrating that these amino acids are required for virus replication. The eight residues in the CPSF30-binding epitope of NS1A () are almost 100% conserved amongst influenza A viruses isolated from humans (Macken et al., 2001), except for Ile117 which is frequently replaced by Met. Based on this structure, disclosed for the first time here, we propose disruption of 2NS1A:2F2F3 tetramerization as a strategy to inhibit influenza A virus in human. Based on our structural data, we further propose that a small molecule inhibitor that binds tightly to the above described conserved epitope and surrounding regions will disrupt CPSF30 binding and will inhibit influenza A virus in humans. This pocket on the surface of the NS1A effector domain is the target of our proposed drug discovery process.","Table 1 describes some of the specific location of the epitopes described herein as the tetramerization, RNA binding and CPSF30 binding epitopes of NS1A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Tetramerization, RNA binding and CPSF30 binding epitopes of NS1A."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["NS1A","Interacting",{}]},{"entry":["amino","amino acids ",{}]},{"entry":["acids","of F2F3","Remark"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["F103","L72, Y88,","F103 contributes to both the tetramer interface and the CPSF30-"]},{"entry":[{},"M93, P111","binding epitope F103 interacts with F2 and F3 domains of CPSF30,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"may play a role in defining angle between F2 and F3 appropriately;"]},{"entry":[{},{},"mutation of 103 could affect an intermolecular salt bridge between R73"]},{"entry":[{},{},"and D125."]},{"entry":["L105","P111, F112, ","L105 contributes to both the tetramer interface and the CPSF30-"]},{"entry":[{},"M124 ","binding epitope Adjacent to F103 and also interacting at the tetramer"]},{"entry":[{},"(NS1A-2)","interface with a 2NS1A molecule."]},{"entry":["M106","N107","M106 contributes to both the tetramer interface and the CPSF30-"]},{"entry":[{},{},"binding epitope.

This PR8 influenza strain is adapted for passage in mouse, presumably as a result of mouse adaptation, the PR8 NS gene attenuates virus growth in mammalian cells in tissue culture (Ozaki et al, 2004). The PR8 NS1A protein does not bind F2F3 because it lacks the consensus human sequence at positions 106 (I instead of M) and 103 (S instead of F) (Macken et al, 2001), therefore we can determine if the attenuation of growth in mammalian cells is caused primarily by the changed amino acids at positions 106 and 103 in the PR8 NS1A protein (data not shown). The absence of a CPSF30 binding epitope in the PR8 NS1A protein presumably resulted from the large number of passages in mice that have adapted the virus for replication in mice. Consequently, the 3D structure of effector domain of the PR8 NS1A protein (Bornholdt and Prasad, 2006) is not suitable for structure-based drug discovery efforts. In addition, its structure may differ from that of a NS1A protein containing a functional CPSF30 binding epitope. Indeed, the 3D structures of the Udorn effector domain monomers in our complex are similar to, but not identical with, the structure of the monomers of the PR8 NS1A effector domain structure (). The PR8 NS1A structure does not have a F2F3-binding epitope like that observed in the 3D structure of the Udorn NS1A structure described herein. In particular, the PR8 NS1A structures lack the hydrophobic pocket that binds F2F3 in the NS1A:F2F3 complex. Moreover, the dimeric interface in crystal structure of the PR8 NS1A effector domain has an intermolecular beta-sheet interaction () that is completely different from the interface in the crystal structure of the Udorn NS1A effector domain bound to F2F3. Therefore, the dimer of the effector domain of the PR8 NS1A protein is not relevant for the binding of CPSF 30 and to our proposed drug-design strategy.","Fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. Fluorescence polarization (FP) is a spectroscopic method that measures the rotational rate of a sample in solution. It applies polarized light to excite a fluorophore and measures the polarization characteristics of the emitted light (Nasir and Jolley, 1999; Roehrl et al., 2004b). If the sample tumbles slowly compared to the lifetime of the fluorescence, the emitted light retains some of the incident polarization. However, if the sample tumbles fast, the emitted light is isotropic. Therefore, the degree of anisotropy (polarization) of the fluorescent light emitted from a sample provides a measure of the fluorophore's rotational correlation time in the bound state. Given appropriate bound-state lifetimes, rotational correlation times, and changes in rotational correlation upon complex formation, FP assays can be used to measure binding affinities and to screen for binding inhibitors (Schade et al., 1996; Seethala and Menzel, 1998; Roehrl et al., 2004a).","FP with fluorescently-labeled F2F3. A FP assay of F2F3 binding by NS1A is being implemented. As mentioned above, complex formation between F2F3 and various effector domain constructs is observed in gel filtration studies (see ), indicating a dissociation constant Ktighter than low micromolar. These data of  demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a FP assay for detecting NS1A:F2F3 binding. Moreover, excellent HSQC spectra and essentially complete NMR resonance assignments are available for the F2F3 construct (data not shown); these will be used to assess the native structural integrity of fluorescently-labeled CPSF30 fragments.","In one embodiment of the invention, we will generate a fluorescein (or other fluorophore)\u2014labeled F2F3 (Fluo-F2F3) substrate for FP assay. The F2F3 sequence of human CPSF30 contains 7 Lys and 6 Cys residues, and fluorophore labeling requires careful consideration to ensure proper folding with Zn ligation by these six Cys residues. Two primary strategies will be pursued for labeling F2F3: (i) chemical synthesis with a fluorophore label and (ii) synthesis or biosynthesis of an analog suitable for specific labeling. The 61-residue F2F3 is sufficiently short to allow fluorophore labeling by solid phase peptide synthesis (for example, by a commercial supplier, such as New England Peptide, Inc. Gardner, Mass.). The crystal structure of F2F3 bound to the NS1A effector domain indicates that the N-terminal region is not involved in key binding interactions, and suggests that it may be possible to generate shorter constructs with similar binding affinities. Those constructs that show tight binding can be synthesized in 100 mg amounts and assayed for structural integrity by N-H HSQC NMR analysis at natural isotopic abundance using a 800 MHz NMR system with cryoprobe.","If for some reason this approach is not successful, fluorophone-labeled F2F3 will be produced by overexpression with a \u2018flash\u2019 peptide sequence tag (Griffin et al., 1998; Griffin et al., 2000; Abrams, 2002). When the tetra-cysteine tag [NH-Cys-Cys-Pro-Gly-Cys-Cys . . . ] is incorporated into proteins\/peptides it can be specifically conjugated to a biarsenyl-fluorophore ligand (sold by Invitrogen as their Lumio-technology). The modification can even specifically label the tetra-cysteine tag in vivo (Griffin et al., 2000), and thus should not react with any of the six cysteine residues on F2F3. If even both of these approaches prove to be problematic for this tandem Zn-finger domain, alternative strategies for fluorophore labeling are available, such as the method of Ting and colleagues (Chen and Ting, 2005) that utilizes biotin ligase together with appropriate cofactors to introduce fluorescein in a short N-terminal acceptor peptide lacking any Cys residues, allowing the fluorophore to be introduced subsequent to forming the Zn fingers.","Using any of the above labeling approaches, or other possible approaches, the labeled F2F3 can then be folded with Zn ligation using the same protocol we have developed for unlabeled F2F3. In exploring each of these approaches, we will verify that the fluorophore in the N-terminal tag becomes sufficiently immobilized in the complex to provide a significant change in fluorescence anisotropy. If required, a more immobilized Cys residue within the F2F3 sequence with be introduced without interfering with Zn-finger formation, using our 3D structure of the NS1A (85-215):F2F3 complex as a guide. Using one of these labeling routes, or any approach for introducing the fluorescence tag, the resulting FP assay will be validated by measuring competition with unlabeled F2F3.","The crystal structure of the complex between NS1A Udorn(85-215) and the F2F3 CPSF30 reveals that most of the intermolecular interactions between NS1A and F2F3 involve the F3 Zn-finger domain (). Accordingly, a smaller flourescein-labeled F3 finger (Fluo-F3), with \u02dc4 kDa molecular weight, may have preferential properties in developing a FP assay. Though the binding of the NS1A effector domain to Fluo-F3 is likely to be somewhat weaker than the binding to F2F3, the change in rotational correlation time, and thus the signal-to-noise of the FP assay, will be significantly higher using Fluo-F3 than using Fluo-F2F3. These design principles may be advantageous in development of a high throughput FP assay useful in screening for inhibitors of CPSF30 (or variants, mutants, or fragments thereof) binding to NS1A (or variants, mutants, or fragments thereof).","The crystal structure of the complex between NS1A Udorn (85-215) and the F2F3 fragment further suggests that a tandem repeat of the F2F3 fragment, connected by a short flexible linker, F2F3-F2F3, could also bind in a manner similar to the two independent F2F3 molecules, though potentially with much tighter binding affinity. Accordingly, we will generate a variety of F2F3-F2F3 constructs, as outlined below, assay their binding, and assess the oligomerization states of these complexes by gel filtration with light scattering detection. If indeed a tandem repeat F2F3-F2F3 construct can be generated with even tighter binding than F2F3 itself, it will be used in a more sensitive FP assay, capable of detecting only more tightly-binding inhibitors.","The magnitude of the change in fluorescence anisotropy, which determines the signal-to-noise of the FP assay, depends on the change in rotational correlation time of the fluorophore upon complex formation. If required to enhance this change in rotational correlation time, the relative size of the NS1A component of NS1A:CSPF30 (or fragments thereof) complexes described above can be further increased by expression as a larger fusion protein (e.g., fused to maltose binding protein), or by attachment to beads or microscopic particles using, for example, already available constructs of Tables 2, 3, and 4 with either N- or C-terminal hexHis tags, or using other affinity tags.","The crystal structure of the complex between NS1A Udorn (85-215) and the F2F3 fragment was examined to identify potential linking sites so that the C-terminus of one segment of F2F3 (or portion thereof) would have a favorable path for linking to the N-terminus of the second segment. Considerations for favorable linking geometry include the distance between termini to be linked, the path the linker would need to take, and linker composition and length. A common peptide linker composition used for connecting domains in engineered proteins is some combination of Gly and Ser residues, allowing for conformational flexibility and solubility while remaining somewhat neutral in chemical content, e.g. -Gly-Ser-, or -Gly-Ser-Gly, etc.","Constructs were designed based on the crystal structure of the influenza virus NS1A-CTD protein complex with the F2F3 fragment from the human CPSF30 protein, disclosed for this first time in this Disclosure. The expectation is that a single-chain construct of the F2F3 binding regions observed in the crystal structure would bind more tightly to the NS1A dimer than the separate domains, and might have significant antiviral activity.","The structure was examined to identify potential linking sites so that the C-terminus of one segment of F2F3 (or portion thereof) would have a favorable path for linking to the N-terminus of the second segment.

A common peptide linker composition used for connecting domains in engineered proteins is some combination of Gly and Ser residues, allowing for conformational flexibility and solubility while remaining somewhat neutral in chemical content, e.g. -Gly-Ser-, or -Gly-Ser-Gly, etc.","The sequence of CPSF30 F2F3 used for the specific designs is that used in the crystal structure determination, but amino acid replacements can be considered. The N-terminal portion might include a hexa-His or other tag for convenient purification; alternatively a tag might be encoded at the C-terminus of the construct. Other purification tags may be preferable to oligo-His owing to potential interference with the chelation of zinc ions by the F2 and F3 \u201cZn finger\u201d segments, which is required for the integrity of the three-dimensional structure and for effective binding to NS1A. In all of these F2F3 sequences, residue Pro92 may be substituted by Ser. The constructs involving single F3 domains (\u201cone finger\u201d) as opposed to F2F3 domains (\u201ctwo fingers\u201d) are potentially valuable as minimal\/miniature versions because the interaction between separate F2F3 chains in the dimer (chains F2F3-A and F2F3-B) is mediated entirely by residues in F3 and does not involve any residues from F2. The F3 domain itself, or variants, could be used as an antiviral drug.","Relatively few of the residues in F2 make important interactions with the NS1A protein in the dimer of dimers; notable exceptions are Leu72 and Arg73, whose side chains interact extensively with NS1A. The Leu72 and Arg73 interactions could be maintained by a strategic linkage of a Leu-Arg or Arg-Leu peptide to Thr91 (proposed N-terminus of the F3 domain construct). L72-T91 distance is 14.2 \u212b; R73-T91 distance is 17.6 \u212b.

The sample preparation and structural characterization of NS1A effector domains from multiple influenza strains, allow the use of both NMR and X-ray crystallography in hit validation, lead compound optimization, and drug discovery.","Crystallography for lead optimization. X-ray analysis has historically been very important to structure-based inhibitor design. Compounds identified as inhibitor \u201chits\u201d by kinetic assays can be used to form complexes with the target protein. X-ray analysis will reveal the mode of inhibitor binding and act as a basis for further inhibitor design. Crystal inhibitor complexes can also be formed by soaking inhibitors into preformed crystals, or complexes may be grown by co-crystallization. The latter case may be necessary if the complex triggers conformational changes. In either case, diffraction data is collected on a rotating anode source, processed, and converted to electron density maps. The orientation and occupancy of the inhibitors will be observed and compared with binding modes predicted from virtual screening or models from earlier design cycles. In this way, inhibitors analyzed in one cycle of design will feed into subsequent rounds of structural analysis and re-design in the general process of structure-based drug design (Kuhn 2002; Scapin 2006)","Cocrystallization and Crystal soaks. Using crystallization conditions that we have already optimized for the NS1A effector domains, described above, cocrystallizations and crystal soaks can be carried out with lead compounds identified in our high throughput screening efforts. Trials will be carried out to crystallize NS1A effector domain:lead compound complexes. Diffraction data can be collected using either home or synchrotron X-ray sources and the resulting difference electron density maps and 3D structures can be used to characterize small molecule binding epitopes and bound-state conformations. These data can be used screening for lead compounds either one at a time or in high throughput format, lead compound validation, and optimization of lead compounds, using methods familiar to a person skilled in the art.","NMR for lead identification optimization. NMR is also a powerful method for validating intermolecular interactions, and is used extensively in commercial pharmaceutical drug discovery efforts to identify lead compounds and their protein binding sites (Shuker et al., 1996; Hajduk et al., 1997; Moore, 1999a, 1999b; Muegge et al., 1999; Moy et al., 2001; Powers, 2002; Lepre et al., 2004; Rush and Powers, 2004; Mercier et al., 2006; Petros et al., 2006). NMR chemical shift perturbations, of either the protein or the ligand, can be used for screening for small molecule lead compounds, validating initial small molecule hits identified with htp or virtual screening assays, locating the corresponding binding site in the 3D protein structure, and to guide rational lead optimization. NMR methods uniquely complement crystallography studies. Strengths of NMR analysis methods include (i) the ability to detect even weak (Kup to \u02dc500 micromolar) binding interactions, (ii) compatibility with systems that undergo structural changes upon ligand binding which may not be accommodated by a crystalline lattice, (iii) the ability to adjust solvent conditions over a wide range, and (iv) high sensitivity and very low sample requirements.","Using NS1A effector domain constructs that have already been shown to provide high quality HSQC spectra (e.g., ), NMR chemical shift perturbation can be used to validate initial small molecule hits identified with high-throughput (htp) or virtual screening assays, locating the corresponding binding site in the 3D protein structure, and for rational lead optimization. Hits identified in htp FP assays will be characterized by assessing perturbations in HSQC spectra for which resonance assignments will be available, and interpreting these effects on the available 3D structures of NS1 effector domains. Some methods suitable for lead compound screening, identification, and optimization envisioned for use with our invention are summarized in C. A. Lepre, J. M, Moore, and J. W. Peng, Theory and Applications of NMR-based Screening in Pharmaceutical Research (Chem. Rev. 104, 3641-3675 (2004)), which is incorporated herein by reference. The NMR infrastructure required for such work are available at most large research institutions, including by not limited to Rutgers University, and include 5 mm 600 and 800 MHz NMR cryoprobe systems, as well as a 1 mm 600 MHz NMR equipped with an automated sample changer. The cryoprobes enable recording of high-quality HSQC data using 150 microliter samples at protein concentrations as low as 10 micromolar, and the 1 mm NMR probe provides high quality HSQC data on 7 microliter samples at 100 micromolar concentrations. Such NMR technologies allow NMR screening for lead compound optimization with as little as \u02dc500 nanomoles of each sample. Where appropriate, the 3D structures of tightly bound small molecule lead compounds may also be determined by NMR methods if they cannot be solved by crystallographic methods. These data will be used in redesign and lead optimization as outlined for crystallographic data above.","Expressed soluble constructs of NS1A outlined in Tables 2, 3 and 4, or their variants, can also be used to screen for small molecule lead compounds using NMR detection of resonances of the small molecule, using limits described by (but not limited to) C. A. Lepre, J. M, Moore, and J. W. Peng, Theory and Applications of NMR-based Screening in Pharmaceutical Research (Chem. Rev. 104, 3641-3675 (2004)).","Where appropriate, the 3D structures of tightly bound small molecule lead compounds may also be determined by NMR methods if they cannot be solved by crystallographic methods. These data will be used in redesign and lead optimization using synthetic chemistry, as outlined for crystallographic data above.","Antiviral assays. Having identified inhibitors of the interaction between NS1A and CPSF30, the inhibitors would be tested for their ability to inhibit influenza A virus replication in tissue culture studies. Plaque reduction assays in MDCK cells will be used to assay compounds for their ability to inhibit influenza A virus replication (Twu et al., 2006). Monolayers of MDCK cells will be infected with approximately 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) of influenza A\/Udorn\/72 virus, and after virus adsorption the cells will be overlaid with agar containing a concentration of a compound ranging from 0.001 micrograms\/ml to 10 micrograms\/ml. Plaques will be counted in duplicate plates and compared to the number of plaques in controls not exposed to the chemical. In parallel cytotoxicity evaluations of lead compounds would be carried out on MDCK cells using the Roche reagent WST-1 (Berridge et al., 2005). The rate of WST-1 cleavage by mitochondrial dehydrogenases, yielding a product with absorbance at 450 nm, correlates with the number of viable cells. These assays will be carried out in 96-well tissue culture plates, and cell viability will be assayed by determining absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Once the most promising lead compounds with low cytotoxicity in both MDCK and human (A549) cells have been identified, we will determine the effect of several concentrations of the compounds on the rate and extent of virus replication during multiple-cycle growth in MDCK cells. The compounds with the greatest inhibitory activity at the lowest concentrations will be used for subsequent studies in a suitable animal model (ferrets).","Applications of NS1A:CPSF30 Inhibitors. These inhibitors can be developed into antiviral drugs that will be effective in the control of influenza virus epidemics and pandemics in humans. Because there is the potential for such epidemics to be man-made, i.e., using influenza A virus as a bioterrorist weapon, such antivirals would also be crucial in this situation. Influenza antiviral drugs will also be important for the control of influenza A infections in commercial poultry stocks, such as chickens.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0130"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

Attenuated Influenza Virus Strains Suitable for Avian and Human Influenza Vaccine Development. The structural information disclosed here can be combined with site-directed mutagenesis data for NS1A to engineer attenuated influenza A virus strains suitable for use as live attenuated vaccines in humans and livestock. Multiple, weakly attenuating mutations will be created in the CPSF30 and dsRNA-binding epitopes to generate NS1 proteins with reduced binding affinity in vitro. The effects of these mutations on the structural integrity of NS1A variants can be assessed with HSQC NMR data and\/or crystallization and X-ray crystallography. These data will then be used to engineer viral strains of influenza A with various degrees of attenuation. These viral strains will be engineered to contain multiple base changes to minimize the potential of the virus to revert to virulence. Such influenza A viruses would be attenuated in normal cells, and in humans and animals, but would not be attenuated in cells lacking interferon genes (e.g. cell culture Vero cells), thereby enabling the production of large amounts of these attenuated viruses suitable for use as a live virus vaccine.","Methods for development of attenuated flu vaccines are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/737,742, \u201cNovel Compositions and Vaccines Against Influenza and Influenza B Infections,\u201d, and PTC Patent Application Filed Nov. 17, 2006 \u201cNovel Compositions and Vaccines Against Influenza and Influenza B Infections,\u201d relevant portions and tables incorporated herein by reference, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference.","A person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of nucleic acid sequences can be generated in accordance with this invention. The production of the viruses of the instant invention (or the respective recombinant NS1A protein or respective NS1B protein comprising said amino acid sequences) can be achieved by recombinant DNA technology. Nucleic acid sequences encoding the amino acid sequences of the instant invention can be produced using methods well known in the art, including, for example, chemical synthesis, PCR and site-directed mutagenesis.","The instant invention provides recombinant influenza A virus comprising the amino acid sequences which are at least 70% identical but less than 100% identical either to dsRNA binding domains of NS1A. These viruses may be generated, for example, by reverse genetic system, whereby influenza virus can be generated by transfection of multiple DNAs without a helper virus. This technique was described in Fodor et al., 1999. Essentially, in that study the technique involved transfecting into a host cell a combination of plasmids containing cDNAs for the viral RNA segments (including NS1 proteins), proteins of viral RNA dependent polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, and PA), and nucleoprotein. Further, it is possible to transfect host cells (such as, for example 293 cells or Vero cells) with a plasmid encoding a recombinant NS1A protein (for rescuing influenza A viral phenotype) containing the appropriate amino acid sequence of the instant invention. The resulting viruses may be used for creation of vaccines, as described below.","In another embodiment, the virus can be propagated in suitable host, such as, for example, chicken eggs, without a need for transforming a host cell with multiple plasmids. In this embodiment, essentially, clinical isolates of human influenza virus are taken from infected patients and are reassorted in embryonated chicken eggs with laboratory-adapted master strains of high-growth donor viruses.","To prepare the recombinant NS1A viruses for different purposes (including, without limitations, the use of the virus as a vaccine or a part thereof), each of these mutations may be carried out individually on constructs of NS 1A suitable for biochemical characterization, possibly including but not limited to the constructs outlined in Tables 3 and 4. Other variants of NS1A or affinity tags (e.g. FLAG tags) may also be used. These proteins may be purified and characterized with respect to structural integrity by comparing the circular dichroism and\/or NMR spectrum and\/or X-ray crystal structures with those of the corresponding wild-type NS1 construct. The several constructs may then be assayed for dsRNA binding as described elsewhere (Chien et al., 2004), or using other methods of assessing protein-dsRNA binding affinities commonly used for such studies, such as, for example, sedimentation equilibrium, gel electrophoresis, or gel filtration chromatography. These data will be used to assess the effect of single site mutants at these sites revealed by the structural models to be important for dsRNA recognition. Further, sets of double, triple, and quadruple mutants of residues in the CPSF30 binding epitope, tetramer interface, dsRNA binding epitope, and combinations thereof would also be generated in these NS1A constructs and assessed for structural integrity and binding activities in vitro. This experimental design will allow a person of the ordinary skill in the art to identify mutant forms of NS1A and NS1A varients with minimal structural disruption but with reduced CPSF30 and\/or dsRNA binding affinity.","The invention encompasses methods of selecting viruses which have the desired phenotype, i.e., viruses which have low or no dsRNA binding activity, whether obtained from natural variants, spontaneous variants (i.e., variants which evolve during virus propagation), mutagenized natural variants, reassortants and\/or genetically engineered viruses. Such viruses can be best screened in differential growth assays that compare growth in host systems which have attenuated and normal immune response to influenza A viruses. Viruses which demonstrate better growth in the hosts having the attenuated response versus the normal response are selected; preferably, viruses which grow to titers at least one log greater in the host systems with the attenuated response as compared to the host system with the normal response are selected.","The present invention also encompasses methods of growing and isolating mutated viruses having altered dsRNA binding activity in cells and cell lines which naturally exhibit an attenuated response to viral infections as compared to wild-type cells. In a particular preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to methods of growing the viruses of the instant invention in Vero cells.","It is contemplated that any embodiment discussed in this specification can be implemented with respect to any method, kit, reagent, or composition of the invention, and vice versa.
