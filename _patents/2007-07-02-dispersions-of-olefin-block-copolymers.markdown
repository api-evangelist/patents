No. 60\/818,911, filed on Jul. 6, 2006.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates generally to ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin block interpolymers, dispersions of ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin block interpolymers, and products made from the block interpolymers.","2. Background","Aqueous dispersions of a thermoplastic resin of various types are known in the art and have been used in a wide variety of fields. For example, when an aqueous dispersion is coated and dried on a surface of a substrate such as paper, fiber, wood, metal, or plastic molded article, the resin coating formed will provide the substrate with water resistance, oil resistance, chemical resistance, corrosion resistance and heat sealability. An aqueous medium is advantageous compared to an organic dispersion medium in view of common hazards such as flammability, working environment, handling convenience, and the like.","Conventional aqueous dispersions of a thermoplastic resin have been produced either by a process wherein a polymerizable monomer which is the resin raw material is polymerized by emulsion polymerization in an aqueous medium in the presence of a dispersing agent, or by a process wherein a molten thermoplastic resin and an aqueous medium, and optionally, a dispersing agent are mixed by applying shearing force. The former process is associated with the disadvantage of the limited number of the polymerizable monomers that can be used, and hence, the variety of the aqueous dispersions of the thermoplastic resin that can be produced, is limited. The former process also suffers from complicated control of the polymerization reaction as well as intricate equipment. On the other hand, the latter process is applicable to a wide variety of resins in relatively simple equipment.","Coatings and articles produced via aqueous dispersions of typical ethylene copolymers lack the heat resistance and compression set properties needed for many applications. For example, frothed foams made via the frothing and drying of aqueous dispersions of homogeneous ethylene-octene copolymers exhibit the softness required for hygiene and fabric backing applications, but lack the heat resistance required for shipment during the summer months. In addition, coatings and foams to be used in the interior of an automobile typically require heat resistance to at least 60\u00b0 C. In this environment, frothed foams based on homogeneous, low crystallinity ethylene copolymers will not retain mechanical properties such as compression set.","Accordingly, there exists a need for dispersions and foams formed from ethylene and propylene based interpolymers having improved heat resistance and mechanical properties, including compression set.","In one aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a dispersion and methods for forming a dispersion that includes a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer, and at least one dispersing agent, wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer includes at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment.","In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a polyolefin froth foam, formed from a dispersion that includes a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer, and at least one dispersing agent, wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer includes at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment.","In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a cellulose-based article, especially having a specific volume of less than 3 cc\/gm, that includes a cellulose-based composition; and an applied compound, wherein the applied compound, at the time of application, includes a dispersion formed of a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer, and at least one dispersing agent, wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer includes at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment wherein the cellulose-based article has at least one of a water resistance value of less than about 10 g\/m\/120 seconds as measured via the Cobb test and an oil and grease resistance value of at least 9 as measured using the Kit test at an exposure time of 15 seconds.","In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to an article formed by a process that includes impregnating a fibrous structure with a compound, the compound including a dispersion, the dispersion formed from a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer; and at least one dispersing agent, wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer includes at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment; and removing at least a portion of the water from the impregnated fibrous structure.","In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a toner composition including a dispersion, the dispersion including a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer, and at least one dispersing agent, wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer includes at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment; and at least one selected from the group consisting of a colorant and a magnetic pigment, wherein the dispersion has an average volume diameter particle size from about 0.3 to about 8.0 microns.","In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a method for forming a heat sealable coating on a substrate including applying a dispersion to a substrate, the dispersion including a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer; at least one dispersing agent; wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer includes at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment and removing at least a portion of a liquid in the dispersion to form a first layer.","In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a method to make a long fiber concentrate that includes fibers and a thermoplastic resin that involves the steps of: coating continuous fibers with a dispersion, wherein the dispersion includes a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer, at least one dispersing agent, wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer includes at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment to form thermoplastic coated continuous fiber strands, heating the thermoplastic coated continuous fiber strands, chopping the dried thermoplastic coated continuous fiber strands forming dried long fiber concentrate pellets, and isolating dried long fiber concentrate pellets.","In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a method to make a long fiber concentrate including fibers and a thermoplastic resin involving the steps of coating chopped long fibers with a dispersion wherein the dispersion includes a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer; at least one dispersing agent; wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer includes at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment to form thermoplastic coated chopped fiber pellets, heating the coated chopped long fiber concentrate pellets, and isolating dried long fiber concentrate pellets.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.","In one aspect, embodiments of the invention relate to an aqueous dispersion having a base polymeric component.

The copolymers may be further characterized as having both a polydisperse block distribution and a polydisperse distribution of block sizes and possessing a most probable distribution of block lengths. Preferred multi-block copolymers are those containing 4 or more blocks or segments including terminal blocks. More preferably, the copolymers include at least 5, 10 or 20 blocks or segments including terminal blocks.","In addition, the block interpolymers may have additional characteristics or properties. In one aspect, the interpolymers, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more co-polymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, are characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, the block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40\u00b0 C. and 130\u00b0 C. when fractionated using TREF, characterized in that the fraction has a molar comonomer content higher, at least 5 percent higher in some embodiments, at least 10 percent higher in other embodiments, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein the comparable random ethylene interpolymer comprises the same comonomer(s), and has a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. The Mw\/Mn of the comparable interpolymer may also be within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and\/or the comparable interpolymer may have total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer.","Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance (\u201cNMR\u201d) spectroscopy preferred. Moreover, for polymers or blends of polymers having relatively broad TREF curves, the polymer is first fractionated using TREF into fractions each having an eluted temperature range of 10\u00b0 C. or less. That is, each eluted fraction has a collection temperature window of 10\u00b0 C. or less. Using this technique, the block interpolymers have at least one such fraction having a higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding fraction of the comparable interpolymer.","In another aspect, the interpolymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more co-polymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks (i.e., at least two blocks) or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, the block interpolymer having a peak (but not just a molecular fraction) which elutes between 40\u00b0 C. and 130\u00b0 C.

The Mw\/Mn of the comparable interpolymer may also be within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and\/or the comparable interpolymer may have a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. The full width\/half maximum (FWHM) calculation is based on the ratio of methyl to methylene response area [CH\/CH] from the ATREF infra-red detector, wherein the tallest (highest) peak is identified from the base line, and then the FWHM area is determined. For a distribution measured using an ATREF peak, the FWHM area is defined as the area under the curve between Tand T, where Tand Tare points determined, to the left and right of the ATREF peak, by dividing the peak height by two, and then drawing a line horizontal to the base line, that intersects the left and right portions of the ATREF curve. A calibration curve for comonomer content is made using random ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin copolymers, plotting comonomer content from NMR versus FWHM area ratio of the TREF peak. For this infra-red method, the calibration curve is generated for the same comonomer type of interest. The comonomer content of TREF peak of the multi-block interpolymer may be determined by referencing this calibration curve using its FWHM methyl:methylene area ratio [CH\/CH] of the TREF peak.","Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy preferred. Using this technique, the blocked interpolymers have higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding comparable interpolymer.","In some embodiments, for interpolymers of ethylene and 1-octene, the block interpolymer may have a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 and 130\u00b0 C. greater than or equal to the quantity (\u22120.2013)*T+20.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in \u00b0 C.

That is, the catalysts are chemically distinct. Under continuous solution polymerization conditions, the process is ideally suited for polymerization of mixtures of monomers at high monomer conversions. Under these polymerization conditions, shuttling from the chain shuttling agent to the catalyst becomes advantaged compared to chain growth, and multi-block copolymers, especially linear multi-block copolymers are formed in high efficiency.","The interpolymers disclosed herein may be differentiated from conventional, random copolymers, physical blends of polymers, and block copolymers prepared via sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, and anionic or cationic living polymerization techniques. In particular, compared to a random copolymer of the same monomers and monomer content at equivalent crystallinity or modulus, the interpolymers have better (higher) heat resistance as measured by melting point, higher TMA penetration temperature, higher high-temperature tensile strength, and\/or higher high-temperature torsion storage modulus as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Compared to a random copolymer containing the same monomers and monomer content, the interpolymers have lower compression set, particularly at elevated temperatures, lower stress relaxation, higher creep resistance, higher tear strength, higher blocking resistance, faster setup due to higher crystallization (solidification) temperature, higher recovery (particularly at elevated temperatures), better abrasion resistance, higher retractive force, and better oil and filler acceptance.","The interpolymers may also exhibit a unique crystallization and branching distribution relationship. That is, the interpolymers have a relatively large difference between the tallest peak temperature measured using CRYSTAF and DSC as a function of heat of fusion, especially as compared to random copolymers containing the same monomers and monomer level or physical blends of polymers, such as a blend of a high density polymer and a lower density copolymer, at equivalent overall density. It is believed that this unique feature of the interpolymers is due to the unique distribution of the comonomer in blocks within the polymer backbone. In particular, the interpolymers may comprise alternating blocks of differing comonomer content (including homopolymer blocks). The interpolymers may also comprise a distribution in number and\/or block size of polymer blocks of differing density or comonomer content, which is a Schultz-Flory type of distribution. In addition, the interpolymers also have a unique peak melting point and crystallization temperature profile that is substantially independent of polymer density, modulus, and morphology. In some embodiments, the microcrystalline order of the polymers demonstrates characteristic spherulites and lamellae that are distinguishable from random or block copolymers, even at PDI values that are less than 1.7, or even less than 1.5, down to less than 1.3.","Moreover, the interpolymers may be prepared using techniques to influence the degree or level of blockiness. That is the amount of comonomer and length of each polymer block or segment may be altered by controlling the ratio and type of catalysts and shuttling agent as well as the temperature of the polymerization, and other polymerization variables. A surprising benefit of this phenomenon is the discovery that as the degree of blockiness is increased, the optical properties, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties of the resulting polymer are improved. In particular, haze decreases while clarity, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties increase as the average number of blocks in the polymer increases. By selecting shuttling agents and catalyst combinations having the desired chain transferring ability (high rates of shuttling with low levels of chain termination) other forms of polymer termination are effectively suppressed. Accordingly, little if any \u03b2-hydride elimination is observed in the polymerization of ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin comonomer mixtures, and the resulting crystalline blocks are highly, or substantially completely, linear, possessing little or no long chain branching.","Polymers with highly crystalline chain ends may be selectively prepared. In elastomer applications, reducing the relative quantity of polymer that terminates with an amorphous block reduces the intermolecular dilutive effect on crystalline regions. This result may be obtained by choosing chain shuttling agents and catalysts having an appropriate response to hydrogen or other chain terminating agents. Specifically, if the catalyst which produces highly crystalline polymer is more susceptible to chain termination (such as by use of hydrogen) than the catalyst responsible for producing the less crystalline polymer segment (such as through higher comonomer incorporation, regio-error, or atactic polymer formation), then the highly crystalline polymer segments will preferentially populate the terminal portions of the polymer. Not only are the resulting terminated groups crystalline, but upon termination, the highly crystalline polymer forming catalyst site is once again available for re-initiation of polymer formation. The initially formed polymer is therefore another highly crystalline polymer segment. Accordingly, both ends of the resulting multi-block copolymer are preferentially highly crystalline.","The ethylene \u03b1-olefin interpolymers used in the embodiments of the invention may be interpolymers of ethylene with at least one C-C\u03b1-olefin. The interpolymers may further comprise C-Cdiolefin and\/or alkenylbenzene. Suitable unsaturated comonomers useful for polymerizing with ethylene include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, conjugated or non-conjugated dienes, polyenes, alkenylbenzenes, etc. Examples of such comonomers include C-C\u03b1-olefins such as propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and the like. 1-Butene and 1-octene are especially preferred. Other suitable monomers include styrene, halo- or alkyl-substituted styrenes, vinylbenzocyclobutane, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, and naphthenics (e.g., cyclopentene, cyclohexene and cyclooctene).","Other ethylene\/olefin polymers may also be used. Olefins as used herein refer to a family of unsaturated hydrocarbon-based compounds with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Depending on the selection of catalysts, any olefin may be used in embodiments of the invention. Suitable olefins include C-Caliphatic and aromatic compounds containing vinylic unsaturation, as well as cyclic compounds, such as cyclobutene, cyclopentene, dicyclopentadiene, and norbornene, including but not limited to, norbornene substituted in the 5 and 6 position with C-Chydrocarbyl or cyclohydrocarbyl groups. Also included are mixtures of such olefins as well as mixtures of such olefins with C-Cdiolefin compounds.","Examples of olefin monomers include, but are not limited to propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene, 1-eicosene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 4,6-dimethyl-1-heptene, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinylcyclohexane, norbornadiene, ethylidene norbornene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclooctene, C-Cdienes, including but not limited to 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, other C-C\u03b1-olefins, and the like. In certain embodiments, the \u03b1-olefin is propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene or a combination thereof. Although any hydrocarbon containing a vinyl group potentially may be used in embodiments of the invention, practical issues such as monomer availability, cost, and the ability to conveniently remove unreacted monomer from the resulting polymer may become more problematic as the molecular weight of the monomer becomes too high.","Other olefin interpolymers include polymers comprising monovinylidene aromatic monomers including styrene, o-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, t-butylstyrene, and the like. In particular, interpolymers comprising ethylene and styrene may be used. In other embodiments, copolymers comprising ethylene, styrene and a C-C\u03b1 olefin, optionally comprising a C-Cdiene, may be used.","Suitable non-conjugated diene monomers may include straight chain, branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon diene having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable non-conjugated dienes include, but are not limited to, straight chain acyclic dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, 1,6-octadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, branched chain acyclic dienes, such as 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-1,7-octadiene and mixed isomers of dihydromyricene and dihydroocinene, single ring alicyclic dienes, such as 1,3-cyclopentadiene; 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-cyclododecadiene, and multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes, such as tetrahydroindene, methyl tetrahydroindene, dicyclopentadiene, bicyclo-(2,2,1)-hepta-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes, such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene, 5-isopropylidene-2-norbornene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbornene, 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene, and norbornadiene. Of the dienes typically used to prepare EPDMs, the particularly preferred dienes are 1,4-hexadiene (HD), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB), 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene (VNB), 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB), and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD).","One class of desirable polymers that may be used in accordance with embodiments of the invention includes elastomeric interpolymers of ethylene, a C-C\u03b1-olefin, especially propylene, and optionally one or more diene monomers. Preferred \u03b1-olefins for use in this embodiment are designated by the formula CH\u2550CHR*, where R* is a linear or branched alkyl group of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable \u03b1-olefins include, but are not limited to, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. A particularly preferred \u03b1-olefin is propylene. The propylene based polymers are generally referred to in the art as EP or EPDM polymers. Suitable dienes for use in preparing such polymers, especially multi-block EPDM type polymers include conjugated or non-conjugated, straight or branched chain-, cyclic- or polycyclic- dienes comprising from 4 to 20 carbons. Preferred dienes include 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, and 5-butylidene-2-norbornene. A particularly preferred diene is 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene.","Because the diene-containing polymers comprise alternating segments or blocks containing greater or lesser quantities of the diene (including none) and \u03b1-olefin (including none), the total quantity of diene and \u03b1-olefin may be reduced without loss of subsequent polymer properties. That is, because the diene and \u03b1-olefin monomers are preferentially incorporated into one type of block of the polymer rather than uniformly or randomly throughout the polymer, they are more efficiently utilized and subsequently the crosslink density of the polymer may be better controlled. Such crosslinkable elastomers and the cured products have advantaged properties, including higher tensile strength and better elastic recovery.","In some embodiments, the interpolymers made with two catalysts incorporating differing quantities of comonomer have a weight ratio of blocks formed thereby ranging from 95:5 to 5:95. The elastomeric interpolymers, in some embodiments, have an ethylene content of from 20 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an \u03b1-olefin content of from 10 to 80 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. In other embodiments, the multi-block elastomeric polymers have an ethylene content of from 60 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an \u03b1-olefin content of from 10 to 40 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. In some embodiments, the interpolymers are high molecular weight polymers, having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) from 10,000 to about 2,500,000; from 20,000 to 500,000 in other embodiments; and from 20,000 to 350,000 in yet other embodiments. In some embodiments, the interpolymers may have a polydispersity less than 3.5; less than 3.0 in other embodiments. In other embodiments, the interpolymer may have a Mooney viscosity (ML (1+4) 125\u00b0 C.) ranging from 1 to 250. In other embodiments, such polymers may have an ethylene content from 65 to 75 percent, a diene content from 0 to 6 percent, and an \u03b1-olefin content from 20 to 35 percent.","The ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin interpolymers may be functionalized by incorporating at least one functional group in its polymer structure. Exemplary functional groups may include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated mono- and di-functional carboxylic acids, ethylenically unsaturated mono- and di-functional carboxylic acid anhydrides, salts thereof and esters thereof. Such functional groups may be grafted to an ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin interpolymer, or it may be copolymerized with ethylene and an optional additional comonomer to form an interpolymer of ethylene, the functional comonomer and optionally other comonomer(s). Means for grafting functional groups onto polyethylene are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,890, 4,927,888, and 4,950,541, the disclosures of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. One particularly useful functional group is maleic anhydride.","The amount of the functional group present in the functional interpolymer may vary. The functional group may be present in a copolymer-type functionalized interpolymer in an amount of at least about 1.0 weight percent in some embodiments; at least about 5 weight percent in other embodiments; and at least about 7 weight percent in yet other embodiments. The functional group may be present in a copolymer-type functionalized interpolymer in an amount less than about 40 weight percent in some embodiments; less than about 30 weight percent in other embodiments; and less than about 25 weight percent in yet other embodiments.","Additives","Additives may be used with the base polymer, stabilizing agent, or filler used in the dispersion without deviating from the scope of the present invention. For example, additives may include a wetting agent, surfactants, anti-static agents, antifoam agent, anti block, wax-dispersion pigments, a neutralizing agent, a thickener, a compatibilizer, a brightener, a rheology modifier, a biocide, a fungicide, and other additives known to those skilled in the art.","Additives and adjuvants may be included in any formulation comprising the multi-block interpolymers. Suitable additives include fillers, such as organic or inorganic particles, including clays, talc, titanium dioxide, zeolites, powdered metals, organic or inorganic fibers, including carbon fibers, silicon nitride fibers, steel wire or mesh, and nylon or polyester cording, nano-sized particles, clays, and so forth; tackifiers, oil extenders, including paraffinic or napthelenic oils; and other natural and synthetic polymers, including other polymers according to embodiments of the invention.","Suitable polymers for blending with the polymers according to embodiments of the invention include thermoplastic and non-thermoplastic polymers including natural and synthetic polymers. Exemplary polymers for blending include polypropylene, (both impact modifying polypropylene, isotactic polypropylene, atactic polypropylene, and random ethylene\/propylene copolymers), various types of polyethylene, including high pressure, free-radical LDPE, Ziegler Natta LLDPE, metallocene PE, including multiple reactor PE (\u201cin reactor\u201d blends of Ziegler-Natta PE and metallocene PE, such as products disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,545,088, 6,538,070, 6,566,446, 5,844,045, 5,869,575, and 6,448,341, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), ethylene\/vinyl alcohol copolymers, polystyrene, impact modified polystyrene, ABS, styrene\/butadiene block copolymers and hydrogenated derivatives thereof (SBS and SEBS), and thermoplastic polyurethanes. Homogeneous polymers such as olefin plastomers and elastomers, ethylene and propylene-based copolymers (for example polymers available under the trade designation VERSIFY\u2122 available from The Dow Chemical Company and VISTAMAXX\u2122 available from ExxonMobil may also be useful as components in blends comprising the multi-block interpolymers.","Suitable conventional block copolymers which may be blended with the interpolymers disclosed herein may possess a Mooney viscosity (ML 1+4@ 100\u00b0 C.) in the range from 10 to 135 in some embodiments; from 25 to 100 in other embodiments; and from 30 to 80 in yet other embodiments. Suitable polyolefins especially include linear or low density polyethylene, polypropylene (including atactic, isotactic, syndiotactic and impact modified versions thereof) and poly(4-methyl-1-pentene). Suitable styrenic polymers include polystyrene, rubber modified polystyrene (HIPS), styrene\/acrylonitrile copolymers (SAN), rubber modified SAN (ABS or AES) and styrene maleic anhydride copolymers.","The blends may be prepared by mixing or kneading the respective components at a temperature around or above the melt point temperature of one or both of the components. For most multiblock copolymers, this temperature may be above 130\u00b0 C., most generally above 145\u00b0 C., and most preferably above 150\u00b0 C. Typical polymer mixing or kneading equipment that is capable of reaching the desired temperatures and melt plastifying the mixture may be employed. These include mills, kneaders, extruders (both single screw and twin-screw), BANBURY\u00ae mixers, calenders, and the like. The sequence of mixing and method may depend on the final composition. A combination of BANBURY\u00ae batch mixers and continuous mixers may also be employed, such as a BANBURY\u00ae mixer followed by a mill mixer followed by an extruder. Typically, a TPE or TPV composition will have a higher loading of cross-linkable polymer (typically the conventional block copolymer containing unsaturation) compared to TPO compositions. Generally, for TPE and TPV compositions, the weight ratio of block copolymer to multi-block copolymer may range from about 90:10 to 10:90, more preferably from 80:20 to 20:80, and most preferably from 75:25 to 25:75. For TPO applications, the weight ratio of multi-block copolymer to polyolefin may be from about 49:51 to about 5:95, more preferably from 35:65 to about 10:90. For modified styrenic polymer applications, the weight ratio of multi-block copolymer to polyolefin may also be from about 49:51 to about 5:95, more preferably from 35:65 to about 10:90. The ratios may be changed by changing the viscosity ratios of the various components. There is considerable literature illustrating techniques for changing the phase continuity by changing the viscosity ratios of the constituents of a blend and a person skilled in this art may consult if necessary.","The blend compositions may contain processing oils, plasticizers, and processing aids. Rubber processing oils having a certain ASTM designation and paraffinic, napthenic or aromatic process oils are all suitable for use. Generally from 0 to 150 parts, more preferably 0 to 100 parts, and most preferably from 0 to 50 parts of oil per 100 parts of total polymer are employed. Higher amounts of oil may tend to improve the processing of the resulting product at the expense of some physical properties. Additional processing aids include conventional waxes, fatty acid salts, such as calcium stearate or zinc stearate, (poly)alcohols including glycols, (poly)alcohol ethers, including glycol ethers, (poly)esters, including (poly)glycol esters, and metal salt-, especially-Group 1 or 2 metal or zinc-, salt derivatives thereof.","It is known that non-hydrogenated rubbers such as those comprising polymerized forms of butadiene or isoprene, including block copolymers (here-in-after diene rubbers), have lower resistance to UV, ozone, and oxidation, compared to mostly or highly saturated rubbers. In applications such as tires made from compositions containing higher concentrations of diene based rubbers, it is known to incorporate carbon black to improve rubber stability, along with anti-ozone additives and anti-oxidants. Multi-block copolymers according to the present invention possessing extremely low levels of unsaturation, find particular application as a protective surface layer (coated, coextruded or laminated) or weather resistant film adhered to articles formed from conventional diene elastomer modified polymeric compositions.","For conventional TPO, TPV, and TPE applications, carbon black is the additive of choice for UV absorption and stabilizing properties. Representative examples of carbon blacks include ASTM N110, N121, N220, N231, N234, N242, N293, N299, S315, N326, N330, M332, N339, N343, N347, N351, N358, N375, N539, N550, N582, N630, N642, N650, N683, N754, N762, N765, N774, N787, N907, N908, N990 and N991. These carbon blacks have iodine absorptions ranging from 9 to 145 g\/kg and average pore volumes ranging from 10 to 150 cm\/100 g. Generally, smaller particle sized carbon blacks are employed, to the extent cost considerations permit. For many such applications the present multi-block copolymers and blends thereof require little or no carbon black, thereby allowing considerable design freedom to include alternative pigments or no pigments at all.","Compositions, including thermoplastic blends according to embodiments of the invention may also contain anti-ozonants or anti-oxidants that are known to a rubber chemist of ordinary skill. The anti-ozonants may be physical protectants such as waxy materials that come to the surface and protect the part from oxygen or ozone or they may be chemical protectors that react with oxygen or ozone. Suitable chemical protectors include styrenated phenols, butylated octylated phenol, butylated di(dimethylbenzyl) phenol, p-phenylenediamines, butylated reaction products of p-cresol and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), polyphenolic anitioxidants, hydroquinone derivatives, quinoline, diphenylene antioxidants, thioester antioxidants, and blends thereof. Some representative trade names of such products are WINGSTAY\u2122 S antioxidant, POLYSTAY\u2122 100 antioxidant, POLYSTAY\u2122 100 AZ antioxidant, POLYSTAY\u2122 200 antioxidant, WINGSTAY\u2122 L antioxidant, WINGSTAY\u2122 LHLS antioxidant, WINGSTAY\u2122 K antioxidant, WINGSTAY\u2122 29 antioxidant, WINGSTAY\u2122 SN-1 antioxidant, and IRGANOX\u2122 antioxidants. In some applications, the anti-oxidants and anti-ozonants used will preferably be non-staining and non-migratory.","For providing additional stability against UV radiation, hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) and UV absorbers may be also used. Suitable examples include TINUVIN\u2122 123, TINUVIN\u2122 144, TINUVIN\u2122 622, TINUVIN\u2122 765, TINUVIN\u2122 770, and TINUVIN\u2122 780, available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals, and CHEMISORB\u2122 T944, available from Cytex Plastics, Houston Tex. USA. A Lewis acid may be additionally included with a HALS compound in order to achieve superior surface quality, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,681.","For some compositions, additional mixing process may be employed to pre-disperse the anti-oxidants, anti-ozonants, carbon black, UV absorbers, and\/or light stabilizers to form a masterbatch, and subsequently to form polymer blends there from.","Suitable crosslinking agents (also referred to as curing or vulcanizing agents) for use herein include sulfur based, peroxide based, or phenolic based compounds.","Examples of the foregoing materials are found in the art, including in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,758,643, 3,806,558, 5,051,478, 4,104,210, 4,130,535, 4,202,801, 4,271,049, 4,340,684, 4,250,273, 4,927,882, 4,311,628 and 5,248,729.","When sulfur based curing agents are employed, accelerators and cure activators may be used as well. Accelerators are used to control the time and\/or temperature required for dynamic vulcanization and to improve the properties of the resulting cross-linked article. In one embodiment, a single accelerator or primary accelerator is used. The primary accelerator(s) may be used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably about 0.8 to about 1.5 phr, based on total composition weight. In another embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts, such as from about 0.05 to about 3 phr, in order to activate and to improve the properties of the cured article. Combinations of accelerators generally produce articles having properties that are somewhat better than those produced by use of a single accelerator. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures yet produce a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound. Certain processing aids and cure activators such as stearic acid and ZnO may also be used. When peroxide based curing agents are used, co-activators or coagents may be used in combination therewith. Suitable coagents include trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA), trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA), triallyl cyanurate (TAC), triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC), among others. Use of peroxide crosslinkers and optional coagents used for partial or complete dynamic vulcanization are known in the art and disclosed for example in the publication, \u201cPeroxide Vulcanization of Elastomer,\u201d Vol. 74, No 3, July-August 2001.","When the multi-block copolymer containing composition is at least partially crosslinked, the degree of crosslinking may be measured by dissolving the composition in a solvent for specified duration, and calculating the percent gel or unextractable component. The percent gel normally increases with increasing crosslinking levels. For cured articles according to embodiments of the invention, the percent gel content is desirably in the range from 5 to 100 percent.","The multi-block copolymers according to embodiments of the invention as well as blends thereof may possess improved processability compared to prior art compositions, due, it is believed, to lower melt viscosity. Thus, the composition or blend demonstrates an improved surface appearance, especially when formed into a molded or extruded article. At the same time, the present compositions and blends thereof uniquely possess improved melt strength properties, thereby allowing the present multi-block copolymers and blends thereof, especially TPO blends, to be usefully employed in foam and thermoforming applications where melt strength is currently inadequate.","Thermoplastic compositions according to embodiments of the invention may also contain organic or inorganic fillers or other additives such as starch, talc, calcium carbonate, glass fibers, polymeric fibers (including nylon, rayon, cotton, polyester, and polyaramide), metal fibers, flakes or particles, expandable layered silicates, phosphates or carbonates, such as clays, mica, silica, alumina, aluminosilicates or aluminophosphates, carbon whiskers, carbon fibers, nanoparticles including nanotubes, wollastonite, graphite, zeolites, and ceramics, such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride or titania. Silane based or other coupling agents may also be employed for better filler bonding.","The thermoplastic compositions according to embodiments of the invention, including the foregoing blends, may be processed by conventional molding techniques such as injection molding, extrusion molding, thermoforming, slush molding, over molding, insert molding, blow molding, and other techniques. Films, including multi-layer films, may be produced by cast or tentering processes, including blown film processes.","In addition to the above, the block ethylene\/\u03b1-olefin interpolymers also may be used in a manner that is described in the following U.S. provisional applications, the disclosures of which and their continuations, divisional applications and continuation-in-part applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety:\n\n","Stabilizing Agent","Embodiments of the present invention use a stabilizing agent to promote the formation of a stable dispersion or emulsion. In selected embodiments, the stabilizing agent may be a surfactant, a polymer (different from the base polymer detailed above), or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the polymer may be a polar polymer, having a polar group as either a comonomer or grafted monomer. In preferred embodiments, the stabilizing agent comprises one or more polar polyolefins, having a polar group as either a comonomer or grafted monomer. Typical polymers include ethylene-acrylic acid (EAA) and ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers, such as those available under the trademarks PRIMACOR\u2122 (trademark of The Dow Chemical Company), NUCREL\u2122 (trademark of E.I. DuPont de Nemours), and ESCOR\u2122 (trademark of ExxonMobil) and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,599,392, 4,988,781, and 5,938,437, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a number of other useful polymers may also be used.","Other surfactants that may be used include long chain fatty acids or fatty acid salts having from 12 to 60 carbon atoms. In other embodiments, the long chain fatty acid or fatty acid salt may have from 12 to 40 carbon atoms.","If the polar group of the polymer is acidic or basic in nature, the stabilizing polymer may be partially or fully neutralized with a neutralizing agent to form the corresponding salt. In certain embodiments, neutralization of the stabilizing agent, such as a long chain fatty acid or EAA, may be from 25 to 200% on a molar basis; from 50 to 110% on a molar basis in other embodiments. For example, for EAA, the neutralizing agent is a base, such as ammonium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, for example. Other neutralizing agents may include lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, for example. Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the selection of an appropriate neutralizing agent depends on the specific composition formulated, and that such a choice is within the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art.","Additional surfactants that may be useful in the practice of the present invention include cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants, or a non-ionic surfactants. Examples of anionic surfactants include sulfonates, carboxylates, and phosphates. Examples of cationic surfactants include quaternary amines. Examples of non-ionic surfactants include block copolymers containing ethylene oxide and silicone surfactants. Surfactants useful in the practice of the present invention may be either external surfactants or internal surfactants. External surfactants are surfactants that do not become chemically reacted into the polymer during dispersion preparation. Examples of external surfactants useful herein include salts of dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid and lauryl sulfonic acid salt. Internal surfactants are surfactants that do become chemically reacted into the polymer during dispersion preparation. An example of an internal surfactant useful herein includes 2,2-dimethylol propionic acid and its salts.","In particular embodiments, the dispersing agent or stabilizing agent may be used in an amount ranging from greater than zero to about 60% by weight based on the amount of base polymer (or base polymer mixture) used. For example, long chain fatty acids or salts thereof may be used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 10% by weight based on the amount of base polymer. In other embodiments, ethylene-acrylic acid or ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers may be used in an amount from 0.5 to 60% by weight based on polymer. In yet other embodiments, sulfonic acid salts may be used in an amount from 0.5 to 10% by weight based on the amount of base polymer.","The type and amount of stabilizing agent used may also affect end properties of the cellulose-based article formed incorporating the dispersion. For example, articles having improved oil and grease resistance might incorporate a surfactant package having ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers or ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers in an amount from about 10 to about 50% by weight based on the total amount of base polymer. A similar surfactant package may be used when improved strength or softness is a desired end property. As another example, articles having improved water or moisture resistance might incorporate a surfactant package utilizing long chain fatty acids in an amount from 0.5 to 5%, or ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers in an amount from 10 to 50%, both by weight based on the total amount of base polymer. In other embodiments, the minimum amount of surfactant or stabilizing agent must be at least 1% by weight based on the total amount of base polymer.","Fillers","Embodiments of the dispersions disclosed herein may include a filler as part of the composition. A suitable filler loading in a polyolefin dispersion may be from about 0 to about 600 parts of filler per hundred parts of polyolefin. In certain embodiments, the filler loading in the dispersion may be from about 0 to about 200 parts of filler per hundred parts of a combined amount of the polyolefin and the polymeric stabilizing agent. The filler material may include conventional fillers such as milled glass, calcium carbonate, aluminum trihydrate, talc, antimony trioxide, fly ash, clays (such as bentonite or kaolin clays for example), or other known fillers.","Thermoplastic Polyolefin","As mentioned above, the dispersions disclosed herein may include blends of the above described multi-block olefin interpolymers with thermoplastic polymers or non-polar thermoplastic polyolefins.

By \u201caverage particle size\u201d, the present invention means the volume-mean particle size. In order to measure the particle size, laser-diffraction techniques may be employed for example. A particle size in this description refers to the diameter of the polymer in the dispersion.

A filler wetting agent may be included in a composition of the present invention at a concentration of at least about 0.5 parts per 100 parts of filler, by weight.","Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may optionally include a thickener. Thickeners may be useful in the present invention to increase the viscosity of low viscosity dispersions. Thickeners suitable for use in the practice of the present invention may be any known in the art such as for instance poly-acrylate type or associate non ionic thickeners such as modified cellulose ethers. For example, suitable thickeners include ALCOGUM\u2122 VEP-II (trademark of Alco Chemical Corporation), RHEOVIS\u2122 and VISCALEX\u2122 (trademarks of Ciba Ceigy), UCAR\u00ae Thickener 146, or ETHOCEL\u2122 or METHOCEL\u2122 (trademarks of the The Dow Chemical Company) and PARAGUM\u2122 241 (trademarks of Para-Chem Southern, Inc.), or BERMACOL\u2122 (trademark of Akzo Nobel) or AQUALON\u2122 (trademark of Hercules) or ACUSOL\u00ae (trademark of Rohm and Haas). Thickeners may be used in any amount necessary to prepare a dispersion of desired viscosity.","The ultimate viscosity of the dispersion is, therefore, controllable. Addition of the thickener to the dispersion including the amount of filler may be done with conventional means to result in viscosities as needed. Viscosities of thus dispersions may reach +3000 cP (Brookfield spindle 4 with 20 rpm) with moderate thickener dosing (up to 4% preferably, below 3% based on 100 phr of polymer dispersion). The starting polymer dispersion as described has an initial viscosity prior to formulation with fillers and additives between 20 and 1000 cP (Brookfield viscosity measured at room temperature with spindle RV3 at 50 rpm). Still more preferably, the starting viscosity of the dispersion may be between about 100 to about 600 cP.","Also, embodiments of the present invention are characterized by their stability when a filler is added to the polymer\/stabilizing agent. In this context, stability refers to the stability of viscosity of the resultant aqueous polyolefin dispersion. In order to test the stability, the viscosity is measured over a period of time. Preferably, viscosity measured at 20\u00b0 C. should remain +\/\u221210% of the original viscosity over a period of 24 hours, when stored at ambient temperature.","The aqueous dispersion of the present invention may contain particles having an average particle size of from about 0.1 to about 5 microns. The coatings obtained therefrom exhibit excellent moisture resistance, water repellency, oil and grease resistance, thermal adhesion to paper and other natural and synthetic substrates such as metal, wood, glass, synthetic fibers and films, and woven and non-woven fabrics.","The aqueous dispersions disclosed herein may be used as coatings, as articles such as frothed foams, and adhesives for bonding and sealing various substrates, especially corrugated boxes and plastics films such as BOPP, polyester and polyamide films.

In addition, the diluted mixture may be diluted any number of times until the desired dilution level is achieved. In some embodiments, water is not added into the twin screw extruder  but rather to a stream containing the resin melt after the melt has exited from the extruder. In this manner, steam pressure build-up in the extruder  is eliminated.","In particular embodiments, it may be desired to utilize the dispersion in the form of foam. When preparing foams, it is often preferred to froth the dispersion. For example, a froth and foam may be prepared as described in WO2005\/021622, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. Preferred in the practice of this invention is the use of a gas as a frothing agent. Examples of suitable frothing agents include: gases and\/or mixtures of gases such as, air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, helium, and the like. Particularly preferable is the use of air as a frothing agent. Frothing agents are typically introduced by mechanical introduction of a gas into a liquid to form a froth. This technique is known as mechanical frothing. In preparing a frothed dispersion, it is preferred to mix all components and then blend the air or gas into the mixture, using equipment such as an OAKES, MONDO, or FIRESTONE frother.","Surfactants useful for preparing a stable froth are referred to herein as foam stabilizers. Foam stabilizers are useful in the practice of the present invention. Those having ordinary skill in this field will recognize that a number of foam stabilizers may be used.

Density of the froth is measured by weighing a 3 oz (89 ml) paper cup filled with froth. Once the desired density is reached, whipping is stopped. Dispersion densities are often between about 900 to 1000 g\/L, while the resultant whipped density may be about 100 g\/L to 300 g\/L. Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the final density of the whipped dispersion may be controlled as desired by modifying the whipping times, for example. In select embodiments, the whipped dispersion is formed at a temperature less than the melting point of the dispersed polymer. More preferably, the dispersion is formed at about 25 C+\/\u221210 C of the melting point of the dispersed polymer.","Additional comparison dispersions used for making foams for testing are as follows:","AFFINITY EG8200 (available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich.) with 2% UNICID 350 and 1% HYSTRENE 4516, 51.7% active; 1% STEPANOL WAT-k (from an \u02dc39% active solution) and the METHOCEL is formulated into the dispersion once the dispersion is cooled to room temperature (CS1).","70\/30 blend of AFFINITY EG8200\/AFFINITY PL1280 (both available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich.) with 2% UNICID 350 and 1% HYSTRENE 4516, 52.2% active, 1% STEPANOL WAT-k (from an \u02dc39% active solution) and 0.35% METHOCEL is formulated into the dispersion once the dispersion is cooled to room temperature (CS 2).","70\/30 blend of AFFINITY EG8200\/AFFINITY PL1280 (both available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Mich.) with 2% UNICID 350 and 1% HYSTRENE 4516, 52.2% active, 1% STEPANOL WAT-k (from an \u02dc39% active solution) and 0.35% METHOCEL is formulated into the dispersion once the dispersion is cooled to room temperature. Polypropylene fiber is slowly added to the dispersion in the standard mixing bowl as it is mixed on low. Once all of the fiber is added, mix an additional one minute and then begin the frothing process by increasing the mixer speed to high (CS3).","Foam Preparation\/Drying","Froth prepared as described above is spread on release paper supported by a stiffer paper sheet and is smoothed to a height of about 0.25 in (\u02dc0.63 cm) or as desired. The froth is placed in a Blue M forced air oven at drying temperature of approximately 75 to 100\u00b0 C. (\u02dc167 to 212\u00b0 F.) for about 10 minutes. The oven temperature setting is then increased to approximately 120 to 1.35\u00b0 C. (\u02dc248 to 275\u00b0 F.) and takes approximately 17 minutes to reach set temperature. The froth remains in the oven for approximately 6 minutes additionally and the dry foam sheet is recovered from the oven.","Foam Compression Testing","Six samples measuring two inches wide by two inches in height are cut from a large polyolefin foam sample. Three sample weights are constructed weighing 197 g, 455 g, and 907 g corresponding with the desired loads of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 psi on the 4 sq in samples. Two sample patches are placed under each load and heated in an 85\u00b0 C. oven for 20 min. The samples are removed from the oven and the weights are removed. Compressed samples are allowed to cool and final thickness measurements are taken.","Foam Compression Data","Comparison of samples compressed at 85\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes under various loads are

can be seen from the above, polyolefin froth foams formed from the dispersion of multi-block olefin interpolymers may have a number of useful properties. Modified frothed foams are also within the purview of this invention and can include micro-cavity containing thermoplastic foams such as those disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/700,644. The micro-cavity containing additives include such materials as super absorbent polymers (SAP) for articles such as infant and children diapers, adult incontinence pants, feminine hygiene pads, household cleaning articles, pet urine absorption mats\/pads, and garbage bag liquid absorbent pads.","Advantageously, the present invention provides for dispersions of multi-block olefin interpolymers. In some embodiments the dispersions may be aqueous. These block interpolymers may have a soft (low crystallinity) segment rich in comonomer and a hard segment (high crystallinity) which is rather low in comonomer content. This heterogeneous structure may allow for a polymer having the same overall comonomer content (and crystallinity) of a standard homogeneous ethylene-copolymer with a broader melting range. Coatings and articles produced from dispersions disclosed herein may advantageously have a higher, heat resistance, a greater resistance to compression set at elevated temperatures, and may exhibit a broader operating window in various extrusion and molding process.","These dispersions may be used as coatings and as articles such as frothed foams. Alternative uses for these dispersions include adhesives for bonding and sealing various substrates, especially corrugated boxes and plastics films such as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), polyester and polyamide films. Additionally, these foams may be used in the construction of diapers and feminine hygiene pads as the liquid absorbent and distribution layer. Today, such diapers and feminine hygiene pads are packaged tightly. Foams formed from dispersions disclosed herein may provide significantly lower compression set at 40\u00b0 C., allowing near full recovery of the original foam thickness, a requirement for the end product.","In another aspect, the multi-block interpolymers may be used as a coating or adhesive where heat resistance is required. Many automotive applications require heat resistance at temperatures of 60\u00b0 C. and higher. A dispersions produced using a standard metallocene-based ethylene-octene copolymer having density of 0.870 g\/cc and a melt index (12 at 190\u00b0 C.) of 5 g\/10 min. will fail as a coating or adhesive at temperatures of 60\u00b0 C. and higher. A coating or adhesive based on a dispersion on a multi-block olefin interpolymer having density of 0.870 g\/cc, a melt index (12 at 190\u00b0 C.) of 5 g\/10 min., and a hard segment content of 30% may achieve sufficient heat resistance.","In addition to the mechanical emulsification of a single multi-block interpolymer, blends of different multi-block interpolymers and blends of multi-block interpolymers and other polyolefins and plastics may be produced to enhance certain properties such as adhesion to specific substrates such as paper or glass and heat resistance.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a dispersion of catalytic linear multi-block olefins may be used in connection with other dispersions to form a blended dispersion product.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a dispersion of catalytic linear multi-block olefins may be dispersed into a monomer, such as acrylonitrile. This monomer may be later polymerized, which has the effect of dispersing the multi-block olefin polymer in a secondary polymer.","In addition to the applications described above, catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer as described herein may be useful in a number of other applications.","Accordingly, in one application, dispersions of catalytic linear multi-block olefins may be useful in cellulose-based articles, especially having a specific volume of less than 3 cc\/gm, for example, paper and board structures, incorporating a compound comprising an aqueous polyolefin dispersion resulting in articles having improved properties. In various embodiments, the articles can have improved oil and grease resistance, improved water resistance, controlled coefficients of friction, thermal embossability, thermal formability, improved wet and dry strength, or an improved softness, among others. Such techniques and compositions are disclosed in U.S. Application Ser. No. 60\/750,466, which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Thus, in one application, dispersions of catalytic linear multi-block olefins may be useful in providing a cellulose-based article having, especially those having a specific volume of less than 3 cc\/gm, including: a cellulose-based composition; and an applied compound. The applied compound, at the time of application, may include a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer, and at least one dispersing agent wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer comprises at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment. The article may have an oil and grease resistance value of at least 9 as measured using the Kit test at an exposure time of 15 seconds.","Thus, in one application, dispersions of catalytic linear multi-block olefins may be useful in providing a cellulose-based article, especially those having a specific volume of less than 3 cc\/gm, including: a cellulose-based composition; and an applied compound. The applied compound, at the time of application, may include a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer, and at least one dispersing agent wherein the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer comprises at least one hard segment and at least one soft segment. The cellulose-based article may have a water resistance value of less than about 10 g\/m\/120 seconds as measured via the Cobb test.","The Kit test: the kit value of samples may be determined using TAPPI T559 cm-02. The test was performed flat as described in the TAPPI test. This involves putting five separate drops of oil onto the board's surface and inspecting the board after a specified amount of exposure time (15 seconds) to see if any pronounced darkening of the paper appears. A modified Kit test run at elevated temperature(s) can be useful to distinguish deposited dispersions made using the catalytic linear multi-block polymers, especially for ethylene based block polymers versus other ethylene based random copolymers. Such elevated temperatures for testing can be as high as about 80\u00b0 C., but preferably tested around 50\u00b0 C. Film layers made using deposited dispersions from the catalytic linear ethylenic multi-block polymers show higher Kit values at 50\u00b0 C. than Kit values (also at 50\u00b0 C.) for random ethylene polymer based deposited dispersions, even at similar overall ethylene polymer density and melt index.","The Cobb test: Cobb tests may be performed in accordance with ASTM D3285-93. The exposure time was 2 minutes. The test involves a known volume of water (100 ml) being poured onto a specific area of the board's surface (100 cm). The board is weighed before and after the exposure and the difference between the two can then be expressed as the weight per unit area of water absorbed in that given time; the lower the Cobb value, the better the result. A modified Cobb test run at elevated temperature(s) can be useful to distinguish deposited dispersions made using the catalytic linear multi-block polymers, especially for ethylene based block polymers versus other ethylene based random copolymers. Such elevated temperatures for testing can be as high as about 80\u00b0 C., but preferably tested around 50\u00b0 C. Film layers made using deposited dispersions from the catalytic linear ethylenic multi-block polymers show lower Cobb values at 50\u00b0 C. than Cobb values (also at 50\u00b0 C.) for random ethylene polymer based deposited dispersions, even at similar overall ethylene polymer density and melt index.","Thus, embodiments disclosed herein may relate to cellulose-based compositions, which are generally referred to as \u201cpaper and\/or paperboard products\u201d (i.e., other than paper towels), such as newsprint, uncoated groundwood, coated groundwood, coated free sheet, uncoated free sheet, packaging and industrial papers, linerboard, corrugating medium, recycled paperboard, bleached paperboard, writing paper, typing paper, photo quality paper, wallpaper, etc. Such compositions can generally be formed in accordance with the present invention from at least one paper web.","For example, in one embodiment, the paper product can contain a single-layered paper web formed from a blend of fibers. In another embodiment, the paper product can contain a multi-layered paper (i.e., stratified) web. Furthermore, the paper product can also be a single- or multi-ply product (e.g., more than one paper web), wherein one or more of the plies may contain a paper web formed according to the present invention. Normally, the basis weight of a paper product of the present invention is between about 10 to about 525 grams per square meter (gsm). Normally, the specific volume of a paper product in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is between about 0.3 to about 2 grams per cubic centimeter (g\/cc).","Any of a variety of materials can be used to form the paper products of the present invention. For example, the material used to make paper products can include fibers formed by a variety of pulping processes, such as kraft pulp, sulfite pulp, thermomechanical pulp, etc.","Papermaking fibers useful in the process of the present invention include any cellulosic fibers that are known to be useful for making cellulosic base sheets. Suitable fibers include virgin softwood and hardwood fibers along with non-woody fibers, as well as secondary (i.e., recycled) papermaking fibers and mixtures thereof in all proportions. Non-cellulosic synthetic fibers can also be included in the aqueous suspension. Papermaking fibers may be derived from wood using any known pulping process, including kraft and sulfite chemical pulps.","Fibers suitable for making paper webs comprise any natural or synthetic cellulosic fibers including, but not limited to nonwoody fibers, such as cotton, abaca, kenaf, sabai grass, flax, esparto grass, straw, jute hemp, bagasse, milkweed floss fibers, and pineapple leaf fibers; and woody fibers such as those obtained from deciduous and coniferous trees, including softwood fibers, such as northern and southern softwood kraft fibers; hardwood fibers, such as eucalyptus, maple, birch, and aspen. Woody fibers can be prepared in high-yield or low-yield forms and can be pulped in any known method, including kraft, sulfite, high-yield pulping methods and other known pulping methods. Fibers prepared from organosolv pulping methods can also be used, including the fibers and methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,793,898, issued Dec. 27, 1988 to Laamanen et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,130, issued Jun. 10, 1986 to Chang et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,585,104. Useful fibers can also be produced by anthraquinone pulping, exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,628 issued Jan. 21, 1997, to Gordon et al.","In one embodiment, a portion of the fibers, such as up to 50% or less by dry weight, or from about 5% to about 30% by dry weight, can be synthetic fibers such as rayon, polyolefin fibers, polyester fibers, bicomponent sheath-core fibers, multi-component binder fibers, and the like. An exemplary polyethylene fiber is PULPEX\u00ae, available from Hercules, Inc. (Wilmington, Del.). Any known bleaching method can be used. Synthetic cellulose fiber types include rayon in all its varieties and other fibers derived from viscose or chemically-modified cellulose. Chemically treated natural cellulosic fibers can be used such as mercerized pulps, chemically stiffened or crosslinked fibers, or sulfonated fibers. For good mechanical properties in using papermaking fibers, it can be desirable that the fibers be relatively undamaged and largely unrefined or only lightly refined. While recycled fibers can be used, virgin fibers are generally useful for their mechanical properties and lack of contaminants. Mercerized fibers, regenerated cellulosic fibers, cellulose produced by microbes, rayon, and other cellulosic material or cellulosic derivatives can be used. Suitable papermaking fibers can also include recycled fibers, virgin fibers, or mixes thereof. In certain embodiments capable of high bulk and good compressive properties, the fibers can have a Canadian Standard Freeness of at least 200, more specifically at least 300, more specifically still at least 400, and most specifically at least 500. In some other embodiments, portions of the fibers up to about 90% by dry weight may be synthetic fibers.","Other papermaking fibers that can be used in the present disclosure include paper broke or recycled fibers and high yield fibers. High yield pulp fibers are those papermaking fibers produced by pulping processes providing a yield of about 65% or greater, more specifically about 75% or greater, and still more specifically about 75% to about 95%. Yield is the resulting amount of processed fibers expressed as a percentage of the initial wood mass. Such pulping processes include bleached chemithermomechanical pulp (BCTMP), chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP), pressure\/pressure thermomechanical pulp (PTMP), thermomechanical pulp (TMP), thermomechanical chemical pulp (TMCP), high yield sulfite pulps, and high yield Kraft pulps, all of which leave the resulting fibers with high levels of lignin. High yield fibers are well known for their stiffness in both dry and wet states relative to typical chemically pulped fibers.","In some embodiments, the pulp fibers may include softwood fibers having an average fiber length of greater than 1 mm and particularly from about 2 to 5 mm based on a length-weighted average. Such softwood fibers can include, but are not limited to, northern softwood, southern softwood, redwood, red cedar, hemlock, pine (e.g., southern pines), spruce (e.g., black spruce), combinations thereof, and the like. Exemplary commercially available pulp fibers suitable for the present invention include those available from Neenah Paper Inc. under the trade designations \u201cLONGLAC-19.\u201d","In some embodiments, hardwood fibers, such as eucalyptus, maple, birch, aspen, and the like, can also be used. In certain instances, eucalyptus fibers may be particularly desired to increase the softness of the web. Eucalyptus fibers can also enhance the brightness, increase the opacity, and change the pore structure of the paper to increase the wicking ability of the paper web. Moreover, if desired, secondary fibers obtained from recycled materials may be used, such as fiber pulp from sources such as, for example, newsprint, reclaimed paperboard, and office waste. Further, other natural fibers can also be used in the present invention, such as abaca, sabai grass, milkweed floss, pineapple leaf, and the like. In addition, in some instances, synthetic fibers can also be utilized. Some suitable synthetic fibers can include, but are not limited to, rayon fibers, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer fibers, polyolefin fibers, polyesters, and the like.","As stated, the paper product of the present invention can be formed from one or more paper webs. The paper webs can be single-layered or multi-layered. For instance, in one embodiment, the paper product contains a single-layered paper web layer that is formed from a blend of fibers. For example, in some instances, eucalyptus and softwood fibers can be homogeneously blended to form the single-layered paper web.","In another embodiment, the paper product can contain a multi-layered paper web that is formed from a stratified pulp furnish having various principal layers. For example, in one embodiment, the paper product contains three layers where one of the outer layers includes eucalyptus fibers, while the other two layers include northern softwood kraft fibers. In another embodiment, one outer layer and the inner layer can contain eucalyptus fibers, while the remaining outer layer can contain northern softwood kraft fibers. If desired, the three principle layers may also include blends of various types of fibers. For example, in one embodiment, one of the outer layers can contain a blend of eucalyptus fibers and northern softwood kraft fibers. However, it should be understood that the multi-layered paper web can include any number of layers and can be made from various types of fibers. For instance, in one embodiment, the multi-layered paper web can be formed from a stratified pulp furnish having only two principal layers.","In accordance with the present invention, various properties of a paper product such as described above, can be optimized. For instance, strength (e.g., wet tensile, dry tensile, tear, etc.), softness, lint level, slough level, and the like, are some examples of properties of the paper product that may be optimized in accordance with the present invention. However, it should be understood that each of the properties mentioned above need not be optimized in every instance. For example, in certain applications, it may be desired to form a paper product that has increased strength without regard to softness.","In this regard, in one embodiment of the present invention, at least a portion of the fibers of the paper product can be treated with hydrolytic enzymes to increase strength and reduce lint. In particular, the hydrolytic enzymes can randomly react with the cellulose chains at or near the surface of the papermaking fibers to create single aldehyde groups on the fiber surface which are part of the fiber. These aldehyde groups become sites for cross-linking with exposed hydroxyl groups of other fibers when the fibers are formed and dried into sheets, thus increasing sheet strength. In addition, by randomly cutting or hydrolyzing the fiber cellulose predominantly at or near the surface of the fiber, degradation of the interior of the fiber cell wall is avoided or minimized. Consequently, a paper product made from these fibers alone, or made from blends of these fibers with untreated pulp fibers, show an increase in strength properties such as dry tensile, wet tensile, tear, etc.","Other examples of useful cellulose-based compositions useful in the present invention include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,837,970, 6,824,650, 6,863,940 and in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. US20050192402 and 20040149412 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Cellulosic webs prepared in accordance with the present invention can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as paper and paperboard products (i.e., other than paper towels), newsprint, uncoated groundwood, coated groundwood, coated free sheet, uncoated free sheet, packaging and industrial papers, linerboard, corrugating medium, recycled paperboard, and bleached paperboard. Webs made according to the present invention can be used in diapers, sanitary napkins, composite materials, molded paper products, paper cups, paper plates, and the like. Materials prepared according to the present invention can also be used in various textile applications, particularly in textile webs comprising a blend of cellulosic materials and wool, nylon, silk or other polyamide or protein-based fibers.","The paper products may contain a variety of fiber types both natural and synthetic. In one embodiment the paper products comprises hardwood and softwood fibers. The overall ratio of hardwood pulp fibers to softwood pulp fibers within the product, including individual sheets making up the product may vary broadly. The ratio of hardwood pulp fibers to softwood pulp fibers may range from about 9:1 to about 1:9, more specifically from about 9:1 to about 1:4, and most specifically from about 9:1 to about 1:1. In one embodiment of the present invention, the hardwood pulp fibers and softwood pulp fibers may be blended prior to forming the paper sheet thereby producing a homogenous distribution of hardwood pulp fibers and softwood pulp fibers in the z-direction of the sheet. In another embodiment of the present invention, the hardwood pulp fibers and softwood pulp fibers may be layered so as to give a heterogeneous distribution of hardwood pulp fibers and softwood pulp fibers in the z-direction of the sheet. In another embodiment, the hardwood pulp fibers may be located in at least one of the outer layers of the paper product and\/or sheets wherein at least one of the inner layers may comprise softwood pulp fibers. In still another embodiment the paper product contains secondary or recycled fibers optionally containing virgin or synthetic fibers.","In addition, synthetic fibers may also be utilized in the present invention. The discussion herein regarding pulp fibers is understood to include synthetic fibers. Some suitable polymers that may be used to form the synthetic fibers include, but are not limited to: polyolefins, such as, polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, and the like; polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate, poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(\u03b2-malic acid) (PMLA), poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(\u03c1-dioxanone) (PDS), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), and the like; and, polyamides, such as nylon and the like. Synthetic or natural cellulosic polymers, including but not limited to: cellulosic esters; cellulosic ethers; cellulosic nitrates; cellulosic acetates; cellulosic acetate butyrates; ethyl cellulose; regenerated celluloses, such as viscose, rayon, and the like; cotton; flax; hemp; and mixtures thereof may be used in the present invention. The synthetic fibers may be located in one or all of the layers and sheets comprising the or paper product.","Cellulose-based articles can be formed by a variety of processes known to those skilled in the art. Machines may be configured to have a forming section, a press section, a drying section, and depending on the article formed, optionally a reel. Examples of the details of the process steps and schematic illustrations may be found in \u201cProperties of Paper: An Introduction\u201d 2nd edition W. Scott an J. Abbott, TAPPI Press 1995. In a simplified description of the process, typically a dilute suspension of pulp fibers is supplied by a head-box and deposited via a sluice in a uniform dispersion onto a forming fabric of a conventional papermaking machine. The suspension of pulp fibers may be diluted to any consistency which is typically used in conventional papermaking processes. For example, the suspension may contain from about 0.01 to about 1.5 percent by weight pulp fibers suspended in water. Water is removed from the suspension of pulp fibers to form a uniform layer of pulp fibers. Other paper-making processes, paper-board manufacturing processes, and the like, may be utilized with the present invention. For example, the processes disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,423,183 may be used.","The pulp fibers may be any high-average fiber length pulp, low-average fiber length pulp, or mixtures of the same. The high-average fiber length pulp typically have an average fiber length from about 1.5 mm to about 6 mm. An exemplary high-average fiber length wood pulp includes one available from the Neenah Paper Inc. under the trade designation LONGLAC 19.","The low-average fiber length pulp may be, for example, certain virgin hardwood pulps and secondary (i.e. recycled) fiber pulp from sources such as, for example, newsprint, reclaimed paperboard, and office waste. The low-average fiber length pulps typically have an average fiber length of less than about 1.2 mm, for example, from 0.7 mm to 1.2 mm.","Mixtures of high-average fiber length and low-average fiber length pulps may contain a significant proportion of low-average fiber length pulps. For example, mixtures may contain more than about 50 percent by weight low-average fiber length pulp and less than about 50 percent by weight high-average fiber length pulp. One exemplary mixture contains 75 percent by weight low-average fiber length pulp and about 25 percent high-average fiber length pulp.","The pulp fibers used in the present invention may be unrefined or may be beaten to various degrees of refinement. Small amounts of wet-strength resins and\/or resin binders may be added to improve strength and abrasion resistance. Useful binders and wet-strength resins include, for example, KYMENE 557H available from the Hercules chemical Company and PAREZ 631 available from American Cyanamid, Inc. Cross-linking agents and\/or hydrating agents may also be added to the pulp mixture. Debonding agents may be added to the pulp mixture to reduce the degree of hydrogen bonding if a very open or loose nonwoven pulp fiber web is desired. One exemplary debonding agent is available from the Quaker Chemical Company, Conshohocken, Pa., under the trade designation QUAKER 2008. The addition of certain debonding agents in the amount of, for example, 1 to 4 percent, by weight, of the composite also appears to reduce the measured static and dynamic coefficients of friction and improve the abrasion resistance of the continuous filament rich side of the composite fabric. The de-bonder is believed to act as a lubricant or friction reducer.","When treating paper webs in accordance with the present disclosure, the additive composition containing the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer dispersion can be applied to the web topically or can be incorporated into the web by being pre-mixed with the fibers that are used to form the web. When applied topically, the additive composition can be applied to the web when the web is wet or dry. In one embodiment, the additive composition may be applied topically to the web during a creping process. For instance, in one embodiment, the additive composition may be sprayed onto the web or onto a heated dryer drum to adhere the web to the dryer drum. The web can then be creped from the dryer drum. When the additive composition is applied to the web and then adhered to the dryer drum, the composition may be uniformly applied over the surface area of the web or may be applied according to a particular pattern.","When topically applied to a paper web, the additive composition may be sprayed onto the web, extruded onto the web, or printed onto the web. When extruded onto the web, any suitable extrusion device may be used, such as a slot-coat extruder or a meltblown dye extruder. When printed onto the web, any suitable printing device may be used. For example, an inkjet printer or a rotogravure printing device may be used.","The dispersion may be incorporated at any point in the paper manufacturing process. The point during the process at which the dispersion is incorporated into the cellulose-based composition may depend upon the desired end properties of the cellulose-based product, as will be detailed later. Incorporation points may include pre-treatment of pulp, co-application in the wet end of the process, post treatment after drying but on the paper machine and topical post treatment. Incorporation of the dispersion of the present invention onto or in the cellulose-based structure may be achieved by any of several methods, as incorporated by reference, and known by those of ordinary skill in the art.","In yet another application, a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer dispersion formed in accordance with the disclosure, is suitable for impregnating a fibrous structure. In certain cases, a fibrous structure impregnated with such a stiffening composition can provide adequate stiffness, elasticity, resilience, adhesion, and shape retention for use in shoe stiffeners, such as toe boxes, counters, and the like. Suitable techniques for impregnation are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/300,993, which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.","One skilled in the art will appreciate that a desirable degree or amount of impregnation can range from a partial saturation of the fibrous structure to a complete saturation of the fibrous structure. The desired degree of impregnation can depend upon variables including the nature of the fiber being impregnated and the nature of impregnate, for example. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the intended end properties of the impregnated structure will influence the selection of the specific ingredients (fibers and dispersions, for example) and processing parameters.","In yet another application, dispersions of the catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer may be useful as toner compositions, wherein at least one selected from the group consisting of a colorant and a magnetic pigment is used with the dispersion, and wherein the dispersion has an average volume diameter particle size from about 0.3 to about 8.0 microns. Techniques for formulating such toner compositions are discussed in co-pending, co-assigned, application U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/779,126 filed on Mar. 3, 2006, which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Briefly, after forming the dispersion, at least a portion of the liquid may be removed to form toner particles. In selected embodiments, substantially all of the water may be removed to form base toner particles. In one embodiment, drying of the dispersion may be accomplished by spray drying the dispersion. As is known in the art, spray drying involves the atomization of a liquid feedstock into a spray of droplets and contacting the droplets with hot air in a drying chamber. The sprays are typically produced by either rotary (wheel) or nozzle atomizers. Evaporation of moisture from the droplets and formation of dry particles proceed under controlled temperature and airflow conditions. Powder is discharged substantially continuously from the drying chamber. Operating conditions and dryer design are selected according to the drying characteristics of the product and powder specification.","Thus, in one embodiment, a dispersion may be formed, and shipped to another location, where the dispersion is subjected to a post-treatment process such as spray drying to form a toner powder.","In select embodiments, it is advantageous to add auxiliary fine particles to the base toner particles in order to improve the fluidity, the electrification stability, or the blocking resistance at a high temperature, etc. The auxiliary fine particles to be fixed on the surface of the base toner particles may be suitably selected for use among various inorganic or organic fine particles.","As the inorganic fine particles, various carbides such as silicon carbide, boron carbide, titanium carbide, zirconium carbide, hafnium carbide, vanadium carbide, tantalum carbide, niobium carbide, tungsten carbide, chromium carbide, molybdenum carbide and calcium carbide, various nitrides such as boron nitride, titanium nitride and zirconium nitride, various borides such as zirconium boride, various oxides such as titanium oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide, aluminum oxide, cerium oxide, silica and colloidal silica, various titanate compounds such as calcium titanate, magnesium titanate and strontium titanate, phosphate compounds such as calcium phosphate, sulfides such as molybdenum disulfide, fluorides such as magnesium fluoride and carbon fluoride, various metal soaps such as aluminum stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate and magnesium stearate, talc, bentonite, various carbon black and conductive carbon black, magnetite and ferrite, may, for example, be employed. As the organic fine particles, fine particles of a styrene resin, an acrylic resin, an epoxy resin or a melamine resin, may, for example, be employed.","Among such auxiliary fine particles, silica, titanium oxide, alumina, zinc oxide, various carbon black or conductive carbon black may, for example, be particularly preferably employed. Further, such auxiliary fine particles may include the above mentioned inorganic or organic fine particles, where the surface of the particles is treated by surface treatment such as hydrophobic treatment by a treating agent such as a silane coupling agent, a titanate coupling agent, a silicone oil, a modified silicone oil, a silicone varnish, a fluorinated silane coupling agent, a fluorinated silicone oil or a coupling agent having amino groups or quaternary ammonium bases. Such treating agents may be used in combination as a mixture of two or more of them.","As a method for adding the auxiliary fine particles to the base toner particles, a method is known to add and blend them by means of a high speed stirring machine such as a Henschel mixer. However, in order to improve the blocking resistance at a high temperature, it is preferred to have the auxiliary fine particles fixed on the surface of the base toner particles. In the present invention, fixing means an addition method employing an apparatus capable of exerting a compression sharing stress (hereinafter referred to as a compression shearing treatment apparatus) or an apparatus capable of melting or softening the surface of the base toner particles (hereinafter referred to as a particle surface-melting treatment apparatus). By such fixing treatment, the auxiliary fine particles may be firmly be fixed to the surface of the base toner particles without substantial pulverization of the base toner particles, whereby blocking resistance during the storage at a high temperature may be improved, and it is possible to produce a toner which is less likely to bring about fusion to components of a copying machine or a printer even in a continuous copying operation.","The above-mentioned compression shearing treatment apparatus is constructed to have a narrow clearance defined by a head surface and a head surface, a head surface and a wall surface, or a wall surface and a wall surface, which are mutually mobile while a distance is maintained, so that the particles to be treated are forcibly passed through the clearance, whereby a compression stress and a shearing stress will be exerted to the surface of the particles without substantially pulverizing them. As the compression shearing treatment apparatus to be used, a mechanofusion apparatus manufactured by Hosokawa Micron K.K., may, for example, be mentioned.","The above-mentioned particle surface-melting treatment apparatus is usually constructed so that a mixture of the base toner fine particles and the auxiliary fine particles is instantaneously heated to a temperature of at least the melting-initiation temperature by means of, for example, a hot air stream thereby to have the auxiliary fine particles fixed. As the particle surface-melting treatment apparatus to be used, a surfacing system manufactured by Nippon Neumatic K.K. may be employed.","In yet another application, dispersions using a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer may be useful as films, adhesives, or other sealing and\/or packaging applications. This particular application involves applying a dispersion formulated in accordance with the above disclosure to a substrate. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that any useful substrate may be used. In particular, a wide variety of polymer substrates may be used, and even more particularly, oriented polymers may be used. Such techniques are disclosed for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20050271888, which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Thus, embodiments of the present invention, provide heat sealable films that may allow for higher packaging line speeds (due to lower heat seal initiation temperatures), provide the ability to seal packages over broad operating windows, and provide good package integrity.","In other words, one or more embodiments of the present invention provide the ability to seal packages over a broad operating window. During startup and shutdown of packaging lines, the temperature of the sealing equipment can often deviate, sometimes by a large amount, from the setpoint. With a packaging film having a low heat seal initiation temperature, an adequate seal can still be generated if the sealing equipment is somewhat cooler than desired.","In order to determine the heat seal initiation temperature, for each coated weight, individual strips (1 inch wide) having no backing may be heat sealed from 50 to 140\u00b0 C. in 10\u00b0 C. increments, using a Packforsk Hot Tack Tester set at 40 psi seal pressure and 0.5 second dwell time. Sealed samples are allowed to equilibrate for at least a day in an ASTM room set at 70\u00b0 F. (21.1\u00b0 C.) and 50% relative humidity before being pulled on Instron model 4501 tensile testing device at a rate of 10 inches per minute. As used herein, the temperature at which a seal strength of 0.5 lb\/in is achieved is defined as the heat seal initiation temperature.","In yet another application, dispersions using a catalytic linear multi-block olefin interpolymer may be useful in forming long fiber-reinforced thermoplastic concentrates. Techniques for forming such concentrates are disclosed in co-pending, co-assigned 60\/697,324, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims.","All priority documents are herein fully incorporated by reference for all jurisdictions in which such incorporation is permitted. Further, all documents cited herein, including testing procedures, are herein fully incorporated by reference for all jurisdictions in which such incorporation is permitted to the extent such disclosure is consistent with the description of the present invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
