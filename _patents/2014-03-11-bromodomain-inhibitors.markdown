folds which bind to N-acetylated lysine residues that are found in some proteins. The BET family of bromodomain containing proteins is comprised of four members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDt). Each member of the BET family employs two bromodomains to recognize N-acetylated lysine residues found primarily, but not exclusively, on the amino-terminal tails of histone proteins. These interactions modulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors to specific genome locations within chromatin. For example, histone-bound BRD4 recruits the transcription factor P-TEFb to promoters, resulting in the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell cycle progression (Yang et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 28: 967-976 (2008)). BRD2 and BRD3 also function as transcriptional regulators of growth promoting genes (LeRoy et al., Mol. Cell 30: 51-60 (2008)). BET family members were recently established as being important for the maintenance of several cancer types (Zuber et al., Nature 478: 524-528 (2011); Mertz et al; Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 108: 16669-16674 (2011); Delmore et al., Cell 146: 1-14, (2011); Dawson et al., Nature 478: 529-533 (2011)). BET family members have also been implicated in mediating acute inflammatory responses through the canonical NF-KB pathway (Huang et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 29: 1375-1387 (2009)) resulting in the upregulation of genes associated with the production of cytokines (Nicodeme et al., Nature 468: 1119-1123, (2010)). Suppression of cytokine induction by BET bromodomain inhibitors has been shown to be an effective approach to treat inflammation-mediated kidney disease in an animal model (Zhang, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 287: 28840-28851 (2012)). BRD2 function has been linked to predisposition for dyslipidemia or improper regulation of adipogenesis, elevated inflammatory profiles and increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases (Denis, Discovery Medicine 10: 489-499 (2010)). The human immunodeficiency virus utilizes BRD4 to initiate transcription of viral RNA from stably integrated viral DNA (Jang et al., Mol. Cell, 19: 523-534 (2005)). BET bromodomain inhibitors have also been shown to reactivate HIV transcription in models of latent T cell infection and latent monocyte infection (Banerjee, et al, J. Leukocyte Biol. doi:10.1189\/jlb.0312165). BRDt has an important role in spermatogenesis that is blocked by BET bromodomain inhibitors (Matzuk, et al., Cell 150: 673-684 (2012)). Thus, compounds that inhibit the binding of BET family bromodomains to their cognate acetylated lysine proteins are being pursued for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory diseases, kidney diseases, diseases involving metabolism or fat accumulation, and some viral infections, as well as for providing a method for male contraception. Accordingly, there is an ongoing medical need to develop new drugs to treat these indications.","In one aspect the present invention provides for compounds of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0003"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"37.42mm","wi":"54.02mm","file":"US09050346-20150609-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein\n\n","In another aspect, the present invention provides for methods for treating or preventing disorders that are ameliorated by inhibition of BET.

The term \u201cparenterally\u201d as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d as used herein, means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as, but not limited to, lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as, but not limited to, corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as, but not limited to, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as, but not limited to, cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as, but not limited to, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as, but not limited to, ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as, but not limited to, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as, but not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.","Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.","These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.","In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility.

In determining the effective amount of the compound to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of the disorder being treated, the physician can evaluate factors such as the circulating plasma levels of the compound, compound toxicities, and\/or the progression of the disease, etc. In general, the dose equivalent of a compound is from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg for a typical subject.","For administration, compounds of the formula I can be administered at a rate determined by factors that can include, but are not limited to, the LDof the compound, the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound, contraindicated drugs, and the side-effects of the compound at various concentrations, as applied to the mass and overall health of the subject. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.","The compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention can be administered at the initial dosage of about 0.001 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg daily. In certain embodiments, the daily dose range is from about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Treatment may be initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired.","Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.","The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art.

Accordingly, compounds of formula I may be used to treat cancer, including, but not limited to acoustic neuroma, acute leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia (monocytic, myeloblastic, adenocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, astrocytoma, myelomonocytic and promyelocytic), acute t-cell leukemia, basal cell carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, bronchogenic carcinoma, cervical cancer, chondrosarcoma, chordoma, choriocarcinoma, chronic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic (granulocytic) leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, craniopharyngioma, cystadenocarcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, dysproliferative changes (dysplasias and metaplasias), embryonal carcinoma, endometrial cancer, endotheliosarcoma, ependymoma, epithelial carcinoma, erythroleukemia, esophageal cancer, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, essential thrombocythemia, Ewing's tumor, fibrosarcoma, follicular lymphoma, germ cell testicular cancer, glioma, glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, heavy chain disease, hemangioblastoma, hepatoma, hepatocellular cancer, hormone insensitive prostate cancer, leiomyosarcoma, leukemia, liposarcoma, lung cancer, lymphagioendotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's), malignancies and hyperproliferative disorders of the bladder, breast, colon, lung, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, skin and uterus, lymphoid malignancies of T-cell or B-cell origin, leukemia, lymphoma, medullary carcinoma, medulloblastoma, melanoma, meningioma, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, myelogenous leukemia, myeloma, myxosarcoma, neuroblastoma, NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), non-small cell lung cancer, oligodendroglioma, oral cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, papillary adenocarcinomas, papillary carcinoma, pinealoma, polycythemia vera, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, sarcoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, seminoma, skin cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, solid tumors (carcinomas and sarcomas), small cell lung cancer, stomach cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, synovioma, sweat gland carcinoma, thyroid cancer, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia, testicular tumors, uterine cancer and Wilms' tumor.","Further, compounds of formula I may be used to treat inflammatory diseases, inflammatory conditions, and autoimmune diseases, including, but not limited to: Addison's disease, acute gout, ankylosing spondylitis, asthma, atherosclerosis, Behcet's disease, bullous skin diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn's disease, dermatitis, eczema, giant cell arteritis, glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Kawasaki disease, lupus nephritis, multiple sclerosis, myocarditis, myositis, nephritis, organ transplant rejection, osteoarthritis, pancreatitis, pericarditis, Polyarteritis nodosa, pneumonitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleritis, sclerosing cholangitis, sepsis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Takayasu's Arteritis, toxic shock, thyroiditis, type I diabetes, ulcerative colitis, uveitis, vitiligo, vasculitis, and Wegener's granulomatosis.","Compounds of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be used to treat AIDS.","The compounds of formula I can be co-administered to a subject. The term \u201cco-administered\u201d means the administration of two or more different pharmaceutical agents or treatments (e.g., radiation treatment) that are administered to a subject by combination in the same pharmaceutical composition or separate pharmaceutical compositions. Thus co-administration involves administration at the same time of a single pharmaceutical composition comprising two or more pharmaceutical agents or administration of two or more different compositions to the same subject at the same or different times.","The compounds of the invention can be co-administered with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more agents to treat a cancer, where examples of the agents include, such as radiation, alkylating agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, antibodies, antimetabolites, antimitotics, antiproliferatives, antivirals, aurora kinase inhibitors, apoptosis promoters (for example, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Bfl-1) inhibitors, activators of death receptor pathway, Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors, BiTE (Bi-Specific T cell Engager) antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, biologic response modifiers, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, DVDs (dual variable domain antibodies), leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB2) receptor inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors, heat shock protein (HSP)-90 inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, hormonal therapies, immunologicals, inhibitors of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), intercalating antibiotics, kinase inhibitors, kinesin inhibitors, Jak2 inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, microRNA's, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitors, multivalent binding proteins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), poly ADP (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, platinum chemotherapeutics, polo-like kinase (Plk) inhibitors, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (bromodomain) inhibitors, proteosome inhibitors, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, etinoids\/deltoids plant alkaloids, small inhibitory ribonucleic acids (siRNAs), topoisomerase inhibitors, ubiquitin ligase inhibitors, and the like, and in combination with one or more of these agents.","BiTE antibodies are bi-specific antibodies that direct T-cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, 1997, 158 (12), 5783).","SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and\/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2\u2032-deoxynucleotide, 2\u2032\u2014OCH-containing ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-F-ribonucleotides, 2\u2032-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single\/double strands, bulges, nicks\/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and\/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5\u2032- and\/or the 3\u2032-ends of a given strand.","Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term \u201cmultispecific binding protein\u201d means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF, or C-met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.","Alkylating agents include altretamine, AMD-473, AP-5280, apaziquone, bendamustine,

induced IL-6 (Interleukin-6) production in mice. Fox Chase SCID\u00ae female mice (Charles Rivers Labs, 5 per group) received an intraperitoneal challenge of lipopolysaccharide (2.5 mg\/kg, L2630 0111:B4) one hour after oral administration of compounds. Mice were euthanized 2 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection, blood was removed by cardiac puncture, and then the serum harvested from the blood samples was frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. On the day of the assay the serum samples were brought to room temperature and then diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Interleukin-6 measurements were performed using a cytokine assay from Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, Md.) for mouse serum analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol and read on a SECTOR Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Md.) instrument. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software (version 5.0) incorporating Dunnett's one way ANOVA. The IL-6 mean and standard deviation of the group of vehicle treated animals were compared with the IL-6 mean and standard deviation of the group treated with drug.

A suspension of cancer cells (5\u00d710per 0.1 mL) prepared in RPMI culture medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was diluted 1:1 with a solution of Matrigel\u2122 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and inoculated subcutaneously into the right hind flank of female SCID-beige (Charles River Labs) mice. Randomization into treatment and vehicle control groups (10\/group) occurred when the mean tumor volume reached approximately 250 mm. Compounds were formulated in 2.5% DMSO, 10% EtOH, 27.5% PEG 400, 60% Phosol 53 MCT. Administration of compound or vehicle was initiated on the day following randomization and continued for 21 days. Tumors were measured twice a week throughout the treatment period using a pair of calipers and tumor volumes were calculated according to the formula V=L\u00d7W\/2 (V: volume, mm; L: length, mm. W: width, mm) Tumor growth inhibition was calculated based on the mean tumor volume measured on the first day that the mean volume of the vehicle group exceeded 2000 mmaccording to the formula % TGI=100-mean tumor volume of treatment group\/mean tumor volume of control group x 100.
