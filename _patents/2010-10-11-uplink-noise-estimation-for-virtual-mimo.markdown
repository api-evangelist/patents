abstract: A system and methods for estimating a noise power level in an uplink signal for a virtual MIMO system is disclosed. The system comprises a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) module configured to obtain a DMRS receive symbol from the uplink signal and determine a DMRS sequence for a first UE in the virtual MIMO system. An autocorrelation module is configured to calculate an average autocorrelation value for the subcarriers in the uplink signal.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a National Stage of PCT\/CN2010\/001585, filed on Oct. 11, 2010, entitled \u201cUPLINK NOISE ESTIMATION FOR VIRTUAL MIMO\u201d, of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","When information is transmitted over a wireless channel then the received signal can be distorted due to the effects of multipath transmissions. Multipath transmissions can be caused by reflections of the transmitted signal off of objects such as buildings, vehicles, and other types of obstructions. The result is that multiple copies of the transmitted signal arrive at the receiver, with each signal having a certain time delay. The amount of the time delay is proportional to the length of the path the signal traveled. Obviously, signals that are reflected multiple times will travel a longer path than a signal with a direct line of sight.","The amount of time between a first signal (typically the line of sight signal) and a last reflected signal arrive at the receiver is referred to as the delay spread. In cellular communication applications delay spreads can be on the order of several microseconds. The delay induced by multipath can cause a symbol received along a delayed path to \u201cbleed\u201d into a subsequent symbol arriving at the receiver via a more direct path. This is typically referred to as inter-symbol interference (ISI). In a single carrier communication system, the symbol times decrease as the data rates increase. At very high data rates (with correspondingly shorter symbol periods) it is possible for ISI to exceed an entire symbol period and spill into a second or third subsequent symbol. This can cause significant problems at the receiver.","In addition to problems in the time domain, there can be additional problems in the frequency domain due to multipath distortion. As the multiple reflected signals are combined at the receiver, some frequencies within the signal passband can undergo constructive interference (a linear summation of in-phase signals), while other signals may undergo destructive interference (a linear summation of out-of-phase signals). This can result in a composite received signal that is distorted by frequency selective fading. The ability to estimate signal power and noise power for a received signal can significantly improve the ability to receive a signal that has distortion.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For example, an object that is \u201csubstantially\u201d enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However, generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of \u201csubstantially\u201d is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. The following definitions are provided for clarity of the overview and embodiments described below.","Single carrier systems compensate for channel distortion via time domain equalization. Generally, time domain equalizers compensate for multipath induced distortion by one of two methods:\n\n","In either case, channel equalization implementation becomes increasingly complex as data rates increase. Symbol times become shorter and receiver sample clocks are selected that are proportionally faster. This leads to more severe inter-symbol interference that may span several symbol periods.","Data sent on single carrier signals can only be increased by increasing the data rate. In order to reduce inter-symbol interference while allowing an increase in data rates, the data can be sent on multiple parallel paths. For instance, in Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation (OFDM), the communication systems do not rely on increased symbol rates in order to achieve higher data rates. Rather, OFDM systems break the available bandwidth into many sub-carriers having a narrower frequency bandwidth and transmit the data in parallel streams. Each OFDM symbol is a linear combination of the instantaneous signals of each of the sub-carriers in the channel. Because data is transmitted in parallel rather than serially, OFDM symbols are typically substantially longer than symbols on a single carrier system of equivalent data rate.","Each OFDM symbol is typically preceded by a cyclic prefix (CP). The length of the CP is selected so that preceding symbols do not spill over into the data portion of the signal, which is also referred to as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) period. Thus, the CP can be used to effectively eliminate ISI.","However, since the OFDM symbol is a linear combination of the instantaneous signals in the sub-carriers, the signal can have a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This can reduce the efficiency of the transmitter radio frequency power amplifier (RFPA) and create a need for analog to digital and digital to analog converters with a high dynamic range.","Sub-carriers in OFDM signals can be very tightly spaced to make efficient use of available bandwidth. The close spacing of sub-carriers is possible due to the orthogonality of the sub-carriers. An OFDM system can achieve zero inter-carrier interference (ICI) if each subcarrier is sampled precisely at its center frequency. However, the transmitter and receiver local oscillators used to perform down conversion of the radio frequency carrier signal will invariably drift, so active means are used to keep them synchronized. Each base station periodically sends synchronization signals which are used by User Equipment (UE) (i.e. the user's cell phone or mobile computing device) to stay in sync with the base station clock. Even so, other sources such as Doppler shifts and oscillator phase noise can still result in frequency errors. Uncorrected frequency errors can result in ICI. The signal frequency can be tracked continuously to correct offsets in the baseband processor to avoid excessive ICI that may result in dropped packets.","The 3Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) advanced mobile communication standard was submitted as a candidate 4generation (4G) system to the Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) in the Fall of 2009 and is expected to be adopted in 2011. The proposed standard uses OFDM Multiple Access (OFDMA) in the physical layer generic frame structure.  provides an example illustration of an LTE frame structure. LTE frames are 10 milliseconds (msec) in duration. Each frame is divided into 10 subframes, with each subframe being 1.0 msec long. Each subframe is further divided into two slots that are each 0.5 msec in duration. Slots can include of either 6 or 7 OFDM symbols and cyclic prefixes, depending on whether the normal or extended cyclic prefix is employed.","In OFDMA, users are allocated a specific number of subcarriers for a predetermined amount of time. The minimum number of subcarriers over a minimum amount of time in the LTE standard is referred to as a physical resource block (PRB), which represents the smallest subdivision. Each PRB is defined in the LTE standard as comprising 12 consecutive subcarriers for one slot (either 6 or 7 OFDM symbols in 0.5 msec) of duration.  shows an example subframe that is comprised of two slots, providing a first PRB  and a second PRB .","Rather than using a preamble to facilitate a carrier offset estimate, channel estimation, timing synchronization, and so forth, LTE uses special reference signals that are embedded in the PRBs, as shown in  by the designation of \u201cRS\u201d. In the uplink, the reference signals may be transmitted during the 4th symbol of each slot when the short CP is used. The channel response of subcarriers bearing the reference symbols can be computed directly. Interpolation can be used to estimate the channel response on the remaining subcarriers.","SC-FDMA","Limiting power consumption for wireless connections with user equipment (UE) enables the devices to operate longer on a single battery charge. The UE may be a cell phone, a mobile computing device such as a mobile internet devices, a tablet computing device, a laptop computer, an embedded communication device in a vehicle, and so forth. As previously discussed, the use of OFDM causes a relatively large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This can reduce the efficiency of the transmitter radio frequency power amplifier (RFPA) and create a need for analog to digital and digital to analog converters with a high dynamic range, thereby reducing efficiency.","In order to increase the efficiency by reducing the PAPR, the LTE standard suggests the use of Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) for uplink communication from the UE to the base station. The basic transmitter and receiver architecture is very similar to OFDMA, and it offers the same degree of multipath protection, while reducing the PAPR since the underlying waveform is essentially single-carrier.","However, the term \u201csingle-carrier\u201d is somewhat of a misnomer, as SC-FDMA transmissions can be thought of as linear summations of discrete subcarriers. The LTE frame structure for an SC-FDMA downlink is the same as the structure illustrated in , though different reference signals may be used. The reference signals in each uplink PRB may also be communicated at different locations in the PRB than is illustrated in . These details are disclosed in the 3GPP LTE standard.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"102"},"Constellation mapper: Converts incoming bit stream to single carrier symbols (BPSK, QPSK, or 16 QAM depending on channel conditions);","Serial\/parallel converter: Formats the time domain single carrier symbols into blocks for input to the fast Fourier transform engine;","M-point DFT: Converts each time domain single carrier symbol block into M discrete tones using discrete Fourier transform;","Subcarrier mapping: Maps discrete Fourier transform output tones to specified subcarriers for transmission. SC-FDMA systems can either use contiguous tones (localized) or uniformly spaced tones (distributed);","N-point IDFT: Converts mapped subcarriers back into time domain (using inverse discrete Fourier transform) for transmission;","Cyclic prefix and pulse shaping: Cyclic prefix is pre-pended to the composite SC-FDMA symbol to provide multipath immunity in the same manner as described for OFDM; pulse shaping is employed to prevent spectral regrowth; and","RFE: Converts the digital signal to analog and upconverts the signal for radio frequency transmission;","One or more antennas  can be used to transmit the radio frequency signal. Any type of antenna may be used including, for example, dipoles, patch antennas, helical antennas, and so forth.","In the receive side chain , the process is effectively reversed. Multipath distortion for an SC-FDMA signal can be handled with the removal of the cyclic prefix, conversion of the signal to frequency domain, and a channel correction applied on a subcarrier-by-subcarrier basis. While the SC-FDMA signal that is represented by the discrete subcarriers is actually single carrier. Unlike an OFDM signal, SC-FDMA subcarriers are not independently modulated. As a result, PAPR is lower than for OFDM transmissions.","MIMO","The use of multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas, commonly referred to as Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), can provide significant increases in data throughput and link range without additional bandwidth or transmit power. MIMO achieves the increase in data throughput and range by enabling higher spectral efficiency (more bits per second per hertz of bandwidth) and an improvement in link reliability and\/or diversity (reduced fading).","The number of antennas used in a MIMO system can vary. The number of transmitter antennas may be the same as the number of receive antennas, such as a 2\u00d72 or 3\u00d73 array. Alternatively, more antennas may be located on one side, such as a 2\u00d73 or 2\u00d74 array. Typically, a UE is limited in the number of antennas that can be located on the device. This is due to spatial separation requirements that are needed to provide adequate spatial diversity for the antennas. A base station, however, can typically incorporate a desired number of antennas with a sufficient separation.","In order to successfully receive a MIMO transmission, a receiver can determine the channel impulse response from each transmitting antenna. In LTE, the channel impulse response for each channel is determined by sequentially transmitting known reference signals from each transmitting antenna, as shown in . Once a channel impulse response has been determined for each channel then the channels can be used to communicate simultaneously. In a 2\u00d72 MIMO system, there are a total of four channel impulse responses corresponding to the four separate channels that can be formed between the antennas.","Many types of user equipment, such as cell phones and other types of handheld computing devices do not have a sufficient size to incorporate multiple antennas with adequate spacing between the antennas. The advantages of MIMO can still be obtained through partnering with the antennas of other devices. The coordination of transmission and reception using the single or multiple antenna(s) of two or more separate devices to one or more devices having at least two antennas is commonly referred to as virtual MIMO.","For instance, two devices having a single antenna can be configured to coordinate transmission to two additional devices that each has a single antenna. Typically, a virtual MIMO system is comprised of two or more devices having at least one antenna that coordinate transmission to a base station with at least two antennas.","Estimating Noise Power for Virtual MIMO","One challenge for communicating with virtual MIMO is that a high level of precision in channel estimation is typically used to enable virtual MIMO. Channel estimation and equalization in an LTE uplink receiver using minimum mean square error (MMSE) requires an estimation of noise power. An estimation of noise power is also used to select an optimal modulation and coding scheme to improve a system's spectrum efficiency. In the case of uplink virtual MIMO, two different user equipment devices transmit in the same space-time resource blocks. This can cause inter-user interference, which increases the difficulty of noise power estimation.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a system and method for virtual MIMO uplink noise power estimation is disclosed. The system and method use the LTE's demodulation reference signal (DRMS) sequence structure. The estimation only needs to calculate three correlation values for each DMRS symbol, thereby enabling a low complexity.","The algorithms disclosed below describe a noise power estimation process for a virtual MIMO LTE uplink with two UEs (1,2). It can be assumed that the received data at the m-th symbol and the n-th subcarrier can be expressed as follows:\n\n\u221a{square root over ()}\u221a{square root over ()}+\u221a{square root over ()}w\u2003\u2003(1),\n","where H(i=1,2) is the channel frequency response of UE(i=1,2), S(i=1,2) is the average power of UE(i=1,2), P(i=1,2) is the average power of the channel response on the UEchannel (i=1,2), dis the DMRS symbol of UE(i=1,2), wis the additional Guassian white noise whose variance is 1 and mean value is zero, and W is noise power. The objective is to estimate the noise power W.","The autocorrelation function of Yis defined
