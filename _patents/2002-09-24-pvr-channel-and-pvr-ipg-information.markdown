{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is related to copending U.S. utility patent application entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING USER-DEFINED MEDIA PRESENTATIONS,\u201d filed on Apr. 6, 2001 and accorded Ser. No. 09\/827,470, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention is generally related to television systems, and, more particularly, is related to personal video recording and interactive program guides.","With recent advances in digital transmission technology, subscriber television systems are now capable of providing much more than the traditional analog broadcast video. In implementing enhanced programming, the home communication terminal device (\u201cHCT\u201d), otherwise known as the set-top box, has become an important computing device for accessing media content services (and media content within those services) and navigating a user through a maze of available services. In addition to supporting traditional analog broadcast video functionality, digital HCTs (or \u201cDHCTs\u201d) now also support an increasing number of two-way digital services such as video-on-demand and personal video recording.","Typically, a DHCT is connected to a cable or satellite, or generally, a subscriber television system, and includes hardware and software necessary to provide the functionality of the digital television system at the user's site. Some of the software executed by a DHCT can be downloaded and\/or updated via the subscriber television system. Each DHCT also typically includes a processor, communication components, and memory, and is connected to a television or other display device, such as a personal computer. While many conventional DHCTs are stand-alone devices that are externally connected to a television, a DHCT and\/or its functionality may be integrated into a television or personal computer or even an audio device such as a programmable radio, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.","DHCTs are typically capable of providing users with a very large number and variety of media content choices. DHCTs equipped with personal video recording functionality (e.g., via the use of a coupled storage device) provide the user with the opportunity to record favorite media content and\/or to record and subsequently view media content he or she would otherwise have missed due to, for example, scheduling conflicts. Many DHCTs provide users with television program information via interactive program guides (IPGs), which allow a user to scroll through and\/or search available program information for broadcast and\/or on-demand media content, but current mechanisms provide limited program information for recorded media content and are cumbersome to use.","Thus, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the industry to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.","The preferred embodiments of the invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. One way of understanding the preferred embodiments of the invention includes viewing them within the context of a subscriber television system, and more particularly within the context of a media client device, such as a digital home communication terminal (DHCT), that provides for user interaction with what is displayed on a television. Although other communication environments are considered to be within the scope of the preferred embodiments, the preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in the context of a DHCT that receives media content from a headend over a subscriber network as one example implementation among many.","Because the preferred embodiments of the invention can be well understood in the context of a subscriber television system environment, an initial description of a subscriber television system is followed with further description of the headend and DHCT (and coupled storage device) that are included within the subscriber television system. The preferred embodiments of the invention include, among other things, a system that displays information about media content recorded in the storage device that is coupled to the DHCT. Following the description of the subscriber television system components is a description of an interactive program guide (IPG), and how the preferred embodiments of the invention are used in the context of an IPG. The displayed information, or media content information, will preferably be manifested in one or more display channels in an IPG. An IPG is typically presented as a grid with rows of display channels and columns of time slots. Listings of current and scheduled media content instance presentations, preferably identified by title of a particular media content instance (e.g., TV episode, movie), are placed in the grid according to the scheduled presentation.","In the preferred embodiments, listings for the media content stored in a storage device coupled to the DHCT are presented in the IPG in a somewhat similar format to that used for broadcast media content. In one preferred embodiment, broadcast media content that is recorded (either temporarily or permanently recorded, including scheduled recordings, live recordings, or recordings designated as permanent from a storage buffer, among others) to the storage device automatically has the corresponding title displayed in a personal video recording (PVR) channel in the IPG within a time slot that reflects the duration of the recorded presentation.","Following the description of how the preferred embodiments can be used in an IPG is a description of how the preferred embodiments include a series of user interface screens for configuring PVR channels in the IPG. These screens, as will be explained below, can be evoked during the recording process of the PVR functions of the DHCT and\/or via a user settings menu screen. In the preferred embodiments, the user can configure one or more PVR channels to reflect the type of media content that is recorded in the storage device. For example, assume the user desires to record all Barney episodes for his or her child. The user can configure the DHCT PVR functionality to record all episodes of Barney to the storage device. Also, the user can configure one of a plurality of PVR channels in the IPG to not only be entitled the Barney Channel, but also to display the titles of all of the recorded Barney episodes into the newly configured Barney channel. Displaying the titles, or other media content information, of the recorded media content into PVR channels in the IPG is herein referred to as channel mapping. Similarly, the user can configure other PVR channels based on the type of downloaded media content. For example, the user can configure a News Channel to channel map all of the instances of recorded news programming. Further, the user can configure time-based channels, such as a Last Night Channel to channel map all of the media content recorded from the prior evening, for example.","The preferred embodiments of the invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those having ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, all \u201cexamples\u201d given herein are intended to be non-limiting, and are provided as an exemplary list among many other examples contemplated but not shown.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","11","16","18","10","10"]},"A DHCT  is typically situated at the residence or place of business of a user and may be a stand-alone unit or integrated into another device such as, for example, a television set or a personal computer or other display devices, or an audio device. The customer's premises may be a user's residence or place of business. The DHCT  receives signals (video, audio and\/or other data) from the headend  through the network  and provides any reverse information to the headend  through the network .","The headend  receives, among other data and\/or media content, program guide data from a program guide information provider (not shown). The program guide information (data) preferably comprises data corresponding to services that may be provided via the DHCT . The headend  edits the program guide data and transmits the edited program guide data to the DHCT  via the network . The headend  may include one or more server devices (not shown) for providing video and\/or audio and\/or data to media client devices such as the DHCT . The headend  and the DHCT  cooperate to provide a user with television services via the television (not shown). The television services may include, for example, broadcast television services, cable television services, premium television services, video-on-demand (VOD) services, and\/or pay-per-view (PPV) services, among others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["11","11","11","11","18","11"]},"A digital network control system (DNCS)  provides management, monitoring, and control of the network's elements and of the broadcast services provided to users. A content provider such as a program guide information provider transmits data for television program guides through a network interface  to the DNCS  of the headend , preferably using a file transfer protocol (FTP). The DNCS  includes functionality that defines relationships between channel names listed in the program guide data received from the program guide provider and the numbered channels that are available via the DHCT . This functionality is used by the DNCS  to edit the program guide data to include channel numbers that correspond to the listed channel names. After the program guide data is edited by the DNCS , it is transmitted to the DHCT  preferably using a broadcast file system (BFS) server . The BFS server  and its counterpart, a BFS client module  in the DHCT , are part of a file broadcasting system. The BFS server  repeatedly sends data through a network interface  to the DHCT  via a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modem  over a period of time in a cyclical manner so that the DHCT  may access the data as needed. Of course other mechanisms and techniques may be utilized to transfer data to the DHCT .","A quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modem  is responsible for transporting out-of-band IP (internet protocol) datagram traffic between the distribution headend  and a DHCT . Data transmitted or received by the QPSK modem  may be routed by a headend router . The headend router  may be used to deliver upstream data to the various server applications (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["16","11","341","16","16","363","11","16","342","11","18","11","18"]},"The DHCT  preferably includes one or more processors, such as processor , for controlling operations of the DHCT , an output system  for driving the television display , and at least one tuner system  for tuning into a particular television channel or frequency to display media content and for sending and receiving various types of data or media content to and from the headend . The DHCT  may include, in other embodiments, multiple tuners for receiving downloaded (or transmitted) media content. The tuner system  enables the DHCT  to tune to downstream media and data transmissions, thereby allowing a user to receive digital and\/or analog media content delivered in the downstream transmission via the subscriber television system. The tuner system  includes, in one implementation, an out-of-band tuner for bidirectional QPSK data communication and one or more QAM tuners (in band) for receiving television signals. Additionally, a receiver  receives externally generated information, such as user inputs or commands from an input device, such as remote control device , or other devices.","The DHCT  processes analog and\/or digital transmission signals for storage in the storage device , and\/or for display to the television . The DHCT  preferably includes a signal processing system  and a media engine . The components of the signal processing system  are capable of QAM demodulation, forward error correction, and demultiplexing MPEG-2 transport streams, and parsing elementary streams and packetized elementary streams. Additional components, not shown, include an analog decoder and compression engine for processing an analog transmission signal and, in one implementation, converting it to compressed audio and video streams that are produced in accordance with the syntax and semantics of a designated audio and video coding method, such as specified by the MPEG-2 audio and MPEG-2 video ISO (International Organization for Standardization or ISO) standard, among others.","The signal processing system  outputs packetized compressed streams and presents them as input for storage in the storage device  via an interface , or in other implementations, as input to a media engine  for decompression by a video decompression engine (not shown) and an audio decompression engine (not shown) for display on the TV . One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the signal processing system  will preferably include other components not shown, including memory, decryptors, samplers, digitizers (e.g., analog-to-digital converters), and multiplexers, among other components. Further, it will be understood that one or more of the components listed above will interface with the processor  and\/or system memory  (and\/or dedicated memory for a particular component), to facilitate data transfer and\/or processing of the video and\/or audio signal for display and\/or storage.","One or more programmed software applications are executed by utilizing the computing resources in the DHCT . Note that an application typically includes a client part and a server counterpart that cooperate to provide the complete functionality of the application. The applications may be resident in FLASH memory  or downloaded (or uploaded) into DRAM . Applications stored in FLASH memory  or DRAM  are executed by the processor  (e.g., a central processing unit or digital signal processor) under the auspices of the operating system . Data required as input by an application is stored in DRAM  or FLASH memory  and read by the processor  as need be during the course of application execution. Input data may be data stored in DRAM  by a secondary application or other source, either internal or external to the DHCT , or possibly anticipated by the application and thus created with the application at the time it was generated as a software application, in which case it is stored in FLASH memory . Data generated by an application is stored in DRAM  by the processor  during the course of application execution. DRAM  also includes application memory  that various applications may use for storing and\/or retrieving-data.","An application referred to as a navigator  is also resident in FLASH memory  for providing a navigation framework for services provided by the DHCT . The navigator  registers for and in some cases reserves certain user inputs related to navigational keys such as channel increment\/decrement, last channel, favorite channel, etc. The navigator  also provides users with television related menu options that correspond to DHCT functions such as, for example, blocking a channel or a group of channels from being displayed in a channel menu presented on a screen display.","The FLASH memory  also contains a platform library . The platform library  is a collection of utilities useful to applications, such as a timer manager, a compression manager, a configuration manager, a hyper text markup language (HTML) parser, a database manager, a widget toolkit, a string manager, and other utilities (not shown). These utilities are accessed by applications via application programming interfaces (APIs) as necessary so that each application does not have to contain these utilities. Two components of the platform library  that are shown in  are a window manager  and a service application manager (SAM) client .","The window manager  provides a mechanism for implementing the sharing of the screen regions and user input. The window manager  on the DHCT  is responsible for, as directed by one or more applications, implementing the creation, display, and deallocation of the limited DHCT  screen resources. It allows multiple applications to share the screen by assigning ownership of screen regions, or windows. The window manager  communicates with the resource manager  to coordinate available resources (such as display memory) among different resource consuming processes. Such processes may be directly or indirectly invoked by one or more applications.","The SAM client  is a client component of a client-server pair of components, with the server component (not shown) being located on the headend , preferably in the DNCS  (). A SAM database  (i.e., structured data such as a database or data structure) in DRAM  includes a data structure of services and a data structure of channels that are created and updated by the headend . Herein, database will refer to a database, structured data or other data structures as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Applications can also be downloaded into DRAM  at the request of the SAM client , typically in response to a request by the user or in response to a message from the headend . In the example DHCT  illustrated in , DRAM  includes a media-on-demand (MOD) application , an e-mail application , a PVR application , and a web browser application . It should be clear to one with ordinary skill in the art that these applications are not limiting and merely serve as examples for embodiments of the invention. Furthermore, one or more DRAM based applications may be resident, as an alternative embodiment, in FLASH memory . These applications, and others provided by the subscriber television system operator, are top-level software entities on the network for providing services to the user.","FLASH also includes a BFS client module  that is preferably resident in the operating system , and which cooperates with a server counterpart (as described above) to provide a directory of modules such as applications that are cyclically broadcast.","An executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system (OS) component, or to a client platform component, or to an application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in and execute out of DRAM  and\/or FLASH memory . Likewise, data input into or output from any executable program can reside in DRAM  or FLASH memory . Furthermore, an executable program or algorithm corresponding to an operating system component, or to a client platform component, or to an application, or to respective parts thereof, can reside in FLASH memory , or in a local storage device (such as storage device ) externally connected to or integrated into the DHCT  and be transferred into DRAM  for execution. Likewise, data input for an executable program can reside in FLASH memory  or a storage device and be transferred into DRAM  for use by an executable program or algorithm. In addition, data output by an executable program can be written into DRAM  by an executable program or algorithm and be transferred into FLASH memory  or into a storage device. In other embodiments, the executable code is not transferred, but instead, functionality is effected by other mechanisms.","The DHCT  can also include one or more wireless or wired interfaces, also called communication ports , for receiving and\/or transmitting data to other devices. For instance, the DHCT  may feature USB (Universal Serial Bus), Ethernet (for connection to a computer), IEEE-1394 (for connection to media content devices in an entertainment center), serial, and\/or parallel ports. The user inputs may be, for example, provided by an input device including a computer or transmitter with buttons or keys located either on the exterior of the terminal or by a hand-held remote control device  or keyboard that includes user actuated buttons, or even aural input (c.g., voice activated).","The DHCT  includes at least one storage device  to provide storage for downloaded media content. The storage device  can be an optical storage device or a magnetic storage device, among others, and is preferably a hard disk drive. The storage device  comprises storage for media content and\/or data that can be written to for storage and later read from for retrieval for presentation. The storage device  preferably includes at least one hard disk . Throughout this disclosure, references relating to writing to or reading from the storage device , or references regarding recordings from or to the storage device  will be understood to mean that such read or write operations are occurring to the actual medium (for example, the hard disk ) of the storage device . The storage device  is also comprised of a controller  that preferably receives operating instructions from the device driver  of the operating system  and implements those instructions to cause read and\/or write operations to the hard disk .","The storage device  is preferably internal to the DHCT , coupled to a common bus through a communication interface , preferably an integrated drive electronics (IDE) interface or small computer system interface (SCSI), although IEEE-1394 or USB can be used. In other embodiments, the storage device  can be externally connected to (and thus removable from) the DHCT  via a communication port  implemented as IEEE-1394 or USB or as a data interface port such as a SCSI or an IDE interface. In one implementation, under the auspices of the real-time operating system  and executed by the processor , and in coordination with the personal video recording (PVR) application , the device driver , and the device controller , downloaded media content (herein understood to also refer to other types of data, in addition to, or instead of, media content instances) are received in the DHCT  via the communications interface , processed as described above, and stored in a temporary cache (not shown) in memory . The temporary cache is implemented and managed to enable media content transfers from the temporary cache to the storage device , or, in concert with the insertion of a newly arriving media content into the temporary cache.","In one implementation, the processor , in communication generally with the device driver  and the storage device controller  and the signal processing system , effect retrieval of compressed video streams, compressed audio streams, and data streams corresponding to one or more media content instances from the storage device . Retrieved streams are deposited in an output cache in the storage device  and transferred to DRAM , and then processed for playback according to mechanisms well known to those having ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, one or more media content instances are retrieved and routed from the hard disk  to the media engine  for video and audio decoding simultaneously, and then further processed for eventual presentation on a display device or other device.","The PVR application  provides for media content recording functionality by enabling the temporary writing to, and if requested, more permanent recording (i.e., relatively permanent) to the storage device . Media content can be transmitted (or downloaded) from a remote location, such as, for example, a remote server located in the headend , or from a home communication network, or from consumer electronic devices. Downloaded media content that is received at each tuner of tuner system  is temporarily stored, or buffered, on the hard disk  of the storage device . The corresponding space on the hard disk  is called buffer space, or a time shift buffer (TSB) . In a preferred embodiment, each tuner in tuner system  has a respective TSB . Although one TSB  is shown, it will be understood that more TSBs can be used with multiple tuners. Note that buffering is understood to include temporarily storing media content, received from a local attached device (e.g., a camera, etc.) and\/or either from reception of a broadcast digital channel or a digital compressed version of a broadcast analog channel, and\/or data, in the buffer space, or TSB , of the storage device .","Under normal operation, the PVR application  effectively associates a temporary recording designation with the media content received into the TSB . The media content stored in the TSB  will either be deleted (i.e., the clusters storing the media content will be configured as writeable for eventual write operations that overwrite the media content within those clusters) or retained (through election by the user as one example) as a permanent recording. A permanent recording will be understood to include media content that is stored for an extended period of time, for example as decided by the user. Permanent recordings can be implemented by the user electing in advance to make a scheduled recording of a media content instance that has not yet been tuned to at the DHCT . A permanent recording can also be achieved by selecting a media content instance stored in the TSB  and designating the media content instance as permanent. Permanent recordings will preferably be more permanent than media content in the TSB , and permanent recordings can eventually be deleted from the disk space, typically at the explicit request of a user, as one example. The PVR application  maintains a data structure, or data record, for every downloaded media content instance. This data structure is preferably maintained on the hard disk  of the storage device , but can be maintained in memory  also.","The time shift buffer can be managed and implemented according to several mechanisms. Further information pertaining to creating and maintaining the TSB , as well as information pertaining to the processing of incoming digital and\/or analog transmission signals, can be found in the applications entitled, \u201cCONTROLLING SUBSTANTIALLY CONSTANT BUFFER CAPACITY FOR PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDING WITH CONSISTENT USER INTERFACE OF AVAILABLE DISK SPACE,\u201d filed Dec. 6, 2001 under Ser.

In one preferred embodiment, the user can record from an IPG screen, as will be described below. An example remote control device  to provide input to the DHCT  is illustrated in . Rewind  and fast-forward  buttons enable a user to access buffered media content instances in the TSB . Record button  enables the user to designate as permanently recorded any media content instance buffered into the TSB , or to schedule recordings. Pause button  or the stop button  enables the user to pause a media content instance, or pause during a search for a particular media content instance. Playback  enables the playback of a media content instance. \u201cA\u201d  \u201cB\u201d , and \u201cC\u201d  buttons can correspond to certain application-defined functions that have a corresponding \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, or \u201cC\u201d symbol displayed in a graphic user interface (GUI) presented on a display device. List button  can be used to evoke various PVR user interface screens. The guide button  may be used to access a television program guide such as, for example, an IPG screen. The information button  can be used to access additional information about a particular media content instance. Many alternative methods of providing user input may be used including a remote control device with different buttons and\/or button layouts, a keyboard device, a voice activated device, etc. The embodiments of the invention described herein are not limited by the type of device used to provide user input.","Referring again to , the IPG application  displays a program guide to the user and populates the guide with information about television services. The IPG application  includes an IPG user interface module  that creates an IPG for presentation to the user. The IPG user interface module  accesses configuration settings stored in an EPG configuration module  to implement an appropriate configuration for the IPG. The EPG configuration module  preferably includes a configuration database  for storing a plurality of IPG configurations. The IPG user interface module  populates the IPG with information contained in an IPG database . The IPG database  contains data files corresponding to current and future services that are or will be available via the DHCT  and\/or other local devices.","Based on the configuration information stored in the IPG configuration module , the IPG user interface module  utilizes the window manager  and other graphics utilities provided by the operating system  to render an IPG on the television . The window manager  is a component that, in one embodiment, is part of the platform , but in other embodiments may be part of the operating system . The window manager  contains functionality for allocating screen areas and managing screen use among multiple applications. The operating system  provides primitives to the IPG user interface module  in order to help render images on the television .","As a window is generated on a display device, the IPG user interface module  registers with the window manager  for particular user input commands that may be required for selecting options provided by a newly-created window. The EPG application  also contains a daemon application  that receives IPG data files transmitted by the headend  and stores them in the IPG database  for utilization by the user interface module . The PVR application  also includes functionality for searching for and retrieving from multiple sources of PVR media content and\/or data for storage in the IPG database . Such sources include, for example, the storage device  or a navigator database (not shown), or other pluggable database modules (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["400","400","394","391","394","359","397","394","398","400","410","420"]},"Video corresponding to the television service to which the DHCT  () is currently tuned (for which audio may also be playing, and which preferably corresponds to a television presentation occupying the full screen before the user is presented with the IPG screen ) is displayed in a video area . Immediately below the video area  is an information banner  for displaying the television display channel number corresponding to the service to which the DHCT  is currently tuned (e.g., display channel ), the current day and date (e.g., Thursday, January 17), and the current time (e.g., 8:00 p.m.).","An IPG grid  includes a main media content instance listing display area , a time area , and a service identification area . The media content instance listing display area  contains listings of service instances that correspond to respective television services identified in the service identification area  that are scheduled to be available during the time periods listed in the time area . Each media content instance listing is preferably formatted as a rectangle, or block, that has a length that depends on the duration of the scheduled presentation of the media content instance. The media content instance listing, such as the Johnny Bravo listing , includes an identifier such as the title of the media content instance (e.g., Johnny Bravo), and can include other identifiers like parental control icons or differences in shading and\/or color to represent different functionality. The service identification area  includes, in one implementation, a vertical list of television services organized sequentially from top to bottom by increasing television display channel number (except for the highest numbered television service which is typically listed immediately above the lowest numbered television service). In one embodiment, the arrow buttons  of the remote control device  () can be used to scroll through the media content instance listing display area  to highlight a desired media content instance listing, such as the Johnny Bravo listing . As a user scrolls in time across a calendar day boundary, the day and date indications displayed in various areas are updated.","In this non-limiting example, the left-most time column (i.e., under the 8:00 time slot) in the media content instance listing display area  includes the titles of media content instance listings, including the highlighted Johnny Bravo listing , which is scheduled to be provided via the Cartoon Network (i.e., Toonz on display channel number ). It should be noted that the current media content instance listing shown in video area  with corresponding information referenced in information banner , corresponds to the currently tuned television service (display channel number ), and not to the service corresponding to the currently highlighted Johnny Bravo listing . The bottom area  of the IPG screen  indicates the selected day for which media content instance listing data is being displayed as well as information about the current functions of the \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC\u201d buttons on the remote control device  ().","In an alternative embodiment, the IPG screen  may have fewer, additional, and\/or different components and may have a different layout. For example, the IPG screen  might not include one or more of a detailed focus area , a video area , an information banner , and\/or a bottom area . The double arrow icons  indicate that a given media content instance listing has a duration that expands beyond the time period shown in the current IPG display screen, suggesting to the user that the balance of the listing can be viewed in another IPG display by selecting the right or left navigation arrow buttons  on the remote control device  (), depending on the direction of the double arrow icon . Note that the functions of highlighting, scrolling, and other navigation functions for interacting with a particular screen involve selecting buttons on the remote control device  that often correspond to symbols displayed on the screen. It will be understood that terminology that describes making selections on a particular screen will be understood to include making the corresponding selections using a remote control device . Other input devices contemplated to be within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the invention include a touch screen, a mouse, an IR keyboard, among others.","In one preferred embodiment, the IPG application  () will be used in cooperation with the PVR application  () to provide channel mapping of media content stored in the storage device  (). More specifically, media content stored in buffer (e.g., TSB ) and non-buffer space on the hard disk  () of the storage device  will have display channel listings in the IPG screen . Further, each individual display channel row for PVR content will preferably be segmented into listings that are formatted as titled blocks, with the boundaries of each block preferably representing the duration of each recorded media content instance (wherein recorded media content instance includes scheduled recordings, active recordings, and completed recordings) stored or scheduled to be stored in the storage device  (). PVR channel mapping into an IPG screen can be implemented through the use of a user settings menu (not shown), or during the recording process from the IPG screen . For example, starting with the recording process implementation, the user can highlight one of the media content instance listings in the media content instance listing display area , and press the record button  () on the remote control device  () to initiate permanent recordings for the selected media content instance. Assume the user has highlighted the Johnny Bravo listing , and selected the record button . In response, the user will be presented with an example confirm recording screen , as shown in .","The example confirm recording screen  includes a confirm recording header  to identify the screen . Also included is an information area , that includes the title of the media content instance (e.g., Johnny Bravo), the date, time, display channel, and associated service of the scheduled presentation, as well as the default quality and the default start time, which in this case is from the beginning of the scheduled presentation. Note that the quality refers to the recording quality level. In one implementation, there exists three recording quality levels: good (with a video data rate of 3 MegaBytes per second), better (5 MegaBytes per second), and best (8 Megabytes per second). Other data rates and quality levels can also be used in other embodiments. Also included is an information button icon, which corresponds to the information button  on the remote control device  () to provide further media content instance information. The confirm recording screen  also includes an options block , which includes such options as the ability to record all episodes, to record this single episode, among other options shown and not shown. The user preferably scrolls through these options in the options block  by using the arrow buttons  () of the remote control device , as suggested by the navigation arrow icons . The blocks of the option block  preferably become highlighted as the user scrolls to the block. The user can select one of the options of the option block  as suggested by the select button icon , which corresponds to the select button  () on the remote control device . Also included is a bottom area , which includes a cancel button icon . Assume in this example that the user desires to record this episode of Johnny Bravo, and does so by highlighting and selecting the \u201crecord this episode\u201d option in the option block . This selection results in the user being presented with an example recorded programs list screen , as shown in .","The example recording schedule screen  includes a recording schedule header , an information area , a list block , and a bottom area . As shown, the information area  includes the title of the selected media content instance for recording, as well as default values for the amount of days the media content instances will be saved (e.g., for seven days). Other default values include the quality, which is shown here as \u201cgood,\u201d as well as an information button icon as described in respect to . Also note the open padlock icon, signifying a parental control feature that is not enabled (thus permitting a user to view the associated media content instance without the requirement for inputting a personal identification number). The list block  shows Johnny Bravo as one of the current scheduled recordings. As shown by the highlighted block in the list block , Johnny Bravo is listed as an entry scheduled to be recorded on Thursday, the 17th of January, at 8:00 p.m., with a duration of 30 minutes. Further note that the list block  includes the select button icon  for making a selection and navigation arrow icons  for scrolling to the next displayed entry, as described in association with . Assume the user previously scheduled to record an Auburn basketball game on Saturday afternoon, as well as the ABC news later that same afternoon.

In other words, the PVR channel media content listings are preferably aligned along the time area , having a similar appearance to the listings associated with broadcast media content. For example, since Johnny Bravo is a half hour presentation, its block boundaries in the IPG screen  are defined by the column positioned between the beginning of the 11:00 p.m. time slot and the beginning of the 11:30 p.m. time slot illustrated in the time area . In one implementation, because the media content instance listings in the IPG screen  for PVR content are synchronized with the time indicated in the time area , a user selecting Johnny Bravo for playback at the current time of 11:10 p.m. will be positioned 10 minutes into the presentation (i.e., ten minutes past the relative hour) of Johnny Bravo. Thus, at the end of the presentation of a recorded media content instance, the user can go to other display channels, for example, broadcast channels, to view from the beginning of a scheduled presentation of one of the broadcast media content. Further, scheduled live broadcasts can be inserted into the PVR channel, as described above, providing the user the opportunity to view the presentation while it is being recorded. In other embodiments, the user can choose to be positioned at the beginning of the presentation of the selected media content instance, regardless of what the current time is relative to the hour. This positioning can be user configurable via a user settings menu, as one example. Note that as time advances, as shown in the time area , the relative positions of the media content listings with respect to the boundaries of the media content instance listing display area  for the PVR channels remains the same in the IPG screen . For example, when the IPG screen  advances to 12:30 p.m., Johnny Bravo will still positioned relative to the hour, starting at the left-most position of the IPG grid (i.e., the under the 12:30 column). An exception to this relative positioning occurs when scheduled media content is inserted into the PVR channel, since the scheduled recordings will preferably be tied to a set, or scheduled presentation time.","In other embodiments, the time area  can take on other forms and functionality. Unlike broadcast media content, PVR listings that are associated with completed recordings can be viewed at any time. Thus, when a listing in a PVR channel is selected, the time area  can be altered to reflect this selection and accessibility feature. For example, responsive to selecting a listing in a PVR channel, the time area  can be grayed out. In another embodiment, the time area  can depict the duration in \u201cseconds,\u201d and\/or \u201cminutes,\u201d and\/or \u201chours\u201d of each recorded media content instance. Other embodiments include not having a time area, or having a time area with index numbers corresponding to the number and\/or the recorded sequence of the recorded media content, or a ticker banner, among others. The ticker banner can include a scrolling banner that is displayed to the user when he or she has highlighted one of the listings for recorded media content instances displayed in the PVR channels. In other embodiments, the time area can still illustrate the current time increments by half an hour (as shown by the IPG screen ), but have relevance only to broadcast media content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["700","802","802","391","380","377","353","377","802","377","802","804","806","806","806","806"]},"If there was a portion of Johnny Bravo that was not recorded, the playback bar  would preferably be divided into two distinct regions. For example, the unrecorded portion can be colored red, and the recorded portion can be colored green, as one example. Such a scenario can arise for scheduled recordings (i.e., scheduled to be recorded in the future), and\/or recordings that are in progress, as non-limiting examples. It would be understood, in the context of the detailed description, that other mechanisms can exist to indicate the difference between unrecorded and recorded content including differences in gray shading, etc. The playback bar  also includes a playback position indicator . As described earlier, the user is positioned, in one implementation, in the presentation of Johnny Bravo ten minutes past the start of the scheduled presentation of Johnny Bravo. The playback position indicator  reflects this relative position. The recorded length of Johnny Bravo is also indicated in the recorded length area . The pause banner  also includes a play button icon  and an options button icon . The usermight select the options button icon , for example, to delete a selected recorded media content instance. Preferably, by selecting a delete option (not shown) in a screen prompted by the selection of the options button icon , the corresponding listing will also be removed from the IPG screen  ().
