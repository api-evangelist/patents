Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of haem. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","Over the last years, a number of substances which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly. i.e. without prior release of NO, have been described, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587], and also various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","EP 0 266 890-A1, WO 89\/03833-A1, JP 01258674-A [cf. 112:178986], WO 96\/34866-A1, EP 1 277 754-A1, WO 2006\/015737-A1, WO 2008\/008539-A2, WO 2008\/082490-A2, WO 2008\/134553-A1, WO 2010\/030538-A2 and WO 2011\/113606-A1, inter alia, describe various imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives which can be used for treating disorders.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and, as such, are suitable for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"39.03mm","wi":"55.71mm","file":"US09126998-20150908-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["A represents CH, CDor CH(CH),","Rrepresents (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl or phenyl,\n    \n    ","Rrepresents hydrogen, (C-C)-alkyl, cyclopropyl, monofluoromethyl, difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl,","Rrepresents a group of the formula"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"9.99mm","wi":"69.77mm","file":"US09126998-20150908-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["where","* represents the point of attachment to the carbonyl group,","Lrepresents a bond or (C-C)-alkanediyl,\n        \n        ","Lrepresents a bond or (C-C)-alkanediyl,","Lrepresents a bond or (C-C)-alkanediyl,\n        \n        ","Rrepresents hydrogen, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkenyl, (C-C)-alkynyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl, 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl or phenyl,\n        \n        ","Rrepresents hydrogen or (C-C)-alkyl,","or","Rand Rtogether with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a 3- to 7-membered carbocycle or a 4- to 7-membered heterocycle,\n        \n        ","Rrepresents hydrogen, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkenyl, (C-C)-alkynyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl, 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl or phenyl,\n        \n        ","Rrepresents hydrogen or (C-C)-alkyl,","or","Rand Rtogether with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a 3- to 7-membered carbocycle or a 4- to 7-membered heterocycle,\n        \n        ","with the proviso that the radicals Rand Rdo not both represent phenyl,","or","Rand Rtogether with the carbon atoms to which they are attached and with the group Lform a 5- to 7-membered carbocycle or a 4- to 7-membered heterocycle,","with the proviso that not more than one of the radical pairs Rand R, Rand Rand Rand R, respectively, forms a carbo- or heterocycle,","Rrepresents hydrogen or (C-C)-alkyl,\n        \n        ","Rrepresents hydrogen, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl, phenyl or benzyl,\n        \n        ","or","Rand Rtogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 4- to 7-membered azaheterocycle,\n        \n        ","and","Lrepresents a bond or (C-C)-alkanediyl,","Rrepresents 5- to 9-membered azaheterocyclyl which is attached via a ring carbon atom,\n        \n        "]}},"Rrepresents hydrogen,","Rrepresents hydrogen, halogen, cyano, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl, (C-C)-alkynyl, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, (C-C)-alkoxy, amino, 4- to 7-membered heterocyclyl or 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl,","Rrepresents hydrogen, cyano or halogen,\n\nand their N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of the N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides and salts.\n"]}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds included in the formula (I) of the formulae mentioned in the following and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, and the compounds included in the formula (I) and mentioned in the following as embodiment examples and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, where the compounds included in the formula (I) and mentioned in the following are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention.

The present invention therefore includes the enantiomers and diastereomers and their particular mixtures.

An isotopic variant of a compound according to the invention is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the compound according to the invention has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into a compound according to the invention are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active compound distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the methods described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the particular reagents and\/or starting compounds therein.","The present invention moreover also includes prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. The term \u201cprodrugs\u201d here designates compounds which themselves can be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) into compounds according to the invention during their dwell time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, the substituents have the following meaning, unless specified otherwise:","Alkyl in the context of the invention represents a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having the number of carbon atoms stated in each case.

are stunned with a blow on the back of the neck and exsanguinated. The aorta is removed, freed from adhering tissue, separated into rings with a width of 1.5 mm, and placed individually, with preloading, in 5-ml organ baths with carbogen-gassed Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37\u00b0 C. with the following composition (mM in each case): sodium chloride: 119; potassium chloride: 4.8; calcium chloride dihydrate: 1; magnesium sulphate heptahydrate: 1.4; potassium dihydrogen phosphate: 1.2; sodium hydrogen carbonate: 25; glucose: 10. The contraction force is recorded with Statham UC2 cells, amplified and digitized via an A\/D converter (DAS-1802 HC, Keithley Instruments Munich) and recorded in parallel on a continuous-line recorder. To produce contraction, phenylephrine is added to the bath cumulatively in increasing concentration. After several control cycles, the test substance is added in increasing dosage in each subsequent pass and the level of contraction is compared with the level of contraction reached in the immediately preceding pass. This is used for calculating the concentration that is required to reduce the level of the control value by 50% (ICvalue). The standard application volume is 5 \u03bcl, and the proportion of DMSO in the bath solution corresponds to 0.1%.","B-4. Measurement of Blood Pressure on Anaesthetized Rats","Male Wistar rats having a body weight of 300-350 g are anaesthetized with thiopental (100 mg\/kg i.p.). After tracheotomy, a catheter for measuring the blood pressure is introduced into the femoral artery. The substances to be tested are administered as solutions either orally by gavage or intravenously via the femoral vein (Stasch et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 344-355).","B-5. Radiotelemetric Blood Pressure Measurement on Awake, Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats","The blood pressure measurement on awake rats described below uses a commercially available telemetry system from the company DATA SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL DSI, USA.","The system consists of 3 main components:","implantable transmitter (Physiotel\u00ae Telemetry Transmitter)","receiver (Physiotel\u00ae Receiver), which are connected via a multiplexer (DSI Data Exchange Matrix) to a","data acquisition computer.","The telemetry system provides continuous acquisition of blood pressure, heart rate and body movement on awake animals in their usual living space.","Animal Material","The investigations are carried out on adult female, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR Okamoto) with a body weight of >200 g. SHR\/NCrl from Okamoto Kyoto School of Medicine, 1963 were crossed from male Wistar Kyoto rats with greatly increased blood pressure and females with slightly raised blood pressure and were delivered in F13 to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.","After transmitter implantation, the experimental animals are kept individually in Makrolon cages, type 3. They have free access to standard feed and water.","The day-night rhythm in the testing laboratory is alternated by the room lighting at 06:00 hours in the morning and at 19:00 hours in the evening.","Transmitter Implantation","The TA11 PA-C40 telemetry transmitters used are implanted surgically in the experimental animals under aseptic conditions at least 14 days before the first test. The animals provided with this instrumentation can be used again after the wound has healed and the implant has become incorporated.","For implantation, the fasting animals are anaesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal, Sanofi: 50 mg\/kg i.p.) and are shaved and disinfected on a wide area of the abdomen. After opening the abdominal cavity along the linea alba, the liquid-filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted above the bifurcation in the cranial direction into the aorta descendens and secured with tissue adhesive (VetBonD\u2122, 3M). The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally on the abdominal wall musculature and the wound is closed layer by layer.","Postoperatively, an antibiotic is administered to prevent infection (Tardomyocel COMP Bayer 1 ml\/kg s.c.)","Substances and Solutions","Unless described otherwise, the test substances are in each case administered orally by stomach tube to a group of animals (n=6). Corresponding to an application volume of 5 ml\/kg body weight, the test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5% Tylose.","A group of animals treated with solvents is used as control.","Test Procedure","The present telemetry measuring device is configured for 24 animals. Each test is recorded under a test number (Vtest year month day).","The instrumented rats living in the unit are each assigned their own receiving antenna (1010 Receiver, DSI).","The implanted transmitters can be activated from outside by an in-built magnetic switch. They are switched to transmission at the start of the tests. The signals emitted can be recorded online by a data acquisition system (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. for WINDOWS, DSI) and processed appropriately. The data are saved in each case to a folder opened for this, which bears the test number.","In the standard procedure, the following are measured, in each case for 10 seconds:","systolic blood pressure (SBP)","diastolic blood pressure (DBP)","mean arterial pressure (MAP)","heart rate (HR)","activity (ACT).","Recording of the measured values is repeated at 5-minute intervals under computer control. The source data recorded as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure (Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor; APR-1) and saved in individual data. Further technical details can be found in the extensive documentation of the manufacturer (DSI).","Unless described otherwise, the test substances are administered on the test day at 09.00 hours. Following application, the parameters described above are measured for 24 hours.","Evaluation","After the end of the test, the individual data recorded are sorted with the analysis software (DATAQUEST\u2122 A.R.T.\u2122 ANALYSIS). The 2 hours before application are taken as the blank value here, so that the selected data set comprises the period from 07:00 hours on the test day to 09:00 hours on the next day.","The data are smoothed for a pre-settable time by mean value determination (15-minute average) and transferred as text file to a storage medium. The pre-sorted and compressed measured values are transferred to Excel templates and presented as tables. The data recorded are saved per test day in a specific folder, which bears the test number. Results and test protocols are filed in folders, sorted in paper form by numbers.","Literature","Klaus Witte, Kai Hu, Johanna Swiatek, Claudia M\u00fcssig, Georg Ertl and Bj\u00f6rn Lemmer Experimental heart failure in rats: effects on cardiovascular circadian rhythms and on myocardial \u03b2-adrenergic signaling.
