title: Method and system for providing enhanced business listings to multiple search providers from a single source
abstract: A source server receives listing identification data for transmission of an enhanced listing comprising enhanced content to a provider server. The source server searches the provider server for a matching listing based on the received listing identification data. When the source server determines that there is no matching listing on the provider server or that a potential matching received from the provider server is a non-matching listing, the source server transmits the enhanced listing without an identifier as an indication to the provider server to create a listing using the enhanced content. When the source server determines that the potential matching listing received from the provider server is a matching listing, the source server transmits to the provider server the enhanced listing with an identifier provided by the provider server as an indication to the provider server to update the enhanced listing on the provider server with the enhanced content.

No. 13\/342,540 filed Jan. 3, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates generally to Internet search methods, and more particularly, to a method and system for providing enhanced business listings to multiple search service providers from a single source system in an integrated fashion.","A consumer and\/or merchant may rely heavily on services rendered via the Internet. One such service is searchable listings provided by a search service (also known in some instances as \u201cyellow pages\u201d or \u201cInternet yellow pages,\u201d e.g., Google.com, Amazon.com, Yahoo.com, Yelp.com, MapQuest.com, Superpages.com, etc.). Searchable listings may include businesses, such as restaurants, people information, product information, etc. The information provided may include, for example, a name of a person or business, addresses, telephone numbers (i.e., a network access point (NAP)). The information provided may also include web site URLs, photos, videos e-mail addresses, etc., as well as a special tagline to be used for promotional purposes, the latter included in a visual \u201ctag\u201d highlight (together, \u201cenhanced content\u201d). The consumer may be presented with other information about a business by either clicking anywhere in the listing, including the tagline, or placing a mouse pointer or finger over the listing, including the tagline.","Certain search service providers, such as Google.com, WhitePages.com, MapQuest.com, provide some or all of the requested information in alphabetical, \u201cmost visited\u201d, or distance order (i.e., distance from a location that the consumer entered for a search or a distance from a location of the search provider). A merchant may wish to ensure that the NAP information provided in the search results is correct, so that a consumer may find a listing when searching in her local area, and if the consumer does choose to call or visit the merchant's business, the consumer is provided with correct information. Furthermore, a merchant may desire to maximize the chance that a consumer will select the merchant's listing from among those returned. The listing may be displayed higher in the search results and\/or be featured in a more prominent and attractive fashion. The ordering of the listings is sometimes influenced by the extent to which enhanced content is available for the listing. Also, the enhanced content may be employed in the display of search results, such that the presence and quality of enhanced content associated with a listing may increase the attractiveness of the listing to the consumer. Further still, the merchant may desire to maximize the probability that a consumer that views additional information about a business will have a favorable impression of the business.","The above goals may be achieved by maximizing the presence and quality of enhanced content associated with a listing. The merchant associated with a listing may therefore desire to be listed with multiple search services. Unfortunately, the merchant currently needs to obtain their listing from each search service provider separately, i.e., they need to contact each of the search service providers separately, provide the listing information to each of the search service providers, and pay each of the search service providers separately. Moreover, if they wish to update their listing, each service provider needs to be contacted separately.","Assuming a listing is updatable at each of the search service providers, an update may take days, weeks, or more to be reflected at a consumer-facing Web site, mobile directory, application, etc., of each of the search service providers. Therefore, in the related art, updates cannot occur in real time or near real time. Moreover, the merchant cannot provide their customers with information about real-time or near real-time services, such as, for example, an offer of a discount coupon \u201cfor the next hour only.\u201d","The above-described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for providing listings that include both NAP information and enhanced content (hereinafter \u201cenhanced listings\u201d) to multiple search service providers from a single source system. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the source system receives listing identification data from a merchant. The listing identification data is transmitted to each individual provider system. Potential matching listings are received from each provider system. The potential matching listings are matched to the listing identification data previously supplied by the merchant, and a measure of certainty of a match for each provider system is determined. If a match is found for a given provider system that equals or exceeds a predetermined level or more of certainty, then a provider-supplied \u201cExternal ID\u201d for that match is recorded in the source system and is associated with the listing information provided by the merchant, and the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system. If no such match is found, the source system presents the listing information from the provider system to the merchant (or an analyst working on behalf of the merchant).","According to an embodiment of the present invention, when the source system presents the listing information from the provider system to the merchant, the source system may receive from the merchant an indication as to whether returned listing data from a provider system matches the merchant's listing. If the merchant confirms a match, the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system. If the merchant indicates that the returned listing data is incorrect, or if no probable match of returned listing data from the provider system was found, then the merchant searches directly for their listing on the provider system via a source system interface. If the provider system returns listing data that the merchant confirms as a match, then the provider-supplied External ID is recorded for the listing that the merchant confirmed in the database of the provider system. The listing data is also recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system after a cross check by a human operator.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, after completing a search on the provider system via a source system interface, the merchant may indicate that no listing on the provider system matches the merchant listing. In such circumstances, the source system records an indication in the source system database that the listing should be delivered to the provider system as a new listing to be added to the provider system after a cross check by a human operator.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a cross check by a human operator may be conducted when the merchant has indicated that the merchant listing did not match the provider data automatically selected, and then has either indicated that another provider listing matches or that no provider listing matches. The human operator either accepts as a match returned listing data from the provider system that the merchant indicated as a non-match, accepts as a match the provider listing selected by the merchant, searches and selects the provider system himself for a different match of listing data via a source system interface, or indicates that no valid listing is present on the provider system. Accordingly, the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system, either with the \u201cExternal ID\u201d included in the provider listing data selected as a match or, if no such listing was selected, with an indication that the merchant listing is to be added to the provider site.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, when listing data is recorded in the source system database as being ready for delivery, one or more methods of delivery may be selected to deliver an enhanced listing to the provider system. The selection of a deliver method may be based on (1) which methods are available on the provider system, (2) which data fields are included in the enhanced listing to be provided, and (3) which methods may cause the data fields associated with the enhanced listing to be sent to the provider system as quickly as possible. In one embodiment, all fields may be delivered through a single method. In another embodiment, some fields may be delivered through one method to provide faster delivery, while other fields may be delivered through a slower method.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the following delivery methods are provided: (1) periodic feed files, (2) real-time API integration; (3) JavaScript enhanced content; and (4) frequent delta updates.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, in the periodic feed files listings delivery method, at periodic intervals, a file for each provider system containing associated target listings that are to become enhanced listings is generated for each provider system by the source system. This file contains NAP information and enhanced content for each of the merchant listings, and possibly the provider-supplied External ID previously identified and associated with the listing. If the provider-supplied external ID for a given listing is not provided, this is an indication that the listing does not exist on the provider system and should be created by the provider system. For each of the provider systems, the generated file is transmitted to the corresponding provider system.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the provider system processes the received listings. If at least one new listing is found that does not have an External ID supplied, the provider system adds a listing into the provider database and generates an External ID for it. The provider then updates the listings in the provider database with the listing information (NAP and enhanced content) provided by the source system for each listing, identifying each by External ID. In this manner, the merchant listing information on each provider is added and updated from a single point, and, as a result, the enhanced listing is now present on each provider.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, in the real-time API integration listings delivery method, as soon as new or updated merchant listing information is provided to the source system and, as applicable, approved according to the methods described above, the source system contacts the provider system through a real-time API, and provides merchant listing information, including, but not limited to, NAP and enhanced content, as well as the corresponding \u201cExternal ID\u201d for the listing on the provider system (or an indication that this listing is to be added to the provider system). The provider system updates its database with the new listing information, and is made available to consumers searching for business listings on the provider site. If the source system is contacting the provider system concerning a listing for the first time, the provider system provides the source system (either substantially immediately, or after some interval) with the source system assigned Listing ID, the provider assigned External ID, and a URL where the consumer can expect to see the listing on the provider system. For any listings appearing for the first time, the merchant is provided with an indication that the listing is now in service on that provider, and supplies the merchant with a URL from which the provider listing associated with the business of the merchant may be seen.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the periodic feed files delivery method or the real-time API integration delivery method may be augmented by a JavaScript enhanced content delivery method. The JavaScript enhanced content delivery method permits enhanced content to be updated for a listing in real-time even if a provider does not support real-time updates to its database (e.g., as in the periodic feed files delivery method), or if the provider does support updates to its database but cannot substantially immediately display the updates to a consumer (as may happen in the real-time API integration listings delivery method).","The JavaScript enhanced content delivery method is executed after completing the steps of the periodic feed files delivery method or the real-time API integration delivery method. In the JavaScript enhanced content delivery method, the provider system is configured to store in its database an indication that the listing with a particular External ID is to include JavaScript based enhanced content, possibly to include a promotional highlight, when displayed in a consumer Web browser. When the provider system provides listing information for any such listings to the consumer, the provider system may include a JavaScript in the Web page. This JavaScript runs on the consumer's Web browser, and is configured to contact the source system to obtain the enhanced content associated with the listing, identified by the External ID (or a source system ID) of the listing in question. The source system returns the most up-to-date enhanced content for the listing, which is then displayed to the consumer. Thus, the most up-to-date enhanced content, including, but not limited to, a real-time promotional highlight message, is displayed to the consumer, thus rendering a complete enhanced listing available to consumers on a provider system.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a variation of the JavaScript enhanced content delivery method may be used. In this variation, the provider system requests the enhanced content in question directly from the source system through a server-to-server connection, and then serves this information to the consumer as though it were incorporated into the provider system database, although it has not been.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the periodic feed files delivery method may be augmented with the frequent delta updates delivery method. In the frequent delta updates delivery method, the source system keeps track of all merchant listing records that are recorded either for the first time or for which the merchant has provided updated information. At regular intervals, for example, every five minutes, the provider system contacts the source system for an update. The source system delivers all of the updated listing information from the time since the last contact. The provider system processes this information by updating its own listing records based on the listing information supplied in the delta update. This up-to-date information is presented to consumers.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, in connection with the periodic feed files delivery method, the provider system may assemble a list of all of the listings with listing information controlled and updated by the source system, may generate a \u201creceipt file\u201d containing these listings, and may transmit the receipt file to the source system. The receipt file may include, for each listing, the source system-assigned Listing ID, the provider system-supplied External ID, and a URL where the consumer can expect to see the listing on the provider system. For any listings appearing for the first time, the merchant is provided with an indication that the listing is now in service on that provider, and supplies the merchant with a URL from which the provider listing associated with the business of the merchant may be seen.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, the methods described for delivering listings may be employed both when a listing is initially provided by the merchant to the source system, and when updates to the NAP or enhanced content for a listing is provided by the merchant to the source system.","It is to be understood that the attached drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and may not be to scale.","Methods and systems for enabling merchants to have their business listed in the so-called \u201corganic search results\u201d on a large number of directories (including Web sites, mobile apps, etc.) through a single product\/system are provided. As used herein, the term \u201corganic search results\u201d refers to, but is not limited to, listings on search engine results pages that appear because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to their being advertisements. In contrast, non-organic search results may include pay per click advertising.","A merchant is permitted to list promotional material comprising enhanced content associated with a listing through, among other things, highlighted content in search results and more complete content in the business profile on the service provider. In some embodiments, a URL is provided to permit the merchant to see their promoted listing on each search service provider's Web site. The merchant is permitted to update their information (e.g., when they move or when their phone number changes) and enhance their listing (e.g., by adding or modifying photos, text descriptions, special offers, hours, etc., i.e., enhanced content) from a single point substantially in real-time or near real-time.","The term \u201ccomputer\u201d or \u201ccomputer platform\u201d is intended to include any data processing device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a mainframe computer, a server, a handheld device, a digital signal processor (DSP), an embedded processor (an example of which is described in connection with  hereinbelow), or any other device able to process data. The computer\/computer platform is configured to include one or more microprocessors communicatively connected to one or more non-transitory computer-readable media and one or more networks. The term \u201ccommunicatively connected\u201d is intended to include any type of connection, whether wired or wireless, in which data may be communicated. The term \u201ccommunicatively connected\u201d is intended to include, but not limited to, a connection between devices and\/or programs within a single computer or between devices and\/or separate computers over a network. The term \u201cnetwork\u201d is intended to include, but not limited to, OTA (over-the-air transmission, ATSC, DVB-T), packet-switched networks (TCP\/IP, e.g., the Internet), satellite (microwave, MPEG transport stream or IP), direct broadcast satellite, analog cable transmission systems (RF), and digital video transmission systems (ATSC, HD-SDI, HDMI, DVI, VGA), etc.","The one or more computer readable media may be used for storing the instructions to be executed by the one or more processors, including an optional operating system, such as the Windows or the Linux operating system. The computer readable media may further be used for the storing and retrieval of data in one or more databases. The computer readable media may include a combination of volatile memory, such as RAM memory, and non-volatile memory, such as flash memory, optical disk(s), and\/or hard disk(s). Portions of the data stored in the computer readable media may be provided by one or more human users at one or more monitors.

"]},"A plurality of provider application programming interfaces (APIs)  permits the source system  to search for matching listings as part of a matching process. The provider API searcher  is configured to accommodate existing APIs  provided that it meets system standards. In certain circumstances, a provider may need to modify their API  so that it may operate properly with the source system . The provider listing update APIs  are configured to receive information about new and updated listings to display from the listing delivery engine . Should a provider not be able to supply a provider listing update API , the provider may supply a periodic feed receiver  for processing periodic data updates generated by the source system  containing listings that should contain enhanced content. These are modules designed by each of the providers. They are generally designed to accommodate a source system enhanced listings format. The provider directory site\/mobile app\/etc.  is a module that serves the directory sites with which a consumer interacts, e.g., MapQuest.com, the MapQuest iPhone app, etc.","The modules , , ,  are, in turn, are communicatively connected to a plurality of user devices running some form of communication software, preferably in a consumer Web browser  over a network, such as the Internet , and a provider database -. In a preferred embodiment, the computer platform  may be communicatively connected to each of the plurality of user devices via a PowerListings JavaScript  running in the consumer Web browser  when enhanced content is pulled directly from a consumer Web browser  or device, rather than passing through a service provider computer platform (e.g., ) (to be described hereinbelow in connection with ). In such circumstances, the PowerListings JavaScript  (either provided by the system provider or written by the service provider and included within a Web page) calls the real-time content server  and obtains the needed enhanced content. Alternatively, the PowerListings JavaScript  may be replaced with, for example, a mobile application or some other non-Web application. In such circumstances, the mobile or external application may communicate directly with the real-time content server  to obtain the real-time content updates. However, in the preferred embodiment, a request typically passes through a service provider computer platform (e.g., ) rather than having a direct connection between the application running on the consumer's device and the real-time content server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","34","34","32","402","32","38","404","34","34","406","34","34","408","410","512","414","38","40","416","34","34"],"i":["a","n ","a","n","a","n","a","n "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","34","34","38","502","102","38","38","504","104","106","34","34","34","506","516"],"i":["a","n ","a","n","a"]},"In Step , the provider API searcher  invokes a provider API  with the listing identification data supplied by the merchant . In Step , the provider API  of the provider system may return potential matching listings to the provider API searcher . In Step , the provider API searcher  employs a method to determine which of the returned results matches the listing identification data supplied by the merchant , if any, and a measure of certainty of a match for the provider system . Each potential match is given a score that indicates the system's level of certainty that the potential match listings corresponds with the listing identification data supplied by the merchant. To calculate this score, the system normalizes the core listing information supplied by the merchant and returned with each potential match. Then the system assigns up to one point for similarity of each of the following data fields: name, address (including city, state, and postal code), and primary phone number. The system also assigns points for matches of non-primary phone numbers and merchant URL. If a match has at least three points\u2014which can happen only if the name, address, and primary phone number match exactly, or if two of the three match and the other fields match exactly\u2014the listing is considered to be so perfect a match that it can be recorded as a listing match without merchant verification (i.e., equal to or above a predetermined level of certainty). If it has a match of at least one point, then it is considered a possible match and can be presented to the merchant as such. Otherwise, it is considered that there are no possible matches.","In Step , if a match is found that equals or exceed a predetermined level or more of certainty, then in Step , the provider API searcher  records a provider-supplied \u201cExternal ID\u201d for the listing along with returned listing data (e.g., the name, address, telephone number, and URL associated with the listing found on the provider system ) in the system database ; otherwise, processing proceeds to step . As used herein, an External ID refers to a unique identifier that each of the provider systems -has assigned to a listing for their own purposes. This contrasts with a system-provided \u201cListing ID\u201d that is a unique identifier assigned by the source system  to the same listing on a per provider\/per listing basis. In step , a matching process is conducted by the source system , wherein an attempt is made to determine the External ID of the listing on the provider's system that most closely matches the listing with the system-provided Listing ID. The purpose of the matching process is to ascertain whether there is a corresponding listing on the server provider's side. If, in step , a match is found, then in step , the provider-supplied External ID is associated with the system-supplied Listing ID in the system database  for the provider system (e.g., ). If, in Step , no match was returned, then in Step , the provider API searcher  records \u201cno match found\u201d in the system database  for the provider system . Also, a \u201cno External ID corresponding to the Listing ID\u201d in question is recorded in the database  for the provider system ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","32","38","34","602","102","38","34","34","34","604","612"],"i":["a ","a","n ","a"]},"In Step , if a probable match was found, then in Step , the PowerListings Web application  displays the returned listing data (e.g., the name, address, and phone number) as supplied by the provider system , and prompts the merchant  to confirm that the correct returned listing data was identified. If, in Step , the merchant  confirms a matching returned listing data, then in Step , the returned listing data is recorded by the source system  in the system database  along with an indication that the returned listing data is \u201cready to be delivered to the provider system\u201d as described hereinbelow. If, in Step , the merchant  indicates that the returned listing data is incorrect, or if no probable match of returned listing data from the provider system was found, then in Step , the merchant  searches directly for their listing on the provider systems via queries made through the PowerListings Web application , the provider API searcher , and the provider API  of the provider system . If, in step , as a result of the queries in Step , the provider system returns listing data that the merchant  confirms as a match, then in Step , the source system  records the provider-supplied External ID for the listing that the merchant  confirmed in the system database  for the provider system . If, in Step , the provider system does not return listing data or, in Step , none of the returned listing data is considered a match by the merchant , then in Step , the source system  records a \u201cNO LISTING FOUND\u201d or some other negative indication in the system database  for the provider system .

For example, existing search service providers provide a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly feed for updating listings of local merchant data, which may be the only way of updating content. Existing listings services rely on the recipient of the listing information (provider systems) to attempt any matching of their own listings (e.g., some provider systems accept only an advertised listing from a single source. As a result, there may be duplicate listing of the same merchant with no attempt by the provider systems to remove the duplicate entries). As of this writing, search service providers do not perform matching from a central server system  and do not provide each provider system -with its ID for a listing. Still further, there are no known instances of service providers providing a combination of accepting data in a periodic feed, serving content with special markers based on this data, and having this data augmented with a JavaScript-based call back to the original central server system , which solves an apparent latency problem for updating content in a number of domains. There are also no known instances of a service provider accepting listing information from a merchant and delivering it to multiple provider systems via a real-time API. There are also no known instances of a service provider accepting listing information from a merchant and then distributing it to multiple providers using a combination of these mechanisms based on the capabilities of each provider system in order to minimize the latency of distribution new listing information as far as possible. There are also no known instances of such a listings service using automated mechanisms to ascertain whether the listings sent out to provider systems are correctly added and correctly updated.","A merchant is provided with the most up-to-date information possible associated with their business listings. Provider systems each have different capabilities and mechanisms for the support of the adding and updating of merchant listings. Some of them have systems that can operate only on a daily or multi-day cycle through the use of \u201cfeed\u201d files that contain listing information and are processed daily. Others are able to process \u201cfeed\u201d files more frequently, and still others have assorted miscellaneous mechanisms allowing for faster updates. Methods and systems according to certain embodiments of the present invention provide a way to make use of each of the existing mechanisms available with each provider system in the most efficient manner possible to effect updates to listings in a manner as near to real-time as possible. Provider systems that can process \u201cfeed\u201d updates only infrequently to nevertheless display certain elements of the enhanced content-in real time or near real-time.
