No. 60\/479,381 filed Jun. 18, 2003.","This invention was partially funded by the Government under a grant from Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) under contract NCRADA-NMCSD-03-110. The Government has certain rights to portions of the invention.","The present invention relates generally to the delivery of bioactive substances to target cells within a body, and more particularly, to the delivery of genetic material to the inner ear sensory cells of the inner ear using superparamagnetic nanoparticles.","The present invention is directed to a method of introducing a bioactive substance into a target cell within a body. The bioactive substance is associated with a superparamagnetic nanoparticle. The method comprises introducing the bioactive substance and the nanoparticle into the body and moving the bioactive substance and the nanoparticle into the target cell using a controllable external magnetic field. The controllable external magnetic field is adapted to move the nanosphere in three dimensions.","The present invention further includes a method for introducing a bioactive substance into a target cell within a body wherein the bioactive substance is supported within a nanosphere. The nanosphere comprises at least one superparamagnetic nanoparticle and an outer bioerodable shell. The outer bioerodable shell supports the nanoparticle and the bioactive substance. The method comprises introducing the nanosphere into the body and moving the nanosphere into the target cell using a controllable external magnetic field. The controllable external magnetic field is adapted to move the nanosphere within the body in three dimensions.","Still yet, the present invention includes a system for introducing a bioactive substance into a target cell within a body. The system comprises a superparamagnetic nanoparticle, a biocompatible shell covering the nanoparticle and a magnetic field generator. The biocompatible shell is adapted to bond the bioactive substance with the nanoparticle. The magnetic field generator is adapted to move the nanoparticle to the target cell in three dimensions.","Further still, the present invention includes a method for introducing a bioactive substance into a target cell within a body wherein the bioactive substance is supported within a nanosphere. The nanosphere comprises a superparamagnetic nanoparticle and a bioerodable matrix. The bioerodable matrix supports the nanoparticle and the bioactive substance. The method comprises introducing the nanosphere into the body and moving the nanosphere into the target cell. The nanosphere is moved into the target cell using a controllable magnetic field adapted to move the nanosphere within the body in three dimensions.","Delivery of bioactive substances, such as drugs or genetic material, to specific cells allows for the treatment of diseases and conditions that affect the human body. Several methods and systems have been developed to accomplish delivery of the bioactive substance. However, there remains an ongoing need for improved delivery methods and systems.","Targeted delivery of bioactive substances using nanospheres and\/or nanoparticles to a specific site within a body provides advantages over systemic or oral administration of the bioactive substance to the body. For example, effective doses of bioactive substance may be delivered at varying doses to a desired target cell without exposing the entire body to adverse conditions or side effects. Further, the present method and system allows for the delivery of bioactive substance into sensitive or remote areas of the body in a non-invasive manner using an externally controlled magnetic field adapted to move the nanoparticle in three dimensions.","Viral agents have been used for targeted delivery of genetic material to specific cells within the body. A viral agent that has an affinity for the target cells is chosen to transport the genetic material to the target cells. However, the use of viruses to transport genetic material to specific cells presents difficulties such as infection of the host body, mutation of the virus, and incitement of harmful immunogenic reactions. Additionally, viruses are of such a size that there use may cause damaging trauma to the body by requiring invasive procedures. The present invention is useful in that it minimizes trauma to the body and can use non-immunogenic substances.","Turning now to the drawings in general and  in particular, there is shown therein a system for introducing a bioactive substance  into a target cell  disposed within a body . The bioactive substance  is shown bonded to a superparamagnetic nanoparticle . The nanoparticle  may be covered by a biocompatible shell  () that is adapted to bond the bioactive substance  to the nanoparticle . A magnetic field generator  is positioned outside the body  to move the nanoparticles  in three dimensions and into the target cell .","To move the nanoparticle  and the bioactive substance  into the target cell  the magnetic field generator  generates a gradient, represented by arrows , which attracts the nanoparticle to the magnetic field generator and into the target cell. The use of a magnetic field gradient  facilitates internalization of the nanoparticle  and bioactive substance  by the target cell . Facilitating uptake of the nanoparticle  and bioactive substance  using the magnetic field generator may prevent premature release of the bioactive substance from the nanoparticle. Once the nanoparticle  and bioactive substance  are moved into the target cell , the bond between them is broken and the bioactive substance may be released.","The magnetic field generator  may comprise a plurality of magnets (not shown) that are arranged such that a magnetic field is generated, within which numerous gradients  may be created to three-dimensionally direct the nanoparticles  to the target cell . An alternative magnetic field generator may comprise an electromagnetic field generating coil that is movable in three dimensions and adapted to create a gradient  that moves the nanoparticle  through a non-target cell  and into the target cell . It will be appreciated that the electromagnetic field generating coil may be moved by any means that permits three-dimensional movement of the nanoparticle  through the body . In a preferred embodiment the electromagnetic field generating coil may be supported on the end of a robotic arm (not shown) that is programmed to move around the body  so that the nanoparticle  is directed in three dimensions to the target cell .","Turning now to , there is shown therein the nanoparticle  and bioactive substance  of  covalently bonded to one another. The nanoparticle  may be comprised of a ferrite such as magnetite and is preferably superparamagnetic. Because the nanoparticles  are superparamagnetic, the nanoparticles will only be attracted to the strongest side of the magnetic field gradient  and will not be attracted by other or similar nanoparticles when in a magnetic field. Thus, particle to particle interactions resulting in aggregation or other undesirable effects are minimized. Once the magnetic field is removed, the nanoparticles  lose their magnetic remanence.","The nanoparticle  of  is shown encapsulated in a biocompatible shell . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the biocompatible shell  may comprise silica (SiO) or titania (TiO). Encapsulation of the nanoparticle  in the biocompatible shell  hermetically seals the nanoparticle to help prevent corrosion of the nanoparticle and provides a surface charge to promote suspension of the nanoparticle in solution to facilitate uptake of the nanoparticle by non-target  and target cells . The biocompatible shell  also provides a substrate for the attachment of amines  that can serve as linkers to other molecules. The biocompatible shell  of  is shown to provide a covalent bond  such as a Sulfhydryl bond between the bioactive substance  and the nanoparticle .","Turning now to , there is shown therein a diagrammatic representation of a nanosphere  prepared using the methods and systems described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/724,563, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The nanosphere  of  comprises a plurality of superparamagnetic nanoparticles  supported within the nanosphere by an erodable polymer matrix (not shown). Each nanoparticle  may be encapsulated within the previously described biocompatible silica shell . The nanosphere  has an outer shell  that may be adapted to support the bioactive substance . The nanosphere generally has a diameter of less than 300 nanometers, and more preferably a diameter of 100 nanometers or less.","The nanoparticles  may be arranged within the outer shell  such that they have uniformly aligned magnetic moments . Uniform alignment of the nanoparticles' magnetic moments  increases the magnetic susceptibility of the nanosphere  thus providing more efficient transport of the nanosphere and the bioactive substance  through the body  and into the target cell .","The outer shell  generally encapsulates the nanoparticle  and provides a support mechanism for the bioactive substance  so that it may be transported with the nanoparticles to the target cell . In one embodiment the outer shell  may comprise a bioerodable polymer that is adapted to release an encapsulated bioactive substance . In this embodiment, the outer bioerodable shell  may comprise any erodable synthetic or natural polymer that is biocompatible. Polylactides, polyglycolides and collagen have been found to be acceptable for use as the outer bioerodable shell  of the nanosphere .","If the outer shell  comprises a bioerodable polymer, the nanosphere  may form a reservoir  that encapsulates the bioactive substance  and the nanoparticles  within the nanosphere. As the outer shell  is dissolved, the bioactive substance  is released from the nanosphere  and dispersed into the cytoplasm (not shown) of the target cell . The inclusion of the erodable polymer matrix further aids in regulating release of the bioactive substance .","Continuing with , the bioerodable polymer matrix may be used to entrap the bioactive substance  within the outer bioerodable shell . As the outer bioerodable shell  and the erodable matrix dissolve the bioactive substance  is released at a rate dependent upon dissolution of the outer shell and the matrix. Thus, it is preferable that the erodable polymer matrix is non-toxic and capable of being consumed, metabolized or expelled by the target cell . (.) An example of such an erodable polymer matrix is collagen. A tightly cross-linked matrix will exhibit a slow release rate providing low doses of bioactive substance  over longer periods of time. When no bioerodable matrix is present rapid release of the bioactive substance  can be expected.","Continuing with , the bioactive substance  may alternatively be supported on the outer shell . In such cases the outer shell  may be formed from either the bioerodable polymer or a biostable polymer. By way of example, the outer shell  of the nanosphere  may comprise a silica matrix. The silica matrix may have a plurality of amine groups  attached to the outer surface  of the outer shell  that functionalize the nanosphere . These amine groups  give the outer surface  of the shell  a net positive charge. A positively charged outer shell  has an affinity for bioactive substance  comprising genetic material that has a generally negative net charge.","It will be appreciated that the bioactive substance  or  may itself form the outer shell by attaching the bioactive substance directly to the silica coated nanoparticles  or alternatively to the previously described silica matrix.","The outer shell  of the nanosphere  may have a cell adhesion factor (not shown) supported on the outer surface  of the shell . The use of cell adhesion factors enhances endocytosis of the bioactive substance  or  supported by the nanosphere  by the target cell . (.) Thus, the cell adhesion factor may comprise a protein having an affinity for a predetermined type of cell. It will be appreciated that a wide array of cell adhesion factors may be used with nanospheres  of the present invention without departing from the spirit of the invention.","Turning now to , there is shown therein an alternative nanosphere  of the present invention that may be used to deliver the bioactive substance  to the target cell . The nanosphere  of  comprises a plurality of superparamagnetic nanoparticles  supported by a bioerodable polymer matrix . In the present embodiment, the nanoparticles  are shown with the biocompatible shell . The nanoparticles  may be supported by the bioerodable polymer matrix  so that they have substantially aligned magnetic moments . The bioactive substance  is likewise supported by the bioerodable polymer matrix  so that the amount of bioactive substance  released from the nanosphere  and into the target cell  may be controlled over time.","Turning now to , there is shown therein an illustration of a human ear . The ear  shown in  comprises an outer ear , a middle ear  and an inner ear . The outer ear  has an ear canal  that is closed at one end by a tympanic membrane , or eardrum. The middle ear comprises an ossicular chain that normally connects the ear drum  to a cochlea . The ossicular chain includes a malleus , an incus , and a stapes . A properly functioning ossicular chain transmits and amplifies sound vibrations from the ear drum  through the malleus , incus  and stapes  to vibrate an oval window (not shown) of the inner ear . Vibration of the oval window is transmitted to the fluid of the inner ear to cause movement of ear sensory cells within the cochlea  of the inner ear . Electrical impulses from the ear sensory cells are sent from the cochlea  along an auditory nerve  to the brain of the mammal where the signals are processed for hearing.","Damage to the ear sensory cells, or hair cells, of the cochlea  is the leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Congenital conditions and\/or exposure to injurious levels of noise may be the cause of damage to the hair cells. After the hair cells are initially damaged, a number of inner ear cell death programs are activated that result in eventual hair cell death and permanent hearing loss. However, the supporting cells may remain alive with the capacity to regenerate hair cells and restore hearing when triggered by the appropriate bioactive substance .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["32","44","54","32","16","32","70","54","22","20","60","32","20","20","32","72","60"]},"When the nanosphere reaches the hair cell supporting cell, the magnetic field generator  may be moved to an alternative position to facilitate magnetofection of the nanosphere into the cell. Once inside the hair cell supporting cell, the bioactive substance  is released into the cytoplasm of the target cell to begin repair or regeneration of the hair cells. The bioactive substance  released into the hair cells may comprise a genetic material such as the Hath-1 gene. The Hath-1 gene has been shown to stimulate regeneration of hair cells in mammals. See, \u201cRobust Generation of New Hair Cells in the Mature Mammalian Inner Ear by Adenovirus Expression of Hath-1,\u201d J. Shou, J. L. Zheng, W. Q. Gao, Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience 2003; 23:169-170, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention also comprises a method for introducing a bioactive substance  into a target cell  within a body . The bioactive substance  is generally associated with a superparamagnetic nanoparticle . The bioactive substance  is introduced into the target cell  by introducing the bioactive substance and the nanoparticle  into the body  and moving the bioactive substance into the target cell. The bioactive substance  is moved into the target cell  using an externally controlled magnetic field that is adapted to move the nanoparticle  and bioactive substance through the body  and any non-target cells . Movement of the nanoparticle  may comprise generating a gradient  in the external magnetic field. Preferably one of the nanoparticles  or nanospheres  or  as described herein may be used for this purpose.","In accordance with the method of present invention, the bioactive substance  may comprise genetic materials, such as DNA, RNA, plasmids, oligonucleotides or proteins, which are bonded to the biocompatible silica shell  that covers the nanoparticle . The bond between the genetic material  and the silica shell  is adapted to release the genetic material after the nanoparticle  and genetic material are pulled into the target cell .","In an exemplary application of the present method, the body  may comprise a mammal having a target cell  disposed within the cochlea  of the mammal's ear . Thus, the externally controlled magnetic field may be used to move the genetic material  and nanoparticle  into the cochlea , then to disperse the genetic material throughout the cochlea and across the cellular membrane (not shown) of the ear sensory cells. Once inside the target ear sensory cell , the genetic material may be released from the nanoparticle  or nanosphere . The genetic material  may then transfect the ear sensory cell or the supporting cell to cause repair or regeneration of the cells.","Superparamagnetic nanoparticles having a silica shell were synthesized using the modified Massart procedures described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/724,563. The nanoparticles were made of magnetite (Fe3O4) and synthesized to have a diameter of less than 30-50 nanometers. A two Molar iron (III) sulfate heptahydrate solution was prepared in two (2) Molar HCl and combined with one Molar iron (III) chloride hexahydrate aqueous solution. The solutions were mixed and washed in a 0.7 Molar ammonium hydroxide solution and rapidly stirred. The resulting precipitate was stirred for thirty (30) minutes then collected using a magnet. After multiple washes, the precipitate was re-suspended in 0.7 Molar ammonium hydroxide and peptized by the addition of one (1) Molar tetramethylammonium hydroxide aliquots. The volume of the resulting suspension was then taken to 250 ml for processing to add the silica shell to the nanoparticles.","To confirm the iron oxide phase and size of the magnetic nanoparticle, several uncoated magnetite particles were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD analysis revealed the presence of magnetite particles having an average diameter of ten (10) nanometers. The diameter of the magnetite particles was confirmed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Further observation of the uncoated magnetite particles using High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy further established the existence of magnetite particles.","Encapsulation of the nanoparticle with silica provides an anionic surface charge that promotes endocytosis as well as a substrate for attachment of amines adapted to link the bioactive substance to the nanoparticle. The suspension of magnetite nanoparticles was stirred and a 4 ml aliquot was taken up to 100 ml with distilled water. A solution of 0.54% sodium silicate was prepared at a pH of 10.5, and 4 ml of the sodium silicate was added to the magnetite nanoparticle suspension. The pH of the resulting suspension was adjusted to 10.0 and stirred for an extended period of time. After settling for several hours, the silica-coated nanoparticles were removed from the excess silica using a magnet to pull the particles out of the solution and by washing the precipitate several times with distilled water.","Several of the silica-coated nanoparticles were analyzed using TEM to determine the size and structure of the nanoparticles produced in the above procedure. Analysis of the coated nanoparticles revealed an average diameter of approximately sixteen (16) nanometers with a standard deviation of 2.3 nanometers. The presence of the silica shell and iron oxide core was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (\u201cEDS\u201d).","Silica-coated nanoparticles were then functionalized by the addition of amine groups to the surface of the silica shell. The nanoparticles were treated with 3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane and a 1 ml aliquot of the resulting suspension was brought to a volume of 5 ml with distilled water. Additional 3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane was added to the suspension to bring the final concentration to five percent (5%). The reaction system was stirred and the resulting nanoparticles were washed and collected. A Kaiser assay was performed on several of the functionalized nanoparticles to confirm the presence of amine groups on the surface of the silica-coated nanoparticles.","Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used to label the nanoparticle for subsequent location of the nanoparticle using confocal microscopy. The particles were conjugated with FITC using standard protocols to attach the FITC to the amine functional groups.","Guinea pigs were anesthetized and positioned such that an experimental ear was facing upward and parallel to the operating table. A retro-articular incision was made to expose the temporal bone over the middle ear cavity. The middle ear space was opened using an otological surgical drill system (MicroCraft\u2122, Xomed Inc., Jacksonville, Fla.) to expose the ossicular chain of the subjects.","The silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles were suspended in saline at a pH of 7.4 and sonicated for several minutes. Sonication was performed to disperse the nanoparticles before placement onto the ossicular epithelium. A volume of 50-75 microliters of the nanoparticle suspension was applied to the target cells in 25 microliter doses. The operative site was closed and the subjects recovered during application of an external magnetic field to the their heads.","An externally vectored magnetic force was applied to the heads of the experimental animals using an external magnet so that the nanoparticles were pulled downward into the epithelia of the incus and tympanic membrane. The magnet created a magnetic field of approximately 0.35 Tesla at one inch from the experimental incus and tympanic membrane. Each subject was exposed to the external magnetic field for 20 to 30 minutes and subsequently monitored for survival for several days.","Eight to fifteen days after surgery the subjects were anesthetized and euthanized. The experimental incus and tympanic membrane were dissected and prepared for observation. Confocal laser and epifluorescence microscopy were used to confirm the delivery of FITC-labeled nanoparticles into the epithelia of the incus and tympanic membrane. Florescence within the target cells of the incus and the tympanic membrane confirmed that the FITC-labeled nanoparticles had been internalized by the target epithelial cells of the incus and tympanic membrane. Control specimens, not subjected to the external magnetic field, showed reduced intracellular fluorescence showing that the external magnetic field facilitated internalization of the FITC-labeled nanoparticles by the target cells.","Various modifications can be made in the design and operation of the present invention without departing from the spirit thereof. Thus, while the principal preferred construction and modes of operation of the invention have been explained in what is now considered to represent its best embodiments, which have been illustrated and described, it should be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically illustrated and described."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
