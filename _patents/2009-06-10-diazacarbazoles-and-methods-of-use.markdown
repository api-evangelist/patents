Provisional Application No. 61\/060,746, filed Jun. 11, 2008 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/148,001, filed Jan. 28, 2009, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in

therapeutics. The invention also relates to compositions, more specifically pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of using the same to treat various forms of cancer and hyperproliferative disorders, as well as methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Individual cells replicate by making an exact copy of their chromosomes, and then segregating these into separate cells. This cycle of DNA replication, chromosome separation and division is regulated by mechanisms within the cell that maintain the order of the steps and ensure that each step is precisely carried out. Involved in these processes are the cell cycle checkpoints (Hartwell et al., Science, Nov. 3, 1989, 246(4930):629-34) where cells may arrest to ensure DNA repair mechanisms have time to operate prior to continuing through the cycle into mitosis. There are two such checkpoints in the cell cycle\u2014the G1\/S checkpoint that is regulated by p53 and the G2\/M checkpoint that is monitored by the serine\/threonine kinase checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1).","Chk1 and chk2 are structurally unrelated yet functionally overlapping serine\/threonine kinases activated in response to genotoxic stimuli (reviewed in Bartek et al., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001, vol. 2, pp. 877-886). Chk1 and chk2 relay the checkpoint signals from the ATM and ATR, which phosphorylate and activate them. Chk2 is a stable protein expressed throughout the cell cycle, activated mainly by ATM in response to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). In contrast, Chk1 protein expression is largely restricted to S and G2 phases. In response to DNA damage, ChK1 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM\/ATR, resulting in cell cycle arrest in the S and G2\/M phases to allow for repair of DNA damage (reviewed in Cancer Cell, Bartek and Lukas, Volume 3, Issue 5, May 2003, Pages 421-429. Inhibition of Chk1 has been shown to abrogate cell cycle arrest leading to enhanced tumor cell death following DNA damage by a range of chemotherapeutics. Cells lacking intact G1 checkpoints are particularly dependent on S and G2\/M checkpoints and are therefore expected to be more sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment in the presence of a chk1 inhibitor, whereas normal cells with functional G1 checkpoints would be predicted to undergo less cell death.","The invention relates to 1,7-diazacarbazoles of Formula (I), (I-a), and\/or (I-b) (and\/or solvates, hydrates and\/or salts thereof) with kinase inhibitory activity, more specifically with chk1 inhibitory activity. The compounds of the present invention are also useful as inhibitors of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3), KDR kinase, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Accordingly, the compounds of the invention and compositions thereof are useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders such as

P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. For example, any reference to a structure of 2-hydroxypyridine include its tautomer 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine, also known as 2-pyridone, and vice versa. Similarly, compounds of Formula (I-a) include the tautomeric form, i.e., Formula (I-c) and compounds of Formula (I-b) include the tautomeric form, i.e., Formula (I-d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0070"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"57.57mm","wi":"59.61mm","file":"US08501765-20130806-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention.

Thus, for example, a formyl group may be introduced by using N,N-dimethylformamide as the electrophile. Aromatic halogen substituents may alternatively be subjected to metal (e.g. palladium or copper) catalysed reactions, to introduce, for example, acid, ester, cyano, amide, aryl, heteraryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, thio- or amino substituents. Suitable procedures which may be employed include those described by Heck, Suzuki, Stille, Buchwald or Hartwig.","Aromatic halogen substituents may also undergo nucleophilic displacement following reaction with an appropriate nucleophile such as an amine or an alcohol.
