One or more examples of these non-limiting embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. It will be appreciated that the flow restricting apparatuses and the connector assemblies for the same specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting example embodiments and that the scope of the various non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure are defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one non-limiting embodiment may be combined with the features of other non-limiting embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure.","In one embodiment, referring to , a flow restricting apparatus or a fluid flow restricting apparatus, such as vortex valve , for example, can be used to restrict or slow fluid flow from a reservoir  or a drainage gully to an outlet conduit or pipe .

The bores ,  can be the same size (e.g., same radii if the bores are circular) or they can be different sizes. For example, the bore  of the first member  can be size smaller (e.g., a lesser radius) than the bore  of the second member . In various embodiments, the size of the bores  and  can be changed during manufacturing to modify the flow rate of fluid through the connector assembly . In one embodiment, if the bores  and  are larger the flow rate of fluid through the connector assembly  can be greater.","In one embodiment, referring to , the reservoir  can comprise a side wall  having an aperture therein.

In one embodiment, the coupling  may not be provided and the flow restricting cap , or another suitable flow restricting cap, can be engaged with the second end portion  of the elbow  directly. In other various embodiments, an elbow may be integrally formed with a flow restricting cap or a flow restricting plate on a second end portion. In such an embodiment, only a first end portion of the elbow would need to be engaged with or slid onto the insert  to make the connection of the fluid flow restricting assembly  and the insert . In one embodiment, a fluid flow restricting assembly can be formed of a single component. Such a single component fluid flow restricting assembly can be attached to the insert  or can be formed with the insert  or the first member .","In one embodiment, the flow restricting cap  can comprise an end wall  defining an aperture  therein. In various embodiments, more than one flow restricting cap  can be provided with a fluid flow restricting assembly. These flow restricting caps  can comprise differently sized or shaped apertures  in their end walls . Such a feature can allow a user of the fluid flow restricting assembly  to change the fluid flow rate through the fluid flow restricting assembly  merely by changing the flow restricting cap . In one embodiment, where the flow restricting cap  is integrally formed with the second end portion  of the elbow , more than one fluid flow restricting assembly can be provided with each fluid flow restricting assembly having a differently sized or shaped aperture in their end walls.","In one embodiment, the various components of the fluid flow restricting assembly can be comprised of sewer pipe, sewer pipe elbows, sewer pipe couplings, and\/or sewer pipe caps, for example. In various embodiments, these components can have a diameter in the range of 3 inches to 20 inches, 5 inches to 15 inches, and 6 inches to 10 inches, for example.","While an example fluid flow restricting assembly has been described above and illustrated in the accompanying figures, those of skill in the art will recognize that other suitable fluid flow restricting assemblies are within the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore, it should be recognized that a bore in a first member can be sized and shaped to itself provide an adequate flow restriction to fluid flow therethrough without the use of a vortex valve or a fluid flow restricting assembly. In such an embodiment, a bore in a second member can be the same size and shape as the bore in the first member or can be larger in size and shape than the bore in the first member. The term \u201clarger\u201d, in this context, can mean having a larger area and\/or diameter, for example.","While particular non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure have been illustrated and described, those of skill in the art will recognize that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of the present disclosure. Although dimensions are illustrated in some of the figures, those dimensions are meant as example embodiments and are not to be construed as limiting.","Although the various embodiments of the present disclosure have been described herein, many modifications and variations to those embodiments can be implemented. For example, different types of fluid flow restricting apparatuses may be employed. Furthermore, according to various embodiments, a single component may be replaced by multiple components, and multiple components may be replaced by a single component, to perform a given function or functions. The foregoing description and following claims are intended to cover all such modification and variations."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The embodiments described herein will become more apparent and will be better understood by reference to the following description of non-limiting embodiments of the disclosure taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 20 and 21","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 22 and 23","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 28 and 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 35","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 36 and 37","FIG. 30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 38"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 41","FIG. 40"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
