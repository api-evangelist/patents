These tools allow a user to include new report objects in any area of the report. This allows the user to change the report according to their requirements.","A report includes one or more areas, the one or more areas may contain one or more existing report objects. At present, when a report designer places a new report object in any of the one or more areas, the report designer is not aware whether this addition would maintain the semantic validity of report rendering. Specifically, the report designer find it difficult to understand whether the combination of the new report object and the one or more report objects present in the same area of the report would preserve the validity of rendering.","Therefore a method that provides the user a set of semantically correct placement options when the user tries to place the new report object in an area of the report is desired. This would ensure semantically correct report rendering.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for providing a set of placement options when a new report object is requested to be placed in an area of a report are described herein. A request is received to place the new report object in the area of the report. A set of placement options are determined based on at least one of the following: an area type, and the semantic relationship between the new report object and one or more existing report objects associated with the area. The area type of the area is one of an iterative type and a static type. The set of placement options are provided based on the determination.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for providing a semantically guided report design are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Initially at block , a request is received to place the new report object in an area of the report. In one exemplary embodiment, the request is received from a user. In one embodiment, the request is received through a user interface. In one embodiment, the request is received to place the new report object in a sub-area present within an area of the report. Each of the one or more existing report objects and the new report object may contain one or more data elements.","Next at block , a set of placement options are determined. In one embodiment, the set of placement options are determined based on at least one of the following: an area type, and semantic relationship between the new report object and the one or more existing report objects associated with the area in which the new report object is requested to be placed.","In one embodiment, when the new report object is requested to be placed in a sub-area present within an area, the set of placement options are determined based on the area (sub-area) type and the semantic relationship between the new report object and the one or more existing report objects associated with the sub-area and the one or more existing report objects associated with the area in which the sub-area is placed.","The area type may be either an iterative type or a static type. In one embodiment, the area that has the area type as static is rendered by rendering the data elements associated with the report objects (existing or new) associated with the area. In one embodiment, the area that has the area type as the iterative type are rendered by sequentially rendering the data elements contained in the report objects (existing or new) associated with the area.","The semantic relationship is either a one-to-one relationship or a one-to-many relationship. In a one-to-one relationship one entity is associated to one other entity. In a one-to-many relationship one entity is associated with a potential plurality of other entities. In one embodiment, the semantic relationship is a one-to-one relationship when each data element of a new or existing report object corresponds to only a single data element of another existing or new report object. In one embodiment, the semantic relationship is a one-to-many relationship when each data element of a new or existing report object corresponds to more than one data element of another existing or new report object.","In one embodiment, the semantic relationship may be a direct relationship or a transitive relationship. A direct relationship exists between two existing report objects or between a new report object and an existing report object when each data element of an existing report object or a new report object has a direct (one-to-one or one-to-many) relationship with the one or more data elements of another existing report object or new report object. A transitive relationship exists between two report objects when each data element of an existing report object or a new report object does not have a direct relationship, but has a relationship, with the one or more data elements of another existing or new report object.","Finally, the set of placement options determined in block  are provided in block . In one embodiment, the set of placement options are provided to a user. In one embodiment, the set of placement options provide semantic guidance for placing the new report object in the area of the report. In one embodiment, one of the placement options from the set of placement options is selected by a user. In one embodiment, one of the placement options from the set of placement options is selected automatically.

In one embodiment, the area type is defined when the area is created in the report. As discussed above, the area type may be either a static type or an iterative type.","In one embodiment, the information included in the current state of the report includes an iteration key. Each area of the report that has the area type as the iterative type has an iteration key. In one embodiment, the iteration key is initially empty when the area is created or added to the report (e.g., when the area does not include an existing report object). The iteration key stores the one or more existing report objects associated with the area having the area type as the iterative type. In one embodiment, the iteration key defines the sequence in which the one or more data elements of the one or more existing report objects associated with the area that has the area type as the iterative type are rendered during a rendering operation. In one embodiment, the iteration key stores a value indicative of a type of sequence for rendering. In one embodiment the type of sequence may be one of the following: alphabetically ascending, alphabetically descending, in an order defined by a memory that stores the one or more report objects associated with the one or more existing report objects, or in a specific order. In one embodiment, the specific order is stored in the iteration key, the specific order defining an order in which the data elements are to be rendered.","In one embodiment, a sub-area present within an area of the report has an area type as the iterative type. The sub-area of the report is initially empty when there are no report objects in the sub-area.

In one embodiment, the data hull of the sub-area includes a collection of the one or more existing report objects associated with the sub-area and the one or more existing report objects associated with the area. In case the area within which the sub-area is present is a sub-area for another area (i.e., a parent area of the area in which the sub-area is present), the data hull of the sub-area would include a collection of the one or more existing report objects contained in the sub-area, the one or more existing report objects associated with the area, and the one or more existing report objects associated with the parent area of the area. Thus, the data hull of the sub-area includes the one or more existing report objects of the sub-area and the one or more existing report objects of all the parent areas (until the top level) of the sub-area.","Finally at block , the metadata is queried to obtain the semantic relationship between the new report object and each of the one or more existing report objects stored in the data hull at block . As discussed above, the data hull stores the one or more report objects associated with the area in which the new report object is requested to be placed. The metadata retrieved in block  is queried to obtain the semantic relationship between the new report object and each of the one or more existing report objects associated with the area in which the new report object is requested to be placed.
