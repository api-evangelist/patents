abstract: Contextual graph matching based anomaly detection may include evaluating computer-generated log file data to create a master directed graph that specifies known events and transitions between the known events. The master directed graph may be processed to determine a plurality of decomposed master graph walks. Incoming computer-generated log file data may be evaluated to create an incoming directed graph that specifies unknown events and transitions between the unknown events. The incoming directed graph may be processed to determine a decomposed incoming walk. Overlap, distance difference, and correlation scores may be determined for each walk pair of a plurality of walk pairs including each of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks and the decomposed incoming walk. One of the decomposed master graph walks may be selected based on the overlap score, the difference score, and the correlation score, to detect an anomaly.

No. 61\/889,722, filed Oct. 11, 2013, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.","Enterprise environments typically generate log files to record a variety of activities. Sifting through the log file data sources to find errors and anomalies can be a daunting task, for example, due to the extensive volume of such log files. Log content analytics (LCA) is the application of analytics and semantic technologies to consume and analyze heterogeneous computer-generated log files to discover and extract relevant insights in a rationalized and structured form.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the present disclosure is described by referring mainly to examples thereof. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It will be readily apparent however, that the present disclosure may be practiced without limitation to these specific details. In other instances, some methods and structures have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.","Throughout the present disclosure, the terms \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d are intended to denote at least one of a particular element. As used herein, the term \u201cincludes\u201d means includes but not limited to, the term \u201cincluding\u201d means including but not limited to. The term \u201cbased on\u201d means based at least in part on.","Data present in the contents of log files may be characterized by log traces with unique identifiers, time-stamps, events, and actions. These attributes may be indicative of underlying behaviors of applications, the processes that may interact with applications, and the subsequent patterns that exist and may have been created by a series of events. Through mining and correlation, the information contained within log files may be modeled as a graph with statistics, event states, and transition probabilities between events. Learning the behavior of applications through log file traces and understanding the flow of events that occur within applications can facilitate performance of log content analytics, for example, with regard to an enterprise environment.","A contextual graph matching based anomaly detection system and a method for contextual graph matching based anomaly detection are disclosed herein, and may generally provide for discovery of the existence of aberrations and other phenomena within log files as the aberrations and phenomena occur. The system and method disclosed herein may generally provide for extraction of correlations between trace events within log files and the information surrounding them such as probability of occurrence of trace log events, probability of transitions between particular trace log events, execution times of trace log events, and anomalous occurrences of trace log events. The system and method disclosed herein may apply graph matching to log file mining and anomaly detection. The system and method disclosed herein may implement a scalable framework to facilitate learning of application behavior utilizing log files. Based on the mining of large data sets of log files, a master directed graph (i.e., a directed cyclic graph) may be produced. The master directed graph may represent application behaviors through state probabilities, transitions, and other relevant features. The system and method disclosed herein may utilize feature extraction to measure similarity between weighted, labeled, and master directed graphs. The master directed graphs may provide context and intuition on the degree of fitness for a series of related events that a master directed graph generation module of the contextual graph matching based anomaly detection system may mine from log files.","The system and method disclosed herein may characterize how an incoming directed graph representing a set of events differs from a master directed graph that represents known or pre-established events. A graph matching module of the contextual graph matching based anomaly detection system may calculate a bounded metric to characterize the degree of contextual fitness or anomalousness of a decomposed incoming walk compared to a decomposed master graph walk of the master directed graph. The computation of the metric may be based on the master directed graph structure, providing a probabilistic insight on graph similarity. The system and method disclosed herein may provide information that may be used proactively, and may further provide a metric for the contextual anomalousness of an event sequence when compared to the probability distribution of patterns present within an overall mined master directed graph.","According to an example, a contextual graph matching based anomaly detection system is disclosed herein, and may include a processor, and a master directed graph generation module, executed by the processor, to evaluate computer-generated log file data to create, in a computer memory, a master directed graph that specifies known events and transitions between the known events. A master directed graph decomposition module may process the master directed graph to identify a plurality of unique walks through the master directed graph, and to decompose the plurality of unique walks into their probability distributions as a plurality of decomposed master graph walks. An incoming directed graph generation module may evaluate incoming computer-generated log file data to create an incoming directed graph that specifies unknown events and transitions between the unknown events. An incoming directed graph decomposition module may process the incoming directed graph to identify an incoming walk through the incoming directed graph, and to decompose the incoming walk into its probability distribution as a decomposed incoming walk. A graph matching module may determine an overlap score for each walk pair of a plurality of walk pairs including each of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks and the decomposed incoming walk, and further determine a distance difference score and a correlation score for each walk pair of the plurality of walk pairs. An anomaly detection module may select one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks based on the overlap score, the difference score, and the correlation score, and detect an anomaly based on the selected one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks.","According to an example, a method for contextual graph matching based anomaly detection is disclosed herein and may include evaluating, by a processor, computer-generated log file data to create, in a computer memory, a master directed graph that specifies known events and transitions between the known events. The method may further include processing the master directed graph to identify a plurality of unique walks through the master directed graph, and to decompose the plurality of unique walks into their probability distributions as a plurality of decomposed master graph walks. The method may include evaluating incoming computer-generated log file data to create an incoming directed graph that specifies unknown events and transitions between the unknown events. The method may further include processing the incoming directed graph to identify an incoming walk through the incoming directed graph, and to decompose the incoming walk into its probability distribution as a decomposed incoming walk. The method may include determining an overlap score for each walk pair of a plurality of walk pairs including each of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks and the decomposed incoming walk by evaluating an intersection and a union of an edge set of one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks and an edge set of the decomposed incoming walk, and determining a distance difference score and a correlation score for each walk pair of the plurality of walk pairs. The method may further include selecting one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks based on the overlap score, the difference score, and the correlation score, to detect an anomaly based on the selected one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks.","According to an example, a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon machine readable instructions for contextual graph matching based anomaly detection is disclosed herein. The machine readable instructions, that when executed, cause a processor to evaluate computer-generated log file data to create, in a computer memory, a master directed graph that specifies frequencies of state transitions within the master directed graph. The machine readable instructions, that when executed, may further cause the processor to process the master directed graph to identify a plurality of unique walks through the master directed graph, and to decompose the plurality of unique walks into their probability distributions as a plurality of decomposed master graph walks. The machine readable instructions, that when executed, may further cause the processor to evaluate incoming computer-generated log file data to create an incoming directed graph that specifies frequencies of state transitions within the incoming directed graph. The machine readable instructions, that when executed, may further cause the processor to process the incoming directed graph to identify an incoming walk through the incoming directed graph, and to decompose the incoming walk into its probability distribution as a decomposed incoming walk. The machine readable instructions, that when executed, may further cause the processor to determine an overlap score for each walk pair of a plurality of walk pairs including each of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks and the decomposed incoming walk, determine a distance difference score for each walk pair of the plurality of walk pairs, and determine a correlation score for each walk pair of the plurality of walk pairs based on the frequencies of state transitions within the master directed graph and the frequencies of state transitions within the incoming directed graph. The machine readable instructions, that when executed, may further cause the processor to select one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks based on the overlap score, the difference score, and the correlation score, to detect an anomaly based on the selected one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks.","The system and method disclosed herein may include learning capabilities whereby the known master directed graph generated from the log files may be evolved as more information related to the master directed graph becomes available. The system and method disclosed herein may be applicable in areas, such as, for example, audit or regulatory compliance, security policy compliance, digital forensic investigation, security incidence response, anomaly detection, error tracking, application debugging, fraud, and\/or in situations where there is a need for active intelligence as to the operational behavior of applications and events for which guidance on proactive measures are sought. Generally, the system and method disclosed herein may be applicable to any area that requires the understanding of data and application behavior. For example, the log files and related log file data as described herein may be related to a user's interactions with a website, for example, to determine whether the interactions are intended to bypass a security mechanism related to the website. Based on the analysis of the log file data, the system and method disclosed herein may detect anomalies related to the user's interaction with the website (e.g., whether the user's interaction is a typical interaction, or whether the user's interaction is unauthorized).","The system and method disclosed herein may apply trace mining techniques to discover the temporal relationships between log trace events. The system and method disclosed herein may further discover the probability of event occurrences, discover the probability of transitions between events, and detect and report anomalous states by analyzing the execution times of events. Further, the system and method disclosed herein may cluster and group related events based on transition density, and produce visualizations representing temporal rules. The output of the system and method disclosed herein may be fed into other processes for real-time processing or enrichment. The system and method disclosed herein may be used as a plug-in framework that has the capability to change backend connectors as the backend technology changes. Further, the system and method disclosed herein may provide a reusable framework that can be called and reused as needed with no modification to the original source.","The system and method disclosed herein may provide for processing of logs and extraction of trace sequences at large volumes of data. As disclosed herein, the system and method disclosed herein may further provide for performance of extraction with parallel map-reduce processing, production of graph outputs of information that may be used to seed real-time analysis, anomaly detection, and discovery of root-cause analysis. The system and method disclosed herein may include the capability of running locally, on a local Hadoop cluster, or in the cloud with elastic scaling. The system and method disclosed herein may provide for automatic detection of storage capabilities for the processing of relatively large datasets, and filtering of data to provide targeted views of data of relevant interest in the output. The system and method disclosed herein may further include a configurable plug-in architecture for extension with new techniques, and include an extendable and reusable framework.","For the system and method disclosed herein, matching of decomposed master graph walks to a decomposed incoming walk may account for intersection, intersection strength, intersection confidence, and intersection type. With respect to intersection, intersection may be defined as the existence of a mined trace sequence within a larger mined trace sequence graph (i.e., the master directed graph). Intersection strength may be defined as the degree of fit of a mined trace sequence to a probability ranking. Intersection confidence may be defined as the highest correlation between a trace sequence (i.e., the decomposed incoming walk) and existing trace sequences (i.e., the decomposed master graph walks) within the master directed graph. Further, intersection types may include converging or diverging intersection. For converging intersection, a decomposed incoming walk may fit a known decomposed master graph walk with the same directionality. For diverging intersection, a decomposed incoming walk may fit a known decomposed master graph walk with the opposite directionality.","The contextual graph matching based anomaly detection system and the method for contextual graph matching based anomaly detection disclosed herein provide a technical solution to technical problems related, for example, to anomaly detection in log file data. In many instances, anomaly detection in log file data can be a daunting task, for example, due to the extensive volume of such log files. The system and method disclosed herein provide the technical solution of evaluating computer-generated log file data to create, in a computer memory, a master directed graph that specifies known events and transitions between the known events. The master directed graph may be processed to identify a plurality of unique walks through the master directed graph, and to decompose the plurality of unique walks into their probability distributions as a plurality of decomposed master graph walks. Incoming computer-generated log file data may be evaluated to create an incoming directed graph that specifies unknown events and transitions between the unknown events. The incoming directed graph may be processed to identify an incoming walk through the incoming directed graph, and to decompose the incoming walk into its probability distribution as a decomposed incoming walk. An overlap score may be determined for each walk pair of a plurality of walk pairs including each of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks and the decomposed incoming walk, for example, by evaluating an intersection and a union of an edge set of one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks and an edge set of the decomposed incoming walk. Further, a distance difference score and a correlation score may be determined for each walk pair of the plurality of walk pairs. One of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks may be selected based on the overlap score, the difference score, and the correlation score, to detect an anomaly based on the selected one of the plurality of decomposed master graph walks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 2","FIGS. 3A-3E","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","104","108","106","108","108","106","110","108","108","112","114","116","118","116","120","120","114","102","120","122","120","120","120","124","126","112","112","124","128","130","132","134","112","128","130","132","136","112"]},"As described herein, the modules and other elements of the contextual graph matching based anomaly detection system  may be machine readable instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium. In addition, or alternatively, the modules and other elements of the contextual graph matching based anomaly detection system  may be hardware or a combination of machine readable instructions and hardware.","With respect to the master directed graph , generally, the log file data  such as log content may be characterized by events with unique identifiers, timestamps, and actions. In order for the master directed graph generation module  to generate the master directed graph , the master directed graph generation module  may extract information such as correlations between trace events, probability of occurrence of trace log events, probability of transitions between particular trace log events, execution times of trace log events, and anomalous occurrences of trace log events, from the log file data . The master directed graph  that is mined from the log files  may represent behavioral patterns that describe temporal ordering and potential causality relationships between trace events that occur with a certain measure of probability. In order to compare a sequence of incoming events (i.e., the decomposed incoming walk ), to a known model of events (i.e., the master directed graph ), the incoming directed graph decomposition module  may generate the decomposed incoming walk  and represent the transitions from one event to another as a weighted and normalized probability. When comparing the decomposed incoming walk  to the master directed graph , the graph matching module  may extract several features, such as, for example, probability ranking of occurrence, overlap, distance, and the correlation of the transition weights or probabilities to describe a time correlated series of log traces.","With respect to generation of the master directed graph  from the log file data , log files may store information in a transactional format from which trace events may be linked, correlated against time, and associated with unique identifiers. Information present in the log files  may include location, origination, and other relevant information for some task or trace occurrence that has been logged. Over time, information that is present in the log file  may be mined to link events together, discover time correlated groupings of events or behaviors, and tracked according to frequency of occurrence and frequency of occurrence of transitions between events. With respect to mining of the log files  and discovery of insights, the master directed graph generation module  may ingest and analyze the content of the log files , and discover and extract the temporal causality behaviors of traces and events. The mined information may be viewable as the master directed graph  for facilitating exploration. The master directed graph generation module  may mine and process logs at scale for extraction of relationships (in either full-scale distributed mode or emulation mode), data profiling, filtering, and exploration.","Referring to , the master directed graph generation module  may include a log file\/event management module  to pull information from the log file data . The log file\/event management module  may control the access and instruction set needed to provide a seamless transition of data between a provider of the log files  and the framework of the log file\/event management module . A log ingestion module  may receive and parse the log file data . The log ingestion module  may also normalize the log file data  into a vendor agnostic format for further analysis by the other modules of the master directed graph generation module . Normalization of the log file data  may be performed via customizable connectors that allow for reuse. Additionally, the log ingestion module  may provide the capability to load and store models generated and used by the other modules of the master directed graph generation module . A query module  may operate as a mediator or interface between the log file\/event management module  and the log ingestion module , and a data mining module , an analytics module , a filter module , and a command and application programming interface (API) dispatcher module . The query module  may provide an abstraction layer that is different from the underlying providers of the log file data  and specific storage formats of the log file data . The data mining module  may perform the data extraction and discovery of relationships within the log file data . The analytics module  may perform the analysis of the log file data  that has been mined and extracted, for example, using event clustering. The filter module  may filter and pair down the log file data  to reduce overall size of a model that is exported, for example, by event filtering, edge strength filtering for trace sequence graphs, etc. The command\/API dispatcher module  may function as the primary interface into log content analytics framework of the master directed graph generation module . The command\/API dispatcher module  may provide for the master directed graph generation module  to be operated as a tool from a terminal prompt or utilized within another application as an API with all the configuration and extensibility of a command line application.","The master directed graph generation module  may perform data mining in parallel and at scale by creating process flows utilizing, for example, the Hadoop Map-Reduce framework. To provide for process mining in a distributed environment, a plurality of the master directed graph generation modules  may be used to read portions of one or more of the log files , mine the information locally, and then forward models to a reducer to aggregate information from all of the plurality of master directed graph generation modules . The log file data  may be normalized according to the schema of the input log files , and trace events may be correlated with other known trace events within the master directed graph generation module . For a distributed environment, each of the master directed graph generation modules  may receive streamed log trace information and deconstruct the information into a rationalized internal form for association with other related trace events according to a feature set including, for example, unique identifiers, time stamps, and trace event categories for the incoming log file data . As each trace event is extracted from a log trace, the trace event may be correlated against previously mined and known trace events using its feature set, and ordered temporally to create a unique sequence of trace events. This may be performed for every incoming log trace and subsequent extracted trace events to create multiple trace event sequences. Once the entire set of trace event sequences have been mined from the log files , or a portion of the log files , a Bayesian network may be constructed from the aggregate view of all trace sequences to generate the master directed graph .

At smaller sample sizes, shorter walks, and smaller graph feature sets, the fitness results may vary as opposed to larger sample sizes, longer walks, or larger graph feature sets, when performing the graph matching by the graph matching module  with the incoming  and master walks (e.g., the decomposed master graph walks ) or graphs (e.g., the master directed graph ). To compensate for any fluctuations that may occur, a statistical method may be used for determining whether fitness between two feature sets of walk decompositions or graphs is generated by chance alone, thus providing a confidence metric. Based on Pearson's correlation coefficient, statistical significance may be tested for to provide a confidence metric. By constructing a sampling distribution for the correlation value and determining its standard error, a determination may be made as to whether a concluded result is due to chance alone. For the example of , the significance using t-test and raw Pearson's value may be 0.101 for walk pair w-i.","With respect to implementation of the contextual graph matching based anomaly detection system , the foregoing graph similarity metrics may be used to determine anomalousness of an incoming, potentially incomplete, walk (e.g., the decomposed incoming walk ) compared against the probability density distribution of all known decomposed master graph walks  with respect to the most probable path of walks that reside within a comparison master graph (e.g., the master directed graph ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","100","108","124","124"]},"As preprocessing, at , the pseudo-code of  may first obtain all the walks (e.g., the decomposed master graph walks ) of the master directed graph  (i.e., the set of labels) through a depth-first search methodology. Next, at , the pseudo-code of  may compute the probability ranking (i.e., Equation (1)) for each master walk (e.g., the decomposed master graph walks ), and sort the master walks in ascending order. At , each master walk may be assigned into percentiles by associating a ranking coefficient Rto each master walk where each ranking has equal probability mass and the distribution is uniform. The number of master walks may determine the distribution of the ranking coefficients. In the case where more than one master walk has the same probability of occurrence, such master walks may reside within the same probability mass and percentile ranking. At , a decomposition of the incoming walk and master walks into their respective edge sets may be performed in order to compute the overlap, distance, and correlation coefficient (i.e., Equation (4)). At  generally, the percentage overlap (i.e., Equation (2)) and distance difference (i.e., Equation (3)) metrics may be computed with each of the incoming (e.g., the decomposed incoming walk ) and master walk pairs. The correlation of edge weights may occur on common edges that are present in both walk decompositions. As shown in , data points are not inserted from one walk decomposition into another (giving the inserted data points a value of zero) to preserve the notion that the incoming walk may be a part of a larger walk. Furthermore, inserting data points may skew the results towards divergence. Therefore, Equation (4) is limited to considering those overlapping points within a data set.","At , if an incoming walk does not share any edge with a master walk, this results in a correlation of zero with an overlap of zero, with the fitness metric being zero regardless of the distance difference value. Otherwise, at , the fitness value (i.e., Equation (8)) for an incoming walk with each of the master walks may be calculated. At , the calculations of the fitness value may be limited to those sequences that have the highest overlap, where the operation may be performed on the maximal overlap set of incoming walk and master walk pairs. The master walks with the highest fitness metric may be identified. At , if more than one incoming walk and master walk pair have the same fitness value calculation from Equation (8), a scaled fitness value from Equation (9) may be obtained using the probability ranking coefficient for the master walk match as a multiplier. In some situations, the scaled fitness calculation does not adequately differentiate one match from another, and thus occurs if two master walks have the same probability of occurrence and reside within the same ranked probability mass. If such a situation arises, then choosing either match is sufficient as they will calculate out to the same fitness value and have the same degree of anomalousness. At , using the master walk with the highest scaled fitness, at , the rank of the master walk with the highest scaled fitness may be determined in the overall master walk's percentile distribution by using the best fitting master walk's ranking coefficient and the ranking coefficient of the next lowest rank from Equation (10). At , the directionality from Equation (11) may be determined between the master and incoming walk pairing. At , the significance may be determined, and the result of the computation may be returned at  by the anomaly detection module .","According to an example, for the master directed graph  of , a determination as to the anomalousness of the decomposed incoming walk  of , i.e., {Start, 1, 2, 3, 3, Stop}, is described.
