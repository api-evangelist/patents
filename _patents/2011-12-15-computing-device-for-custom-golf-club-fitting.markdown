{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to golf club fitting. In an example embodiment, the disclosure relates to a computing device for custom golf club fitting.","Currently, there are many applications that locate appropriate sized golf clubs to match a user's unique traits. Typically, a user interfaces with such an application to input various information, such as his height, his glove size, his gender, his hand preference, his assessment of his game, and other information. The application then uses the inputted information to find or recommend one or more golf clubs that fit the user's individual needs.","However, some or all information manually inputted by the user is inaccurate because the information is estimated by the user. That is, the user typically does not have the means to measure a particular parameter at the time when inputting such information into the application, and therefore, the user basically provides an estimate of the requested information. For example, a user typically does not have a ruler or other instrument to measure his hand size and thus, the user can only provide an estimate of his glove size. The problem with providing inaccurate information is that the golf clubs identified by conventional applications may not be a good fit to the user's individual needs.","The description that follows includes illustrative systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences, and computing machine program products that embody illustrative embodiments of the present invention. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","102"]},"Example embodiments can automatically detect, using sensors of the mobile computing device, one or more parameters, such as the golf glove size. For example, as explained in more detail below, the mobile computing device can detect a hand dimension using a sensor. This detected hand dimension correlates to a grip size of the golf club, and the application communicates this hand dimension, along with other parameters, to an online platform that facilitates sales of golf clubs. The online platform then searches its inventory for all golf clubs that satisfy the parameters provided by the application, and then communicates to the application an inventory of golf clubs that have a matching grip size and\/or other matching parameters.","The application, as executed on the mobile computing device, then displays the inventory communicated from the online platform. From the mobile device, a user can then shop for one or more golf clubs by browsing through the inventory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","204","210","212","206","210","208","212"]},"In the online platform , an Application Programming Interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . Application servers  are commerce servers that can host, for example, one or more marketplace applications  and payment applications . Application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases .","Marketplace applications  may provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users that access the online platform . Payment applications  may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. Payment applications  may allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as \u201cpoints\u201d) in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are made available via the marketplace applications . While the marketplace and payment applications  and  are shown in  to both form part of the online platform , it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, payment applications  may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the online platform .","Further, while the system  shown in  employs a client-server architecture, the present invention is not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various marketplace and payment applications  and  could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.","The Web client  accesses the various marketplace and payment applications  and  via the web interface supported by web server . Similarly, programmatic client  accesses the various services and functions provided by the marketplace and payment applications  and  via the programmatic interface provided by API server . Programmatic client  may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TURBOLISTER application developed by EBAY INC., of San Jose, Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on online platform  in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between programmatic client  and online platform . Some embodiments of the present invention may be implemented by components of the marketplace application(s) . For example, a content provider manager  or other system may perform the marketplace listing management functions and activities described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["228","230","202","214","228","202","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["312","312"]},"In one embodiment, the custom golf fit module  is configured to communicate with an online platform, such as the online platform  depicted in . In various embodiments, the custom golf fit module  may be used to implement computer programs, logic, applications, methods, processes, or software to automatically detect parameters (e.g., hand dimensions of a user) for custom golf club fittings.","As depicted in , the custom golf fit module  includes a GUI module , a fitting module , a fitting library , and a software development kit (SDK) . The fitting module  is configured to detect one or more parameters. For example, as explained in more detail below, the fitting module  can activate various sensors, such as a camera or an accelerometer included in a mobile computing device, to detect various hand dimensions. The fitting module  can then communicate the parameters to an online platform through, for example, the SDK . In one embodiment, the SDK  includes a search API . In general, the search API  enables access to various functionalities related to searching, which may be provided by the online platform or, a search engine. For example, through the search API , calls can be made to search for items by category, description, and product information.","The GUI module  is configured to generate the GUIs for display at the mobile computing device. As also explained in more detail below, the fitting library  is configured to store various information used for parameter conversions. For example, the fitting library  can include or store a conversion table that correlates hand dimensions to grip sizes. In another example, the fitting library  can store a different conversion table that correlates hand dimensions to glove sizes.","It should be appreciated that in other embodiments, the custom golf fit module  may include fewer or more modules apart from those shown in . For example, in an alternate embodiment, the fitting library  can be integrated within the fitting module . The modules , , , and  may be in the form of software that is processed by a processor. In another example, as explained in more detail below, the modules , , and  may be in the form of firmware that is processed by Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which may be integrated into a circuit board of a mobile computing device. Alternatively, the modules , , and  may be in the form of one or more logic blocks included in a programmable logic device (e.g., a field programmable gate array (FPGA)). The described modules , , , and  may be adapted, and\/or additional structures may be provided, to provide alternative or additional functionalities beyond those specifically discussed in reference to . Examples of such alternatives or additional functionalities will be discussed in reference to the flow diagrams discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","312","402"]},"The fitting module then composes or creates a query based on the detected hand dimension, at . A \u201cquery,\u201d as used herein, is an enquiry about one or more items, which include any tangible or intangible thing and\/or something that has a distinct, separate existence from other things (e.g., goods and services). The terms included in the query can include words, numbers, symbols, and other alphanumeric characters. The query can be submitted to an online platform to locate, purchase, or bid on one or more items. In one embodiment, the query includes the detected hand dimension itself. In another embodiment, the query includes a grip size. To calculate or determine the grip size, the fitting module accesses a conversion table, which is stored in the fitting library, which is used to convert hand dimensions to grip sizes. In another embodiment, the query is a glove size. Here, the fitting module accesses a different conversion table that is used to convert hand dimensions to glove sizes.","Thereafter, the query is communicated, at , to one or more databases storing an inventory of golf clubs. Such a communication can be through a search API. In one embodiment, the databases can be included in an online platform that facilitates sales of golf clubs. In response to the query, at , the fitting module, through the search API, receives golf club information from the database identifying golf clubs having the grip size. For example, the fitting module can receive an inventory of a number of golf clubs from the online platform that have a particular grip size that correlates to the detected hand dimension. The graphical user interface module then, at , provides the golf club information for display on the mobile computing device. A user can then view the inventory and select one or more golf clubs for purchase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","312","502"]},"The fitting module then, at , detects a dimension of the predefined object in the picture. It should be appreciated that a variety of different techniques can be used to detect the dimension. For example, the fitting module can use an algorithm to identify an outline of the predefined object and, based on the outline, measure a dimension of the predefined object in the picture. At , the fitting module calculates a ratio of the predefined object based on the detected dimension and the standard dimension of the predefined object. As explained in more detail below, the hand dimension can then be calculated, at , based on this ratio.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["604","204","602","602","604","204","602","652","204","204","204","204"]},"Additionally, the custom golf fit module can detect hand dimension . For example, the custom golf fit module can also detect various features and outlines of the hand , and use these features and outlines for reference to measure hand dimension , which is a distance from a main crease under a base of a wrist to a tip of the longest finger on the hand .","From these two detected dimensions  and , the actual hand dimension  can be identified or detected. For example, the actual hand distance can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nActual Hand Dimension=Detected Hand Dimension*Ratio\n\nwhere the Ratio is the detected object dimension\/standard object dimension, as discussed above.\n","In an alternate embodiment, instead of providing the flexibility to have the user place his hand  anywhere in the proximity of the mobile computing device , the mobile computing device  can display a viewfinder of the camera with predefined marks indicating a position and distance to place the predefined object (along with the hand ) relative to the camera. For example, the mobile computing device  can display a viewfinder with two parallel lines indicating where the outer diameter of the coin  should be placed. The user, when viewing through the viewfinder, places his hand with the coin  such that the edges of the coin  touch the two lines. Given that the two lines are predefined, the ratio of the coin  is already known and therefore, the hand dimension  can be quickly detected or measured without an additional calculation of the ratio of the coin .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["102","702","704","708","700","102","702","704","708","102","102","102","702","704","702","704"]},"The custom golf fit module then composes a query with all the parameters (e.g., gender, height, wrist to floor distance, golf glove size, and swing speed) and communicates the query to an online platform. In response to the query, the custom golf fit module receives an inventory from an online platform listing all the golf clubs that satisfy the query. As depicted in , the custom golf fit module then provides the inventory for display, in the form of GUI  listing and showing pictures of the golf clubs and their prices that have been determined to be a custom fit for the user. Through use of the GUI , a user can browse the inventory of golf clubs and initiate a purchase of one or more of the listed golf clubs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 3","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","800","312","802","804","806"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["604","602","604","602","602","604"]},"During the movement, the mobile computing device  tracks a time to move from the first point to the second point, and also detects the acceleration during this time. With these two variables identified (time and acceleration), the fitting module can then use, for example, the following equation to calculate a displacement, which correlates to the hand dimension:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0044"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["\u0394","x"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":"0","mi":"t"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","\u2062","]"],"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":"0","msup":{"mi":["t","\u2032"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["a","x"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mrow":{"mi":"t","mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mi":"\u2033"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","msup":{"mi":["t","\u2033"]}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}}},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}},{"mo":"\u2146","msup":{"mi":["t","\u2032"]}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"sub":"x "},"The custom golf fit module can then prompt the user to measure another hand dimension, such as a length of a longest finger of the hand using the techniques described above. With these two hand dimensions detected, the custom golf fit module can convert them into a glove size or directly convert them to a grip size by looking up the corresponding glove size or grip size, respectively, using the appropriate conversion chart.","As a result, when compared to conventional applications where a user estimates his glove size, embodiments of the present invention may possibly provide more convenient and accurate methodologies to provide custom golf club fittings, such as the automatic determination of a grip size.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"1000"},"The machine is capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine. Further, while only a single machine is illustrated, the term \u201cmachine\u201d shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set (or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.","The example of the computing device  includes a processor  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  (e.g., random access memory), and static memory  (e.g., static random-access memory), which communicate with each other via bus . The computing device  may further include video display unit  (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD)), a camera , an accelerometer , an alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard), a user interface (UI) navigation device , a disk drive unit , a signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker), and a network interface device .","The disk drive unit  (a type of non-volatile memory storage) includes a machine-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of data structures and instructions  (e.g., software) embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The data structures and instructions  may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory  and\/or within the processor  during execution thereof by computing device , with the main memory  and processor  also constituting machine-readable, tangible media.","The data structures and instructions  may further be transmitted or received over a computer network  via network interface device  utilizing any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)).","Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, modules, or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., the computing device ) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor  or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.","In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a FPGA or an ASIC) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor  or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor  configured using software, the general-purpose processor  may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor , for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other modules. For example, the described modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiples of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the modules. In embodiments in which multiple modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple modules have access. For example, one module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors  that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors  may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors  or processor-implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors , not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processors  may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors  may be distributed across a number of locations.","While the embodiment(s) is (are) described with reference to various implementations and exploitations, it will be understood that these embodiments are illustrative and that the scope of the embodiment(s) is not limited to them. In general, techniques for custom golf club fittings may be implemented with facilities consistent with any hardware system or hardware systems defined herein. Many variations, modifications, additions, and improvements are possible.","Plural instances may be provided for components, operations or structures described herein as a single instance. Finally, boundaries between various components, operations, and data stores are somewhat arbitrary, and particular operations are illustrated in the context of specific illustrative configurations. Other allocations of functionality are envisioned and may fall within the scope of the embodiment(s). In general, structures and functionality presented as separate components in the exemplary configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components.
