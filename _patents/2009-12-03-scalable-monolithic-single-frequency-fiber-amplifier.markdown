title: Scalable monolithic single frequency fiber amplifier
abstract: A method to increase the output power of monolithic narrow-linewidth Yb-doped fiber amplifiers by suppressing simulated Brillouin scattering. The fiber amplifier employs a co-propagating geometry and is seeded with broad- (source ) and narrow- (source ) linewidth signals that are sufficiently different in wavelengths to allow for efficient gain competition and favorable temperature profile at the output end of fiber. The broadband seed signal possesses the higher emission and absorption cross sections. If source  is also given sufficiently greater input power than source , it will be amplified to its maximum value as the seed signals reach the middle portion of the gain fiber. Beyond that portion, the signal having the lower emission and absorption cross sections (signal ) will continue to experience gain by power transfer from both signal  and the pump light, attaining a power output well beyond what the maximum output would have been had the amplifier been illuminated with a single frequency beam. Furthermore, if the two signals are carefully selected such that appreciable quantum defect heating occurs during the power transfer, a steep thermal gradient develops leading to even further increase in output power.

This invention is related to co-pending patent application Ser. No. 12\/198,308 filed Aug. 25, 2008.","Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is a limiting factor in the evolution of rare-earth doped fiber lasers and amplifiers towards higher power. This phenomenon is a result of a third-order nonlinear process that causes the scattering of laser light by a travelling hypersonic acoustic grating. The latter is initiated from thermal noise. From a quantum physics viewpoint, a photon is scattered by a phonon leading to a frequency-shifted photon. Therefore, as a by-product, Doppler-shifted scattered light known as Stokes light is generated. The interaction of the Stokes light with the laser light induces electrostriction in the medium leading to further amplification of both acoustic and Stokes waves. In an optical fiber, momentum conservation requires the Stokes light to propagate in the opposite direction as the laser light. It is well-known in the art that once a certain amount of optical power is coupled into or is generated in the fiber, significant backscattered Stokes light is produced causing the performance of the fiber to degrade.","This deleterious SBS process is characterized by a gain spectrum that determines the acoustic response of the medium to the pump frequency. Measurements in silica fibers have established a Brillouin shift of approximately 16 GHz and a linewidth of approximately 40 MHz at a signal wavelength of 1-1.1 \u03bcm. The effective SBS gain can be diminished through the use of a broad linewidth seed laser. However, several important applications, including coherent beam combination for directed energy purposes, nonlinear frequency conversion in resonant cavities or in single pass configurations, gravitational wave detection, and inter-satellite communications, require the use of high power narrow linewidth optical fiber amplifiers and lasers. Therefore, there is a need for techniques that mitigate the SBS process.","The SBS threshold can be increased by decreasing the effective length of the fiber, increasing the mode field diameter (MFD), or somehow manipulating the Brillouin gain. The increase in the SBS threshold through the decrease of length is limited by either requirements for amplifier efficiency or rare-earth elements solubility in silica. Much work has been done to increase the effective area of the fiber through the use of large mode area (LMA) fibers. While conventional LMA fiber designs have been successful in delivering single mode power outputs exceeding 100 watts, there is general agreement that new approaches are required for further enhancement of power.","A variety of experimental efforts have been attempted or proposed to reduce the SBS threshold through the manipulation of the SBS gain. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,259 by Clayton et al., the SBS threshold is reduced by introducing a modulation in the tension applied to the fiber during the draw process. This idea was expanded on in U.S. Pat. No. 6,542,683 by Evans et al. as a permanent, non-uniform stress is imparted to the fiber core through non-uniform thermal expansion and viscosity profiles. The latter inventor shows that a simple modulation of tension during the draw process leads to a marginal increase in the SBS threshold. The technique is limited by the fact that a change in the draw tension leads to a change in the fiber diameter. The latter inventor also did not envision a fiber which could be manufactured with polarization maintaining properties.","An attractive technique used in SBS mitigation is to induce a shift in the Brillouin frequency by introducing a thermal gradient in the fiber. The frequency shift was measured by Imai et al. to be approximately 2 MHz per degree Kelvin as reported in a 1993 paper in IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett. 16, pp. 133-1337. Along these lines, in 2007 Jeong et al. reported in IEEE J. of Selected Topics in Quantum Electron., pp. 546-551, that SBS gain broadening along the longitudinal direction of the fiber due to quantum-defect heating increased the SBS threshold sufficiently enough that signals with linewidths below 1 MHz and powers approaching 500 W were obtained. Fundamentally, quantum defect heating is a manifestation of the energy difference between a pump photon and a signal photon. One can also attempt to tailor the temperature variation in the transverse direction. However, it does not appear based on theoretical analysis that this would yield any appreciable SBS suppression.","Alternatively, transverse tailoring of the acoustic properties of fibers was suggested by Bickham et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 7,082,243 and was reported to be successful in increasing the SBS threshold by Chen et al. in Opt. Express 15, 8290-8299, 2007. But so far, attempts to fully utilize a transverse acoustic gradient in conjunction with a longitudinal thermal gradient have not been fruitful. Furthermore, it is well-known to those practicing the art that, in itself, the full benefit of a quantum defect induced thermal gradient is only realized in what is referred to as a counter-pump configuration. In such a configuration, the signal light propagates in the opposite direction to the pump light. While such a configuration is beneficial in suppressing SBS, it is not well-suited for monolithic all fiber configurations due to the exposure of pump combiners to the signal light. Consequently, robust deployment of counter-pumped fibers in rugged environments is problematic.","Another important issue for the full utilization of thermal gradients is the operating temperature of the acrylate polymer in the outer cladding region or in the coating region of the fiber. Operating temperatures are typically under 200\u00b0 C. Based on theoretical analysis, it is possible then to be thermally limited. In other words, the polymer material will be damaged due to the heat generated in the core prior to the SBS threshold being reached. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to explore ideas to keep the temperature from exceeding maximum operating temperature while maintaining an effective thermal gradient for SBS suppression purposes.","In 2004, Wessels et al. reported in Optics Express 12, pp. 4443-4448 on a 72 m-long fiber amplifier pumped with two seed lasers. The two seed signals were separated by twice the SBS shift. The Stokes generated light from one laser signal coupled into the second laser light, allowing the first laser signal to grow to twice the power level of a single seed amplifier. One significant drawback of this technique is the requirement that the two seed signals have to be precisely tuned. Another significant drawback is that at such a small frequency separation, a parasitic process known as four-wave mixing (FWM) is prominent, leading to the generation of several frequency sidebands. This broadening of the optical power spectrum precludes the implementation of this method in fiber laser applications that require well-defined spectra such as coherent beam combining. Alternatively, another technique was proposed in 2009 by Dajani et al. in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics 15, pp. 406-414 whereby a broad- and narrow-linewidth seed laser signals are employed. The two laser signals are sufficiently separated in wavelengths to suppress FWM while allowing for efficient gain competition resulting, at the output end of the fiber, in the narrow linewidth signal dominating the signal output power. While this technique can result in tripling the output power of the narrow linewidth signal, the authors address neither the utility of developing a thermal gradient in the fiber in conjunction with the aforementioned technique nor provide a recipe for achieving a large thermal gradient.","While some of the foregoing patents and applications may describe techniques that can lead to improvement in the power output of narrow linewidth amplifiers, each can have limitations. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for new methods that address prior deficiencies.","The present invention for mitigating SBS effects is a novel technique that takes advantage of the emission and absorption properties of ytterbium (Yb)-doped fibers or any fibers doped with other rare-earth elements with similar spectroscopic properties. The technique employs a co-propagating pump configuration where broad- and narrow-linewidth signals are coupled into a fiber and propagate in the same direction as the pump. The signals are selected such that the broadband signal has a shorter wavelength and greater emission and absorption cross sections than the narrow-linewidth signal. Furthermore, the input power of the former is significantly greater than the latter. Initially, both signals grow with distance along the fiber. However, at a certain point along the fiber, the broadband signal will begin to rapidly transfer its power to the narrow-linewidth signal. Consequently, the effective length of the fiber is shortened leading to an increase in the SBS threshold. Appreciable further enhancement is achieved when a U- or V-shaped temperature profile, or a point of inflection in the temperature profile, is induced in a significant portion of the fiber due to quantum defect heating. Alternatively, in some cases, a large portion of the fiber can be kept at constant temperature through external control of the heat flow, while allowing for a steep negative or positive temperature gradient to be developed at the output end of the fiber due to quantum defect heating. This can potentially lead to even better SBS suppression. Both of these scenarios can be accomplished by careful selection of the signal wavelengths.","The present invention is a method of suppressing the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) effect in order to allow for the design of high power narrow linewidth (single frequency) lasers and amplifiers. The invention is applicable to various waveguide structures comprised of core and cladding regions in which most of the light power is contained in the core. The invention will also work in conjunction with other SBS suppressing schemes.","As an overview, a Yb-doped double clad fiber amplifier consists of a silica core doped with the rare-earth element ytterbium (Yb), an inner cladding region, and outer cladding region. The purpose of the double clad is to provide guiding for the pump light. The purpose of ytterbium is to provide laser gain due to the pump absorption in the core. Laser gain is achieved when a sufficient number of electrons are made to occupy the upper energy lasing level of a Yb ion. In addition to the pump light, a laser beam called the \u201csignal\u201d (or \u201cseed\u201d) is coupled into the core. As this signal travels along the length of the fiber, it encounters laser gain due to the population inversion and is thus amplified. As a result, power is typically transferred from the low brightness multi-mode pump light and into the high brightness single mode light making the amplifier suitable for a variety of applications. As discussed above, SBS is a major obstacle towards this amplification process and will thus impose an upper limit (threshold) on the amount of signal light that can be generated in a given amplifier.","The present invention makes use of the simultaneous illumination of the fiber amplifier by two seed signals possessing different wavelengths with a wavelength separation of approximately 20 nm or greater. Furthermore, one of the signals (source ) possesses a broad linewidth, while the other signal (source ) possesses a narrow-linewidth. In this case \u201cbroad-linewidth\u201d (or \u201cbroadband\u201d) indicates that the spectral width is much greater than the SBS gain spectrum. Source  should have a linewidth that is greater than 7 times the Brillouin gain spectral width for near maximum benefit. Source , however, could function from greater than 3 to at least 20 times the Brillouin gain spectral width. Those skilled in the art will recognize that this broadband signal does not generate much SBS if any. The \u201cnarrow-linewidth\u201d, which is often referred in the art as \u201csingle frequency\u201d, indicates the spectral width is on the order of the Brillouin gain spectral width or less. The wavelengths and input powers of the two seed signals are chosen such that the emission and absorption cross sections and input power of signal  is greater than that of signal . A reasonable input power range ratio would be for source  to have 10 times or greater input power compared to source . Power ratios below 10 to 1 but greater than 3 to 1 can still work but with reduced benefit. It is best not to put an upper limit on this ratio since the optimal value is determined by the specifics of the amplifier and can be different for different configurations. Generally, the upper limit on the power ratio would be greater than 20 to 1.","In a co-pumped configuration and with no consideration of the thermal gradient, both signals will initially grow along the length of the fiber until a point where signal  will start transferring its power to signal . Due to the confinement of signal  to the core, this power transfer is highly efficient and comparable to the power transfer of the pump light (which propagates in the core and inner cladding) to the signals. As a result, the output power will be predominantly comprised of signal . The favorable spatial profile of signal  in the fiber as a result of the gain competition leads to an increase in the SBS threshold and consequently amplifier performance. This effect can be enhanced significantly if a steep thermal gradient is induced at the output end of the fiber.","For a co-pumped configuration and single seed signal, it is well-known that a steep negative thermal gradient due to quantum defect heating develops at the input end of the fiber. Meanwhile, little variation in temperature is induced at the output end where the signal is highest. Consequently, little SBS suppression is obtained due to the temperature profile. With two signals coupled into the fiber as described above, careful selection of the wavelengths is required in order to forgo a similar temperature profile as the single seed case. In order to obtain a steep thermal gradient at the output end of the fiber, a U or V-shaped temperature profile, or a point of inflection leading to a steep thermal gradient, needs to be induced in a significant portion of the fiber. This can be accomplished if sufficient quantum defect heating is obtained during the process of power transfer from signal  to signal . Therefore, the wavelengths of the two signals need to be separated as much as possible while maintaining efficient laser gain along the length of the fiber.","To illustrate this technique, we refer to  which depicts the spectroscopic properties of Yb-doped silica fibers. As shown, the peak absorption cross section is located near 976 nm. Due to this, diode lasers operating at or near this wavelength are coupled into the cladding region as pump light for fiber lasers and amplifiers and with sufficient power to induce population inversion in the core. At the longer wavelength side of the figure (right side of primary peaks of the absorption and emission cross sections), a secondary peak for the emission cross section appears near 1030 nm. However, note that no secondary peak to the right of the primary appears for the absorption cross section. Instead, the absorption cross section continues to decrease with increasing wavelength. At approximately 1100 nm, the emission cross section drops significantly enough and a parasitic lasing process known as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) becomes problematic. As a result, it is rather difficult to construct Yb-doped fiber lasers and amplifiers beyond 1100 nm. Therefore, the wavelength region 1030-1090 nm is the most suitable for implementation in an efficient fiber amplifier. It should be pointed out here that, for two-signal seeding of the amplifier, some suppression of ASE is expected which can make this wavelength range somewhat broader.","For the broadband signal  (signal ) utilized in this invention, the most suitable wavelength range is 1030 nm-1045 nm as sufficient absorption can occur once this signal reaches its peak value. Those practicing the art will recognize that this absorption process is crucial for transferring the power from signal  to signal . For the latter, the most suitable range is 1060-1080 nm as laser gain, which depends on both the emission and absorption cross sections, is maximized. Note from  that this range is characterized by an almost \u201cflat\u201d profile of the cross sections. In order to get a U-shaped or V-shaped profile in a significant portion of the fiber, it is crucial to obtain high quantum defect heating during the power transfer while ensuring that the two signals, at the very least, lie within the wavelength ranges prescribed above. In other words, the wavelengths required to optimize the quantum defect heating are a subset of these ranges. Since the photon energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength and the quantum defect heating is a manifestation of the difference in energy among the photons of the two signals, those practicing the art will now recognize for maximum benefit the need to operate signal  at the lower end of its appropriate wavelength range, and signal  near the upper end of its appropriate wavelength range. It is important to point out here that the total power transfer among signal , signal , and the pump typically dictates an even more precipitous drop in temperature following the U- or V-shaped profile. Since this process occurs near the output end of the fiber where signal  is highest, significant suppression of SBS is obtained. Alternatively, in some cases, one can forgo the U- or V-shaped profiles by external control of the temperature of the fiber up to those points, and then allowing a steep drop or rise in temperature to develop at the output end of the fiber.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","2","3","4","4","5","9","7","8"]},"While this technique should prove to be very effective in monolithic systems, it can also be readily employed in systems in which any or all of the optical waves are coupled into the fiber or other parts of the system using free space optics. Regardless of the particular experimental implementation of this invention, there are two parameters which are key components of the design that need to be controlled in order to obtain power enhancement of the single frequency laser beam. These two parameters are the power ratios among the seed signals and the wavelength (or equivalently frequency) separations. Another consideration is to ensure that the temperature of the coating does not exceed the maximum operating temperature.","It is well-known in the art that each laser beam experiences gain or loss due to interaction with the gain medium and that only the narrow-linewidth laser light generates its own Stokes light which travels in the opposite direction. Moreover, due to the shift in the Brillouin resonance frequency as a result of the temperature gradient, the Stokes frequency can be thought of as a collection of frequencies. Starting with Maxwell's equations and using standard derivation procedures used in the field of nonlinear optics, we obtain the following two equations that describe the spatial evolution of the powers of the two signals:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":"P","mn":"1"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"z"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":"g","mn":"1"},{"mi":"P","mn":"1"}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"i"},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"B","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"S"},"mo":",","mi":"i"}},{"mi":"P","mn":"1"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]},"msub":{"mi":["A","eff"]}}}],"mo":"-"}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":"P","mn":"2"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"z"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"g","mn":"2"},{"mi":"P","mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}]}}},"br":[{},{},{},{}],"sub":["1 ","B1 ","1","2 ","2","eff ","1","2","1","1","1","2","2","2","1","2","1 ","2 ","1","1","1","2","2","2"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["g","=N","\u2212N","g","=N","\u2212N"],"sup":["(e)","(a)","(e)","(a)","(e) ","(a) ","(e) ","(a) "]},"For a co-propagating pump in a double clad configuration, the evolution of the pump power is given by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":["P","p"]}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"z"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msubsup":[{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"core","mn":"2"},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"clad","mn":"2"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["\u03c3","p"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"e"}}},{"msub":{"mi":"N","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","msubsup":{"mi":["\u03c3","p"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"a"}}}],"mo":"-"}},"msub":{"mi":["P","p"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"5"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["core ","clad "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2146","msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"S"},"mo":",","mi":"i"}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"z"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","msub":{"mi":"g","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"S"},"mo":",","mi":"i"}}},"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":"B","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}},{"mi":"P","mn":"1"},{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"\u2062","mi":"S"},"mo":",","mi":"i"}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]},"msub":{"mi":["A","eff"]}}}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"6"}}]}}}}},"In reality, Eq.

Referring to Equations (3) and (4), the laser gain experienced by the two seed frequencies will be different. For a co-propagating pump configuration, the upper level population density, N, is relatively high in the proximity of the input end of the fiber and both signals experience gain. If pumping power is high and the input power of signal  is significantly larger than that of signal , the former is amplified to its maximum value before these signals have propagated to the midpoint of the fiber. This power value is much higher than that of signal  at that point of the fiber. Due to significant absorption of the pump light, the population inversion beyond that point is such that signal  will become attenuated. Equation (4) indicates that occurs when \u03c3N>\u03c3N. However, if the absorption cross section of signal  is much smaller than that of signal , the former will continue to experience laser gain leading to a power transfer from both signal  and the pump light and into signal . Even though the absorption cross section for signal  is much smaller than the pump, the power transfer from signal  to signal  is very rapid due to the confinement of signal  to the core. The reduction in the Stokes light is due to the suppressed amplification of signal  in a significant portion of the fiber as can be inferred from the equations above. From Eq. 7, when the gradient of power for signal () goes negative, additional heat is being deposited in the fiber due to the power transfer of the signals. For a large separation of wavelength between the two signals, this thermal gradient becomes steep and a U- or V-shaped temperature profile develops. This leads to a remarkable enhancement in the SBS threshold; well beyond that obtained if no thermal gradient was developed.","The following examples will make those practicing the art appreciate the design parameters needed to implement this invention. The design was run using a fully developed simulation system that extends beyond the simplified equations discussed above and accounts for the spatial distribution of the Brillouin noise as well as effects due to the transverse profiles of the signals within the fiber.","A double clad fiber with a core diameter of 25 \u03bcm and an inner cladding diameter of 400 \u03bcm.
