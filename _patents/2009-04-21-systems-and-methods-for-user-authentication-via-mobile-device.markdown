title: Systems and methods for user authentication via mobile device
abstract: A user may provide a financial card to an automated teller machine (ATM) or point of sale (POS) terminal and may be authenticated by providing a gesture and/or an image selection via a mobile device to the ATM or the POS. The gesture and/or image selection may be provided using a touchscreen of the mobile device. The gesture and/or image provided by the user via the mobile device may be compared to a stored gesture and/or image provided by the user during an earlier registration of the financial card. If there is a match between the gesture and/or image provided by the user via the mobile device and the previously stored gesture and/or image, then the user is authenticated and may access an account associated with the financial card.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An automated teller machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunications device that provides a user with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a human clerk or bank teller. An ATM may be placed anywhere, such as, for example, near or inside the premises of a bank or in a location such as a shopping center, an airport, a grocery store, a gas station, a restaurant, or any place people may gather. Using an ATM, users can access their bank accounts in order to make cash withdrawals (or credit card cash advances) and check their account balances, for example.","Typically, the user is identified at an ATM by inserting a financial card, such as an ATM card, a credit card, or a debit card, into the ATM. The financial card may be a plastic card with a magnetic stripe or a plastic smartcard with a chip and contains a unique card number and information such as an expiration date and\/or a card security code (also known as a card verification value). Authentication of the user is provided by the user entering a personal identification number (PIN) into a keypad of the ATM.","There are incidents of fraud where perpetrators attach fake keypads or card readers to existing ATMs and well as other point of sale (POS) terminals. Cameras are often deployed in conjunction with the fake keypads and card readers. These \u201cskimming\u201d devices are used to record users' PINs and financial card information in order to gain unauthorized access to the users' accounts.","A user may provide a financial card to an automated teller machine (ATM) or point of sale (POS) terminal and may be authenticated by providing a gesture via a mobile device to the ATM or the POS. The gesture may be provided using a touchscreen of the mobile device. The gesture provided by the user via the mobile device may be compared to a stored gesture provided by the user during an earlier registration of the financial card. If there is a match between the gesture provided by the user via the mobile device and the previously stored gesture, then the user is authenticated and may access an account associated with the financial card.","In an implementation, the user may select an image via the mobile device and the selected image may be used in conjunction with a gesture to authenticate the user at the ATM or the POS.","In an implementation, the user may provide a gesture and\/or an image via the mobile device in order to be authenticated to perform a particular transaction with the ATM or the POS.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["200","105","102","102","199","190","199","102","190","102"]},"A user  and an associated mobile device  are shown. In an implementation, the user  may be an individual who owns an account  that is held by the institution  and accessible via the institution system . The account  may be any type of account that may be associated with a financial card, such as a credit card account, a charge card account, or an account for depositing funds and from which funds may be withdrawn, such as a savings account, a checking account, a brokerage account, and the like.","The mobile device  may be any type of computing device such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile phone, a smart phone, a handheld computing device, and the like. In an implementation, the mobile device  is a pocket-sized computing device, having a display screen with touch input via a touchscreen interface. A touchscreen is a display which can detect the presence and location of a touch within the display area. The term generally refers to touch or contact to the display of the device by a finger or hand. Touchscreens can also sense other passive objects, such as a stylus. The ability to interact directly with a display typically indicates the presence of a touchscreen. A miniature keyboard may be provided as part of the mobile device . The mobile device  has wireless capability to connect to the Internet and other computer systems via various communications networks. A possible configuration of a mobile device, such as the mobile device , is described with respect to .","The ATM  is a computerized telecommunications device that provides the user  (as well as other customers of the institution  or other users, for example) with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a human clerk or bank teller. The ATM  may have a sign indicating the name of the bank or institution owning, operating, or otherwise affiliated with, the ATM .","Although ATMs were originally developed as just cash dispensers, they have evolved to include many other bank related and non-bank related functions. ATMs include many functions such as providing deposit currency recognition and acceptance, facilitating payment of routine bills, fees, and taxes, printing bank statements, loading monetary value into stored value cards, selling items such as postage stamps, lottery tickets, train tickets, concert tickets, shopping mall gift certificates, etc., providing games and promotional features, providing check processing, etc.","In an implementation, a point of sale may be used instead of the ATM  as described further herein. A POS can be a location where a transaction occurs, such as a retail shop, a checkout counter in a shop, etc. Point of sale systems are used in supermarkets, restaurants, hotels, stadiums, and casinos, as well as almost any type of retail establishment. Point of sale systems use a POS terminal which may be considered a form of electronic cash register. A POS terminal is a device that can do transactions with a financial card, such as a credit card, a charge card, or a debit card, for example. Although examples herein may be described with respect to an ATM, it is contemplated that the techniques and operations described herein may be applied to POS systems and terminals.","In an implementation, the user  may visit the ATM  and provide information from the financial card  to the ATM  (e.g., by swiping the financial card  at the ATM  or by transmitting information such as user name, card number, expiration date, security code, etc. from the mobile device  to the ATM ). The user  may be authenticated by providing a gesture and\/or an image selection via the mobile device  to the ATM , as described further herein. A gesture, as the term is used herein, is a type of written communication made with a finger or stylus or other input device on a touchscreen or display of a computing device, such as the mobile device , for example. The gesture may represent any symbol. The gesture may be freeform or traced (e.g., the user  may trace a gesture over characters or images provided in a display of the mobile device ). In an implementation, the user may fingerswipe a predetermined pattern or symbol or trace a pattern or path on the touchscreen of the mobile device .","The gesture and\/or image selection provided by the user  via the mobile device  may be compared to a previously stored gesture and\/or image provided by the user  during an earlier registration of the financial card  with the institution system . If there is a match between the gesture and\/or image provided by the user  via the mobile device  and the previously stored gesture and\/or image, then the user is authenticated and may access an account associated with the financial card. In an implementation, the user  may authenticate via the mobile device  in order to perform particular transactions with the ATM .","The ATM  may perform the authentication of the user alone or in conjunction with the institution system . The ATM  may communicate over a communications network with the institution system  to perform the authentication processing. In an implementation, the communication may be performed through an ISO 8583 messaging system, though any communication technique(s) may be used. In addition to techniques employed for transaction security and secrecy, the communications traffic between the ATM  and the institution system  may also be encrypted via methods such as secure sockets layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS). The ATM  and the institution system  may also communicate to tie the financial card  to an account of the user .","The ATM  may connect to the institution system  via a dial-up modem over a telephone line, directly via a leased line, or via an Internet connection. Common lower-level layer communication protocols that may be used by the ATM  to communicate with the institution system  include SNA (systems network architecture) over SDLC (synchronous data link control), X.25, and TCP\/IP over Ethernet, for example.","Sensitive data in ATM transactions may be encrypted with data encryption standard (DES) or triple DES. Remote key loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialization of the encryption keys in the ATM . Message authentication code (MAC) or partial MAC may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM  and the institution system .","The ATM  may comprise a central processing unit (CPU) to control the user interface and transaction devices, a magnetic and\/or chip card reader to identify the user , a personal identification number (PIN) pad, a secure cryptoprocessor (a dedicated computer or microprocessor for carrying out cryptographic operations, embedded in a packaging with multiple physical security measures, which provides tamper resistance), a display that may used by the user  for performing some aspects of a transaction in an implementation, function key buttons or a touchscreen that may be used to select the various aspects of the transaction, and a record printer to provide the user  with a record of their transaction. Such components may be comprised within the ATM computing device  shown in . An example computing device is described with respect to . The ATM  may also comprise a vault to store the parts of the machinery having restricted access, and a housing for aesthetics and to attach signage to. Such components are well known and not shown in .","Recently, due to heavier computing demands and the falling price of computer-like architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using microcontrollers and\/or application specific integrated circuits to adopting a hardware architecture that is very similar to a personal computer (PC). Many ATMs are now able to use operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Linux. With the migration to commodity PC hardware, standard commercial off-the-shelf operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms used in ATM development include RMX, OS\/2, and Microsoft operating systems. Java, Linux, and Unix may also be used in these environments.","The ATM  may comprise a communications module  that is adapted to communicate with the mobile device , e.g., via a communications module  of the mobile device . The ATM  may comprise an authentication module  that is adapted to perform the authentication of the user  (e.g., alone or in conjunction with the institution system ). The authentication module  may prompt the user  for authentication information (e.g., a gesture and\/or an image selection) via an authentication module  of the mobile device . In response, the user  may provide a gesture and\/or an image selection through a touchscreen of the mobile device . The ATM  receives the gesture and\/or the image selection from the mobile device  and performs the authentication using techniques and operations described herein.","The institution system  may include a user interface module , a financial card engine , and a data source access engine . The user interface module  may generate and format one or more pages of content  as a unified graphical presentation that may be provided to the mobile device , or another user computing device such as a PC or any other computing device, as an output from the financial card engine . In an implementation, the page(s) of content  may be provided to the mobile device  via a secure website  associated with the institution system . On the website , the user  may be presented with information pertaining to the account , the financial card , and\/or gesture and image information for the financial card  such as registration of one or more gestures and\/or images for the financial card , as described further herein.","The user  may communicate with the institution system  by way of a communications network such as an intranet, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless fidelity (WiFi) network, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular network, a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network, and the like. The user  may also communicate with the institution system  by phone, email, instant messaging, test messaging, web chat, facsimile, mail, and the like.","The financial card engine  may register one or more gestures and\/or images of a user  pertaining to the financial card  and may perform authentication of the user  using the gesture(s) and\/or the image(s). In an implementation, a user authentication module  may obtain data from internal data source(s)  and\/or external data source(s)  by the data source access engine  that may be used in the authentication of the user  of the financial card . The data may include previously stored gestures and\/or images registered by the user  with respect to the financial card . Data may also be requested and received from the user  (e.g., via the ATM  and\/or the mobile device ). Such data may also be used in authenticating the user .","The user  may register one or more gestures for use with the financial card  with a gesture module  of the financial card engine . After the user  has received and activated the financial card , the user may access the institution system  (e.g., via the website ) and provide one or more gestures (e.g., via a touchscreen of the mobile device ) that are to be associated with the financial card . Gestures are described further with respect to , for example.","In an implementation, a gesture may be registered that is to subsequently be used in the authentication of the user to access an account that is tied to the financial card . In an implementation, multiple gestures may be registered, where each gesture may be associated with a particular transaction that may be performed at the ATM  or POS with respect to the financial card  (e.g., transfer of funds, withdrawal of funds, a purchase over a certain amount, etc.). Gestures that are provided by the user  may be stored in storage of the institution system , such as internal data source(s)  or storage . The gesture(s) may be stored in a database in an entry associated with the user , the financial card , or an account of the user , for example.","The user  may register one or more images for use with the financial card  with an image module  of the financial card engine . As with registering gestures, after the user  has received and activated the financial card , the user  may access the institution system  (e.g., via the website ) and select one or more images (e.g., provided by the institution to the user  via a display or touchscreen of the mobile device ) that are to be associated with the financial card . The images that are presented for selection by the user  may be retrieved from storage, such as internal data source(s) , external data source(s) , or storage , for example. Images that are selected by the user  may be stored in storage of the institution system , such as internal data source(s)  or storage . The image(s) may be stored in a database in an entry associated with the user , the financial card , or an account of the user , for example. Images are described further with respect to , for example.","An image may provide an additional level of security to the authentication of the user  when using the financial card  at the ATM  or POS. When authenticating, the user  may be presented with multiple images and may select the previously registered image as one level of authentication. In an implementation, after selecting an image when authenticating, the user  provides a gesture over the image. The image and the gesture provided by the user  are compared to the previously stored image and gesture of the user , and if they match (e.g., within a certain level of confidence), then the user  may be considered authenticated and access may be granted to the account(s) associated with the financial card . The images may be compared separately from the gestures, or the image and gesture combination received from the user  while authenticating may be compared to a previously stored image and gesture combination, depending on the implementation. Gestures and images in combination are further described with respect to , for example.","The gesture module  and the image module  may provide information to the user  regarding how to register gestures and images. The user  may register the gestures and the images via the mobile device  or another computing device of the user , for example.","The financial card engine  has access to data, files, and documents pertaining to the user  as well as any other data, files, and documents that are currently stored by the institution system  as well as external data, files, and documents that may be useful in processing an application for the financial card , issuing the financial card  to the user , and registering one or more gestures and\/or images for the financial card . Data pertaining to the user  and\/or the user account(s) may be retrieved from internal data source(s)  and\/or external data source(s) . The retrieved data may be stored centrally, perhaps in storage . Information may also be provided to the institution system  from the user .","Internal data source(s)  may contain data, metadata, email, files, and\/or documents that the institution system  maintains pertaining to the user , such as personal data such as name, physical address, email address, etc., as well as other account information. The institution system  may access this information when registering gestures or images or retrieving gestures and images for authentication of the user , for example.","A user access system may be communicatively coupled to the financial card engine  and may be configured to send machine-readable instructions to the financial card engine . As mentioned above, the institution system  may provide a unified graphical presentation output. The unified graphical presentation may be transmitted to the user access system. In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation may be combined with other materials and transmitted to the user . In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation is received by the user access system and transmitted directly to the user  without the inclusion of any other materials.","The user access system may be implemented as a web server in an implementation. The user access system, through the use of any suitable interactive web technology, provides an interactive experience to the user  through which access to financial card data and status and related data can be accomplished. Any technology that provides interactivity through a web browser is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion and may include, without limitation, Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), JavaScript, and Ajax.","The institution system  may include any combination of systems and subsystems such as electronic devices including, but not limited to, computers, servers, databases, or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors, databases, storage drives, registers, cache, random access memory (RAM) chips, data buses, or the like and\/or software components such as operating systems, database management applications, or the like.","The institution system  may comprise one or more computing devices . The computing device(s)  may have one or more processors , storage  (e.g., storage devices, memory, etc.), and software modules . The computing device(s) , including its processor(s) , storage , and software modules , may be used in the performance of the techniques and operations described herein. An example computing device and its components are described in more detail with respect to .","Examples of software modules  may include modules that may be used in conjunction with receiving and processing an application for the financial card  for the user , issuing the financial card  to the user , requesting and receiving gestures and image selection from the user  to associate with the financial card , generating web page content for display, and receiving instructions from the user , for example.

The user  may provide the gesture  using a finger or a stylus, for example, in the signature area .","The gesture  may be transmitted to the institution system  (by the user  pressing the send  button or an equivalent, for example). The institution system  may store the gesture  in storage, such as in a database record associated with the user  or the financial card , for example. The gesture  may be stored in a user's security profile made during registration.

Alternatively or additionally, the user may provide information from the financial card to the ATM\/POS via their mobile device. Such information may have been previously stored by the user in the mobile device and may be uploaded to the ATM\/POS over an appropriate communications channel. In this manner, the ATM\/POS may obtain the identity of the user, yet the user is still to be authenticated.","At , the user may be prompted to authenticate. The user may receive a request to authenticate on the mobile device from the ATM or POS over an appropriate communications channel. The user may provide a gesture in response to the request. The gesture may be input by the user on the touchscreen of the mobile device, in an implementation, and may be transmitted to the ATM\/POS where it is received.","The transmission between the mobile device and the ATM\/POS could be over any suitable near field communications network, such as via a mobile cell channel, optically (optical transmission), via Bluetooth, or via RFID, for example. Transmissions between the ATM\/POS and the mobile device may be encrypted to further enhance security.
