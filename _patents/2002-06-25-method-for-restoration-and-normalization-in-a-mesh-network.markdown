Rapid restoration is required by transport network providers to support stringent Service Legal Agreements (\u201cSLAs\u201d) that dictate high reliability and availability for customer connectivity. For example, and in the context of optical networking, Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) rings provide the primary technology for optical layer communication and restoration from network failures. SONET rings tend to be capacity utilization inefficient when compared to \u201cmesh\u201d topologies in networks with a high degree of connectivity and when, because of size limitations, connections are forced to route through many interconnected rings. As optical-cross connects (OXCs) are deployed within today's transport networks based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), the potential emerges to provide on-demand establishment of high-bandwidth connections (also referred to in the art as \u201clightpaths\u201d or \u201clabel switched paths (LSPs)\u201d); Emerging standards such as Generalized MPLS (\u201cGMPLS\u201d), also referred to in the art as Multi-Protocol Lambda Switching (\u201cMPL(ambda)S\u201d), can provide a standardized optical network control plane that is essential for building an effective platform for vendor interoperability. See, e.g., D. Awduche et al., \u201cMulti-Protocol Lambda Switching: Combining MPLS Traffic Engineering Control with Optical Crossconnects,\u201d IETF Internet Draft, http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/internet-drafts\/draft-awduche-mpls-te-optical-01.txt (November 1999). Unfortunately, few recent contributions to the art have addressed the need for fast failure restoration in such networks. GMPLS signaling proposals have primarily focused on the development of methods for label switched path (\u201cLSP\u201d) establishment and removal\u2014with limited fault recovery capabilities. In this specification, we will use the common terminology \u201cLSP\u201d for connection in transport network.","The choice of a restoration policy is a tradeoff between network resource utilization (cost) and service interruption time. Clearly, minimized service interruption time is desirable, but schemes achieving this usually do so at the expense of network resource utilization, resulting in increased cost to the provider. Significant reductions in spare capacity can be achieved by sharing restoration capacity across multiple restoration paths whose service paths do not fail at the same time during independent failures. In co-pending commonly-assigned U.S. Utility patent application, \u201cMETHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR FAST RESTORATION IN A MESH NETWORK OF OPTICAL CROSS CONNECTS,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/474,031, filed on Dec. 28, 1999, which is incorporated by reference herein, a restoration methodology is disclosed that utilizes pre-computed restoration path disjoint from the normal service path\u2014but wherein the channels\/wavelengths may be chosen dynamically during the restoration process. The invention therein disclosed, referred to by the inventors herein generally as \u201cshared mesh restoration\u201d, can potentially provide restoration competitive with SONET ring restoration speeds. Co-pending commonly-assigned U.S. Utility patent application, \u201cMETHOD FOR SELECTING A RESTORATION PATH IN A MESH NETWORK,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/909,102, filed on Jul. 19, 2001, which is also incorporated by reference herein, discloses a distributed approach to selecting the restoration path in a shared mesh restoration scheme.","The present invention is directed to methods for signaling that enable bandwidth reservation, path restoration, path normalization, and path removal in a mesh network that supports shared mesh restoration. The necessary network failure restoration functionality can be advantageously provided by extensions to existing signaling protocols such as RSVP-TE. In accordance with an embodiment of an aspect of the invention, shared resources along a restoration path are reserved by sending a label switched path request with a shared restoration flag indicating that the reserved restoration resources are not to be allocated. The request also includes service path information in order to permit sufficient but necessary restoration capacity reservation along the restoration path to recover any independent shared risk link group (SRLG) failures along the service path. The service path information can alternatively comprise a list of links used along the service path or a list of shared risk link groups traversed by the service path. The restoration path is setup, upon notification of a service path failure, by issuing a label switched path request allocating the reserved restoration resources. Deletion of a restoration path also requires specification of the service path information in order to de-allocate the resources allocated to the label switched path.","Due to the sharing of restoration resources, it is necessary for a connection to return back to the service path after failure repair, which is referred to by the inventors as \u201crestoration normalization.\u201d Then the released resources on the restoration path can be used to restore other failed service paths. The present invention is also directed to a novel method to accomplish the restoration normalization process within shared mesh restoration framework to achieve so-called \u201cmake-before-break\u201d performance. A \u201cbridge and roll\u201d approach is disclosed for restoration normalization that advantageously permits minimal service traffic interruption. Also, it is preferable that the service path be verified prior to commencing the normalization process, and a verification procedure utilizing a protocol such as LMP is also disclosed.","These and other advantages of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","112","115","120","122","125","130","135","100"]},"A label switched path (\u201cLSP\u201d) through the network  is established using the exchange of label distribution messages between adjacent nodes.

The current GMPLS signaling specification is based on extensions to existing protocols\u2014namely RSVP-TE and CR-LDP. See, e.g., L.

The present invention shall be described herein for illustration purposes with particular reference to extensions to RSVP-TE signaling messages.","A restorable LSP in a transport network supporting shared mesh restoration has both a service (primary) path and a restoration (secondary) path. During normal network operation (without failures), the LSP is established along the service path, with resources (optionally) reserved along the restoration path. With reference to , consider an LSP established between node  and node , and another between node  and node . The service and restoration paths for the LSP between  and  are -- and ---, respectively, whilst the service and restoration paths for the LSP between  and  are -- and ---, respectively. Thus, the link between nodes  and  has capacity reserved for the failure of both the service paths. If the service provider wishes to guarantee recovery from any single failure event, and if the links along the two service paths do not have any common failure, then a single unit of capacity may be reserved on the - link for the restoration of either of the service paths assuming one unit of bandwidth for each LSP.","When the amount of reserved capacity on each link is a function of the LSPs that are to be restored on the link, signaling is required to reserve this capacity along the restoration path.","In implementing shared mesh restoration, we assume there is a single pool of bandwidth capacity on each link for both service paths and restoration paths. Then the capacity for restoration paths may be reserved along the restoration path during LSP provisioning. The capacity reserved n each link along a restoration path may be shared across different restoration paths whose service paths are not expected to fall simultaneously. The restoration capacity might be either idle or used for pre-emptable LSPs. The amount of restoration capacity reserved on the restoration paths determines the robustness of the restoration scheme to failures. For example, a network operator may choose to reserve sufficient capacity to ensure that all restorable LSPs can be recovered in the event of any single failure (e.g., a conduit being cut). A network operator may instead reserve more or less capacity than that required to handle any single failure event, or may alternatively choose to reserve only a fixed pool independent of the number of LSPs requiring this capacity.","FIG,  is a flowchart of processing performed in resource reservation for restoration in a mesh network, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention.  illustrates how extensions to RSVP signaling messages can be used to implement resource reservation for shared mesh restoration. It is assumed that, given GMPLS routing enhancements (see K. Kompella et al., \u201cOSPF Extensions in Support of Generalized MPLS,\u201d IETF Network Working Group, Internet Draft, http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/internet-drafts\/draft-kompella-ospf-gmpls-extensions-01.txt (February 2001); K. Kompella et al., \u201cIS-IS Extensions in Support of Generalized MPLS,\u201d IETF Network Working Group, Internet Draft, http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/internet-drafts\/draft-ietf-isis-gmpls-extensions-02.txt (February 2001)), each node will have a representation of the transport network topology, including the available capacity, capacity in service, and capacity reserved for restoration on each link. While a network operator wants to protect against any link failures, it is desirable to know the set of links used along the service path when reserving capacity on the restoration path. Alternatively, if it is desired to protect, more generally against what is referred to in the art as \u201cshared risk link group\u201d (SRLG) failures, the setup message should convey, when restoration capacity reservation is calculated along the restoration path, information about the SRLGs that are associated with the service path should be provided. In guaranteeing recovery from a single SRLG failure, two restoration paths can share resources if the corresponding service paths have no SRLG in common. In general, carriers will want to protect their network against at least any single failure event, such as a fiber cut, or a conduit cut. The SRLG concept may be generalized to represent a fiber, a node, or a conduit. Thus, for simplicity in the following description, it is assumed that the network operator is protecting against SRLG failures.","With reference to , when a restorable LSP request arrives, the source node calculates the service and restoration paths for the LSP at step . As alluded to above, it is advantageous for the two paths to be SRLG diverse. A conventional RSVP PATH message is sent along the calculated service path to establish the service path. To satisfy SLAs, the network may reserve resources along the chosen restoration path. To achieve this, the source node at step  sends a PATH message along the restoration path with a \u201cshared reservation\u201d flag requesting a shared reservation along the path.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"]},"\u201c0\u201d=allocation\n\n","The nodes along the restoration path need to know the path taken by the service path so that reservations can be shared among multiple restoration paths whose service paths are SRLG-disjoint. Thus, the PATH message sent along the restoration path should include information about the service path. This information is communicated by introducing a new object, referred to by the inventors as the \u201cservice path information object\u201d in the PATH message. There are two advantageous alternatives for the information that might be conveyed in the service path information object:","(1) LINK_LIST SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object. The information can contain a list of the links along the service path. A LINK_LIST SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object can be defined which denotes the set of TE links that are used along the service path. This information can be used directly when restoration bandwidth reservation accounts for link failures only. If SRLG failures in the restoration reservations are accounted for, then the use of the LINK_LIST requires the nodes along the restoration path to map from links to SRLGs.","(2) SRLG_LIST SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object. Alternatively, the information can contain a list of the SRLGs traversed by the service path. If SRLG failures in the restoration reservations are accounted for, then carrying the LINK_LIST SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object along the restoration path would require that every node duplicate the calculation of the associated set of SRLGs for the links along the service path. This calculation could instead be performed only at the source node, with the set of SRLGs then carried in the PATH message. Thus, it is advantageous to define a SRLG_LIST SERVICE_PATH INFORMATION object. The SRLG_LIST carries the list of SRLGs that are used by the service path.  shows how the information could be carried in the SRLG_LIST. Each SRLG in  is defined as a 32-bit unsigned number. In this SRLG list, the order of specific SRLGs is not significant.","The use of the SRLG_LIST is more straightforward and requires less processing at each node than the LINK_LIST. The LINK_LIST, however, in some realistic topologies, may be significantly shorter.","Accordingly, with reference to the message format shown in , shared restoration resource reservation is done if and only if the PATH message includes the <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> and the <PROTECTION> objects with S and R (shared reservation) bits set. Otherwise, the <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> is ignored and message processing is performed as usual. Shared restoration resource allocation is done if and only if the PATH\/RESV message includes the <PROTECTION> object with S bit set and the R bit not set.","Thus, with reference again to , an RSVP PATH message containing a protection information object with the S and R (shared reservation) bits set is forwarded along the restoration path with information that identifies the SRLGs of the service path at step . This information, as described above, may be conveyed using either the LINK_LIST or the SRLG_LIST. Upon receipt of this message, at step , each node should then update the restoration bandwidth reserved on the outgoing links of the restoration path. Assume that each node maintains a Reservation array R[i], i=1,2, . . . , K, for each adjacent link j, where K is the maximum SRLG index. R[i] indicates the bandwidth required on the link j if the i-th SRLG in the network fails. The total reserved restoration capacity on link j should be calculated as the maximum over all SRLGs (i.e., max R[i], i=1,2, . . . ,K ). When a node receives a new reservation message, it saves state relating to the LSP and updates the Reservation arrays on its link(s) in the following way: R[i]=R[i]+reservation bandwidth if the i-th SRLG is in the SRLGs associated with the <SERVICE_PATH_INFORMATION> object. Once R[i] has been re-calculated for all SRLGs associated with the service path, a new required reserved capacity is calculated (i.e., max R[i]=1,2, . . . ,K). If at step  inadequate capacity is available to support this new resource reservation, the LSP reservation process may be abandoned, with an error message (PATHERR) being returned to the source at step . The already reserved resources must then be removed. However, if the reservation is successful and the reserved capacity has changed as a result of this new LSP reservation, then updated link resource information may be flooded to other nodes in the network for the purpose of path computation at step . For example, the reserved capacity may reduce the available bandwidth information that is flooded.","Similarly, when a node receives a message requesting the removal of reservations for an existing restorable LSP, the reserved restoration capacity along the restoration path is updated: R[i]=R[i]\u2014reservation bandwidth if the i-th SRLG is in the set of SRLGs along the service path. Again, this update may result in a change in the link information that is flooded throughout the network.","Accordingly, the PATH message sent along the pre-calculated restoration path reserves the required restoration resources and creates shared reservation state relating to the LSP without cross-connecting the channels. A RESV message with the same flag can be returned to acknowledge the resource reservation along the restoration path without establishing the restoration path.","In general, depending on the network operator's desired functionality, channel selection may be performed either during the reservation stage, or after failure. If channels are pre-selected; the channel selection is stored during the resource reservation phase as part of the reservation state along the LSP's restoration path. Importantly, although the channels are pre-selected, the cross-connect is not established until after a failure. If channels are pre-selected during the reservation phase, then restoration message processing during restoration may be faster. However, if the pre-selected channels are dependent on the failure scenario, channel pre-selection may necessitate that fault isolation be performed before connectivity can be restored. Moreover, it is only possible to pre-select channels for a specific set of anticipated failures; if other failures occur, channels must in any event be selected after failure.","Alternatively, channel selection may be performed after failure on receipt of a signaling message for restoration. In this case, since restoration capacity along the restoration path is only reserved but not allocated, handling a fault translates into allocating the restoration path after failure. This requires efficient mechanisms for triggering and allocating the restoration path to meet the tight restoration timing constraints. The LSP restoration time will depend on the time to detect the failure, (possibly) localize the failure, notify the node(s) responsible for restoration, and finally activate the restoration path.","Failure detection and localization are technology and implementation dependent, and, accordingly, the present invention is intended to work independent of the mechanism used for failure localization and notification. In general, failures are detected by lower layer mechanisms (e.g., SONET\/SDH, Loss-of-Light (LOL). When a node detects a failure, an alarm may be passed up to a GMPLS entity, which will take appropriate action. Restoration path setup can be triggered in many different ways\u2014and at either the source node or destination node, or both.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","402","403","404","405","406"]},"If the signaling is initiated by the destination, then at step  a RESV message is sent along the restoration path with the \u201cshared reservation\u201d flag not set. The RESV message is sent from the destination including the <PROTECTION> object with S bit set and the R bit not set. Upon receipt of the RESV message, at step , the nodes along the restoration path should check the cross-connection states for this path. If the cross-connection has not been performed, at step , then the node should select channels (if not already pre-selected), and perform the required cross-connections at step . In nodes with significant cross-connect switching times (e.g., MEMS cross-connects) it may be important to have the RESV message forwarded without waiting for the cross-connection to be completed, as set forth in step . The source node sends a RESV_CONF message to the destination to acknowledge the successful establishment of the restoration path.","If both ends initiate restoration, the PATH and RESV messages for the same restoration path may meet at an intermediate node, as set forth in step . This may result in label contention. For a uni-directional LSP, the contention is resolved using downstream label assignment. For a bi-directional LSP, the contention is resolved based on higher node-ID label assignment, as proposed for GMPLS. Alternatively, contention can be resolved using the methods disclosed in co-pending commonly-assigned Utility patent application, \u201cMETHOD FOR UNIDIRECTIONAL AND BIDIRECTIONAL LABEL SWITCHED PATH SETUP IN A LABEL SWITCHED NETWORK,\u201d Ser. No. 10\/063,923, filed on May 24, 2002, which is incorporated by reference herein. When signaling messages from the two ends meet at an intermediate node, the node sends a RESV message to the source and RESV_CONF in response to the establishment of the restoration path.","When restoration is triggered from both source and destination, and PATH\/RESV messages are forwarded without waiting for cross-connection as described above the receipt of the RESV or RESV_CONF does not guarantee the success of restoration path establishment. In this case, a subsequent error message may override the acknowledgment.","In shared mesh restoration schemes, the reserved restoration resources are limited. During a restoration path establishment, there may be scenarios in which the restoration path can't be setup, for example, if there aren't adequate reserved restoration resources or if there is a failure along the restoration path. In this case, PATHERR and RESVERR messages may be used to report the failure of restoration path establishment. It is important that any resources allocated by the incomplete restoration path establishment be immediately released such that these resources can be used for other restoration paths. In the RSVP-TE extensions proposed for GMPLS, the PATHERR message was extended to carry a \u201cstate_remove\u201d flag to release the resources consumed by incomplete LSP establishment. In shared mesh restoration schemes, it is possible to define a new flag \u201callocation_remove\u201d, which could be carried in both PATHERR and RESVERR messages. Upon receipt of PATHERR or RESVERR messages with this \u201callocation_remove\u201d flag, the node does not remove all local state but instead advantageously frees the cross-connect resources and releases the channels to the reserved capacity pool.","After service path repair, it is generally desirable to normalize the LSP back to its original service path. Often, the routing of the restoration path may not be as efficient as the original service path. Additionally, once a restoration path is established, there is no guarantee that other service paths whose restoration paths were sharing the resources are protected, unless the other restoration routes are re-calculated. Reverting back to the service path after a failure is repaired requires that the service path's resources remain allocated during the time that the LSP uses restoration resources. For RSVP, techniques must be developed that allow service path resources to remain allocated even though refreshes may be affected by failed signaling channels. Moreover, it is important to have mechanisms that allow LSP normalization to be performed without disrupting service to the customer.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of another aspect of the invention,  sets forth a flowchart of processing performed in path normalization that, advantageously, avoids service traffic interruption during the normalization process. At step , it is preferable that the service path by verified after repair. At step , the source node commences the process by \u201cbridging\u201d the customer signal onto both the service and restoration paths (the \u201cbridge\u201d function sends the customer input signal to both paths). Once the bridge process has completed, at step , the source node sends a Notification message to the destination, requesting that the destination \u201cbridge and roll\u201d the service and restoration paths (the \u201croll\u201d function switches the signal sent to the customer from restoration path to service path). In this case, the \u201croll\u201d function causes the destination to select the service path signal at step . Upon finishing the bridge and roll at the destination, at step , the destination sends a Notification message to the source confirming the completion of the bridge and roll operation. When the source receives this Notification, at step , it stops transmitting traffic along the restoration path, and, at step , sends another Notification message to the destination confirming that the LSP is normalized. Once the destination receives this Notification message, at step , it issues a RESVTEAR message along the restoration path and stops transmitting along the restoration path at steps -. The RESVTEAR message informs the nodes along the restoration path to release the restoration resources if shared restoration is used for this LSP. This procedure achieves the \u201cmake-before-break\u201d feature, that is, minimal service traffic interruption during the normalization process. Note that the RESVTEAR removes the cross-connection for the restoration path (and frees the resources to be used for restoring other failures), but does not delete the local state along the restoration path. In this case, the RESVTEAR should not trigger a PATHTEAR message from the source since we want resources to continue to be reserved for this LSP. This allows the termination node to quickly re-establish the restoration path by sending either a RESV or PATH message if the service path fails again in the future. The protection object with \u201cshared reservation\u201d flag is carried in the RESVTEAR message to suppress the PATHTEAR.","It is important to note that this normalization process is applicable to end-to-end restoration procedures as well as segment-based restoration procedures (i.e. where the restoration is performed between two nodes along a connection's path that are not necessarily the source and destination).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"Additional mechanisms may be required in some-cases (e.g., all-optical networks) to ensure that intermediate nodes do not alarm due to LOL during the teardown procedure. See below, Section C.","As set forth in , it is advantageous to permit verification of the service path after successful repair of the failure and prior to commencing the above normalization procedure. Typically, there is a network management system (NMS) that manages the mesh network. The NMS provides a fault isolation and fault handling functions. When a node in the network detects a failure for a connection, it triggers the restoration process for the failed connection. The node also sends a failure notification message to the NMS. The nodes along the service path retain the connection state associated with the service path so that the service path can be normalized following failure repair. Otherwise, the service path should be established first without connecting to customer signals before normalization process. The fault isolation function of the NMS analyzes all failure notification messages, isolates the network failure, and issues a trouble ticket to initiate manual repair of the failure. In most cases, a technician will have to be sent to the failure site to repair the failure. The technician will report successful failure repair to the NMS. The NMS then triggers the restoration normalization process for the restored connections. As part of this process, the NMS may select a few or all of the restored connections for normalization. In distributed path restoration schemes, each connection is restored individually, and each connection can be independently normalized without coordination with other connections. In order to minimize the risk of having unsuccessful normalizations, it is preferable that each repaired service path be verified before the connection is switched back to the service path. This normalization\/verification of the service path should only occur after the technician believes that the failure has been successfully repaired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"]},"At step , it is assumed that the source node receives a normalization message from the NMS. Upon receipt of the normalization message, the source node at step  starts periodic transmission of LMP BeginVerify messages to the destination node via a signaling network, which provides out-of-band communication among the network nodes. The periodic transmissions continue until step  when the source receives a BeginVerifyAck or BeginVerifyNack from the destination node, or until the source times out. Once the destination receives a BeginVerify message, if it is ready to proceed with the verification procedure, it replies with a BeginVerifyAck to the source node via the signaling network. If the connection is bi-directional, the destination node starts to send TEST messages to the source along the service path at this time. If the destination cannot accept the BeginVerify request, it sends a BeginVerifyNack message to the source node. If the source node receives the BeginVerifyNack message, then at step , it informs the NMS of the normalization failure and stops the normalization process of this connection. If the source node receives a BeginVerifyAck message at step , it starts to send Test messages along the service path to the destination at step . This can be done because LMP assumes that the control processor in a node can send and receive LMP messages over any port. Note that in the preferred embodiment of the invention, all LMP messages except for the TEST message are sent via the signaling network; the TEST message is sent via the service path. Once a node receives the Test message, the TestStatusSuccess message is transmitted via the signaling network. If no TEST message is received before the timer expires, a TestStatusFailure message is transmitted via the signaling network. Upon receiving a TestStatusSuccess or TestStatusFailure at step , the node should send a TestStatusAck message back. After the source node has verified the physical connectivity of the service path, at step , it sends an EndVerify message via the signaling network to the destination node to terminate the path verification process. The EndVerifyAck message is sent back by the destination node via the signaling network upon receipt of an EndVerify message at step . This message acknowledges the termination of the path verification process. Note that this service path verification process has no impact on the connection itself. The connection is still up on the restoration path. After the service path verification process, if the service path is physically connected (i.e. the verification was a success), then the normalization process proceeds at step  as above.","It should be noted that the present invention, although described with particular reference to LMP, can be readily adapted to other signaling protocols such as LDP by one of ordinary skill in the art.","Once an LSP is no longer required, the LSP service path and its restoration path reserved resources should be released for future traffic. A PATHTEAR message or RESVTEAR message as defined in the GMPLS signaling specification is used to remove (de--allocate) the paths. If the source node initiates the LSP deletion, it should send two PATHTEAR messages to the destination node: one along the service path and the other along the restoration path. The PATHTEAR along the restoration path should include information about the service path. The information can contain either a list of the links along the service LSP, or a list of the SRLGs traversed by the service path. If the destination initiates the LSP deletion, it should send two RESVTEAR messages to the source. The RESVTEAR along the restoration path should include the information about the service path.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["801","802"]},"It is important that valid signaling actions for planned events\u2014e.g., LSP deletion\u2014do not appear as failures along the path. Additional mechanisms may be required in some cases (e.g., all-optical networks) to ensure that nodes do not alarm due to LOL during the teardown procedure. If LSPs are deleted in an all-optical network by sending a single deletion message, LOL resulting from disconnection at a node will propagate down the path faster than the LSP deletion message, potentially triggering restoration. Thus, for planned events that could result in LOL along the path, such as LSP deletion, all nodes must be informed of the upcoming event so that they may turn off alarms corresponding to the desired LSP so as not to initiate restoration.","Restoration techniques can be classified into path-based and link-based: wherein \u201cpath-based\u201d schemes are implemented via an alternate or restoration path that may traverse multiple nodes in contrast with \u201clink-based\u201d techniques wherein traffic is switched to an alternate channel or link connecting adjacent nodes. In general, path-based schemes may protect an end-to-end path, a segment or a link. The present invention, it should be noted, is applicable to all of these cases, although the above detailed description focuses primarily on end-to-end path-based restoration.","The foregoing Detailed Description is to be understood as being in every respect illustrative and exemplary, but not restrictive, and the scope of the invention disclosed herein is not to be determined from the Detailed Description, but rather from the claims as interpreted according to the full breadth permitted by the patent laws. It is to be understood that the embodiments shown and described herein are only illustrative of the principles of the present invention and that various modifications may be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, the detailed description describes an embodiment of the invention with particular reference to extensions to RSVP-TE. However, the principles of the present invention could be readily extended to other signaling protocols such as CR-LDP. Such an extension could be readily implemented by one of ordinary skill in the art given the above disclosure."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
