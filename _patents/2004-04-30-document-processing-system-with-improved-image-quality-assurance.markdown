title: Document processing system with improved image quality assurance
abstract: A document processing system comprising an image capture subsystem for capturing selected image metrics and at least one image rendition from a plurality of documents and for determining if at least one of the selected image metrics for any of the at least one image rendition does not successfully compare against preselected image quality metric threshold values. An image quality flag is generated for any of the at least one image rendition if it does not successfully compare, and a record entry for each imaged document having at least one flagged image rendition is created in an image quality flag file. An image index file for individually accessing the image renditions is modified to include a reference to the corresponding image quality flag file record entry The document processing system may optionally compare selected document metrics against preselected document metrics in a similar manner. Image defects in the plurality of documents can be identified by examining the record entries in the image quality flag file.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to imaging, and more specifically, to a document processing system with an improved image quality assurance methodology.","2. Background Art","On Jun. 6, 2003, the United States House of Representatives passed \u201cThe Check Clearing for the 21Century Act.\u201d Following the passage of the House Bill, the United States Senate enacted on Jun. 27, 2003, S. 1334, \u201cThe Check Truncation Act of 2003.\u201d Both of these legislations are referred to informally as \u201cCheck 21\u201d legislation. The law aims to improve the check and remittance payment systems by allowing banks, financial institutions, and remittance payment processors (e.g., utility and insurance companies) to exchange checks electronically instead of the current paper-based exchange. President George W. Bush signed the Check 21 legislation into law on Oct. 28, 2003, and when the law goes into effect on Oct. 28, 2004, a printed image of a check or remittance processing stub will have the same legal standing as its original paper counterpart.","Under current law, banking institutions must physically present and return the original paper checks received from customers and other accountholders. Within recent past years, banks, financial institutions, and remittance payment processors (e.g., utility and insurance companies) have been moving away from paper-based financial document processing environments toward image-based processing environments where images of checks and remittance processing stubs are used to perform data entry, correction and balancing operations. The adoption of such image-based document processing has yielded improvements in processing throughput and reduced labor costs.","The Check 21 law allows banks to voluntarily exchange electronic images over networks, legally acknowledging an electronic financial document as the legal equivalent of a paper financial document. In this check truncation environment, only images of the checks would be electronically transmitted between financial institutions and the paper documents would be held or destroyed by the bank of first deposit. Financial institutions desiring to continue processing paper could receive a substitute check, i.e., a paper reproduction created from an electronic image of the original check, for clearing and settlement and ultimate return to the accountholder. This substitute check would have the legal equivalence of the original paper check.","It is expected that the introduction of this law will allow a financial institution's customers to benefit from new products and services, such as online access to their check images. In addition, improved service is anticipated in view of the significantly reduced response time required for account information about checks, and avoidance of negative economic impacts is improved in view of the significantly reduced dependence on air transportation networks, which are vulnerable to expected or unexpected disruptions (such as strikes, weather, natural disaster, terrorist attacks or other types of crises). There is a 12-month implementation period, which began on Oct. 28, 2003, during which banks can roll out imaging technology and set up electronic exchanges with partner institutions.","In view of these changes, and in order to attempt to achieve an acceptable and accepted standard among the aforementioned institutions, the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) for Financial Services (X9B) has drafted a proposed financial image interchange standard (DSTU X9.37-2003, currently under revision, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe X9.37 standard\u201d) to support the exchange of check\/document imagery between financial institutions. Although this standard has not been finalized or officially adopted, it has been provisionally selected by the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States.","However, one issue that arises with check truncation is the new requirement that some level of image quality assurance (IQA) be performed on the check images prior to image interchange between two financial institutions. The goal of IQA would be to provide some level of assurance that the check image renditions being created by the \u201csending\u201d financial institution are of suitable quality and legibility to support follow-on financial document processing operations by the \u201creceiving\u201d financial institution.","In addressing this issue, the X9.37 standard has included the specification of a \u201cminimum set\u201d of image quality assurance (IQA) \u201cflags\u201d for each image being transmitted or exchanged. The purpose of these IQA flags is to identify questionable, or suspect, document images that might exhibit one or more image quality defects. Currently, the working definition of an \u201cimage quality defect\u201d is some defect in the digital image rendition of the check that prohibits its use as a substitute for the original paper document during the payment process. It will be appreciated that such use prohibition may be defined according to the nature of subsequent processing that is to occur. For example, such prohibition might occur if the image does not meet the Check 21 requirement that the substitute check \u201caccurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time the original check was truncated,\u201d or as indicated, infra, if the defect \u201ccan fatally compromise recognition of printed or written information by either intelligent character recognition (ICR) systems or by a data entry operator.\u201d","Typical image quality defects may include such items as: 1) Images of checks with folded corners (obscuring some portion of the document writing), 2) images of documents that are excessively skewed, perhaps causing the top portion of the image to be missing (outside the field of view of the image camera), 3) images that exhibit poor contrast or excessive brightness (reducing the legibility of the document), 4) images of two documents that are overlapped causing one document to be partially obscured, and 5) document images whose compressed image file sizes (in kilobytes) are too small or too large. In many cases, these defects in document image quality, albeit occasional, can fatally compromise recognition of printed or written information by either intelligent character recognition (ICR) systems or by a data entry operator.","It is therefore expected that those equipment vendors who supply image-enabled document processing platforms, as well as those who provide image-enabled document processing applications, will need to provide methods and systems to automatically perform image quality assurance for all images generated or created by their document processing platform\/solution. It is envisioned that each document image will be tested for the presence of one or more image \u201cdefects\u201d, and these defects will be recorded and then stored with the image file\/data prior to image interchange between the two banks.","In the past, companies have performed a variety of methods for automatically detecting image quality defects associated with the document image capture process. The automatic detection of image quality defects generally relies on defining a set of image metrics that can be used to infer probable image quality problems in a document image. Typical image metrics to assess image quality may include: image dimensional data (e.g., image height and width), compressed image packet size, image gray level histograms, image skew angle, hardware\/software feed check errors, and other transport status\/error detection information.","Recently, some companies have demonstrated a variety of methods for automatically detecting image quality defects associated with the document image capture process, and some advances have been made with regard to the automatic detection of image quality defects in document imaging platforms. However, the known image quality flag implementations currently being proposed by the vendors and the interchange standards committees (e.g., IBM and X9.37) involve the appending or embedding of image quality \u201clag\u201d bits or data records directly into the existing check image file formats. Examples of the image quality flags set forth in the X9.37 standard are set forth in Appendix A. Although this methodology provides a vehicle for storing image quality flags for each document image, it does not provide a method for image-based document processing applications (e.g., check image processing applications) to quickly identify which images are suspected of containing one or more image quality defects.","Using such a method to store image quality flag data for each check image requires that a software application sequentially search\/examine the image flag data records stored in each image file for the presence of one or more image quality flags following image capture.  illustrates such a typical IQA implementation scheme. As seen therein, as each document is imaged during the image capture process , one or more image rendition files are created at  for the front and rear of each document (i.e., a front image file (FIM) , a rear image file (RIM) , a second front image file (FI) , a second rear image file (RI) ). Additionally, an image index file (IDX)  is created so that any of the aforementioned individual image files may be accessed by extracting the data stored in the IDX file . Finally, an end-of-file (EOF) semaphore file  is created to signal the completion of image capture processing for a batch of documents.","At least one image measure metric is determined at IQA metric generation process . Image measure metrics may be related to either the document processing and\/or imaging hardware or the imaging software. Examples of hardware-related image measure metrics might include document image height and length, document skew, etc. Software-related image measure metrics might include compressed image packet size and front image dimensions compared to rear image dimensions.","Image quality flag (IQF) parameters such as discussed above and as set forth in Appendix A, and predetermined thresholds based on these parameters (), are applied to image measures determined by the IQA metric generation process  at  in order to determine whether or not IQA flags () are to be set. If IQA flags are to be set, then they are embedded directly in the appropriate image files (i.e., FIM, RIM, FI, RI) at .","While this methodology may be sufficient for a small number of checks, it is not a particularly efficient method for use with large numbers of checks, particularly in view of the fact that the vast majority of check images do not have any quality defects present. As a result, this methodology results in the wasting of a large amount of application processing time examining image quality flag data where no defects are present. Furthermore, for those check image-processing platforms capable of generating multiple image renditions, e.g., black\/white, full gray scale, full resolution, for the front and rear of each check document, the search for imagery containing image quality defects becomes even more complex and time consuming.","Therefore it would be desirable to provide for the realization of automated IQA on image platforms with improved access speed to image quality suspects, and particularly those implementing the X9.37 standard and its progeny.","It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an improved document processing system.","It is another object of the present invention to provide improved image quality assurance systems and methodologies in a document processing system.","It is yet another object of the present invention to improve the identification of, and speed of access to image quality suspects in a plurality of imaged documents in a document processing system","It is still another object of the present invention to improve the identification of, and speed of access to image quality suspects in documents that are imaged in a document processing system having an image platform that is compliant with the X9.37 financial image interchange standard and its progeny.","In a first aspect of the invention a document processing system is provided that includes a document transport for moving a plurality of documents and at least one computer running system software that interfaces with the document transport to provide document control. The document processing system further comprises: an image capture subsystem connected to the document transport for capturing selected image metrics and at least one image rendition from the plurality of documents as they are moved by the document transport. The image capture subsystem determines if at least one of the selected image metrics for any of the at least one image rendition does not successfully compare against preselected image quality metric threshold values and generates an image quality flag for any of the at least one image rendition if it does not successfully compare. The image capture subsystem creates in an image quality flag file, a record entry for each imaged document having at least one flagged image rendition, each record entry including information about the at least one flagged image rendition for that imaged document, whereby image defects in the plurality of documents can be identified by examining the record entries in the image quality flag file.","In a second aspect of the present invention, the document processing system comprises track hardware which provides selected document metrics from a plurality of documents as they are moved by the document transport. The image capture subsystem determines if at least one of the selected document metrics for any of the documents does not successfully compare against preselected document metric threshold values, generates an image quality flag for any of documents if it does not successfully compare, and creates in the image quality flag file, a record entry for each imaged document having at least one flagged document metric. Each record entry includes information about the at least one flagged document metric for that imaged document.","In a third aspect of the invention, the selected document metrics may include information about the type and information about the physical dimensions of each of the plurality of imaged documents. Such selected metrics may include a beam-of-light (BOL) \u201clate\u201d signal, a document spacing error signal and\/or a double document signal.","In a fourth aspect of the present invention, at least one image rendition is captured and then stored according to type of image rendition. An image index file including a document record entry for each imaged document is created, the image index file for individually accessing any of the stored image rendition files and for indexing into any of the record entries in the image quality flag file. For each of the plurality of imaged documents, the image index file document record entry is modified to include a global image quality flag indicating that the imaged document has been examined for image defects.","In a fifth aspect of the present invention, for each of the plurality of imaged documents having at least one flagged image rendition, the image index file document record entry includes a reference to the image quality flag file record entry for the corresponding imaged document and a global image quality flag for that image index file document record entry is set, the global image quality flag indicating that the imaged document has been examined for image defects and at least one defect has been found.","Still other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein there is shown and described only the preferred embodiment of the invention, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive, and what is intended to be protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims. The present invention will become apparent when taken in conjunction with the following description and attached drawings, wherein like characters indicate like parts, and which drawings form a part of this application.","Preferred features of selected embodiments of this invention will now be described with reference to the figures. It will be appreciated that the spirit and scope of the invention is not limited to the embodiments selected for illustration. For example, although the present invention will be described with reference to the X9.37 standard and its progeny, as this appears to be the preferred financial image interchange standard, it will be appreciated that the invention is not so limited and that is applicable to any automated image quality assurance implementation regardless of the image interchange standard that is ultimately adopted. Also, it should be noted that the drawings are not rendered to any particular scale or proportion. Finally, it is contemplated that any of the configurations and materials described hereafter can be modified within the scope of this invention.","As set forth above, although the proposed solutions to his problem have included appending or embedding of image quality \u201cflag\u201d bits or data records directly into the existing check image file formats, as discussed above, this is an inefficient use of time and application processing time, since the vast majority of check images do not have any quality defects present. There are other deficiencies with these proposed methodologies as well.","For example, certain types of image defects are independent of the image representation (e.g., black\/white vs. full gray scale). Examples may include: 1) Images of documents that have one or more folded or torn corners, 2) images of documents where the document is skewed, and 3) images of overlapped or \u201cpiggybacked\u201d documents. In these scenarios, the same image quality flag(s) will be \u201cset\u201d independently of the image rendition, since the defect will show up in all images of that document. Currently known systems and methods such as that of , where image quality flags are stored for each image file independently do not provide any method to consolidate \u201ccommon\u201d image defects for each document independent of the image renditions being generated.","In addition, currently known methods do not allow for the easy detection of \u201ctemporal\u201d image quality defects\u2014i.e., defects that may only affect a subset of a number of documents, or a subset of a batch of documents, and then resolve itself over a period of time. One type of \u201ctemporal\u201d image defect is the presence of horizontal \u201cstreaks\u201d in the document image due to dirt on the digital camera's scan window or optics. In many cases the dirt is present in the camera system's field of view for only for a short period of time and is eventually removed by the wiping action of the paper documents against the scan window. This type of image quality defect will cause a sequence or range of check images to exhibit the same image quality defect. As known methods such as that disclosed in  store the image quality flags specific to a document image within the image file, versus a range or batch of documents, the method does not provide direct support for identifying temporal image quality defects.","Furthermore, as check processing is normally performed by partitioning documents into \u201cbatches\u201d in order to facilitate processing workflows and balancing operation, most image-enabled document processing application software involves the processing of batches of checks. Neither the aforementioned proposed method nor other known methods provide a consolidated summary of image quality defects associated with the batch of images that have been captured\/imaged.","Finally, none of the known IQA methodologies allow for storing the criteria used to determine the value of each image quality flag (i.e., whether the flag is set or not). The values of image quality flags are generally determined by comparing some image measurements (or metrics) against some set of rules that compare the metric(s) to one or more parameter settings. As an example, the compressed image file size (in kilobytes) can be compared to a \u201cmaximum\u201d or \u201cminimum\u201d image file size parameter. The result of the comparison (i.e., whether the compressed image file size is greater than, less than, or equal to the \u201cmaximum\u201d or \u201cminimum\u201d image file size parameter) will be used to determine whether the \u201cimage file size defect flag\u201d is set. Prior IQA methodologies such as shown in  do not provide information on the parameters used in determining the state of each image quality flag.","Automated Image Quality Assurance (IQA)","An embodiment of the automated image quality assurance (IQA) system and method of the present invention that addresses all of the aforementioned shortcomings of prior known IQA methodologies will now be discussed with reference to .","The image capture document processing system  begins at  with an image capture process . As known to those skilled in the art, as each document in a batch of documents is imaged, one or more image renditions, e.g., JPEG and CCITT Group , are preferably created at  for the front and rear of each document and then stored to separate files, e.g., a front image file (FIM) , a rear image file (RIM) , a second front image file (FI) , a second rear image file (RI) , by the image file generation process . (Although preferably image renditions are generated for both sides of a document, it will be appreciated that in certain image processing platforms, image renditions may be generated only for one side of the document). It will be understood by those skilled in the art that any image capture process  and image file generation process  may be used, and as such processes are well-known to those skilled in the art, no further discussion is needed.","An image index file (IDX)  is created so that any of the aforementioned individual image files may be accessed by extracting the data stored therein. Finally, an end-of-file (EOF) semaphore file  is created to signal the completion of processing for a batch of documents","Image data generated from the image capture process  for each image is then analyzed by the IQA metric generation process  to provide selected image metrics which may be used to assess image quality of the captured images. As discussed above, these image metrics may include any or all of the following: image metric data, e.g., height and width; compressed image packet size; image gray level histograms; uncompressed image data; image skew angle; hardware\/software feed check errors; and\/or other transport status\/error detection information, and may be used alone or in any combination thereof to generate specific image quality \u201cflags\u201d (discussed in more detail below). Other image metrics that are known to those skilled in the art may also be included in the IQA metric generation process .","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, an optional document metrics process  provides relevant information about the type and physical dimensions of the documents being processed. Examples of document measure metrics may include beam-of-light (BOL)-\u201clate\u201d signal, document spacing error, double document, and similar document measures. This information may be obtained from track control PC  (), or track control logic and sensors (not shown) located in the document transport (e.g., document processor track hardware  ()). The optional document metrics process  might be used if image quality assurance is performed in real-time during image capture; however, the information provided by this process  would not be available in post-capture implementations of the present invention.","For each image quality defect to be detected, one or more of the image metrics generated by the IQA Metric Generation Process  and, optionally, the document metrics provided by the Document Metrics Process  are then compared at IQA Rules Process  against a selected image quality metric setting or threshold, or some combinations of image quality metric thresholds, from an IQF Parameter File  in order to determine whether a particular image metric \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed.\u201d The IQF Parameter File  is preferably generated prior to the start of the image capture process , preferably by an image quality configuration application that provides a human interface to display and modify the image quality settings and thresholds. The IQF Parameter File  includes at least customized image quality metric thresholds that have been predefined or preselected (e.g., by the manufacturer, the user, or a third party value-added reseller) and is preferably stored in an image capture server PC (e.g., ICS PC  in ) as an image quality flag initialization file (IQF.INI) (discussed with reference to  below).","At the beginning of each batch of documents, an IQF file  is created with an associated IQF header record  (see, ) that contains the image quality metric thresholds from the IQF Parameter File . Should the image data for any of the captured document images fail the predefined image quality metric threshold test (e.g., not equal or exceed the threshold) at , an IQA \u201cflag\u201d () will be generated. This flag  will, in turn, be used to generate at IQF Record Generation Process  a record entry in an IQF file . The IQF Record Generation Process  creates in IQF file  a record entry for each document in the batch that is suspected of having an image quality defect (i.e., one or more image quality flags  have been \u201cset\u201d for one or more of the image renditions associated with that document). Therefore, if five documents in a batch have been flagged as having suspect image quality (on one or more image renditions), five record entries will be placed into the IQF file  for that batch of images. The record entries in the IQF file  in turn contain image index information pointing to the suspect document in the image index file (IDX)  along with all the image quality flags associated with each image rendition of that document (e.g., CCITT, JPEG). In addition, IQF Record Generation Process  will indicate that image quality was checked for that document, and that it has a corresponding \u201cflagged\u201d IQF file record, by initializing a field in record  for that document before record  is written to the image index file (IDX) . Preferably, this is done by setting a global IQA flag  in the document record  before record  is written to image index file (IDX) . In addition, image quality record index field  will be initialized to include a reference to the corresponding record entry in the IQF file . Further details regarding the format of the IQF file  and IDX file  will be discussed below with reference to .","The IQF flags and parameters  for that batch of documents are then stored at  for later retrieval of image quality suspects, and the image index file (IDX)  is preferably modified to indicate that image quality has been checked for that batch of documents. Image quality information is made accessible to a document imaging application (not shown) by having the document imaging application \u201cscan\u201d only those record entries present in the IQF file  after the batch is released (via the EOF file semaphore ). Further discussion of the retrieval of images having suspect image quality will be discussed with reference to .","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, if the imaging hardware or software used to carry out the image capture process  does not support detection of particular imaging quality metrics, the image capture process  will automatically amend IQF Parameter File  to disable the detection for these imaging quality metrics. (discussed in more detail with reference to  below)","Optionally, if a user is not interested in conducting image quality assurance for a particular batch of documents, the IQF file  can be ignored by the document imaging application. This is preferably accomplished through parameter settings located in the image parameters initialization file of IQF Parameter File  (discussed below). It will be appreciated that this allows the benefit of the addition or exclusion of an IQF file that in no way impacts those current document imaging applications that use the existing image file structures (IDX, FIM, FI, RIM, RI, etc.). Thus the automated image quality assurance of the present invention can be conducted without modification of document imaging applications.","IQF File Structure and Modified IDX File Structure","Modified IDX File Structure","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and with reference to , the file structure of image index file IDX  is modified such that each IDX record  contains a single \u201cglobal\u201d image quality flag  and image quality record index field . Preferably, the \u201cglobal\u201d image quality flag  comprises one byte and is at a location in each IDX record  in the image index file IDX  that was reserved in previously created versions of the IDX file . In addition, the image quality record index field  preferably comprises a 32-bit (4-byte) record field at locations that were reserved in previously created versions of the IDX file .","As set forth above, the \u201cglobal\u201d image quality flag  is used to indicate whether image quality was checked for a document and, if so, whether one or more image renditions \u201cfailed\u201d the image quality tests. In one embodiment, a value of zero (0) is used to indicate that the document was not checked for image quality, and a non-zero value is used both to indicate that it was checked and to represent whether it passed or failed (e.g., 1=failed, on one or more image renditions, 2=passed). Of course, it will be understood that any other similar representations may be used to provide this same information.","The image quality record index field  is used to point to (i.e., index into) the appropriate record  in the IQF file  that contains the document that has one or more image quality errors. The particular one of the image quality record entries  (pointed to by the image quality record index field ) will then contain the image quality flag data for all image renditions associated with the document.","IQF File Structure\u2014Header Structure","Referring to , IQF file  comprises a header record  that contains at least the parameter settings  for the \u201cpass\/fail\u201d criteria associated with each image quality flag (i.e., the image metric threshold values extracted from the IQF Parameter File ). In addition, in one embodiment of the present invention, the IQF header record  includes image file set information , reserved fields  to allow for additional data in future implementations of image quality assurance, the particular version level of the IQA being used , and a checksum field  to allow verification that the IQF header record data has not been corrupted. In one embodiment, the IQF header record  comprises 512 bytes.","The parameter settings  that are extracted from the IQF parameter file  (e.g., IQF.INI) preferably include those fields as seen in . In one embodiment, the parameter settings  comprise 100 bytes of the IQF header record.","Referring to , field  is an image quality parameter field that can be \u201ctoggled\u201d to allow a user or a value-added reseller of imaging applications to disable the creation of image quality flags if, for example, the user is not interested in conducting image quality assurance for a particular batch of documents.

Track control PC  provides sorter control of document transport hardware , and includes track applications, such as inclearings, proof of deposit, and remittance operations, and system software (not shown), which in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, is WINDOWS NT\u00ae, WINDOWS\u00ae 2000, or WINDOWS\u00ae XP-based system software. The system software preferably includes Unisys Common Application Programming Interface, or CAPI, which is a common application programming interface that enables the same application software to be used across multiple transport platforms.","Image capture subsystem  provides image server and capture capabilities and interfaces with the document transport hardware  to receive images moved by document transport  and to store them in appropriate files (e.g., FIM, RIM, FI, RI). Image capture subsystem  generally comprises both hardware and software, including imaging module hardware , having a camera system (not shown) for capturing images, and image capture server (ICS) PC  for processing and storing of the images.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the image capture server (ICS) PC  receives the captured image data from imaging module hardware  (image capture process ), processes the image data for storage (image file generation process ), and then carries out the IQA Metric Generation Process , optional Document Metrics Process , IQA Rules Process , and IQF Record Generation process .","The metrics of the present invention are generated in real-time by the Unisys NDP platform and can be used to provide the image quality flags proposed by the X9.37 standard (as set forth above). The metrics generated by the Unisys NDP platform may originate from either the platform hardware (e.g., track control PC , image module hardware  ), or from system software (e.g., CAPI, ICS PC  software). According to the present invention, currently available metrics that might be considered either separately or in combination to generate image quality flags include the following hardware-generated metrics, such as: compressed image packet size; document image height and length; document skew; Beam-of-light (BOL) \u201clate\u201d signal; framing error; leading\/trailing edge; feed check status (including piggyback items, over length items, document spacing errors); and compressor hardware errors. Software-generated metrics might include feed check detected; zero (0) byte images; comparison of document front and rear image dimensions; disk storage full (out of space to store image files); failure to store image; and CAPI document complete status.","An exemplary implementation of the structure of the IQF file  including descriptions for the NDP platform is attached hereto as Appendix B.","Retrieval of Image Quality Suspects","It will be appreciated from the foregoing that suspect images can easily be located by scanning through the record entries of IQF file . Retrieval of these suspect images is accomplished by using the IDX file offset field  in the image quality record  to index into the IDX file, which in turn, provide pointers into the image files. Alternatively, identification of the suspect images may be accomplished by using the image quality record index field  stored in the IDX record  to index into the image quality record  to determine which of the images are suspect.","More particularly,  (with reference to ) illustrates one method of retrieving image quality suspects in the image capture system with image quality assurance (IQA) according to the present invention. The IQF file  is read by an imaging application (not shown) at  to determine whether an image quality record  exists, indicating that at least one document in the particular batch in question was flagged as having one or more image defects. If no image quality record  exists, the process ends. If an image quality record  exists (), the image quality record is read at . All entries in the record are reviewed by the imaging application to determine which image renditions have image problems as well as the type of image problems (). The imaging application will then use the IDX file offset  to index into the IDX record  containing the image(s) having suspect image quality (step ). Index pointers in the IDX file can then be used to index into the specific suspect image files (e.g., FIM, RIM, FI, RI) at step . The process then returns to step  to determine if more image quality records exist.","Alternatively, as shown in  (with reference to ), for each record in the IDX file () (one record for each document), the \u201cglobal\u201d image quality flag  in that IDX record can be read () to see if that document has been checked for image quality (), and if so, whether all the images \u201cpassed\u201d or one or more image quality conditions were detected. If the \u201cglobal\u201d image quality flag  in the IDX record field indicates at  that no image quality conditions were detected, the process continues with the next document at . If, however, the \u201cglobal\u201d image quality flag  in the IDX record indicates at  that one or more image quality conditions were detected, the image quality record index field  is then used by the imaging application to index into the IQF file  to retrieve the image quality record for this document and determine which image renditions for this document have image quality conditions (). At , the image quality flag data pertinent to the imaging application are then reviewed, and pertinent image renditions having image quality flags that are \u201cset\u201d are retrieved ().","Automated Image Quality Assurance (IQA) in a Post-Capture Imaging Environment","Referring to , an alternative implementation of the present invention is shown wherein the image quality assurance system and methodology is carried out in a post-image-capture environment. A post-image-capture image quality assurance system and methodology might be needed and\/or desired to screen incoming images during check image interchange processes. In such instance, the IQF file  is also created post-image capture.","In accordance with this embodiment, the image capture process  and image file generation  are carried out in substantially the same manner as discussed in FIG. . Similarly captured front images (FIM) , rear image (RIM) , second front images (FI) , and second rear image (RI) , and end-of-file (EOF) semaphore file  are substantially identical to their counterparts in . Modified image index file (IDX)  is likewise substantially identical to its counterparts in .","Images stored in FIM , RIM , FI , and RI  are then retrieved and decompressed at  in any manner known to those of skill in the art. The retrieved and decompressed image data is then analyzed by the IQA Metric Generation Process  to provide selected image metrics that may be used to assess image quality of the captured images. The image metrics used in  are comparable to those discussed in relation to , and may include any or all of the following: image dimensional data (e.g., height and width); compressed image packet size; image gray level histograms; document skew angle; hardware\/software feed check errors; and\/or other transport status\/error detection information, and may be used alone or in any combination thereof to generate specific image quality \u201cflags\u201d (discussed in more detail below). Other image metrics that are known to those skilled in the art may also be included in the IQA Metric Generation Process .","The selected image metrics provided at  are then compared at IQA Rules Process  using a selected image quality metric setting or threshold, or some combinations of image quality metric thresholds, from IQF parameter file , in order to determine whether a particular image metric \u201cpassed\u201d or \u201cfailed.\u201d As with IQF parameter file , IQF parameter file  preferably includes at least customized image quality metric thresholds that have been predefined or preselected (e.g., by the manufacturer, the user, or a third party value-added reseller).","As with the embodiment of , should the retrieved and decompressed image data for any of the documents fail the predefined image quality metric threshold test (e.g., not equal or exceed the threshold) an IQA \u201cflag\u201d () will be generated. This flag  and the image quality metric thresholds from the IQF Parameter File  will be used to generate at  an IQF file. The IQF file generated at  contains a record entry for each document in the batch that is suspected of having an image quality defect (i.e., one or more image quality flags  have been \u201cset\u201d for one or more of the images associated with that document). The IQF file  for that batch of documents is then stored at  for later retrieval of image quality suspects, and the image index file (IDX)  is preferably modified to indicate that image quality has been checked for that batch of documents. Image quality information is then made accessible to a document imaging application (not shown) by having the document imaging application \u201cscan\u201d only those record entries present in the IQF file.","It will be appreciated that the image quality assurance systems and methods of the present invention provide for the realization of automated IQA on image platforms with improved access speed to image quality suspects, and particularly those implementing the ASC X9.37 standard and its progeny. The image quality assurance systems and methods of the present invention provide a more efficient use of application processing time and provide a method to consolidate \u201ccommon\u201d image defects for each document independent of the image renditions being generated. Furthermore, the image quality assurance systems and methods of the present invention provide direct support for identifying temporal image quality defects and a consolidated summary of image quality defects associated with the batch of documents for which images have been captured. Finally, the image quality assurance systems and methods of the present invention allow for storing in the image quality flag file itself for easy referral, the information on the criteria and parameters used to determine the state of each image quality flag.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation.
