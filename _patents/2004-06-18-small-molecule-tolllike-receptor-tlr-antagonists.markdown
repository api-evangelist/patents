No. 60\/556,007, filed Mar. 23, 2004, and U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60\/480,588, filed Jun. 20, 2003, the entire contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates to generally to the field of immunology. More particularly, the invention relates to compositions and methods for altering immune function. More specifically, the invention relates to compositions and methods for affecting immune stimulation mediated through Toll-like receptor (TLR) molecules.","Stimulation of the immune system, which includes stimulation of either or both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, is a complex phenomenon that can result in either protective or adverse physiologic outcomes for the host. In recent years there has been increased interest in the mechanisms underlying innate immunity, which is believed to initiate and support adaptive immunity. This interest has been fueled in part by the recent discovery of a family of highly conserved pattern recognition receptor proteins known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) believed to be involved in innate immunity as receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Compositions and methods useful for modulating innate immunity are therefore of great interest, as they may affect therapeutic approaches to conditions involving autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, graft versus host disease (GvHD), infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency.","Recently there have been a number of reports describing the immunostimulatory effect of certain types of nucleic acid molecules, including CpG nucleic acids and double-stranded RNA. Of note, it was recently reported that Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes bacterial DNA and CpG DNA. Hemmi H et al. (2000) 408:740-5; Bauer S et al. (2001) 98:9237-42. It was also recently reported that immune complexes containing IgG and nucleic acid can stimulate TLR9 and participate in B-cell activation in certain autoimmune diseases. Leadbetter E A et al. (2002) 416:595-8.","Chlroroquines have been recognized as useful not only as anti-malarial agents but also as anti-inflammatory agents. Although its mechanism of action is not well understood, chloroquine has been used effectively in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). For a review, see Wallace D J (1996) 5 Suppl 1:S59-64. Recently Macfarlane and colleagues described a number of small molecule analogs and derivatives of chloroquine (4-aminoquinoline) and quinacrine (9-aminoacridine) which reportedly inhibit stimulation of the immune system. U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,882; U.S. Pat. No. 6,479,504; U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,637; PCT published application PCT\/US00\/16723 (WO 00\/76982); and PCT published application PCT\/US98\/13820 (WO 99\/01154). Macfarlane and colleagues report these small molecule inhibitors of the immune response, even when used at nanomolar concentrations, can block the action of immunostimulatory DNA. U.S. Pat. No. 6,221,882 B1. Macfarlane and coworkers studied a large number of compounds by varying substituents on a limited number of 4-aminoquinoline and 9-aminoacridine core structures related to chloroquine and quinacrine.","The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery by the applicants that a number of small molecules, some previously known but distinct from those described by Macfarlane et al. and by Tobe et al., can alter TLR-mediated immunostimulatory signaling. Many of the compounds inhibit TLR signaling and are useful as inhibitors of immune stimulation. Compositions and methods described herein are useful for inhibiting immune stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Such compositions and methods thus will find use in a number of clinical applications, including as pharmaceutical agents and methods for treating conditions involving unwanted immune activity, including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The compositions of the invention can also be used in methods for the preparation of medicaments for use in the treatment of conditions involving unwanted immune activity, including a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.","It was surprisingly discovered that molecules having similar substituents but different core structures compared to those related to chloroquine and quinacrine described by Macfarlane et al., are potent immunomodulatory small molecules. Without being bound to any theory or mechanism, it is believed that the small molecules described by the present invention affect immune stimulation via interaction with a TLR. More particularly, it is believed that many of the small molecules described by the present invention inhibit immune stimulation via TLR antagonism. In particular, it is believed that many of the small molecules described by the present invention inhibit immune stimulation via TLR9 antagonism.","The invention in certain aspects provides methods useful for altering TLR-mediated signaling. The methods of the invention are useful whenever it is desirable to alter TLR-mediated signaling in response to a suitable TLR ligand or TLR signaling agonist. For example, the methods can be used to treat any of a variety of conditions involving autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), infection, sepsis, cancer, and immunodeficiency. Generally, methods useful in the treatment of conditions involving autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, and GvHD will employ small molecules that inhibit TLR-mediated signaling in response to a suitable TLR ligand or TLR signaling agonist. Generally, methods useful in the treatment of conditions involving infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency will employ small molecules that augment TLR-mediated signaling in response to a suitable TLR ligand. In some instances the methods can be used to inhibit or promote TLR-mediated signaling in response to a TLR ligand or TLR signaling agonist. In some instances the methods can be used to inhibit TLR-mediated immunostimulatory signaling in response to a TLR ligand or TLR signaling agonist. In some instances the methods can be used to inhibit or promote TLR-mediated immunostimulation in a subject. In some instances the methods can be used to inhibit TLR-mediated immunostimulation in a subject. In some instances the methods can be used to inhibit an immunostimulatory nucleic acid-associated response in a subject.","The invention in certain aspects provides novel small molecule compositions useful for altering TLR-mediated signaling. The compositions of the invention are useful whenever it is desirable to alter TLR-mediated signaling in response to a suitable TLR ligand or TLR signaling agonist. For example, the small molecules can be used in methods to treat any of a variety of conditions involving autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, GvHD, infection, sepsis, cancer, and immunodeficiency. Generally, methods useful in the treatment of conditions involving autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy, asthma, graft rejection, and GvHD will employ small molecules that inhibit TLR-mediated signaling in response to a suitable TLR ligand or TLR signaling agonist. Generally, methods useful in the treatment of conditions involving infection, cancer, and immunodeficiency will employ small molecules that augment TLR-mediated signaling in response to a suitable TLR ligand. In some instances the molecules can be used in a method to inhibit or promote TLR-mediated signaling in response to a TLR ligand or TLR signaling agonist. In some instances the small molecules can be used in a method to inhibit TLR-mediated immunostimulatory signaling in response to a TLR ligand or TLR signaling agonist. In some instances the small molecules can be used in a method to inhibit or promote TLR-mediated immunostimulation in a subject. In some instances the small molecules can be used in a method to inhibit TLR-mediated immunostimulation in a subject. In some instances the small molecules can be used to inhibit an immunostimulatory nucleic acid-associated response in a subject.","As a feature of the present invention, the methods of the invention can be combined with administration of additional agents to achieve synergistic effect on TLR-mediated immunostimulation. More specifically, whereas the agents described herein have been discovered to affect TLRs directly and thus directly affect TLR-bearing cells, e.g., antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such agents can be used in conjunction with additional agents which affect non-APC immune cells, e.g., T lymphocytes (T cells). Such an approach effectively introduces an immunomodulatory intervention at two levels: innate immunity and acquired immunity. Since innate immunity is believed to initiate and support acquired immunity, the combination intervention is synergistic.","In one aspect of the invention, a method of affecting TLR-mediated signaling in response to a TLR ligand is provided.

It was observed that certain of the small molecules in the library were effective in altering TLR9 signaling in response to CpG ODN. Based on the initial screening results, additional compounds were selected for additional screening. Importantly, the small molecules so identified were distinct from those described by Macfarlane and colleagues.","It has now been discovered according to the present invention that certain small molecules characterized by certain minimum features are able to modulate TLR signaling, e.g., in the presence of or in response to a PAMP or other TLR ligand. Some of the small molecules are potent inhibitors of TLR signaling and thus can be used to inhibit TLR-mediated immunostimulation. The minimal features for many, but not all, of the small molecules can be summarized as follows: a core structure including at least two rings, which can be fused or unfused, wherein at least one of the rings contains a nitrogen atom and\/or has a side chain that contains a nitrogen atom. Certain of the molecules are effective even without presence of a nitrogen atom.","It has been observed that fused three-ring structures such as quinacrine are typically an order of magnitude more potent as inhibitors of TLR-mediated immunostimulation than are fused two-ring structures such as chloroquine. For example, quinacrine is reported to have an ECof about 8 nM, where ECis the concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of CpG-ODN effect on thymidine uptake by WEHI 231 B-cells in the presence of anti-surface IgM. U.S. Pat. No. 6,479,504 B1. It has now also been discovered according to the present invention that fused two-ring core structures to which are attached a nitrogen-containing ring substituent can be as potent as fused three-ring structures such as quinacrine. In particular, such compounds can exhibit ECin the low nanomolar range. In certain embodiments the nitrogen-containing ring substituent is a C-Calkyl group terminated by a tertiary amine, such as methylethylamine, diethyl amine, dimethyl amine, or a ring containing at least one nitrogen.","Without meaning to be bound to any particular theory or mechanism, it is the belief of the instant inventors that both the ring-containing core structure and the side chain substituents contribute to affinity and efficacy. It is believed that molecules with high affinity core structure and low affinity substituents can be as effective as molecules with low affinity core structure and high affinity substituents.","Over many years there have been observations that certain common classes of drugs used for purposes other than affecting the immune system in fact have side effects that include immune suppression. For example, the phenothiazine chlorpromazine has been reported to inhibit messenger RNA expression for interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3). Schleuning M J et al. (1989) 19:1491-6. In a separate study, chlorpromazine was reported to depress contact hypersensitivity to dinitrochlorobenzene in guinea-pigs. Descotes J et al. (1982) 2:21-5. Yet another study reported that acute, high dose administration of the tricyclic antidepressant drug imipramine inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increases in TNF-\u03b1 but has little or no effect on LPS-induced interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) or interleukin 10 (IL-10). Dredge K et al. (1999) 21:663-73.","Histamine is a widely recognized mediator of immediate hypersensitivity and inflammation, which are principally mast cell- and basophil-mediated immune phenomena. The pleiotropic effects of histamine are mediated through three types of membrane-associated histamine receptor, histamine H1 receptor (H1R), histamine H2 receptor (H2R), and histamine H3 receptor (H3R). Pharmacologic inhibitors for these receptors are known and include pyrilamine and tripelennamine (H1R); cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine (H2R); and thioperamide and clobenpropit (H3R). Recently it was reported that signaling through H1R augments T-cell and B-cell antigen receptor-mediated responses. Banu Y et al. (1999)189:673-82. T cells and B cells derived from H1R-deficient (H1R) mice were reported to have normal responses to LPS. Banu et al. also reported that administration of the H2R-specific antagonist famotidine further depressed T-cell and B-cell antigen receptor-mediated responses in H1R mice. Jutel and coworkers recently reported that in their study of T cells, the Th1 subset of CD4+ T cells preferentially express H1R, while Th2 cells preferentially express H2R. They also reported that histamine enhances Th1-type responses by triggering H1R, and that H1R mice have suppressed levels of the Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and increased levels of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Jutel M et al. (2001) 413:420-5.","In contrast, with respect to dendritic cells (DC), Mazzoni and others have reported that histamine inhibits IL-12 production and stimulates IL-10 secretion in LPS-stimulated monocyte-derived DC, resulting in a shift from a Th1- to a Th2-polarized immune response. Mazzoni A et al. (2001) 108:1865; Caron G et al. (2001) 166:6000-6. Recently Mazzoni et al. also reported their observation that histamine, acting through H2R, inhibits release of type I IFN and TNF-\u03b1 by plasmacytoid DC (pDC), the principal producers of IFN-\u03b1, in response to exposure to CpG ODN or live influenza virus. Mazzoni A et al. (2003) 170:2269-73. Finally, it was recently reported that histamine, acting through H2R on monocyte\/macrophages, suppresses NADPH oxidase, a key enzyme in oxygen radical formation, resulting in protection of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells against oxygen radical-induced dysfunction and apoptosis. Hellstrand K (2002) 29(3 Suppl 7):35-40.","Definitions","Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.","As used herein, the term \u201cadaptive immune response\u201d refers to any type of antigen-specific immune response.

Cancers or tumors include but are not limited to biliary tract cancer; brain cancer; breast cancer; cervical cancer; choriocarcinoma; colon cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer; gastric (stomach) cancer; intraepithelial neoplasms; leukemias; lymphomas; liver cancer; lung cancer (e.g., small cell and non-small cell); melanoma; neuroblastomas; oral cancer; ovarian cancer; pancreatic cancer; prostate cancer; rectal cancer; renal (kidney) cancer; sarcomas; skin cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid cancer; as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas. Cancers can be primary or metastatic.","As used herein, the term \u201cCpG DNA\u201d refers to an immunostimulatory nucleic acid which contains a cytosine-guanine (CG) dinucleotide, the C residue of which is unmethylated. The effects of CpG nucleic acids on immune modulation have been described extensively in U.S. patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,194,388; 6,207,646; 6,239,116; and 6,218,371, and published international patent applications, such as WO98\/37919, WO98\/40100, WO98\/52581, and WO99\/56755. The entire contents of each of these patents and published patent applications is hereby incorporated by reference. The entire immunostimulatory nucleic acid can be unmethylated or portions may be unmethylated but at least the C of the 5\u2032-CG-3\u2032 must be unmethylated.","CpG DNA includes both naturally occurring immunostimulatory nucleic acids, as found in bacterial DNA and plasmids, as well as synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN).","In one embodiment the CpG DNA is a CpG ODN that has a base sequence provided by 5\u2032-TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT-3\u2032 (ODN 2006; 1).","CpG ODN have been further classified by structure and function into at least the following three classes or types, all of which are intended to be encompassed within the term CpG DNA as used herein: B-class CpG ODN such as ODN 2006 include the originally described immunostimulatory CpG ODN and characteristically activate B cells and NK cells but do not induce or only weakly induce expression of type I interferon (e.g., IFN-\u03b1). A-class CpG ODN, described in published PCT international application WO 01\/22990, incorporate a CpG motif, include a chimeric phosphodiester\/phosphorothioate backbone, and characteristically activate NK cells and induce plasmacytoid dendritic cells to express large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 but do not activate or only weakly activate B cells. An example of an A-class CpG ODN is 5\u2032-G*G*G_G_G_A_C_G_A_T_C_G_T_C_G*G*G*G*G*G-3\u2032 (ODN 2216, SEQ ID NO:2), wherein \u201c*\u201d represents phosphorothioate and \u201c_\u201d represents phosphodiester. C-class CpG ODN incorporate a CpG, include a wholly phosphorothioate backbone, include a GC-rich palindromic or nearly-palindromic region, and are capable of both activating B cells and inducing expression of IFN-\u03b1. C-class CpG ODN have been described, for example, in published U.S. patent application 2003\/0148976. An example of a C-class CpG ODN is 5\u2032-TCGTCGTTTTCGGCGCGCGCCG-3\u2032 (ODN 2395; SEQ ID NO:3). For a review of the various classes of CpG ODN, see also Vollmer J et al. (2004) 34:251-62.","As used herein, \u201ccytokine\u201d refers to any of a number of soluble proteins or glycoproteins that act on immune cells through specific receptors to affect the state of activation and function of the immune cells. Cytokines include interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor beta, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), chemokines, as well as others. Various cytokines affect innate immunity, acquired immunity, or both. Cytokines specifically include, without limitation, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Chemokines specifically include, without limitation, IL-8, IP-10, I-TAC, RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, Gro-\u03b1, Gro-\u03b2, Gro-\u03b3, MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3.","Most mature CD4 T helper cells can be categorized into one of two cytokine-associated, cross-regulatory subsets or phenotypes: Th1 or Th2. Th1 cells are associated with IL-2, IL-3, IFN, GM-CSF and high levels of TNF-\u03b1. Th2 cells are associated with IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, GM-CSF and low levels of TNF-\u03b1. The Th1 subset promotes both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity that is characterized by immunoglobulin class switching to IgG2a in mice. Th1 responses can also be associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity and autoimmune disease. The Th2 subset induces primarily humoral immunity and induces immunoglobulin class switching to IgE and IgG1 in mice. The antibody isotypes associated with Th1 responses generally have good neutralizing and opsonizing capabilities, whereas those associated with Th2 responses are associated more with allergic responses.","Several factors have been shown to influence commitment to Th1 or Th2 profiles. The best characterized regulators are cytokines. IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 are positive Th1 and negative Th2 regulators. IL-12 promotes IFN-\u03b3 production, and IFN-\u03b3 provides positive feedback for IL-12. IL-4 and IL-10 appear to be required for the establishment of the Th2 cytokine profile and to down-regulate Th1 cytokine production; the effects of IL-4 are in some cases dominant over those of IL-12. IL-13 was shown to inhibit expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 by LPS-induced monocytes, in a way similar to IL-4.","As used herein, \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to any amount that is necessary or sufficient for achieving or promoting a desired outcome. In some instances an effective amount is a therapeutically effective amount. A therapeutically effective amount is any amount that is necessary or sufficient for promoting or achieving a desired biological response in a subject. The effective amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular agent being administered, the size of the subject, or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary skill in the art can empirically determine the effective amount of a particular agent without necessitating undue experimentation.","As used herein, \u201cgraft rejection\u201d refers to immunologically mediated hyperacute, acute, or chronic injury to a tissue or organ derived from a source other than the host. The term thus encompasses both cellular and antibody-mediated rejection, as well as rejection of both allografts and xenografts.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmune cell\u201d refers to a cell belonging to the immune system. Immune cells include T lymphocytes (T cells), B lymphocytes (B cells), natural killer (NK) cells, granulocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and specialized forms of any of the foregoing, e.g., plasmacytoid dendritic cells, plasma cells, NKT, T helper, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).","As used herein, the term \u201cimmune complex\u201d refers to any conjugate including an antibody and an antigen specifically bound by the antibody. In one embodiment the antigen is an autoantigen.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmune complex comprising a nucleic acid\u201d refers to any conjugate including an antibody and a nucleic acid-containing antigen specifically bound by the antibody. The nucleic acid-containing antigen can include chromatin, ribosomes, small nuclear proteins, histones, nucleosomes, DNA, RNA, or any combination thereof. The antibody can but need not necessarily bind specifically to a nucleic acid component of the nucleic acid-containing antigen.","As used herein, the term \u201cimmune complex-associated disease\u201d refers to any disease characterized by the production and\/or tissue deposition of immune complexes, including, but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and related connective tissue diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C- and hepatitis B-related immune complex disease (e.g., cryoglobulinemia), Beh\u00e7et's syndrome, autoimmune glomerulonephritides, and vasculopathy associated with the presence of LDL\/anti-LDL immune complexes.","As used herein, \u201cimmunodeficiency\u201d refers to a disease or disorder in which the subject's immune system is not functioning in normal capacity or in which it would be useful to boost a subject's immune response for example to eliminate a tumor or cancer (e.g., tumors of the brain, lung (e.g., small cell and non-small cell), ovary, breast, prostate, colon, as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas) or an infection in a subject. The immunodeficiency can be acquired or it can be congenital.","As used herein, \u201cimmunostimulatory nucleic acid-associated response in a subject\u201d refers to a measurable response in a subject associated with administration to the subject of an immunostimulatory nucleic acid. Such responses include, without limitation, elaboration of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, or immunoglobulin; expression of immune cell surface activation markers; Th1\/Th2 skewing; and clinical disease activity.","As used herein, the terms \u201cinfection\u201d and, equivalently, \u201cinfectious disease\u201d refer to a condition in which an infectious organism or agent is present in a detectable amount in the blood or in a normally sterile tissue or normally sterile compartment of a subject. Infectious organisms and agents include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The terms encompass both acute and chronic infections, as well as sepsis.","As used herein, the term \u201cinnate immune response\u201d refers to any type of immune response to certain pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Innate immunity, which is also known in the art as natural or native immunity, involves principally neutrophils, granulocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells, NKT cells, and NK cells. Innate immune responses can include, without limitation, type I interferon production (e.g., IFN-\u03b1), neutrophil activation, macrophage activation, phagocytosis, opsonization, complement activation, and any combination thereof.","As used herein, the term \u201cself-DNA\u201d refers to any DNA derived from the genome of a host subject. In one embodiment self-DNA includes complementary DNA (cDNA) derived from a host subject. Self-DNA includes intact and degraded DNA.","As used herein, the term \u201cself-RNA\u201d refers to any RNA derived from the genome of a host subject. In one embodiment self-RNA is a messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from a host subject. In one embodiment self-RNA includes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) derived from a host subject. Self-RNA includes intact and degraded RNA.","As used herein, the term \u201csubject\u201d refers to a vertebrate animal. In one embodiment the subject is a mammal. In one embodiment the subject is a human. In other embodiments the subject is a non-human vertebrate animal, including, without limitation, non-human primates, laboratory animals, livestock, domesticated animals, and non-domesticated animals.","As used herein, \u201csubject having or at risk of developing TLR-mediated immunostimulation\u201d refers to a subject exposed to or at risk of exposure to a PAMP or other TLR ligand.","As used herein, the terms \u201cToll-like receptor\u201d and, equivalently, \u201cTLR\u201d refer to any member of a family of at least ten highly conserved mammalian pattern recognition receptor proteins (TLR1-TLR10) which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and act as key signaling elements in innate immunity. TLR polypeptides share a characteristic structure that includes an extracellular (extracytoplasmic) domain that has leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular (cytoplasmic) domain that is involved in TLR signaling. TLRs include but are not limited to human TLRs.","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for all ten currently known human TLRs are available from public databases such as GenBank. Similarly, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for various TLRs from numerous non-human species are also available from public databases including GenBank. For example, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for human TLR9 (hTLR9) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF245704 (coding region spanning nucleotides 145-3243) and AAF78037, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for murine TLR9 (mTLR9) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF348140 (coding region spanning nucleotides 40-3138) and AAK29625, respectively. The deduced human TLR9 protein contains 1,032 amino acids and shares an overall amino acid identity of 75.5% with mouse TLR9. Like other TLR proteins, human TLR9 contains extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a cytoplasmic Toll\/interleukin-1R (TIR) domain. It also has a signal peptide (residues 1-25) and a transmembrane domain (residues 819-836).","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for human TLR8 (hTLR8) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF245703 (coding region spanning nucleotides 49-3174) and AAF78036, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for murine TLR8 (mTLR8) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AY035890 (coding region spanning nucleotides 59-3157) and AAK62677, respectively.","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for human TLR7 (hTLR7) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF240467 (coding region spanning nucleotides 135-3285) and AAF60188, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for murine TLR7 (mTLR7) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AY035889 (coding region spanning nucleotides 49-3201) and AAK62676, respectively.","Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for human TLR3 (hTLR3) can be found as GenBank accession numbers NM003265 (coding region spanning nucleotides 102-2816) and NP003256, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for murine TLR3 (hTLR3) can be found as GenBank accession numbers AF355152 (coding region spanning nucleotides 44-2761) and AAK26117, respectively.","While hTLR1 is ubiquitously expressed, hTLR2, hTLR4 and hTLR5 are present in monocytes, polymorphonuclear phagocytes, and dendritic cells. Muzio M et al. (2000) 67:450-6. Recent publications reported that hTLR1, hTLR6, hTLR7, hTLR9 and hTLR10 are present in human B cells. Human TLR7 and hTLR9 are present in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), while myeloid dendritic cells express hTLR7 and hTLR8 but not hTLR9. Human TLR8, however, appears not to be expressed in pDCs.","As members of the pro-inflammatory interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family, TLRs share homologies in their cytoplasmic domains called Toll\/IL-1R homology (TIR) domains. PCT published applications PCT\/US98\/08979 and PCT\/US01\/16766. Intracellular signaling mechanisms mediated by TLRs appear generally similar, with MyD88 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) believed to have critical roles. Wesche H et al. (1997) 7:837-47; Medzhitov R et al. (1998) 2:253-8; Adachi 0 et al. (1998) 9:143-50; Kawai Tetal. (1999) 11:115-22); Cao Z et al. (1996) 383:443-6; Lomaga M A et al. (1999) 13:1015-24. Signal transduction between MyD88 and TRAF6 is known to involve members of the serine-threonine kinase IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family, including at least IRAK-1 and IRAK-2. Muzio M et al. (1997) 278:1612-5.","Briefly, MyD88 is believed to act as an adapter molecule between the TIR domain of a TLR or IL-1R and IRAK (which includes at least any one of IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-4, and IRAK-M). MyD88 includes a C-terminal Toll homology domain and an N-terminal death domain. The Toll homology domain of MyD88 binds the TIR domain of TLR or IL-1R, and the death domain of MyD88 binds the death domain of the serine kinase IRAK. IRAK interacts with TRAF6, which acts as an entryway into at least two pathways, one leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and another leading to activation of Jun and Fos, members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family. Activation of NF-\u03baB involves the activation of TAK-1, a member of the MAP 3 kinase (MAPK) family, and I\u03baB kinases. The I\u03baB kinases phosphorylate I\u03baB, leading to its degradation and the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus. Activation of Jun and Fos is believed to involve MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs) and MAP kinases ERK, p38, and JNK\/SAPK. Both NF-\u03baB and AP-1 are involved in controlling the transcription of a number of key immune response genes, including genes for various cytokines and costimulatory molecules. See Aderem A et al. (2000) 406:782-7; H\u00e4cker H et al. (1999) 18:6973-82.","As used herein, the terms \u201cTLR ligand\u201d and, equivalently, \u201cligand for a TLR\u201d and \u201cTLR signaling agonist\u201d, refer to a molecule, other than a small molecule according to Formula I-XIX described herein or a 4-primary amino quinoline or quinazoline molecule according to the invention, that interacts, directly or indirectly, with a TLR through a TLR domain other than a TIR domain and induces TLR-mediated signaling. In one embodiment a TLR ligand is a natural ligand, i.e., a TLR ligand that is found in nature. In one embodiment a TLR ligand refers to a molecule other than a natural ligand of a TLR, e.g., a molecule prepared by human activity. In one embodiment the TLR is TLR9 and the TLR signal agonist is a CpG nucleic acid.","Ligands for many but not all of the TLRs have been described. For instance, it has been reported that TLR2 signals in response to peptidoglycan and lipopeptides. Yoshimura A et al. (1999) 163:1-5; Brightbill H D et al. (1999) 285:732-6; Aliprantis A O et al. (1999) 285:736-9; Takeuchi 0 et al. (1999) 11:443-51; Underhill D M et al. (1999) 401:811-5. TLR4 has been reported to signal in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Hoshino K et al. (1999) 162:3749-52; Poltorak A et al. (1998) 282:2085-8; Medzhitov R et al. (1997) 388:394-7. Bacterial flagellin has been reported to be a natural ligand for TLR5. Hayashi F et al. (2001) 410:1099-1103. TLR6, in conjunction with TLR2, has been reported to signal in response to proteoglycan. Ozinsky A et al. (2000) 97:13766-71; Takeuchi O et al. (2001) 13:933-40.","Recently it was reported that TLR9 is a receptor for CpG DNA. Hemmi H et al. (2000) 408:740-5; Bauer S et al. (2001) 98:9237-42. CpG DNA, which includes bacterial DNA and synthetic DNA with CG dinucleotides in which cytosine is unmethylated, is described in greater detail elsewhere herein. Marshak-Rothstein and colleagues also recently reported their finding that TLR9 signaling can occur in certain autoimmune diseases in response to immune complexes containing IgG and chromatin. Leadbetter E A et al. (2002) 416:595-8. Thus, in a broader sense it appears that TLR9 can signal in response to self or non-self nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, when the nucleic acid is presented in a suitable context, e.g., as part of an immune complex.","Recently it was reported that certain imidazoquinoline compounds having antiviral activity are ligands of TLR7 and TLR8. Hemmi H et al. (2002) 3:196-200; Jurk M et al. (2002) 3:499. Imidazoquinolines are potent synthetic activators of immune cells with antiviral and antitumor properties. Using macrophages from wildtype and MyD88-deficient mice, Hemmi et al. recently reported that two imidazoquinolines, imiquimod and resiquimod (R848), induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) and activate NF-\u03baB only in wildtype cells, consistent with activation through a TLR. Hemmi H et al. (2002) 3:196-200. Macrophages from mice deficient in TLR7 but not other TLRs produced no detectable cytokines in response to these imidazoquinolines. In addition, the imidazoquinolines induced dose-dependent proliferation of splenic B cells and the activation of intracellular signaling cascades in cells from wildtype but not TLR7\u2212\/\u2212 mice. Luciferase analysis established that expression of human TLR7, but not TLR2 or TLR4, in human embryonic kidney cells results in NF-\u03baB activation in response to resiquimod. The findings of Hemmi et al. thus suggested that these imidazoquinoline compounds are non-natural ligands of TLR7 that can induce signaling through TLR7.","Recently it was reported that R848 is also a ligand for human TLR8. Jurk M et al. (2002) 3:499.","It was recently reported that ligands of TLR3 include poly(I:C) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). For purposes of this invention, poly(I:C) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are classified as oligonucleotide molecules. By stimulating kidney cells expressing one of a range of TLRs with poly(I:C), Alexopoulou et al. reported that only cells expressing TLR3 respond by activating NF-\u03baB. Alexopoulou L et al. (2001) 413: 732-8. Alexopoulou et al. also reported that wildtype cells stimulated with poly(I:C) activate NF-\u03baB and produce inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1, whereas the corresponding responses of TLR3 cells were significantly impaired. In contrast, TLR3 cells responded equivalently to wildtype cells in response to lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and CpG dinucleotides. Analysis of MyD88 cells indicated that this adaptor protein is involved in dsRNA-induced production of cytokines and proliferative responses, although activation of NF-\u03baB and MAP kinases are not affected, indicating distinct pathways for these cellular responses. Alexopoulou et al. proposed that TLR3 may have a role in host defense against viruses.","As used herein, a \u201ccell expressing a TLR\u201d refers to any cell which expresses, either naturally or artificially, a functional TLR. A functional TLR is a full-length TLR protein or a fragment thereof capable of inducing a signal in response to interaction with its ligand. Generally the functional TLR will include at least a TLR ligand-binding fragment of the extracellular domain of the full-length TLR and at least a fragment of a TIR domain capable of interacting with another Toll homology domain-containing polypeptide, e.g., MyD88. In various embodiments the functional TLR is a full-length TLR selected from TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, and TLR10.","In certain embodiments the functional TLR is naturally expressed by a cell.","In one embodiment the cell naturally expresses functional TLR and is an isolated cell from human multiple myeloma cell line RPMI 8226 (ATCC CCL-155). This cell line was established from the peripheral blood of a 61 year old man at the time of diagnosis of multiple myeloma (IgG lambda type). Matsuoka Y et al. (1967) 125:1246-50. RPMI 8226 was previously reported as responsive to CpG nucleic acids as evidenced by the induction of IL-6 protein and IL-12p40 mRNA. Takeshita F et al. (2000) 30:108-16; Takeshita Fetal. (2000) 30:1967-76. Takeshita et al. used the cell line solely to study promoter constructs in order to identify transcription factor binding sites important for CpG nucleic acid signaling. It is now known that RPMI 8226 cells secrete a number of other chemokines and cytokines including IL-8, IL-10 and IP-10 in response to immunostimulatory nucleic acids. Because this cell line expresses TLR9, through which immunostimulatory nucleic acids such as for example CpG nucleic acids mediate their effects, it is a suitable cell line for use in the methods of the invention relating to CpG nucleic acids as reference and test compounds, as well as to other TLR9 ligands.","Similar to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the RPMI 8226 cell line has been observed to upregulate its cell surface expression of markers such as CD71, CD86 and HLA-DR in response to CpG nucleic acid exposure. This has been observed by flow cytometric analysis of the cell line. Accordingly, the methods provided herein can be structured to use appropriately selected cell surface marker expression as a readout, in addition to or in place of chemokine or cytokine production or other readouts described elsewhere herein.","The RPMI 8226 cell line has also been found to respond to certain small molecules including imidazoquinoline compounds. For example, incubation of RPMI 8226 cells with the imidazoquinoline compound R848 (resiquimod) induces IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 production. It has recently been reported that R848 mediates its immunostimulatory effects through TLR7 and TLR8. The ability of RPMI 8226 to respond to R848 suggests that the RPMI 8226 cell line also expresses TLR7, as previously reported for normal human B cells.","The RPMI cell line can be used in unmodified form or in a modified form. In one embodiment, the RPMI 8226 cell is transfected with a reporter construct. Preferably, the cell is stably transfected with the reporter construct. The reporter construct generally includes a promoter, a coding sequence and a polyadenylation signal. The coding sequence can include a reporter sequence selected from the group consisting of an enzyme (e.g., luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), secreted alkaline phosphatase, etc.), a bioluminescence marker (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP, U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,084), etc.), a surface-expressed molecule (e.g., CD25), a secreted molecule (e.g., IL-8, IL-12 p40, TNF-\u03b1, etc.), and other detectable protein products known to those of skill in the art. Preferably, the coding sequence encodes a protein having a level or an activity that is quantifiable.","In certain embodiments the functional TLR is artificially expressed (including over-expressed) by a cell, for example by introduction into the cell of an expression vector bearing a coding sequence for the functional TLR wherein the coding sequence is operably linked to a gene expression sequence. As used herein, a coding sequence and the gene expression sequence are said to be operably linked when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription and\/or translation of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the gene expression sequence. Two DNA sequences are said to be operably linked if induction of a promoter in the 5\u2032 gene expression sequence results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not (1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequence, or (3) interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus, a gene expression sequence would be operably linked to a coding sequence if the gene expression sequence were capable of effecting transcription of that coding sequence such that the resulting transcript is translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.","In some embodiments a coding sequence refers to a nucleic acid sequence coding for a functional TLR. In some embodiments a coding sequence refers to a nucleic acid sequence coding for a reporter.","A cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR can be a cell that does not express the functional TLR but for the TLR expression vector. For example, human 293 fibroblasts (ATCC CRL-1573) do not express TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, or TLR9. As described in the examples below, such cells can be transiently or stably transfected with suitable expression vector (or vectors) so as to yield cells that do express TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, or any combination thereof. Alternatively, a cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR can be a cell that expresses the functional TLR at a significantly higher level with the TLR expression vector than it does without the TLR expression vector.","For use in the methods of the instant invention, a cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR is preferably a stably transfected cell that expresses the functional TLR. Such a cell can also be stably transfected with a suitable reporter construct.","As used herein, \u201cTLR-mediated signaling\u201d refers to any portion of the intracellular signal transduction pathway involving interaction of a TLR with a suitable TLR ligand and engagement by the TLR of MyD88 or any aspect downstream of MyD88 engagement, described above in relation to the structure and function of the TIR domain of a TLR.","As used herein, \u201cTLR-mediated immunostimulatory signaling\u201d refers to TLR-mediated signaling that results in a measurable immunostimulatory response. This term applies to such signaling both in vitro and in vivo.","As used herein, \u201cTLR-mediated immunostimulation in a subject\u201d refers to TLR-mediated immunostimulatory signaling as it applies in vivo.","As used herein, the term \u201ctreat\u201d as used in reference to a disorder, disease, or condition means to intervene in such disorder, disease, or condition so as to prevent or slow the development of, to prevent, slow or halt the progression of, or to eliminate the disorder, disease, or condition.","Immunostimulatory Nucleic Acids","As used herein, \u201cimmunostimulatory nucleic acid\u201d refers to a nucleic acid molecule that, when contacted with a cell of the immune system, induces the cell of the immune system to become activated. Immune cell activation can be determined using any suitable means known to one of skill in the art, including but not limited to measurement of stimulated growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, transcription or expression of gene products that are expressed or secreted in association with immune activation, activity of intracellular signaling pathways, and the like. Examples of markers of immune cell activation include, without limitation, secretion of cytokines (e.g., IL-6), secretion of immunoglobulin (e.g., IgG), expression of cell surface antigens (e.g., CD86), induction of cytolytic activity, and induction and nuclear translocation of transcription factors (e.g., NF-\u03baB).","A \u201cnucleic acid\u201d as used herein with respect to the methods of the invention, shall refer to any polymer of two or more individual nucleoside or nucleotide units. Nucleic acids can be single- or double-stranded. Typically individual nucleoside or nucleotide units will include any one or combination of deoxyribonucleosides, ribonucleosides, deoxyribonucleotides, and ribonucleotides. The individual nucleotide or nucleoside units of the nucleic acid can be naturally occurring or not naturally occurring. For example, the individual nucleotide units can include deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxyguanosine, thymidine, and uracil. In addition to naturally occurring 2\u2032-deoxy and 2\u2032-hydroxyl forms, individual nucleosides also include synthetic nucleosides having modified base moieties and\/or modified sugar moieties, e.g., as described in Uhlmann E et al. (1990) 90:543-84. The linkages between individual nucleotide or nucleoside units can be naturally occurring or not naturally occurring. For example, the linkages can be phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoramidate, as well as peptide linkages and other covalent linkages, known in the art, suitable for joining adjacent nucleoside or nucleotide units. Immunostimulatory nucleic acids typically range in size from 3-4 units to a few tens of units, e.g., 18-40 units, although longer nucleic acids are also contemplated by the invention.","In some embodiments the nucleic acids are oligonucleotides made up of 2 to about 100 nucleotides, and more typically 4 to about 40 nucleotides. Oligonucleotides composed exclusively of deoxyribonucleotides are termed oligodeoriboxynucleotides or, equivalently, oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN).","An immunostimulatory nucleic acid includes any of a number of different types of immunostimulatory nucleic acids, including specifically immunostimulatory CpG nucleic acids (CpG nucleic acids), including but not limited to types A, B, and C; and immunostimulatory non-CpG nucleic acids, including without limitation methylated CpG nucleic acids, T-rich nucleic acids, and poly-G nucleic acids. Certain of these various classes of immunostimulatory nucleic acids can coexist in a given nucleic acid molecule.","As used herein, the terms \u201cCpG nucleic acid\u201d and, equivalently, \u201cCpG ODN\u201d refer to an immunostimulatory nucleic acid which contains a cytosine-guanine (CG) dinucleotide, the C residue of which is unmethylated. The effects of CpG nucleic acids on immune modulation have been described extensively in U.S. patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,194,388; 6,207,646; 6,218,371; and 6,239,116, and published international patent applications, such as WO 98\/37919, WO 98\/40100, WO 98\/52581, and WO 99\/56755. The entire contents of each of these patents and published patent applications is hereby incorporated by reference. The entire immunostimulatory nucleic acid can be unmethylated or portions may be unmethylated but at least the C of the 5\u2032-CG-3\u2032 must be unmethylated. The CpG nucleic acid sequences of the invention include those broadly described above as well as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,207,646 B1 and 6,239,116 B1.","In one embodiment the CpG nucleic acid has a base sequence provided by 5\u2032-TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT-3\u2032 (ODN 2006; 1).","CpG nucleic acids have been further classified by structure and function into at least the following three types, all of which are intended to be encompassed within the methods of the instant invention: Type B CpG nucleic acids such as ODN 2006 include the earliest described CpG nucleic acids and characteristically activate B cells but do not induce or only weakly induce expression of IFN-\u03b1. Type A CpG nucleic acids, described in published international application PCT\/US00\/26527 (WO 01\/22990), incorporate a CpG motif, include a hybrid phosphodiester\/phosphorothioate backbone, and characteristically induce plasmacytoid dendritic cells to express large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 but do not activate or only weakly activate B cells. Type C oligonucleotides incorporate a CpG, include a chimeric backbone, include a GC-rich palindromic or nearly-palindromic region, and are capable of both activating B cells and inducing expression of IFN-\u03b1. These have been described, for example, in published U.S. patent application 2003\/0148976.","In other embodiments of the invention, a non-CpG nucleic acid is used. A non-CpG nucleic acid is an immunostimulatory nucleic acid which either does not have a CpG motif in its sequence, or has a CpG motif which contains a methylated C residue. In some instances, the non-CpG nucleic acid may still be immunostimulatory by virtue of its having other immunostimulatory motifs such as those described herein and known in the art. In one embodiment the non-CpG nucleic acid is a methylated CpG nucleic acid. In some instances the non-CpG nucleic acid is still immunostimulatory despite methylation of the C of the CpG motif, even without having another non-CpG immunostimulatory motif described herein and known in the art.","In one embodiment the non-CpG nucleic acid is a methylated CpG nucleic acid having a base sequence provided by 5\u2032-TZGTZGTTTTGTZGTTTTGTZGTT-3\u2032 (ODN 2117; SEQ ID NO:4, wherein Z represents 5-methylcytidine).","Non-CpG nucleic acids include T-rich immunostimulatory nucleic acids. The T-rich immunostimulatory nucleic acids include those disclosed in published PCT patent application PCT\/US00\/26383, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, T-rich nucleic acids 24 bases in length are used. A T-rich nucleic acid is a nucleic acid which includes at least one poly T sequence and\/or which has a nucleotide composition of greater than 25% T nucleotide residues. A nucleic acid having a poly-T sequence includes at least four Ts in a row, such as 5\u2032-TTTT-3\u2032. In some embodiments the T-rich nucleic acid includes more than one poly T sequence. In important embodiments, the T-rich nucleic acid may have 2, 3, 4, or more poly T sequences, such as ODN 2006.","Non-CpG nucleic acids also include poly-G immunostimulatory nucleic acids. A variety of references describe the immunostimulatory properties of poly-G nucleic acids. Pisetsky D S et al. (1993) 18:217-221; Krieger M et al. (1994) 63:601-637; Macaya R F et al.

The antigenic substance can be administered using any effective route or means for administering the antigenic substance to effect the contacting. By way of example, the administering can be by local or systemic injection, inhalation, oral ingestion, topical administration, mucosal administration, or any combination thereof.","In one embodiment the step of contacting an immune cell expressing a functional Toll-like receptor with an effective amount of an antigenic substance to stimulate an immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of a substituted 4-primary amino quinoline composition is passive. For example, in one embodiment the immune cell is already in contact or has already been in contact with an effective amount of an antigenic substance to stimulate an immune response to the antigenic substance, at the time of or prior to the step of contacting the immune cell expressing a functional Toll-like receptor with an effective amount of a substituted 4-primary amino quinoline composition having structural Formula XVII, as defined above, to inhibit an immune response to the antigenic substance compared with the immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of the substituted 4-primary amino quinoline composition.","The antigenic substance can be an allergen. An allergen is a substance that can induce an allergic or asthmatic response in a susceptible subject. The list of allergens is enormous and can include pollens, insect venoms, animal dander, dust, fungal spores and drugs (e.g., penicillin). Examples of natural animal and plant allergens include proteins specific to the following genera: (); (e.g., ); (); (); (e.g., or ); (); (); (); (); (); (); (); (e.g., ); (e.g., or ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., , and ); (e.g., , and ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., or ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); (e.g., ); and (e.g., ). The term \u201callergy\u201d refers to acquired hypersensitivity to a substance (allergen). An \u201callergic reaction\u201d is the response of an immune system to an allergen in a subject allergic to the allergen. Allergic conditions include eczema, allergic rhinitis or coryza, hay fever, bronchial asthma, urticaria (hives) and food allergies, and other atopic conditions.","The antigenic substance can be an antigen that is or is derived from an infectious microbial agent, including a bacterium, a virus, a fungus, or a parasite. Examples of infectious bacteria include: sps (such as. , and ), (Group A ), (Group B ), (viridans group), (anaerobic sps.), , pathogenic sp., sp., sp., sp., , and . Examples of infectious virus include: Retroviridae (including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)); Picornaviridae (for example, polio viruses, hepatitis A virus; enteroviruses, human coxsackie viruses, rhinoviruses, echoviruses); Calciviridae (such as strains that cause gastroenteritis); Togaviridae (for example, equine encephalitis viruses, rubella viruses); Flaviviridae (for example, dengue viruses, encephalitis viruses, yellow fever viruses); Coronaviridae (for example, coronaviruses); Rhabdoviridae (for example, vesicular stomatitis viruses, rabies viruses); Filoviridae (for example, ebola viruses); Paramyxoviridae (for example, parainfluenza viruses, mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus); Orthomyxoviridae (for example, influenza viruses); Bunyaviridae (for example, Hantaan viruses, bunya viruses, phleboviruses, and Nairo viruses); Arena viridae (hemorrhagic fever viruses); Reoviridae (e.g., reoviruses, orbiviurses, and rotaviruses); Bimaviridae; Hepadnaviridae (Hepatitis B virus); Parvoviridae (parvoviruses); Papovaviridae (papilloma viruses, polyoma viruses); Adenoviridae (most adenoviruses); Herpesviridae (herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, (CMV), herpes viruses); Poxyiridae (variola viruses, vaccinia viruses, pox viruses); and Iridoviridae (such as African swine fever virus); and unclassified viruses (for example, the etiological agents of spongiform encephalopathies, the agent of delta hepatitis (thought to be a defective satellite of hepatitis B virus), the agents of non-A, non-B hepatitis (class 1=internally transmitted; class 2=parenterally transmitted (i.e., Hepatitis C); Norwalk and related viruses, and astroviruses). Examples of infectious fungi include, but are not limited to, , and ","The antigenic substance can be a cancer antigen. A cancer antigen as used herein is a compound, such as a peptide or protein, associated with a tumor or cancer cell surface and which is capable of provoking an immune response when expressed on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell in the context of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. Cancer antigens can be prepared from cancer cells either by preparing crude extracts of cancer cells, for example, as described in Cohen P A et al. (1994) 54:1055-8, by partially purifying the antigens, by recombinant technology, or by de novo synthesis of known antigens. Cancer antigens include but are not limited to antigens that are recombinantly expressed, an immunogenic portion thereof, or a whole tumor or cancer cell. Such antigens can be isolated or prepared recombinantly or by any other means known in the art.","The terms \u201ccancer antigen\u201d and \u201ctumor antigen\u201d are used interchangeably and refer to antigens which are differentially expressed by cancer cells and can thereby be exploited in order to target cancer cells. Cancer antigens are antigens which can potentially stimulate apparently tumor-specific immune responses. Some of these antigens are encoded, although not necessarily expressed, by normal cells. These antigens can be characterized as those which are normally silent (i.e., not expressed) in normal cells, those that are expressed only at certain stages of differentiation and those that are temporally expressed such as embryonic and fetal antigens. Other cancer antigens are encoded by mutant cellular genes, such as oncogenes (e.g., activated ras oncogene), suppressor genes (e.g., mutant p53), fusion proteins resulting from internal deletions or chromosomal translocations. Still other cancer antigens can be encoded by viral genes such as those carried on RNA and DNA tumor viruses.

The method according to this aspect of the invention involves contacting an immune cell expressing a functional Toll-like receptor with","(a) an effective amount of an antigenic substance to stimulate an immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of a quinazoline composition, and","(b) an effective amount of a quinazoline composition having structural Formula XIX, as defined above, to inhibit an immune response to the antigenic substance compared with the immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of the quinazoline composition. The quinazoline composition in this aspect of the invention can be in the form a hydrate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The method according to this aspect of the invention can be performed in vitro or it can be performed in vivo. In one embodiment the immune response is an innate immune response. In one embodiment the immune response includes an adaptive immune response.","In one embodiment the step of contacting an immune cell expressing a functional Toll-like receptor with an effective amount of an antigenic substance to stimulate an immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of a quinazoline composition involves the active step of administering an effective amount of an antigenic substance to stimulate an immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of a quinazoline composition. The antigenic substance can be administered using any effective route or means for administering the antigenic substance to effect the contacting. By way of example, the administering can be by local or systemic injection, inhalation, oral ingestion, topical administration, mucosal administration, or any combination thereof.","In one embodiment the method involves contacting, in a subject, an immune cell expressing a functional Toll-like receptor with","(a) an effective amount of an antigenic substance to stimulate an immune response in the subject to the antigenic substance in absence of a quinazoline composition, and","(b) an effective amount of a quinazoline composition having structural Formula XVII, as defined above, to inhibit an immune response in the subject to the antigenic substance compared with the immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of the quinazoline composition.","In one embodiment the step of contacting an immune cell expressing a functional Toll-like receptor with an effective amount of an antigenic substance to stimulate an immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of a quinazoline composition is passive. For example, in one embodiment the immune cell is already in contact or has already been in contact with an effective amount of an antigenic substance to stimulate an immune response to the antigenic substance, at the time of or prior to the step of contacting the immune cell expressing a functional Toll-like receptor with an effective amount of a quinazoline composition having structural Formula XVII, as defined above, to inhibit an immune response to the antigenic substance compared with the immune response to the antigenic substance in absence of the quinazoline composition.","The antigenic substance can be an allergen, as described above.","The antigenic substance can be an antigen that is or is derived from an infectious microbial agent, including a bacterium, a virus, a fungus, or a parasite, as described above.","The antigenic substance can be a cancer antigen, as described above.","In one aspect of the invention, a method of treating an autoimmune disorder in a subject is provided. The method according to this aspect of the invention involves the step of administering to a subject having an autoimmune disorder an effective amount of a quinazoline composition having structural Formula XIX, as defined above, to treat the autoimmune disorder. The quinazoline composition in this aspect of the invention can be in the form a hydrate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt. In one embodiment the autoimmune disorder is chosen from systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, polymyositis, vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, and Beh\u00e7et's syndrome. In one particular embodiment the autoimmune disease is systemic lupus erythematosus. In one particular embodiment the autoimmune disease is rheumatoid arthritis. In one embodiment the subject is a human. The method can also be applied to animal models of any of the autoimmune disorders listed above.","In one embodiment the autoimmune disorder is an immune complex associated disease, as described above.","The quinazoline composition can be administered to the subject by any suitable route of administration, including, without limitation, oral and parenteral. Parenteral routes of administration are as described above with respect to substituted 4-primary amino quinolines.","Assays for Effectiveness","The methods of the invention can be assessed using any of a number of possible readout systems based upon a TLR\/IL-1R signal transduction pathway. In some embodiments, the readout for the method is based on the use of native genes or, alternatively, transfected or otherwise artificially introduced reporter gene constructs which are responsive to the TLR\/IL-1R signal transduction pathway involving MyD88, TRAF, p38, and\/or ERK. H\u00e4cker H et al. (1999) 18:6973-82. These pathways activate kinases including \u03baB kinase complex and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. Thus reporter genes and reporter gene constructs particularly useful for the assays include, e.g., a reporter gene operatively linked to a promoter sensitive to NF-\u03baB. Examples of such promoters include, without limitation, those for NF-\u03baB, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, IP-10, CD80, CD86, and TNF-\u03b1. The reporter gene operatively linked to the TLR-sensitive promoter can include, without limitation, an enzyme (e.g., luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, \u03b2-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), etc.), a bioluminescence marker (e.g., green-fluorescent protein (GFP, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,084), blue fluorescent protein (BFP, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,486,382), etc.), a surface-expressed molecule (e.g., CD25, CD80, CD86), and a secreted molecule (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, TNF-\u03b1). In certain embodiments the reporter is selected from IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB-luciferase (NF-\u03baB-luc; H\u00e4cker H et al. (1999) 18:6973-82), IL-12 p40-luc (Murphy T L et al. (1995) 15:5258-67), and TNF-luc (H\u00e4cker H et al. (1999) 18:6973-82). In assays relying on enzyme activity readout, substrate can be supplied as part of the assay, and detection can involve measurement of chemiluminescence, fluorescence, color development, incorporation of radioactive label, drug resistance, or other marker of enzyme activity. For assays relying on surface expression of a molecule, detection can be accomplished using flow cytometry (FACS) analysis or functional assays. Secreted molecules can be assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or bioassays. Many of these and other suitable readout systems are well known in the art and are commercially available.","Reporter Constructs","A cell expressing a functional TLR and useful for the methods of the invention has, in some embodiments, an expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling. The expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling can include a reporter gene under control of a promoter response element (enhancer element). In some embodiments the promoter response element is associated with a minimal promoter responsive to a transcription factor believed by the applicant to be activated as a consequence of TLR signaling. Examples of such minimal promoters include, without limitation, promoters for the following genes: AP-1, NF-\u03baB, ATF2, IRF3, and IRF7. These minimal promoters contain corresponding promoter response elements sensitive to AP-1, NF-\u03baB, ATF2, IRF3, and IRF7, respectively. In other embodiments the expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling can include a gene under control of a promoter response element selected from response elements sensitive to IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40 subunit, a type I IFN, RANTES, TNF, IP-10, I-TAC, and interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). The promoter response element generally will be present in multiple copies, e.g., as tandem repeats. For example, in one reporter construct, coding sequence for luciferase is under control of an upstream 6\u00d7 tandem repeat of NF-\u03baB response element. In another example, an ISRE-luciferase reporter construct useful in the invention is available from Stratagene (catalog no. 219092) and includes a 5\u00d7 ISRE tandem repeat joined to a TATA box upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. As discussed further elsewhere herein, the reporter itself can be any gene product suitable for detection by methods recognized in the art. Such methods for detection can include, for example, measurement of spontaneous or stimulated light emission, enzyme activity, expression of a soluble molecule, expression of a cell surface molecule, etc.","Readouts typically involve usual elements of Toll\/IL-1R signaling, e.g., MyD88, TRAF, and IRAK molecules, although in the case of TLR3 the role of MyD88 is less clear than for other TLR family members. As demonstrated herein such responses include the induction of a gene under control of a specific promoter such as a NF-\u03baB promoter, increases in particular cytokine levels, increases in particular chemokine levels, etc. The gene under the control of the NF-\u03baB promoter can be a gene which naturally includes an NF-\u03baB promoter or it can be a gene in a construct in which an NF-\u03baB promoter has been inserted. Genes and constructs which include the NF-\u03baB promoter include but are not limited to IL-8, IL-12 p40, NF-\u03baB-luc, IL-12 p40-luc, and TNF-luc.","Increases in cytokine levels can result from increased production, increased stability, increased secretion, or any combination of the forgoing, of the cytokine in response to the TLR-mediated signaling. Cytokines generally include, without limitation, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF. Th1 cytokines include but are not limited to IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12. Th2 cytokines include but are not limited to IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10.","Increases in chemokine levels can result from increased production, increased stability, increased secretion, or any combination of the forgoing, of the chemokine in response to the TLR-mediated signaling. Chemokines of particular significance in the invention include but are not limited to CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL9 (Mig), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11 (I-TAC), IL-8, and MCP-1.","Administration to a Subject","Some aspects of the invention involve administering an effective amount of a composition to a subject to achieve a specific outcome. The small molecule compositions useful according to the methods of the present invention thus can be formulated in any manner suitable for pharmaceutical use.","The formulations of the invention are administered in pharmaceutically acceptable solutions, which may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable concentrations of salt, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, adjuvants, and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.","For use in therapy, an effective amount of the compound can be administered to a subject by any mode allowing the compound to be taken up by the appropriate target cells. \u201cAdministering\u201d the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be accomplished by any means known to the skilled artisan. Specific routes of administration include but are not limited to oral, transdermal (e.g., via a patch), parenteral injection (subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, etc.), or mucosal (intranasal, intratracheal, inhalation, intrarectal, intravaginal, etc.). An injection can be in a bolus or a continuous infusion.","For example the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are often administered by intravenous, intramuscular, or other parenteral means, or by biolistic \u201cgene-gun\u201d application to the epidermis. They can also be administered by intranasal application, inhalation, topically, orally, or as implants, and even rectal or vaginal use is possible. Suitable liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, aqueous or saline solutions for injection or inhalation, microencapsulated, encochleated, coated onto microscopic gold particles, contained in liposomes, nebulized, aerosols, pellets for implantation into the skin, or dried onto a sharp object to be scratched into the skin. The pharmaceutical compositions also include granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, creams, drops or preparations with protracted release of active compounds, in whose preparation excipients and additives and\/or auxiliaries such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. For a brief review of present methods for drug delivery, see Langer R (1990) 249:1527-33, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The concentration of compounds included in compositions used in the methods of the invention can range from about 1 nM to about 100 \u03bcM. Effective doses are believed to range from about 10 picomole\/kg to about 100 micromole\/kg.","The pharmaceutical compositions are preferably prepared and administered in dose units. Liquid dose units are vials or ampoules for injection or other parenteral administration. Solid dose units are tablets, capsules, powders, and suppositories. For treatment of a patient, depending on activity of the compound, manner of administration, purpose of the administration (i.e., prophylactic or therapeutic), nature and severity of the disorder, age and body weight of the patient, different doses may be necessary. The administration of a given dose can be carried out both by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else several smaller dose units. Repeated and multiple administration of doses at specific intervals of days, weeks, or months apart are also contemplated by the invention.","The compositions can be administered per se (neat) or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts can conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group.","Suitable buffering agents include: acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w\/v); citric acid and a salt (1-3% w\/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5% w\/v); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2% w\/v). Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03% w\/v); chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w\/v); parabens (0.01-0.25% w\/v) and thimerosal (0.004-0.02% w\/v).","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention optionally include an active ingredient and optionally a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term \u201cpharmaceutically-acceptable carrier\u201d means one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers, dilutants or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or other vertebrate animal. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being comingled with the compounds of the present invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficiency.","Compositions suitable for parenteral administration conveniently include sterile aqueous preparations, which can be isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents are water, Ringer's solution, phosphate buffered saline, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed mineral or non-mineral oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Carrier formulations suitable for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, etc. administrations can be found in , Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.","The compounds useful in the invention can be delivered in mixtures of more than two such compounds. A mixture can further include one or more adjuvants in addition to the combination of compounds.","A variety of administration routes is available. The particular mode selected will depend, of course, upon the particular compound selected, the age and general health status of the subject, the particular condition being treated, and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of this invention, generally speaking, can be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, meaning any mode that produces effective levels of response without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Preferred modes of administration are discussed above.","The compositions can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the compounds into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the compounds into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are: lipids including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono-di-and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide based systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients; partially fused implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems in which an agent of the invention is contained in a form within a matrix such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,775, 4,675,189, and 5,736,152, and (b) difflusional systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,854,480, 5,133,974 and 5,407,686. In addition, pump-based hardware delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for implantation.","The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.","Candidate small molecules for initial screening were obtained from a commercially available library of 880 off-patent small molecules selected for structural diversity and proven bioavailability in humans (Prestwick Chemical Library). Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells stably transfected with a human TLR9 (hTLR9) expression vector were incubated overnight in the presence of 50 nM CpG ODN 2006 (i.e., the ECconcentration of ODN 2006) and selected small molecule candidate compounds at different concentrations ranging from 5\u00d710M to 5\u00d710M. TLR9 activity was assayed in terms of induction of a 6\u00d7 NF-\u03baB-luciferase reporter construct cotransfected in the cells. Results were measured as fold induction over baseline luciferase activity measured in the absence of ODN 2006 and compared to fold induction over baseline in the presence of the ECconcentration of ODN 2006 alone. From this initial screening a number of small molecules were identified as lead compounds and were categorized by structure and activity. Additional screening was performed in like manner using additional small molecules selected from another library or specifically prepared for this purpose. Results of some of these assays are presented in  and in Tables 5-16.","The method is described in greater detail as follows. The cells for each individual cell clone (hTLR3-NF\u03baB-293, hTLR7-NF\u03baB-293, hTLR8-NF\u03baB-293 and hTLR9-NF\u03baB-293) were counted and seeded one day before the stimulation at 1.5\u00d710cells per well in 96-well cell culture plates. To become adherent the cells were incubated after seeding overnight at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% COhumidified air.","The screen for each compound was performed at the same time for all of the receptors TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9. Up to fifteen test compounds, each assayed in duplicate at each of three different final concentrations (0.5 \u03bcg\/ml, 5 \u03bcg\/ml, and 50 \u03bcg\/ml), were used for 16 h cell stimulation on a single multiwell culture plate. A 4\u00d7 final concentration master plate was created to prepare the different test compounds before they were added to the cells.","Controls were added as duplicates individually for each cell clone on the cell culture plate. Positive controls were used as follows (final concentrations): 50 \u03bcg\/ml poly(I:C) for hTLR3-NF\u03baB-293; 8 \u03bcM resiquimod (R848) for hTLR7-NF\u03baB-293; 30 \u03bcM R848 for hTLR8-NF\u03baB-293; and 2.5 \u03bcM CpG-ODN 2006 for hTLR9-NF\u03baB-293. Media alone was used as negative control. After addition of controls and small molecules, the cell clones were additionally stimulated with the ECconcentration of the appropriate receptor-specific ligand.","To calculate the baseline response to the ECconcentration of the appropriate receptor-specific ligand, wells H3 and H6 did not receive receptor-specific ligand. The mean value of wells H2 and H5 (each with cells and ECconcentration of the appropriate receptor-specific ligand) divided by the mean of wells H3 and H6 (each with cells alone) yielded the baseline response (i.e., fold induction of luciferase activity) to ECconcentration of the appropriate receptor-specific ligand.","After 16 h stimulation the supernatant was removed and the cells treated with lysis buffer and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. before measuring.","An agonist screen was performed in parallel with the antagonist screen just described. The procedure was comparable to the antagonist screen except there was no addition of ECconcentration of receptor-specific ligand. The outcome of this screen reflected agonistic and toxicity effects.","Graphical Ranking System","For each screen result a graphical documentation was performed. A numerical score, describing the graphical results, was determined for each compound. For positive compounds either for antagonists or agonists or synergists the screen has been repeated at least twice.","Antagonists","The baseline result (measured with addition of the ECconcentration of the receptor-specific ligand) for each cell culture plate was measured as described above. Antagonistic effects were measured by down regulation compared to the baseline. Antagonists were scored as follows:\n\n","To detect agonist activity the cells were treated in the above described manner but without adding the ECconcentration of receptor-specific ligand after treatment of the cells with small molecules. Usually the baseline in the agonist screen is taken to be 1 because these cells have not been additionally stimulated with the ECconcentration of the receptor-specific ligand.

After an appropriate period, blood samples are obtained from control and experimental mice and evaluated for serum concentration of cytokine using a suitable method, e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Alternatively or in addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are isolated from both groups of animals and assessed for expression of activation marker using a suitable technique such as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Control and experimental results are compared in pairwise fashion. Reduced expression of activation marker or reduced concentration of cytokine in an experimental animal compared to a negative control animal indicates the small molecule inhibits TLR-mediated signaling in response to a ligand for the TLR. Increased expression of activation marker or increased concentration of cytokine in an experimental animal compared to a negative control animal indicates the small molecule promotes TLR-mediated signaling in response to a ligand for the TLR.","Experimental mice are administered candidate small molecules. Negative control mice are administered carrier alone. After administration or small molecule or carrier alone, PBMC are isolated and then exposed in vitro to CpG nucleic acid under conditions in which the PBMC, in the absence of small molecule, are stimulated to express an activation marker such as CD86 or secrete a product such as cytokine (e.g., IFN-\u03b1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) or chemokine (e.g., IP-10). The expression of the activation marker or the secretion of the product is quantified using FACS, ELISA, or other suitable method, and comparison is made between results obtained with and without the small molecule.
