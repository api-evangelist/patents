{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS","EXAMPLES","Example 1","Example 2","REFERENCES"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/849,253, filed Jan. 23, 2013, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.","This invention was made with government support under grant number DE-FG36-06GO86025 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The presently-disclosed subject matter relates to catalysts for converting syngas to liquid hydrocarbons. In particular, embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter relate to multi-functional catalysts that can convert syngas into liquid hydrocarbons and methods for using the catalysts.","Known catalysts and methods exist to convert synthesis gas (syngas) to fuels and chemicals. One exemplary method includes Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), but because FTS products are controlled by Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) polymerization kinetics, FTS does not provide for selective formation of hydrocarbons. Also, since the hydrocarbon products contain only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), oxygen (O) will be released as the byproducts of COand HO in the FTS process, thereby decreasing the overall efficiency of the process. To improve the overall efficiency, C, H, and O can be kept in the final products, thereby increasing the utilization of syngas. Another approach is to first convert syngas to methanol over a methanol synthesis catalyst, and subsequently polymerize methanol to hydrocarbons. These known methods generally utilize nitrogen-free syngas or low-level nitrogen syngas derived from natural gas or coal, pure syngas, or other low nitrogen syngas.","In this regard, some have attempted to utilize biomass to produce energy-related products such as electricity, fuels, heat, chemicals, and other materials. Biomass can be desirable because it can be renewable. However, because the syngas from biomass gasification can contain about 50 vol % to about 60 vol % N, the nitrogen content in biomass syngas is generally too high for hydrocarbon synthesis using existing technologies. For example, catalysts designed for the syngas-to-gasoline processes have low performance with such high nitrogen content, and the operation costs of syngas compression is a significant investment.","Additionally, while the syngas from biomass and other sources is fairly clean, some impurities, such as HS, NH, and O, do exist. Such impurities in the syngas can \u201cpoison\u201d the catalyst and thus reduce conversion efficiency. Generally, a qualified clean syngas should have minimal amounts of sulfurs, such as HS, COS, NH, and oxygen.","Accordingly, there remains a need for a high activity and high stability catalyst useful for converting syngas, including nitrogen-rich and\/or biomass derived syngas (bio-syngas), into hydrocarbons. There also remains a need for multi-functional catalysts for a single-stage syngas-to-hydrocarbon process that can be utilized with nitrogen-rich bio-syngas.","The details of one or more embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter are set forth in this document. Modifications to embodiments described in this document, and other embodiments, will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of the information provided in this document. The information provided in this document, and particularly the specific details of the described exemplary embodiments, is provided primarily for clearness of understanding and no unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom. In case of conflict, the specification of this document, including definitions, will control.","The presently-disclosed subject matter includes methods for producing liquid hydrocarbons from syngas. In some embodiments the method comprises obtaining syngas, optionally from biomass, and then contacting the syngas with a catalyst. The catalyst can then catalyze the production of liquid hydrocarbons. In some embodiments the catalyst can include a base material (support), a transition metal, and a promoter.","The term \u201cliquid hydrocarbons\u201d is used herein to refer to hydrocarbons that are in a liquid state at a particular temperature and pressure. In some embodiments liquid hydrocarbons are a liquid at 0\u00b0 C. and ambient pressure, and in other embodiments liquid hydrocarbons are liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. In some embodiments liquid hydrocarbons refer to any C hydrocarbon. In specific embodiments liquid hydrocarbons comprise about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms per molecule, and in other embodiments liquid hydrocarbons can comprise more than 20 carbons. Further still, in some embodiments liquid hydrocarbons do not include methane, ethane, propane, butane, or combinations thereof. Some embodiments of liquid hydrocarbons may or may not include C gasoline. Those of ordinary skill will appreciate that the hydrocarbons, including liquid hydrocarbons, can include straight or branched molecules as well as cyclic or acyclic molecules.","The terms hydrocarbon and liquid hydrocarbon are also inclusive of paraffins, olefins, aromatics, and oxygenates. More specifically, exemplary liquid hydrocarbons can be selected from higher alcohols, higher esters, higher ethers, higher aldehydes, higher ketones, higher alkanes, higher alkenes, higher cycloalkanes, higher cycloalkenes, aryls, fused aryls, and combinations thereof, wherein higher can refer to any molecule having 4 or more carbons. In some embodiments the liquid hydrocarbons, including the liquid hydrocarbons described above, are an oxygenate. The term \u201coxygenate\u201d is used herein to refer to a molecule having one or more oxygen atoms. In specific embodiments the liquid hydrocarbons produced by the present methods and catalysts comprise a range of about 5 wt % to about 80 wt % of oxygenates.","The \u201csynthesis gas\u201d (syngas) described herein is comprised primarily of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In some embodiments the syngas is obtained from a biomass, although the term syngas is used herein to refer to both syngas that is and syngas that is not obtained from biomass. Biomass can include, but is not limited to, plant derived materials as well as metabolic waste obtained from microbes and other animals. Exemplary sources of biomass also include, but are not limited to, agricultural wastes, corn stalks, straw, seed hulls, sugarcane leavings, bagasse, nutshells, manure, wood materials, municipal waste, including waste paper and yard clippings, and specific plants grown as biomass, such as poplars, willows, switch grass, alfalfa, prairie bluestream, corn, soybean, and the like.","In this regard, the syngas in certain instances includes syngas, or biosyngas, having a relatively high concentration of nitrogen compared to syngas that is obtained from natural gas or the like. In some embodiments the biosyngas can comprise about 1 vol %, 10 vol %, 20 vol %, 30 vol %, 40 vol %, 50 vol %, 60 vol %, or any value therebetween of nitrogen. Specific embodiments can also comprise syngas that includes about 1 vol %, 10 vol %, 20 vol %, 30 vol %, 40 vol %, or any value therebetween of carbon dioxide. For example, syngas that is obtained from a gasifier that is utilizing wood chips as the feedstock can produce a syngas comprising about 20% H, about 19% CO, about 12% CO, and about 49% N. Certain embodiments described herein have the superior and unexpected result of being capable of converting syngas with relatively high concentrations of nitrogen and\/or carbon dioxide into liquid hydrocarbons. Furthermore, certain embodiments described herein utilize a multi-functional catalyst (e.g., bifunctional catalyst) that can process syngas, including high-nitrogen content syngas (i.e., >20 vol %) in a single stage. On the other hand, known systems are relatively more complex, time-consuming, and expensive because high-nitrogen content syngas either cannot be processed into liquid hydrocarbons, or can only be processed into liquid hydrocarbons with two or more stages.","In some embodiments the syngas is reasonably suitable for producing liquid hydrocarbons without posing a risk of poising and reducing the conversion efficiency of the catalyst being used. On the other hand, in some embodiments the syngas comprises impurities that can poison a catalyst, such as HS, NH, and O. For example, syngas with about 0.5 wt % to about 1.0 wt % of oxygen, trace ammonia, sulfur, and\/or tar can poison certain catalysts and possibly cause them to prematurely become ineffective at catalyzing the production of liquid hydrocarbons.","In this regard, in some embodiments, the present method for producing liquid hydrocarbons further comprises a step of cleaning syngas that is known or suspected of having impurities that could potentially poison the catalysts. In some embodiments the cleaning step comprises passing the poisoning or potentially poisoning syngas through several reactors in series that are packed with different catalysts and\/or absorbents. Exemplary catalysts and absorbents include to active metals, such as copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), silver (Ag), and ruthenium (Rh). Exemplary catalysts and absorbents also include, but are not limited to, alumina-supported metal catalysts, 13X molsieve, active carbon, silica gel, and other high surface area materials. In specific embodiment the syngas after the cleaning step and\/or from the obtaining step qualifies for total sulfurs (HS+COS) of less than 10 ppb, NHof less than 1 ppm, and oxygen of less than 1 ppm.","As stated above, the present catalysts can comprise a base material, a transition metal, and a promoter. In some embodiments the base material is selected from a zeolite, iron, a zeolite-iron material, a cobalt-molybdenum material, a cobalt-molybdenum carbide, or a combination thereof. The zeolite can include known zeolites, and in some embodiments the zeolite can be selected from ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-35, ZSM-48, ZSM-57, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments the zeolite is selected from a type Y zeolite.","The transition metals described herein also include salts, water-soluble halides, nitrates, amines, sulfates, acetates, carbonates, phosphates, or the like of the transition metal. Similarly, the present promoters can include alkali metals, including oxides, hydroxides, nitrates, chlorides, carbonates, sulfates, or the like of an alkali metal.","In certain embodiments the catalyst comprises a zeolite-iron base material. Specific embodiments can comprise about 40 wt % to about 80 wt % of the zeolite molecular sieve. Specific embodiments can also comprise about 2.0 wt % to about 40 wt %, 2.0 wt % to about 15.0 wt %, or about 5.0 wt % to about 15.0 wt % of iron. Both zeolite and iron comprise the zeolite-iron base material of a catalyst. The zeolite-iron base material can be prepared with different processes. For instance, the zeolite-iron base material can be prepared by precipitating iron directly onto the above-described zeolite. In other embodiments iron introduced into the zeolite by an impregnation or incipient of a transition metal. Thus, in some embodiments the catalyst comprises a base material that includes iron deposited (e.g., by precipitation) on a zeolite.","In other embodiments the zeolite-iron base material can be prepared by mixing iron oxide nanostructures with the zeolite. With regard to the iron oxide nanostructures, the term \u201cnanostructure\u201d is used herein to refer to any iron oxide structure that can be measured on a nanoscale (i.e., about 1 nm to about 999 nm). In other embodiments the catalyst comprises a base material that includes iron oxide nanostructures that are mixed with a zeolite. The iron oxides for use in exemplary catalysts include known and commercially available iron oxide nanostructures. In other embodiments, the present methods include preparing iron oxide nanostructures by a method selected from a sol-gel method, a hydrothermal method, an impregnation method, and a micro-emulsion method.","The present catalysts can also include a transition metal. For the zeolite-iron base material, the transition metal can be transferred directly to the base material. Exemplary methods for transferring (e.g., depositing and\/or ion-exchanging) transition metals to the zeolite-iron material include one or more of a impregnation method, an ion exchange method, a hydrothermal ion exchange method, a solid state ion exchange method, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, or another suitable method. In some embodiments the transition metal is added to a zeolite material before the addition of iron. Thus, in certain instances iron can be added to a zeolite to form a zeolite-iron base material by precipitating iron directly onto a transition metal containing zeolite. In yet other embodiments, iron is added to a zeolite to form a zeolite-iron base material by physically mixing iron oxide nanostructures with a zeolite that includes the transition metal.","The transition metal of a catalyst can be selected based on factors including the liquid hydrocarbon that is desired, reaction conditions, or the like. In some embodiments the transition metal for use with a zeolite-iron base material is selected from platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir), rhodium (Rh), molybdenum (Mo), cobalt (Co), and combinations thereof. Furthermore, the transition metals can be in the form of, but are not limited to, salts, water-soluble halides, nitrates, amine complexes, sulfates, acetates, carbonates, phosphates, or combinations thereof.","In some embodiments the incorporation of a transition metal in the catalyst can provide increased gasoline range hydrocarbon production. Likewise, the concentration of transition metal can be selected based on a various factors. Embodiments of the present catalysts can include about 0.1 wt % to about 10 wt % of a transition metal.","To prepare a catalyst that comprises transition metals, in some embodiments the transition metal is deposited on a zeolite, as described above, and then the mixture is calcined. In a specific embodiment the mixture of the transition metal and the zeolite is calcined at about 400\u00b0 C. In another specific embodiment the mixture of the transition metal and the zeolite is calcined for about 3 hours to about 5 hours. The resulting material can be crushed and pelletized to tablets for use as a catalyst in a method of producing liquid hydrocarbons.","Further still, in some embodiments the present catalysts comprise a cobalt-molybdenum material as the base material. More specifically, in some embodiments the base material includes a cobalt-molybdenum carbide material. The cobalt of the base material can be obtained from cobalt-containing chemicals, such as those selected from cobalt chloride, cobalt(II) acetate, cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate, cobalt(II) acetylacetonate, cobalt(II) carbonate hydrate, cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate, cobalt(II) sulfate heptahydrate, cobalt(II,III) oxide, and the like. Furthermore, in some embodiments the molybdenum is obtained from molybdenum-containing chemicals, such as those selected from molybdenum(V) chloride, molybdenum hexacarbonyl, ammonium heptamolybdate, molybdenum(VI) tetrachloride oxide, molybdenum(VI) oxide, molybdenum(II) acetate dimer, and the like.","Embodied bimetallic cobalt-molybdenum (Co\u2014Mo) carbide base materials have varying compositions. Exemplary Co\u2014Mo carbide base materials can comprise about 5 wt % to about 15 wt % cobalt. Exemplary Co\u2014Mo carbide base materials can comprise about 5 wt % to about 25 wt % molybdenum. Exemplary Co\u2014Mo carbide base materials can also comprise about 20 wt % to about 45 wt % carbon. While those of ordinary skill will appreciate that the composition of specific base materials can vary, specific exemplary embodiments of the bimetallic Co\u2014Mo carbide base materials include 5 wt % Co, 25 wt % Mo, and 70 wt % carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 10 wt % Co, 25 wt % Mo, and 65 wt % carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 15 wt % Co, 25 wt % Mo, and 40 wt % carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 20 wt % Co, 25 wt % Mo, and 55 wt % carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 15 wt % Co, 15 wt % Mo, and 70 wt % carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 15 wt % Co, 10 wt % Mo, and 75 wt % carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 15 wt % Co, 5 wt % Mo, and 80 wt % carbon.","In some embodiments the novel cobalt-molybdenum carbide base material is prepared by carburization of metal precursors (e.g., Co\u2014Mo precursor) with carbon at high temperature. This can be done by a variety of processes, including, but not limited to, a two-stage reaction method developed by Newsam, a temperature programmed nitridation and topotactic carburization process, a thermal carburization process, or a direct carburization process. In one embodiment the bimetallic Co\u2014Mo precursors were supported on carbon and prepared using a one-step incipient wetness and\/or a co-precipitation method.","In some embodiments the bimetallic cobalt-molybdenum carbide base material can be prepared using a carbothermal reduction (CR) method or a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) method. The carbothermal reduction method includes the process of using helium or nitrogen as a carrier gas passed through the sample, and the reduction reaction utilizes carbon as the reductant at elevated temperature. Following the reduction process, the carbidization reaction between the reduced metal and carbon usually occurs to form transitional metal carbides. In this manner, carbothermal reduction (CR) methods can prepare embodiments of the present metal carbides. For the case of molybdenum trioxide, the following shows the reduction (1) and carbidization (2) reactions that can form MoC.\n\nMoO+3C=Mo+3CO\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n2Mo+C=MoC\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In some embodiments the bimetallic cobalt-molybdenum carbide material can be prepared using a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) method. Hydrogen flows through the sample during the CHR process. In CHR, the reduction reaction uses hydrogen as the reductant at elevated temperature. Following the reduction process, the carbidization reaction between the reduced transitional metal and carbon occurs to form transitional metal carbides. For the case of molybdenum trioxide, the following shows the reduction (3) and carbidization (4) reactions that can for form MoC.\n\nMoO+3H=Mo+3HO\u2003\u2003(3)\n\n2Mo+C=MoC\u2003\u2003(4)\n","The carbon of the Co\u2014Mo carbide base material can be derived from commercially-available carbons and\/or home-synthesized carbons. Exemplary carbon resources include active carbons, carbon blacks, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, fullerenes, graphene, graphite, bio-char, other carbon-containing materials, and combinations thereof.","As described above, the present catalysts can include a transition metal. For some embodiments of catalysts that include a cobalt-molybdenum base material, the transition metal can be selected from iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), vanadium (V), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), Ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir) and Rhodium (Rh), and combinations thereof. The transition metals can be in the form of, but are not limited to, salts, water-soluble halides, nitrates, amine complexes, sulfates, acetates, carbonates, phosphates, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments of the present catalysts include a cobalt-molybdenum base material and about 0.1 wt % to about 10 wt % of a transition metal. The transition metal can be added to a cobalt-molybdenum base material, or the other base materials, using the above-described methods.","In some embodiments the catalyst can further comprises a promoter in addition to the base material and, optionally, the transition metal. A promoter can be an alkali metal. Exemplary promoters include substances selected from lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and combinations thereof. A promoter can also include an oxide, a hydroxide, a nitrate, a chloride, a carbonate, and\/or a sulfate of the one or more alkali metals. In an exemplary embodiment the promoter is potassium hydroxide.","In some embodiments, the catalyst incorporates a promoter by an impregnation process. The concentration of a promoter will vary depending on the particular catalyst. Exemplary catalysts can include about 0.5 wt % to about 10.0 wt % of a promoter. In one particular embodiment the promoter is the last material added to form the catalyst. In some embodiments, the catalyst if formed by providing a zeolite, adding a transition metal to the zeolite, adding iron and\/or iron oxide nanostructures to the zeolite, and then adding the promoter. In other embodiments the catalyst is formed by providing a cobalt-molybdenum precursor, processing the precursor to form cobalt-molybdenum carbide, adding a transition metal to the cobalt-molybdenum carbine, and then adding the promoter.","The temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of the syngas can be tuned in the contacting step to yield desirable liquid hydrocarbons. In some embodiments the contact step is performed at about 250\u00b0 C. to about 400\u00b0 C. In some embodiments the pressure in the contacting step can be about 400 psi to about 1500 psi. Furthermore, in some embodiments the contacting step is performed with the syngas having a GHSV of about 1,000to about 10,000. In a specific embodiment the catalyst is such that increasing the temperature and\/or pressure of the reaction generally increases carbon monoxide conversion, whereas increasing GHSV generally decreases carbon monoxide conversion. The temperature, pressure, and space velocity used when producing liquid hydrocarbons can also affect the distribution of the particular hydrocarbons that are produced.","In some methods, one or more of the temperature, pressure, space velocity, and composition of the catalyst are adjusted so that the resulting liquid hydrocarbon mixture products have a particular composition and distribution. In some embodiments the parameters are adjusted so as to yield different liquid hydrocarbon products ranging from a light gasoline boiling point range, to a diesel fuel, to a jet fuel. In some embodiments, the catalyst catalyzes the conversion of nitrogen-rich (e.g., >20%) syngas to a liquid hydrocarbon mixture enriched with a C hydrocarbon fraction at low pressure. Embodiments of the present methods can be more efficient and more economical than traditional Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts.","The presently-disclosed subject matter is further illustrated by the following specific but non-limiting examples. Some of the following examples are prophetic, notwithstanding the numerical values, results and\/or data referred to and contained in the examples. Additionally, the following examples may include compilations of data that are representative of data gathered at various times during the course of development and experimentation related to the present invention.","This Example describes processes for making and characterizing embodiments of the present catalysts. In particular, this Example describes how to make certain iron and\/or zeolite-containing catalysts, and also characterizes their ability to process synthesis gas.","An amount of 9.4 g of PdClwas dissolved in 200 mL of deionized (DI) water and stirred for 2 hours. Then 50 g of ZSM-5 zeolite powder was added to the PdClsolution, and HSOwas added in a dropwise fashion until the solution had 4.0 pH. The mixture was transferred into a 500 ml autoclave and maintained at 105-120\u00b0 C. for 8-20 hours. The product was evaporated and oven-dried at 110\u00b0 C. for 12 hours, then the mixture was calcined at 400\u00b0 C. for 3 hours.","The obtained Pd-ZSM-5 was added to an aqueous solution containing 95 g of ferric nitrate in 500 ml of water, and the mixture was stirred at 80\u00b0 C. for 12 hours. The brown products were dried at 110\u00b0 C. for 5 hours, then the dried mixture was calcined at 400\u00b0 C. for 5 hours. An amount of 125 mL of 2.5 wt % KOH solution was added to the resulting Fe\/Pd-ZSM-5 mixture, the promoted catalyst was calcined at 300\u00b0 C. for 2 hours, and then crushed and pelletized to tablets under 15 tons of force.","The synthesis gas conversion reaction was carried out in a micro-reactor of a fixed bed flow system. Three (3) grams of the catalyst were loaded to the reactor. The system was first purged by a helium flow for 30 minutes, followed by prereducing with a syngas mixture at 400\u00b0 C. for 8 hours, then syngas was fed in until reaching the desired pressure with a slow adjustment of the system to the desired temperature. The reaction was operated under the following conditions: 250-400\u00b0 C., a gas volume hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 500 to 5,000 h, and a pressure of 500-1500 psi.","To observe the effect of temperature on the catalyst performance, temperatures studied were conducted at 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, and 350\u00b0 C. Table 1 shows the variation of CO conversion and C\u02dcC selectivity at various temperatures and with the other variables remaining constant. Table 1 shows that temperature influenced CO conversion was very important. CO conversion increased from 55% at 290\u00b0 C. to 83% at 350\u00b0 C. Table 1 also shows that the hydrocarbon distribution changed with temperature, with the light hydrocarbons being favored at higher temperatures. Higher hydrocarbons were relatively more sensitive to temperature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Effect of temperature on CO conversion, COand hydrocarbon"},{"entry":"selectivity, hydrocarbon distribution, and liquid hydrocarbon"},{"entry":"distribution at 1000 psig, with syngas of 19.0% H, 20.0% CO, "},{"entry":"12.0% CO, 1.921% CH, balance N, and GHSV of 2000 h, "},{"entry":"where 3 g of catalyst was used in the reaction.

Example describes processes for making and characterizing embodiments of the present catalysts. In particular, this Example describes how to make certain cobalt-molybdenum (Co\u2014Mo) based catalysts, and also characterizes their ability to process synthesis gas.","To first prepare the bimetallic Co\u2014Mo precursors, an aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and cobalt nitrate was prepared with a Co\/Mo molar ratio 1:1. This aqueous solution was prepared by adding 7.36 g of ammonium heptamolybdate to 20 mL DI water. The solution was heated to 80\u00b0 C. and stirred until a clear, transparent solution was obtained. The solution was then cooled to 40\u00b0 C., where 12.12 g of cobalt nitrate were added to the ammonium heptamolybdate solution. The mixture was stirred until a transparent solution was obtained. The obtained bimetallic salt solution then was added in a dropwise fashion to a beaker containing 10 g of active carbon support and stirred continuously. The impregnation step lasted until removal of the solvent at 80\u00b0 C. by evaporation. The mass obtained was further dried at 110\u00b0 C. for 12 hours.","Next, the bimetallic CoMo carbide was formed from this mass by carbothermal reduction (CR) and carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) processes. The dried Co\u2014Mo (1\/1 molar ratio) over active carbon precursors were transferred to a quartz reactor (1 inch O.D.). A tubular electrical furnace controlled by a temperature program was used to heat the reactor. The amount of the sample was about 20-200 g\/batch. The sample was first heated at 300\u00b0 C. in helium flowing at 500 mL\/min for 2 hours to obtain CoMoO. The temperature was then ramped to 700 to 1100\u00b0 C. with a heating rate of 1-100\u00b0 C.\/min under either flowing helium (100-1000 mL\/min) or pure H(100-1000 mL\/min). The final temperature (700-1100\u00b0 C.) was held for 2 hours. The sample was quenched (trace of the oxygen in nitrogen reacted with surface Co\u2014Mo carbide) (100-1000 mL\/min) for 2 hours at room temperature.","Furthermore, for certain exemplary embodiments at least one additional transitional metal was selected as active component of the catalyst. The additional metals were selected from the salts of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), vanadium (V), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir), and rhodium (Rh). The additional transitional contents were introduced into the catalyst system by employing an impregnation or incipient of the Co\u2014Mo carbide by a salt solution. The salts of the transitional metals could be nitrates, chlorides, oxides, or hydroxides. The additional metal contents could also be added using prepared nanostructured metal particles by a physical mixing process. After introducing the additional transitional metals, the mixture was first dried in an oven and then was calcined under a nitrogen flow in a one-inch quartz tube reactor. The loading of the additional transitional metals was between 0.1 and 10 percent by weight.","For this Example, an exemplary catalyst was formed by dissolving 0.5 g of palladium chloride in 10 mL DI water. The solution of PdClwas drop-wisely added to 10 g of Co\u2014Mo bimetallic carbide obtained from the carbothermal reduction (CR) and a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) processes, and was stirred continually. The impregnation step lasted until removal of the water solvent at 80\u00b0 C. by evaporation. The sample obtained was further dried at 110\u00b0 C. overnight.","Next, alkali metals in the form of oxides, hydroxides, nitrates, chlorides, carbonates, or sulfates were doped to certain samples of the Co\u2014Mo bimetallic carbide. The alkali metals included lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), and caesium (Cs). Thus, the catalyst prepared with or without impregnating with transition metals (e.g., palladium) could be further promoted with 1-15 wt % alkali metals by am impregnation method. The final obtained multifunctional catalyst was first calcined under nitrogen atmosphere at 350\u00b0 C. for 3 hours, and was then crushed and pelletized to tablets.","For this Example, an exemplary catalyst was formed by dissolving 0.5 g of potassium hydroxide in 10 mL DI water. The solution of KOH was added dropwise to the Pd-impregnated catalyst, and was stirred continually. The impregnation step lasted until removal of the water solvent at 80\u00b0 C. by evaporation. The sample obtained was further dried at 110\u00b0 C. overnight.","To observe the effect of temperature on the catalyst performance, the ability of the catalyst to convert syngas to liquid hydrocarbons and oxygenates was observed at temperatures between 200\u00b0 C. and 450\u00b0 C. The synthesis gas conversion reaction was carried out in a micro-reactor of a fixed bed flow system. Three (3) grams of the bimetallic CoMo catalyst that was Pd-impregnated and promoted with KOH was loaded to the reactor. The system was first purged by a helium flow for 30 minutes, followed by pre-reducing with a mixture gas of N-H(1\/1) at 400\u00b0 C. for 8 hours, then syngas was fed in until reaching the desired pressure with slow adjustment of the system to the desired temperature. The reaction was operated under the following conditions: 200\u00b0 C. to 450\u00b0 C., a gas volume hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 500 to 5,000 h, and a pressure of 200 psi to 1200 psi.","Thus, to examine temperature effects, three (3) grams of the catalyst sample were loaded to a half-inch (\u00bd\u2033) stainless steel reactor.
