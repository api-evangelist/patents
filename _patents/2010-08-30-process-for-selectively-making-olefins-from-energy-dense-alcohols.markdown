Dehydration of butanol isomers (including 1-butanol, 2-butanol and isobutanol) produce butenes (including 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and isobutene) which are highly valuable starting materials for chemical industries to make synthetic fuels, lubricants and other high value chemicals. For examples, 1-butene is used in the creation of high density polyethylene as well as linear low density polyethylene. 2-butene is an extremely valuable starting material for lubricants as well as agricultural chemicals. In olefin metathesis, 2-butene reacts with ethylene to form propylene. Isobutene is the starting material for butyl rubber, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and isooctane. In addition, synthetic petroleum kerosene (SPK) can be synthesized by oligomerization of 4-carbon olefins. Unlike dehydration of butanol in the prior art, this invention is an oxidative process (i.e., combustion). The combustion of 1-butanol is extremely exothermic and occurs via Equation 1 shown below. This heat production enables the reaction to perform auto-thermally. As a result, the catalytic reaction is activated to reach an authermal reaction temperature of 330\u00b0 C. to 600\u00b0 C. when the reactant stream (butanol vapor and oxygen) is preheated at approximately 200\u00b0 C. In contrast, traditional dehydration process requires external heating to maintain catalyst temperature at about 300\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C.\n\nCHCHCHCHOH+6O\u21924CO+5HO \u0394H=\u22122713 kJ\/mol\u2003\u2003(1)\n","In a combustion process, the equivalence ratio (\u03c6) of a system, defined herein as the ratio of the fuel-to-air\/oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-air\/oxidizer ratio, plays an important role in fuel conversion. Mathematically, the equivalence ratio is represented as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03d5",{}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["fuel","to","oxidizer","ratio"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":"-"},{"mtext":"-"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]},"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["fuel","to","oxidizer","ratio"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":"-"},{"mtext":"-"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}},"mi":"st"}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["m","fuel"]},{"mi":["m","ox"]}],"mo":"\/"},"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["m","fuel"]},{"mi":["m","ox"]}],"mo":"\/"}},"mi":"st"}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["n","fuel"]},{"mi":["n","ox"]}],"mo":"\/"},"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["n","fuel"]},{"mi":["n","ox"]}],"mo":"\/"}},"mi":"st"}}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"where, m represents the mass, n represents number of moles, and suffix st stands for stoichiometric conditions.","The \u03c6-value can be controlled by adjusting the amounts of fuel and\/or oxygen that are reacted. Having a \u03c6-value of unity (1) signifies a stoichiometric feed of fuel and air, as shown in the above equations. With reactions having high \u03c6-values (i.e., values ranging from 0.75 to 3), the reaction is considered \u201cfuel rich\u201d and incomplete combustion occurs because not enough oxygen exists to combust the fuel. However, reactions having low \u03c6-values (i.e., values ranging from 0 to 0.75) indicate reactions having a \u201cfuel lean\u201d environment with plenty of oxygen to oxidize the fuel into its combustion products: carbon dioxide and water.","The production of olefins from hydrocarbons is well known in the prior art. In particular, Patent Application Publication US2002\/0087042 to Schmidt et al. teaches a process whereby ethane auto-thermally decomposes to form ethene. See also U.S. Pat. No. 6,566,573. However, this process only converts alkanes to mainly two and three carbon olefins, which are not as desirable as four carbon olefins to oligomerize into gasolines, jet fuels, diesel fuels or lubricants.","Patent Application Publications US 2008\/0131948 and US 2008\/0234523, both to Manzer et al., teach processes for converting dry and aqueous 2-butanol directly to isooctenes. However, these processes were carried out as batch processes, which are not favorable as a continuous flow reactor. Additionally, the butanol conversions were as high as 75%, but their selectivity into the desired iso-octenes was generally very low, which would create only a small product yield (yield=conversion\u00d7selectivity).","Patent Application Publications US 2008\/0132730 and US 2008\/0132732, both to Manzer et al., teach a process for producing butenes from dry and aqueous 2-butanol. In particular, US 2008\/0132732 discusses achieving 100% conversion and 100% selectivity of a 70 wt % mixture of butanol. However, the reactions were carried out in a pressurized batch reactor (2 mL vials), making continual production impossible. Additionally, in US 2008\/0132730, the selectivity and conversion of dry butanol was not as high, achieving only 75% conversion, and 100% selectivity. Both of these approaches used sulfuric acid (liquid) as the catalyst, which must then be separated from the liquid reactants, consequently adding another step. This implies frequent replacement of the catalyst, which would be expensive. These processes were also carried out in a pressurized batch reactor.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a process for selectively converting four-carbon liquid alcohols to olefins, comprising providing a supply of oxygen gas, providing the alcohols, atomizing the alcohols, evaporating the alcohols to produce a fuel vapor, mixing the vapor with oxygen to form a fuel mixture, and reacting the fuel mixture in the presence of a solid heterogeneous catalysts of Rh\/AlOand\/or AlO.","Additionally, the alcohols are selected from any one of pure 1-butanols, pure 2-butanols, and pure isobutanols.","The olefins produced comprise Catoms with a selectivity of greater than 90% and a total conversion greater than 95%. Further, the olefins are selected from 1-butenes, cis-2-butenes, trans-2-butenes, and isobutenes.","Additionally, the alcohols are atomized by an electrostatic injection device through electrospray in any one of cone-jet mode, multi jet mode, and charge injection mode. Further, the alcohol droplets are evaporated by a heat tape on the outside of the reactor.","The alcohols have a flow rate of less than 10 milliliters per hour during electrospray and a pressure of less than 10 psig.","The process further includes adjusting operating conditions to selectively produce varying four-carbon olefins. Specifically, the operating conditions include a contact time of said fuel mixture with a catalyst, a temperature of the catalyst, and an equivalence ratio. Preferably, the contact time is in a range from about 145 ms to less than 550 ms, the temperature is in a range from about 330\u00b0 C. to less than 600\u00b0 C. and the equivalence ratio is in a range from about 0.15 to less than 18.","According to another embodiment herein provides a process to produce a butene product with a yield of 93% from a four carbon butanol-containing feed stream, the process comprising contacting the feed stream with a catalyst, consisting essentially of alumina monolith foam with Rh gamma-alumina, to produce the butene product. The reaction occurs in a continuous flow reactor operated at a temperature between about 330\u00b0 C. to less than 600\u00b0 C. Further, an equivalence ratio of the feed stream is in a range from about 0.15 to less than 18 and a contact time of the catalyst with the feed stream is in a range from about 145 ms to less than 550 ms.","The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of ordinary skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.","The embodiments described herein provide methods that include selective catalytic combustion and electrospray technologies to convert liquid butanol fuel in a continuous flow reactor to a variety of olefin products.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["900","920","950","930","940","960","990"]},"It is to be appreciated, however, that the cylindrical shape of the reactor  may have alternative shapes and sizes. Following from the direction of gas intake , which for purposes of the embodiment described herein, is the top of the reactor , grounded mesh  is disposed below a droplet source (not shown) extending from and coupled to an electrostatic fuel injection device . Further, grounded mesh  is located at an approximate distance of 1 cm below the droplet source in order to have a large enough distance for the droplet to evaporate yet small enough distance to sustain the electrospray at a low voltage (e.g., 3500 V for single nozzle electrospray without an extractor electrode). Thus, the larger the distance between the droplet source and a grounded mesh, the more voltage or power that is needed. Pure oxygen gas or air is introduced through gas intake  and the effluent gas is released and sent to a gas chromatograph (GC) (not shown) through the bottom of the reactor . Additionally, liquid fuel is introduced into the stainless steel tube of the reactor  via a liquid pump (not shown). It is to be appreciated that the liquid fuel can include various types of energy dense fuels, including but not limited to butanols. Once introduced, the fuel is electrostatically atomized by creating a voltage difference between the droplet source and a grounded mesh  (e.g. 3500 V for single nozzle electrospray without an extractor electrode). Preferably, the fuel is electrosprayed using electrospraying techniques well known in the art, such as, for example, cone-jet mode, in order to ultimately assist with obtaining an optimum droplet size (e.g., 6 microns) and flow rate of less than 4 milliliters per hour per nozzle. Further, the electrospray injection device  requires minimal power of approximately 0.35 mW per nozzle. It is to be appreciated that other well known electrospraying techniques may be employed, such as, for example, multi jet mode, or charge injection, however, the present invention is not limited thereto.","The foam mixing system  is a layer of alumina located below the grounded mesh  to aid in the mixing of the fuel vapor and any incoming oxygen gas. Additionally, the grounded mesh  is perpendicular to the direction of the droplet trajectory in order to create an electric field between it and the electrostatic field injection device . Sufficient heat (e.g., less than 10 degrees above the boiling point of the fuel) was supplied via a heating tape on the outside of the reactor  to apply heat to the grounded mesh  to ensure complete evaporation or vaporization of the liquid fuel. The same heating tape also preheats the reactant stream (vaporized fuel and oxygen) to approximately 200\u00b0 C. During start-up conditions, the pre-heating is achieved by the heating tape or an active heating element, while during operation, heat may be provided passively by heat reclamation processes. It is to be noted that any heating tape well known in the art may be utilized.","The catalyst material  is a solid material that is placed between two inert, porous alumina foams  that act as heat shields and also serve as an additional mixing layer to ensure uniform fuel vapor concentration over the entire catalyst surface. A foam catalyst containing either an AlOfoam or Rh\/AlOfoam or both can be used as the catalyst which will be described in further detail below. For purposes of description, the Rh\/AlOfoam (5 mm thick) contained 0.061 g of Rhodimum (Rh) and was prepared in a manner detailed in the text \u201cRhodimum Supported on Thermally Enhanced Zeolite as Catalysts for Fuel Reformation of Jet Fuels,\u201d Vol. 136 Catalysis Today p. 258-265 (2008) by Ivan C. Lee, which is incorporated herein by reference. The alumina monolith foam (80 pores per inch, 17 mm diameter, 5 mm thick) was coated with \u03b3-alumina to roughen the foam surface and to increase the surface area. Then, the foam was calcined in a box furnace at 973 K for 15 hours. An aqueous Rh(NO)solution was further added to the foam, and the resultant foam was calcined in the box furnace at approximately 973 K for a subsequent 15 hours. The contact time between the catalyst, fuel, and oxygen as well as the flow rate is dependent upon the thickness of the catalyst. That is, the thicker the catalyst material or smaller the flowrate, the greater the increase in contact time. Thus, as expressed in a formula, contact time=thickness (of the catalyst material)\/flow rate.","Next, a general explanation of the converted products will be given in further detail according to experiments conducted with reference to the embodiments of the invention. This explanation is intended to be illustrative of the invention but is not meant to be construed as limiting the reasonable scope of the invention.","An air tight seal was placed around the reactor  and the GC (not shown). The amounts of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, acetylene, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butane, 1-butene, isobutene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene were monitored by an Agilent 4-channel micro-GC (not shown). Before each new iteration of fuel intake, nitrogen was first passed through the reactor  in order to clear out any lingering gases, to ensure that no leaks existed, and to ensure that no residual oxygen was present. After the appropriate nitrogen and oxygen flow rates were introduced according to the contact time and equivalence ratio, the grounded mesh  and catalyst  temperatures were allowed to equilibrate. Typical steady state temperature of the ground mesh  is about 2-10\u00b0 C. above the boiling point of the specific butanol. When the fuel flow is introduced (atomized and vaporized), chemical reaction occurs on the catalyst . As a result, the catalyst  temperature rises. The catalyst  temperatures were again allowed to reach a steady state operating autothermal temperature (e.g. ranging from 330\u00b0 C. to 600\u00b0 C.) and the GC recorded the gas composition during this time. The overall contact time of the catalyst  with the fuel, nitrogen and oxygen ranged between 145 ms to 550 ms. The equivalence ratio \u03c6 was varied utilizing both the Rh\/AlOand AlOfoam catalysts, ranging from 0.18-18, thereby providing different products with three distinct regimes. For example, as shown in , in 1-butanol combustion utilizing the Rh\/AlOfoam catalyst, for the equivalence ratio \u03c6<1, carbon dioxide and water were selectively produced (i.e., with 100% carbon selectivity, a conversion >95%, and a yield >95%). Additionally, under the same conditions, hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields were minimal. It is to be noted that selectivity is defined herein as how many atoms are converted to some other product and yield is expressed as conversion\u00d7selectivity which will be discussed in further detail below.","The fuel conversion was determined by analyzing exhaust gas composition with the flame ionization detector of a second GC. A HP-INNOWAX column was employed to quantify polar molecules including 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, methanol, acetone, and acetaldehyde wherein conversion is defined by:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"Conversion","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":["amount","of","remaining","butanol"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]},{"mi":["original","amount","of","butanol"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}}},"The carbon selectivity was defined as the number of carbon atoms in a product species, divided by the total number of carbon atoms in all the product species.

Like combustion of 1-butanol, there are 3 distinct regimes in presence of Rh (). Complete combustion occurs for equivalence ratios less than 1, and almost 100% of the carbons are found in carbon dioxide. At \u03c6=1, the selectivity of carbon monoxide rises as that of carbon dioxide decreases. Finally, for \u03c6>10, olefin production becomes prominent as nearly 90% of the carbons leave the reactor as an olefin. The major olefin products were 1-butene, cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene. At \u03c6=6.99, the carbon selectivity of 1-butene, cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene were 25.1%, 35.8% and 26.2%, respectively. At \u03c6=17.5, the carbon selectivity of 1-butene, cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene were 27.4%, 38.8% and 25.9%, respectively. At these equivalence ratios, the 2-butene (including cis- and trans-) are produced with over 50% selectivity. In absence of Rh, there is only olefin production regime (). The major olefin products were 1-butene, cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene. At \u03c6=6.33, the carbon selectivity of 1-butene, cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene were 35.2%, 35.8% and 25.3%, respectively. Therefore, both Rh\/AlOan AlOproduce 2-butenes (including cis- and trans-) as the preferred olefins. In particular, Rh\/AlOis the preferred catalyst for cis-2-butene production from 2-butanol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 7"],"sub":["2","3 ","2","3 ","2","3 ","2","3 "]},"The 3-regime operation of Rh\/AlOcatalyst for combustion of butanol isomers (1-butanol, 2-butanol and isobutanol) is beneficial to provide hot combustion gas to regenerate the reactor with AlOcatalyst. One possible schematic process diagram is shown in , where Rh\/AlOand AlOcatalysts may both be used. It is very common for a reactor to become less efficient as it ages. Catalyst fouling with carbon deposit is one of the main causes for such aging. ,  and  demonstrate that complete combustion of butanol occurs when \u03c6<1. Therefore, one can feed the butanol to the reactor with Rh\/AlOto generate hot gas (COand water) with excess oxygen. This hot mixture passes to the fouled reactor with AlOas catalyst during the regeneration process. Alternatively, cis-2-butene production with Rh\/AlOcatalyst can be self-regenerated by changing the equivalence ratio. In summary, the total selectivities for 1-butanol and isobutanol are almost identical over the range of equivalence ratios studied. However, 2-butanol produces olefins with a much higher selectivity for all equivalence ratios larger than 2. If total olefins are what is desired, then 2-butanol has the advantage, but if a particular butene is desired, then 1-butanol or isobutanol would be the better choice because they selectively produce one butene rather than multiple butenes.","Lastly, the multi-regime capability of Rh\/AlOprovides an additional advantage.
