Then, a description is given by taking as an example an image display system using a plurality of image display terminals.","(Example of image display system using liquid-crystal projector)","FIGS. (A) and (B) include diagrams showing image display in a case where image display is performed in a distributed manner, wherein FIG. (A) is a diagram showing a case in which only one liquid-crystal projector is used, and FIG. (B) is a diagram showing an example of image display using four liquid-crystal projectors.","In the case where image display is performed by one liquid-crystal projector, in a PC which supplies image data to the liquid-crystal projector, UXGA display, i.e., a display of 1600\u00d71200 pixels, is possible. However, in a state in which the liquid-crystal projector supports an XGA display, that is, only up to a display of 1024\u00d7768 pixels is supported by the projector, there is a case in which the pointer indicates a coordinate (1500, 920) at which display cannot be performed by a liquid-crystal projector  in accordance with the instruction by the person giving the presentation although the coordinate can be displayed by the PC.","In such a case, as shown in FIG. (A), in practice, it is impossible for the liquid-crystal projector to produce the display. For this reason, since the pointer does not move as operated by the person giving the presentation, a situation may occur in which an effective presentation cannot be given.","To avoid such a situation, as shown in FIG. (B), by using four liquid-crystal projectors, four images - to - may be projected in a shared manner so that the display area whose display is supported by a PC can be supported.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00143","num":"00143"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","1","200","4"]},"Basically, in the case where one image is displayed in a shared manner, it is necessary to determine in advance which apparatus should be in charge of which range. Dividing a particular image spatially and displaying the images by using four liquid-crystal projectors are typical parallel processes. At a stage in which image data is created by using application software for a processing device for creating image data, when parallel syntax suitable for such a parallel process are described in advance, this is convenient from a processing point of view. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 6-4498 discloses a method of writing parallel execution units contained in \u201ccobegin and coend\u201d and translating them, and this method may also be applied to this embodiment.","FIGS. (A) and (B) include schematic diagrams showing a communication method in the case where a virtual machine  is used, wherein FIG. (A) is a diagram showing a conventional communication method, and FIG. (B) is a diagram showing a communication method according to this embodiment.","In the case where the virtual machine  is merely provided in the liquid-crystal projector  in order to perform dynamic distributed processing, it is necessary to create application software, that is, an application-layer program , by fully considering as to which liquid-crystal projector  should be in charge of which drawing area at the stage in which the application-layer program  is created.","Generally, in order that particular execution units in a program be processed in parallel, the following two conditions must be satisfied. First, it is necessary for the processing system for a target program, including the OS, to have certain program blocks, in other words, resources capable of executing execution units in parallel, and more specifically, to have an independent processor unit corresponding to the number of parallelizations. Second, it is necessary that the target program itself have processing units which can be executed in parallel and that the program be described in such a manner that the processing units can be determined by the processing system.","In this embodiment, \u201cdistributed execution\u201d is a broad concept of parallel execution. Among cases in which a particular processing unit to be processed is distributed to another processing system and is executed thereby, a special case in which processing is preferably performed in parallel in terms of time and the results must be synchronized at a particular time is called \u201cparallel execution\u201d.","For example, as shown in FIG. (A), in the case where two liquid-crystal projectors - and - are connected to each other by an IEEE 802.3 bus , from an image point of view, a connection is established so that application-layer programs - and - recognize each other. When a portion exceeding the display range of the liquid-crystal projector - itself is detected, the liquid-crystal projector - which starts interpreting image data first tries to perform distributed processing on that portion together with the liquid-crystal projector -.","At this time, as a specific operation, a control section which has read a transmission control program of an installed OS of the liquid-crystal projector  opens a connection line to the liquid-crystal projector - through the IEEE 802.3 bus , and transmits a target range of distributed processing.","It is necessary for the application-layer program - to perform processing in sequence, such as connection of a network, opening of a line, and transmission of processing portions, by using a service routine of the installed OS. For the other application-layer program -, it is necessary to perform processing on the server side, such as connection of a network in a similar manner, permission to open a line, and reception of processing portions.","If so much processing is required in order to use plural liquid-crystal projectors, the specifications of the application-layer programs - and - become complex, making it necessary to write a program for a specific purpose in accordance with the execution environment each time.","The \u201capplication-layer program 12\u201d is actually source presentation data, which is created by another application-layer program, for creating presentation materials.","Also, the content of the source presentation data is a set of instruction words of intermediate-language objects, executed by the virtual machine .","In order to facilitate use, it is necessary that the application-layer program be described by interspersing a plurality of parallel syntax therein on the premise of parallel processing of a certain degree from the beginning. Also, it is necessary that its design be made so that parallel execution can be performed when the execution environment permits parallel processing. Instead, the virtual machine  may communicate with another virtual machine dynamically and independently so as to distribute loads.","As a technique for describing a plurality of parallel processing syntax in advance of the former case, a communication method among intermediate-language interpreters, disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 6-4498 by the present applicant, may be implemented.","Also, as a method of communicating with another virtual machine dynamically and independently at the execution stage of the latter case, for example, a technique realized by using a JAVA virtual machine, a technique by multiple agents, etc., may be used. JAVA is a trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc., of the USA.","As a result of using such techniques, even when the number of liquid-crystal projectors is increased to , , etc., it is not necessary to create source presentation data again.","In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. (B), an IEEE 1394 bus  which realizes remote access of memory resources among nodes is used.","In the case of a method of implementing a communication method among intermediate-language interpreters, disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 6-4498 by the present applicant, at the loading stage, an interpreter on the master side of a virtual machine - of a certain liquid-crystal projector - reads object code described in an intermediate language, which is a process to be executed in a memory space of another liquid-crystal projector -, into a work area of an interpreter on the slave side, then, stack initialization data is read in, initialized data is stored in the stack in accordance with the instruction of this data, and the stack pointer is set.","Next, table initialization data is read, and a series of operations of initializing the contents of an execution-time block management table and a shared resource management table is performed. Realization of such operations with the help of a high-order layer protocol implemented in a transport layer or higher of communication using an RS232C serial line, etc., and a network file system, which is commonly seen in the OS of the UNIX system, is not impossible. However, to perform remote memory access at a practical processing speed, implementation is necessary by using bus transactions of IEEE 1394 .","As a result, when the application-layer programs - and - are to be created, these can be created without considering drawing in-charge areas, etc., and from an image point of view, a virtual connection seems to be established among virtual machines  themselves which are one step lower than the application-layer programs - and -.","Next, distributed processing according to this embodiment in the case where a JAVA virtual machine is used as the virtual machine  is described in detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00164","num":"00164"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"The liquid-crystal projector - includes a conversion section , in which the virtual machine  is provided, that converts supplied data, which is distributed from another liquid-crystal projector - which is a data distribution apparatus, into a creative or reproducible data format, and a communication interface section  that receives the supplied data from an input device , which can be converted by the conversion section .","The liquid-crystal projector  includes a creation section  that creates image data on the basis of the supplied data converted by the conversion section , a control section  that stores the created image data in a storage section  in such a manner so as to be managed for each of the other liquid-crystal projectors  and for each predetermined unit and that reads the image data for each of the other liquid-crystal projectors  and for each predetermined unit, and a playback section that plays back the read image data.","In the storage section , in addition to image data containing presentation data and supplied data distributed from another processing device, a management table, etc., used by the control section  is stored.","The storage section  can be accessed via the communication interface section  from another liquid-crystal projector , etc.","Next, the virtual machine  used in this embodiment is described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00170","num":"00170"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"200"},"The software part includes a creation section  having an API (Application Programming Interface) for processing speech and an API for processing images, a control section  having plural instruction words, a dispatcher to instruction words, plural device drivers, and a runtime library, and a virtual machine .","In place of the API for processing speech and the API that processes images, a class that processes speech and a class that processes images may be implemented.","The \u201cvirtual machine 500\u201d used in this embodiment is any device which reads a common file format and which is capable of performing operations specified thereby, and specifically, for example, a JAVA virtual machine, a virtual machine, in which an interpreter capable of performing parallel processing is implemented, disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 6-4498, etc., may be used.","As a method of implementing a JAVA virtual machine, an interpreter method and a compiler method, implemented in the software part, a dedicated CPU method implemented in the hardware part, etc., may be used, and in this embodiment, the method is implemented in the software part.","The virtual machine  includes a program counter, plural threads having one stack each, and a heap area. That is, the stack and the heap area are work areas and function also as the storage section .","Since there are plural threads, what is commonly called a \u201cmulti-thread process\u201d is possible.","This makes it possible to improve execution performance during distributed processing and simultaneous executability.","The hardware part includes a playback section including a display section , a control section  having a video controller, a storage section  having a video RAM (V-RAM) area, and a communication interface section  having an IEEE 1394 link layer and an IEEE 1394 physical layer.","Next, an actual display process using plural liquid-crystal projectors - and - is described.","It is assumed that the liquid-crystal projector - functions as a master and that the liquid-crystal projector - functions as a slave.","It is assumed that the liquid-crystal projector - has drawn an image -, that is, from coordinate (0, 0) to coordinate (1024, 768). This drawing information is stored in the storage section .","When the second liquid-crystal projector - is connected to the IEEE 1394 bus , the liquid-crystal projector -, which is a master, and the liquid-crystal projector -, transmit and receive supplied data.","At this stage, the liquid-crystal projector - can determine that the liquid-crystal projector - has already been operating, and can confirm the drawing area which the liquid-crystal projector - is in charge of by referring to the drawing information of a storage section - of the liquid-crystal projector -.","After this confirmation, the liquid-crystal projector - reads image information which should be displayed by the liquid-crystal projector - itself from the storage section - of the liquid-crystal projector -, converts it by the virtual machine  into a data format in which processing is possible by the liquid-crystal projector - itself, writes it into the V-RAM area, and produces a display on the display section by using a video controller.","As described above, the stack areas inside the storage section  are present for each thread. Since the multi-thread process allows a stack area of another thread to be used even if a stack area of a particular thread is being used, simultaneous executability are not significantly decreased even when the storage section  is shared.","Also, since supplied data can be transmitted and received at high speed by using an IEEE 1394 bus  and an IEEE 1394 bus interface, even when the storage section  is shared, it is possible for each liquid-crystal projector  to refer to the storage section  of another liquid-crystal projector  at nearly the same rate as that when the storage section  of the liquid-crystal projector  itself is referred to.","Also, there are cases in which liquid-crystal projectors  having different display performances coexist, for example, a certain liquid-crystal projector  is a VGA display, i.e., a 640\u00d7480 pixel display, another liquid-crystal projector  is a SVGA display, i.e., a 800\u00d7600 pixel display, and still another liquid-crystal projector  is an XGA display, i.e., a 1024\u00d7768 pixel display.","In such a case, even when the above-mentioned coordinate (1500, 920) must be displayed, liquid-crystal projectors . having different display performances may be connected to each other so that that the coordinate appears on the display. For example, if the liquid-crystal projector , which is a master, is a VGA display, if a total of nine liquid-crystal projectors  are connected, a display area of 1920\u00d71440 pixels can be handled, and the coordinate (1500, 920) may also appear in the display.","Even in such a case, it is possible to automatically adjust display performance by the liquid-crystal projector , which is a slave, by referring to the drawing. information inside the storage section  of the liquid-crystal projector  which is a master.","In the manner as described above, since image data can be created by efficient distributed processing, it is possible to create and play back even processing-intensive data and large volumes of data smoothly, and an image display system having high adaptability can be realized.","Although the methods which have thus been described are methods in which each liquid-crystal projector  displays images in an overlapping manner with respect to different display areas, it is also possible for each liquid-crystal projector  to display images in an overlapping manner with respect to the same display area.","As such a method of displaying images in an overlapping manner, for example, it is possible to use a display method in which there is a relationship of in front of and behind, such as foreground and background, a stereoscopic display method by superposing an image for the left eye and an image for the right eye, a three-dimensional display method using a varifocal mirror method, etc.","According to this, also when such a display method is realized, it is possible to produce a display quickly and appropriately by distributing loads.","Not only image display, but also an image creation process can be performed in a distributed manner. For example, image creation with heavy processing is performed by an image creation device having high processing performance, and image creation with light processing is performed by an image creation device having low processing performance, making it possible to distributed image processing loads.","In addition, as described above, simplification of hardware can be realized by performing resolution conversion by software rather than performing resolution conversion by hardware.","Next, simplification of hardware as a result of performing resolution conversion by software is described by using the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00197","num":"00197"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Generally, in a liquid-crystal projector, image data is converted into digital signals by an AD converter , and image information is stored in a first frame memory .","Thereafter, the image information is convoluted by an image processing circuit  including a digital filtering circuit, and the resulting information is stored in a second frame memory .","Then, in order that the image information be displayed in a liquid-crystal light valve using a liquid-crystal controller , the image data within the second frame memory  is read at a fixed periodicity.","Herein, the \u201cconvolution\u201d is an image filtering technique and it attempts to change a tap coefficient according to the sharpness of an image in order to change the image quality.","Data transfer to the first frame memory , etc., is performed by a controller  to which an image synchronization signal is input from an image synchronization section  and in which the clock is adjusted by a PLL .","In these driving circuits, image deterioration due to a phase difference (shift) occurs due to differences in input image data, and in order to reduce this phase difference, a high-performance PLL circuit, etc., is necessary. Furthermore, in the case where it is assumed that plural liquid-crystal projectors having different resolutions are interconnected, a scaling circuit based on image processing for performing complementation of an image is necessary, and such image processing causes image degradation to occur.","On the other hand, as in this embodiment, if data conversion is performed on image data which is input to a liquid-crystal projector  according to the number of pixels by using application software for causing each section of the liquid-crystal projector  in which the virtual machine  is implemented to operate, image degradation as a result of image processing by a scaling circuit does not occur, and it is not necessary to provide plural frame memories, allowing circuit construction to be simplified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00205","num":"00205"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"1700"},"The liquid-crystal projector  includes a communication interface section , in which an IEEE 1394 bus-class driver, etc., is installed, that receives data from a processing unit  via an IEEE 1394 bus , a CPU  in which a virtual machine  is provided, a RAM , a VRAM , a liquid-crystal controller , a DA converter , and a liquid-crystal light valve .","Supplied data containing the image data received by the communication interface section  is translated by the virtual machine  inside the CPU  and is temporarily stored in the RAM  as image data.","In the virtual machine , functions for performing data conversion according to the number of liquid-crystal pixels are installed in advance, and at the time the image data is stored in the RAM , the image data has already been converted into image data in accordance with the number of liquid-crystal pixels.","The converted image data is loaded as a display image into the VRAM  by the liquid-crystal controller , is converted into analog data by the DA converter , and is displayed in the liquid-crystal light valve .","The virtual machine  can be regarded as a set of instruction words that perform data conversion according to the number of pixels, and that perform data conversion according to the type of model, etc. That is, function expansion, etc., can be performed flexibly by software, as required.","As described above, since an image data conversion process can be performed by software, it is possible to simplify the hardware, such as frame memories.","In the foregoing, simplification of hardware and flexible function expansion are described by using .
