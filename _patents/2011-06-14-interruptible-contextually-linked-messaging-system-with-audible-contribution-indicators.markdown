title: Interruptible, contextually linked messaging system with audible contribution indicators
abstract: Systems and methods for providing a method of recording, delivering, reviewing and responding to messages such that the context of responses to the messages are recorded in the form of a message index to enable linking of messages and responses in a meaningful fashion for review by a user. The flow of conversation on a topic initiated in an original message is preserved in one or more conversation threads. Also incorporated is a method to indicate the party (user or entity) responsible for posting a response in the form of a brief audible icon overlaid on the original message and heard upon review, the icon also to be used to indicate affiliation with third parties at the option of the user or as a means to subsidize the cost of providing the messaging service.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/386,223, filed Sep. 24, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed generally to messaging systems, and more particularly, to interruptible, contextually linked messaging systems with audible contribution indicators.","2. Description of the Related Art","Since the common adoption of computers as messaging tools, the primary format of messages exchanged has been textual. Previous to this point automated voice messaging machines that were attached to the public telephone system were the most efficient means of message delivery short of direct conversation. The convenience of textual messaging, in the form of improved message management, was sufficient to drive adoption despite obvious drawbacks. Among the limitations of textual messaging is the loss of fidelity of the original message. The volume, inflection and rate of a voice message contain information not readily represented in textual form. Poorly composed textual messages can lead to ambiguity. Emotions and meaning may be incorrectly inferred from text whereas, in an audible message, those meanings are made clear by the additional dimensions of verbal communication.","Further, the act of translating a mental thought into a textual form, and the subsequent interpretation of that textual message by the recipient, adds several layers of complexity to the messaging process. Humans communicate most efficiently via speech, and any conversion of information away from speech decreases fidelity, convenience, and clarity.","Further, the physical act of composing a textual message by typing on a keypad (e.g., of a mobile phone or computer), as well as the act of reading the textual message on a display, necessarily distracts a user due to the textual message's requirement for physical interaction and visual inspection. This requirement can be problematic in scenarios such as driving or walking where those resources are already dedicated to important tasks.","There is currently a revolution in messaging as a result of high availability of handheld computers providing ubiquitous phone and data connections for the user. Messaging services built on these devices make it possible to receive and send messages at almost any time. Following the established trend, the majority of messaging systems use a textual format in the form of email, instant messaging, or text messaging.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to the exchange of messages between one or more parties or users over a network, such as the Internet. Specifically, the invention enables an efficient, natural means of composing, delivering, managing, reviewing, and responding to messages that offers benefits over contemporary messaging systems. Embodiments of the present invention include audio messaging systems that take audio messaging to a level beyond anything currently available. Using the features disclosed herein, messages can be routed to an individual or group. The messages can also be shared publicly. Advantageously, the messages can be contextually linked as responses to topics contained in other messages. Novel and innovative features regarding the linking and responding methods disclosed herein result in a new way of messaging that is more efficient and natural to use. Novel and innovative features regarding providing commercial advertising, representing user contribution, and funding services to subsidized accounts are also incorporated into embodiments of the present invention.","Embodiments of the present invention provide messaging services to subscribed users, giving them the ability to record, deliver, receive, review, and respond to messages primarily, but not necessarily, recorded in audio format. In some embodiments, messages may be recorded in other formats, including textual and\/or video formats. The recorded messages are addressable to one or more subscribers to the messaging service, or delivered to non-subscribers by other means with a link back to the messaging service. The messages can be interrupted during playback in order to record responses which are then linked at the point of interruption, resulting in retention of conversational context for the responses. The contribution of a response to a message (e.g., by a different user) may be represented during future playback of the message as an audible icon (\u201caudicon\u201d) representative of the user account that created the response message. Generally, an audicon is a brief audio clip used to represent participation of a user in a virtual conversation. When reviewing a message to which a user has responded, the responder's audicon may be played at one or more points at which they recorded a response to the message. There may be more than one response for which the same audicon is played.","User accounts can optionally be associated with commercial entities represented in the system by one or more brand accounts. Such accounts may generally be referred to as \u201csponsored accounts.\u201d This association results in a promotional brand audicon (or visual media) being inserted into messages generated by the sponsored user account resulting in a benefit to the commercial entity of exposure through impressions on users reviewing the messages. Payment to the messaging service provider by the entity benefited from the audicons may be used to offset the cost of providing the messaging service to the users. Similar association of entities with user accounts may be used to represent affiliation or support on the account of the user, thus personalizing the service and encouraging association with commercial entities, such as but not limited to, sports franchises, educational institutions, businesses, and the like. For example, a user may select their favorite football team to be associated with their user account, such that an audio or visual brand icon is played or displayed during playback of the user's messages. In some embodiments, the costs associated with a user account may be partially or fully subsidized by a sponsor (e.g., a corporate sponsor). As an example, in some embodiments user accounts are \u201cfree\u201d for users and are associated with one or more sponsors. Users may select sponsors to be associated with their user accounts, or sponsors may be chosen for them. During playback of messages from a particular user, audicons or visual content promoting the user's associated sponsor or sponsors may be played or displayed on the device playing the messages. The sponsor's message may be played or displayed before playback of the user's message, after playback of the user's message, during playback of the user's message, or any combinations thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","118","124","118","124","100","110","128","132","128","132","110","170","150","156","162","170","174","176","178","180","170","174","176","178","180","124","128","132"]},"As discussed above, access to the platform  is implemented on various platforms by client software or applications , , , and the system website  to make the system  universally accessible to users. Each platform may require its own implementation of client software (e.g., different programming languages and techniques). The various clients , , , and  are developed with the goal that the end user's experience varies as little as practicable between the platforms. Thus, for example, a user familiar with the client software on the website  would be able to easily install and use the client application  for mobile devices, such as a mobile phone. As can be appreciated, this cross-platform consistency provides an experience that is predicable and convenient for users.","The client applications , , , and  provide a means by which users can access and manipulate messages stored by the system . Exemplary user interfaces for the client applications are shown in , , , and  and are described below. Each message may be linked to other messages within the system to form conversation threads. As discussed below, the client applications , , , and  present these messages and the resulting conversation threads to users in a way that makes it easy to listen to them and to create responses. The client applications , , , and  may also expose other messaging information to users through interaction with external social networks and messaging systems  (e.g., FACEBOOK\u00ae, LINKEDIN\u00ae, email systems, and the like) through an application programming interface (API) .","A diagram of hardware and an operating environment in conjunction with which implementations of the server , the client computing devices running the client applications , , , and , and the interface  may be practiced is provided in  and described below. In the description below, the phrase \u201ccomputing devices\u201d are meant to be construed as digital computing devices, including desktop personal computers (PCs), distributed computers, mainframes; further included in this category are portable or handheld\/mobile computing devices, including laptop computers, tablet computers and cellular phones. All of these devices commonly employ hardware systems comprising a microprocessor, also known as a microcontroller unit (MCU) or central processing unit (CPU) and a digital memory for storing message media files and client application software, readable and executable by the MCU or CPU. All of the foregoing devices are understood to be capable of supporting a graphical user interface (GUI), and therefore further comprise a display screen, wherein the display screen may employ liquid crystal display (LCD) technology, light-emitting diode technology (LED) technology or cathode ray tube (CRT) technology. The following description of the invention may comprise any or all of the foregoing devices. The word \u201conboard\u201d may be used in a phrase such as \u201conboard microprocessor\u201d or \u201conboard memory\u201d is meant to be construed as a hardware component contained within a computing device, such as the \u201cmicroprocessor onboard the computing device operated by a first user\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","204","206","208","204","206","220","220","204","228","220","224","220","204","208","240","252","260","244","248","240"]},"By allowing users to pause playback and record response messages for an individual topic, the context and intention of each topic in the original message may be preserved, making the replies more impactful. As described above and shown in , in addition to responding to the initial message , the response messages (e.g., response message  and ) may be responded to as well. Thus, the conversation threads A, B, and C are created from the initial message  and may be reviewed without distraction of replies to other topics or conversations in the original message . The resulting division of the initial message  into individual topics (e.g., topics  and ) prevents the topics from being overlooked or forgotten as might have otherwise occurred. Thus, a user is able to listen to each of the conversation threads A, B, and C from beginning to end, mimicking natural communication patterns.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","100","174","176","178","180","304"]},"Recording is initiated at the user's discretion through the user interface on a user's device, such as a mobile phone, computer, or the like (see ). Message data may be recorded in any suitable format on the user's device, for example as text or in audio format such as .wav or .mp3 media files.","When the user indicates a recording is complete and has reviewed the message for accuracy, the message is delivered to the storage , (or a cloud-based repository, or the like) via standard Internet protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, or other protocols as might be developed and applicable in the future, step . In addition to the message content, a set of metadata may be delivered including additional information about the message such as recipient accounts, permissions, visibility preferences, message linking, and the like. In some embodiments, all or part of the message may be directly sent to and stored on the remote storage (e.g., without first storing the entire message locally on the user's device). Message linking may be facilitated by metadata elements including response message insertion points, as well as file data identifiers, associating a response message file with a parent message file.","The messaging service application  running on the server  of the platform  accepts delivery of the message content and metadata from the client application through the interface . The content may be stored in a storage repository (e.g., the storage  of ) and is assigned a unique identifier within the system  by which it can later be addressed. The metadata may be parsed to extract relevant information. The system may then update linkage and delivery information for the message, step . The user account of the user sending the message may also be updated to reflect the new message posting. The posting account may be associated with the message for later retrieval of information, such as the user or sponsor account's audicon. Recipient user accounts indicated in the metadata of a message may be updated to reflect that a new message is available for the addressed recipient. Permissions are associated with the message in a database of permission information. Similarly, visibility or scope for the message is stored. If the message was a response to an existing message, a message index (e.g., a time index) of the point in time at which the new message should be linked to the existing message is stored in a database of links for later reference. In the case of textual messages, the message index may reference a particular location in the textual message (e.g., a word, a paragraph, or the like).","Notification of the availability of the new message is then sent to the addressed recipient or recipients, step . This notification can be manifested in many ways depending on how the client software is implemented. For example, a user may get an alert on a device running a client application. As can be appreciated, the alert may be audible and\/or visual. The specific implementation is not critical, but should be sufficient to alert the user in an unobtrusive but obvious way that a message has been delivered to the user's account.","When the user requests to review a message, the data storage  and database  are queried for the message content and metadata. In some embodiments, the content and metadata are delivered via standard Internet protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS and are parsed by the recipient user's device, step . The client software or application operating on the recipient user's device renders the message content in whichever form is appropriate, such as playing an audible message or displaying text. The content may be downloaded and subsequently played on the recipient user's device or may be streamed on the user's device.","Links to other messages as represented in the downloaded metadata may also be included on a user interface when the recipient user reviews messages (see ), possibly as audible icons during playback or as visible icons displayed in a textual or graphical context, step . Other metadata may also be thus represented, such as the audicon of a sponsor account. Because it is undesirable for a user to be distracted while reviewing a message, the audicons or other representations should not interfere unduly with the message data itself. For example, an audicon may be laid over an audio message but its volume may be such that the original message content is still audible and can be easily understood.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["350","100","354","358","362","366","132","128","370"]},"As discussed above, the system  may be accessed via a user-operated digital computing device, such as a computer, a mobile phone, a conventional telephone, or the like. Messages addressed to a user's account will be available for the user to review. Because messages are stored in a repository on the Internet (e.g., the storage , a cloud storage, etc.), they are accessible by any device which has access to the Internet. As discussed above, in some embodiments, a voice-command interface and\/or application is also available to permit users to access the system  via a conventional telephone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["408","400","408","100","408","412","414","408","424","428","408","420","408","412","430"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["450","400","450","462","460","450","466","458","458","454","476","480","472","466","472","476","480","472","476","480"]},"As shown in , users  and  (represented by icons  and , respectively) have both recorded a response message to the parent message at time index  on the timeline . Further, the user  has recorded a response message at time index . As shown, the user interface  also indicates that the users  and  have recorded response messages to the response message by user  at time index , creating a conversation thread as described above. The user can easily listen to any reply by clicking on its graphical icon.","When a user clicks on a message icon (e.g., icons , , , and ), the client application may adjust the display of the user interface  to display a new timeline for the selected message, including any subsequent replies associated with it. Thus, the user is able to manually \u201cwalk down\u201d a conversation thread sequentially listening to each message of the thread. The application may also provide an automated filter that is operative to play a particular conversation thread from beginning to end without user intervention. Thus, to form conversation threads, linked messages may be chained, either by the messaging service application or the client application, whereby a subsequent response message file, recorded in response to previously recorded response message, is linked thereto by the process described above. The previously recorded response message is thus the parent message of the subsequent response message. The previously recorded response message may have been linked to a still earlier recorded response message or to the original primary message. The still earlier response message is then the parent message. A chain of messages is thus created, forming a conversation thread. One or more conversation threads may be linked to a primary message. In the example of a graphical message display in , each message may be represented by an icon, or other form a graphical prompt, where a series of linked messages may be represented by cluster of icons or graphical prompts. In the following description, \u201cicon\u201d and \u201cmessage\u201d are used interchangeably. This is shown in , an example of a configuration of the cluster of icons ,  and . This icon cluster is linked to timeline  via a first response message . The point of linkage of first response message along timeline  corresponds to the response message insertion point where playback of the primary message was paused to record the first response message. The response file insertion point is a graphical distance along the timeline extending from the beginning (first terminus) of the primary message file, and corresponds to the time index or the count of data bytes read by the onboard microprocessor at the point during playback when the primary message file was paused for recording the response message file. Response message  is a parent message to subsequent response message . Response message  is in turn a parent message to subsequent response message . The icons representing these response messages may be arranged in a temporal hierarchy, as shown in . Icons ,  and  are shown linked together, in a descending order corresponding to their temporal relationship, which is the order in which the subsequent response messages were recorded and linked. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other representations are possible.","As discussed above, while reviewing a recorded message, the user will be alerted to responses that may have been previously recorded by other users. In addition to or instead of the icons shown in , the form of the alert may be a brief audible icon representative of the user account used to record the response. For example, a suitable audicon might be the playing of a user's name (e.g., \u201cmessage from John\u201d) or a short sound associated with the user's account, similar to a ring tone. Should the user wish to listen to the response, the message can be paused and playback of the response may be initiated.","A user wishing to record a message can specify the desired recipient or recipients from a contacts list or by providing a recipient's user account name or other identifying information.  illustrates an exemplary user interface  that includes a list of contacts  for a user. As shown in , client applications may also include a user interface  that is operative to display an inbox  of messages received by a user. As can be appreciated, the user interface  may also provide an outbox, sent items box, other folders, and the like.","The system  may include other features as well. For example, the system  may be operative to provide pertinent statistics about a given conversation thread, such as the number of contributors, thread depth (i.e., the number of responses chained together to reach a given point), thread length (in time), contributions for a particular user and the average length of their responses, and the like. This information may be useful in determining the efficiency or effectiveness of a conversation thread or its contributors.","Information pertinent to a given message but existing in a different form (e.g. images, URLs, video clips, documents, and the like) may be linked to the message such that the information is delivered in tandem and is available for review by the recipients of the message. The user interfaces of the client applications may display one or more visual indicators to represent the existence of the linked information (or \u201clinked media\u201d). The indicators act as shortcuts which the user can select to initiate review of the linked media.","In some embodiments, to enable hands free or audible use, the client applications support voice command and control. Voice commands may be used to review existing messages, initiate recording of replies, and otherwise navigate the messaging system . Replies to a message may be represented during playback by audicons which uniquely represent the user posting the reply. Thus, a user listening to a message is aware of who is replying at a particular point within the message, even if the visual interface is inaccessible, such as while driving. Through a voice command and control interface, the user can choose to pause playback and listen to a reply immediately if desired. Should a user be unable to respond with a spoken reply, the client application may also accept a typed message which is automatically converted to audio via a text-to-speech service of the system . Similarly, the user may request that the system  transcribe an audio message to text for review. This feature expands the set of scenarios in which the messaging system  can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":"100"},"Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that implementations may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. Implementations may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through one or more communications networks. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","The exemplary hardware and operating environment of  includes a general-purpose computing device in the form of a computing device . Each of the applications (e.g., the messaging service application , the client applications , , , and , and the like) may be implemented using one or more computing devices similar the computing device .","The computing device  includes the system memory , a processing unit , and a system bus  that operatively couples various system components, including the system memory , to the processing unit .

The computing device  may be a conventional computer, a distributed computer, or any other type of computer.","The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory  may also be referred to as simply the memory, and may include read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system (BIOS) , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the computing device , such as during start-up, may be stored in ROM . The computing device  may further include a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk, not shown, a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk  such as a CD ROM, DVD, or other optical media. The computing device  may also include one or more other types of memory devices (e.g., flash memory storage devices, and the like).","The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are connected to the system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical disk drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for the computing device . It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any type of computer-readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, USB drives, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), read only memories (ROMs), and the like, may be used in the exemplary operating environment. As is apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the hard disk drive  and other forms of computer-readable media (e.g., the removable magnetic disk , the removable optical disk , flash memory cards, USB drives, and the like) accessible by the processing unit  may be considered components of the system memory .","A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk drive , magnetic disk , optical disk , ROM , or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the computing device  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port, a universal serial bus (USB), or the like. A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus  via an interface, such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor, computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers.","The computing device  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as remote computer . These logical connections are achieved by a communication device coupled to or a part of the computing device  (as the local computer). Implementations are not limited to a particular type of communications device.

For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).","Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S)","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
