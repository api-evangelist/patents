Android provides multiple functions and multiple local menus, where each local menu includes one or multiple menu items, and each menu item corresponds to a function, so that each function may be started from the local menus. Android may be used as a mobile operating system. A mobile phone manufacturer adds various third-party applications to the Android platform to develop mobile phones with different functions. Each third-party application includes one or multiple functions, and each function corresponds to one menu item. The menu item corresponding to each function of a third-party application is added to a local menu, so that the functions included in the third-party application may be started from the local menu.","The Android platform has a database for storing menu items. A mobile phone manufacturer adds a menu item included in a third-party application to the database by modifying a code in the Android platform. When a local menu is created, menu items are obtained from the database to make a local menu, thereby adding the menu item included in the third-party application to the local menu. Then, the mobile phone manufacturer burns the Android platform and the third-party application into the memory of the mobile phones.","The inventors find that the prior art has at least the following problems:","When a mobile phone manufacturer adds a menu item of a third-party application to a local menu, the mobile phone manufacturer needs to modify an Android code. In addition, after a mobile phone is delivered from a factory, data burned into the mobile phone memory cannot be modified again. Therefore, when downloading a third-party application to the mobile phone, the user cannot add a menu item in the third-party application to the local menu of the mobile phone.","To add a menu item of a third-party application to a local menu of a mobile phone without modifying an Android platform code, embodiments of the present invention provide a method and device for adding a menu item to an Android menu. The technical solutions are as follows:","A method for adding a menu item to an Android menu includes:","receiving a request for opening a local menu, where the request carries a menu ID, and creating a local menu corresponding to the menu ID;","obtaining according to the menu ID, in a stored correspondence between a menu item of a third-party application and a local menu ID, a menu item of a corresponding third-party application;","adding the menu item of the third-party application to the local menu; and","displaying the local menu to which the menu item of the third-party application is added.","A device for adding a menu item to an Android menu includes:","a first creating module, configured to receive a request for opening a local menu, where the request carries a menu ID, and create a local menu corresponding to the menu ID;","an obtaining module, configured to obtain according to the menu ID, in a stored correspondence between the menu item of a third-party application and a local menu ID, a menu item of a corresponding third-party application; and","an adding module, configured to, add the menu item of the third-party application to the local menu, and display the local menu to which the menu item of the third-party application is added.","When a local menu is opened, a menu item to be added to the local menu is obtained from a stored correspondence between a menu item of a third-party application and a local menu ID, and the obtained menu item is directly added to the local menu. The menu item of the third-party application is directly added to the local menu, therefore, without modifying an Android code, the menu item of the third-party application may be added to the database of an Android platform and the menu item of the third-party application may be added to the local menu.","To make the objective, technical solutions, and advantages of the present invention clearer, the following describes the present invention in detail with reference to embodiments and accompanying drawings. The illustrative embodiments of the present invention and description thereof are used to describe the present invention, and are not intended to limit the present invention.","As shown in , an embodiment of the present invention provides a method for adding a menu item to an Android menu, including:","Step : Receive a request for opening a local menu, where the request carries a menu ID, and create a local menu corresponding to the carried menu ID.","Step : Obtain according to the carried menu ID, in a stored correspondence between a menu item of a third-party application and the local menu ID, a menu item of a corresponding third-party application.","Step : Add the obtained menu item of the third-party application to the local menu, and display the local menu to which the menu item of the third-party application is added.","In the embodiment of the present invention, a menu item of a third-party application and an ID of a local menu to which the menu item belongs are stored; when the local menu is opened, the menu item to be added to the local menu is obtained according to a stored correspondence between the menu item of the third-party application and the local menu ID, and the obtained menu item is directly added to the local menu. The menu item of the third-party application is directly added to the local menu, therefore, without modifying an Android code, the menu item of the third-party application may be added to the database of an Android platform and the menu item of the third-party application may be added to the local menu.","As shown in , an embodiment of the present invention provides a method for adding a menu item to an Android menu, including:","Step : When a user installs a third-party application in a mobile phone, search a file set of the third-party application for a configuration file.","The user may download the file set of the third-party application from an application developer, and store the file set of the third-party application in the memory of the mobile phone. The third-party application may include one or multiple functions, where each function is implemented by a corresponding API (Application Programming Interface) function. Therefore, the file set of the third-party application stores the API function of each function for implementing the third-party application.","The file set of the third-party application has a configuration file, where the configuration file exists as an XML (Extensible Markup Language) file. The configuration file includes at least the following information: a menu item and an ID of a local menu to which the menu item belongs, where the menu item includes at least a menu item name and identity information, and the identity information includes at least a menu ID of a secondary menu or a function ID. In addition, the identity information may further include an application ID. If the identity information includes a menu ID of a secondary menu, the identity information may uniquely identify a secondary menu; and if the identity information includes a function ID, the identity information may uniquely identify a function. In addition, the menu item may further include an icon ID, and the like, and correspondingly, the file set of the third-party application further has an icon. In addition, the menu item name exists in the form of a character string. The configuration file may include multiple menu items and IDs of local menus to which each menu item belongs. A third-party application developer knows each local menu in an Android platform in advance. If the third-party application developer wants to add a menu item of a third-party application to a local menu, the third-party application developer may directly define, in the configuration file of the third-party application, the local menu ID, to which the menu item of the third-party application belongs, to be the local menu ID.","For example, a third-party application is a mail system. A file set of the mail system has a configuration file, where the configuration file includes information shown in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the configuration file of the mail system includes two menu items and IDs of local menus to which each menu item belongs. A first menu item includes a menu item name which is \u201cMail\u201d and identity information which includes a function ID \u201cID\u201d, an application ID \u201cID\u201d, and an icon ID \u201cID\u201d. A second menu item includes a menu item named \u201cDirectMessage\u201d and identity information including a function ID \u201cID\u201d and an application ID \u201cID\u201d. A menu item may not include an icon ID. Therefore, an icon ID recorded in a last line of Table 1 is left blank.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Menu Item","Local"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Menu Item Name","Function ID","Application ID","Icon ID","Menu ID"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Mail","ID101","ID10","ID102","ID1"]},{"entry":["DirectMessage","ID103","ID10","N\/A","ID18"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Step : Obtain, by parsing a found configuration file and from the configuration file, at least information such as each menu item and the menu ID of the local menu to which each menu item belongs, and store the obtained information in a configuration manager.","The configuration manager is stored in an unoccupied space area in the memory of a mobile phone, and the configuration manager is configured to store a correspondence between a menu item of a third-party application and a menu ID of a local menu to which the menu item belongs.
