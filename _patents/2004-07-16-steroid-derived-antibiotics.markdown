The government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to novel steroid derivatives and processes and intermediates for the preparation of these compounds.","Some compounds that associate strongly with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria are known to disrupt the outer membrane and increase permeability. The increased permeability can increase the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to other antibiotics. The best studied of this type of compound are the polymyxin antibiotics. For an example of a study involving the binding of polymyxin B to the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (lipid A) see: D. C. Morrison and D. M. Jacobs, , Immunochemistry 1976, vol. 13, 813-819. For an example of a study involving the binding of a polymyxin derivative to Gram-negative bacteria see: M. Vaara and P. Viljanen, -, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 1985, vol. 27, 548-554.","Membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are semipermeable molecular \u201csieves\u201d which restrict access of antibiotics and host defense molecules to their targets within the bacterial cell. Thus, cations and polycations which interact with and break down the outer membrane permeability barrier are capable of increasing the susceptibility of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics and host defense molecules. Hancock and Wong demonstrated that a broad range of peptides could overcome the permeability barrier and coined the name \u201cpermeabilizers\u201d to describe them (Hancock and Wong, 26:48, 1984).","The present invention features compounds of the formula I",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"36.07mm","wi":"62.65mm","file":"US07598234-20091006-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein:","fused rings A, B, C, and D are independently saturated or fully or partially unsaturated; and","each of Rthrough R, R, R, R, R, R, R, and Ris independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) alkyl, (C1-C10) hydroxyalkyl, (C1-C10) alkyloxy-(C1-C10) alkyl, (C1-C10) alkylcarboxy-(C1-C10) alkyl, (C1-C10) alkylamino-(C1-C10) alkyl, (C1-C10) alkylamino-(C1-C10) alkylamino, (C1-C10) alkylamino-(C1-C10) alkylamino-(C1-C10) alkylamino, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a substituted or unsubstituted arylamino-(C1-C10) alkyl, (C1-C10) haloalkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl, oxo, a linking group attached to a second steroid, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkyloxy, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkyloxy-(C1-C10) alkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkylcarboxy, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkylaminocarbonyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkylcarboxamido, H2N\u2014HC(Q5)-C(O)\u2014O\u2014, H2N\u2014HC(Q5)-C(O)\u2014N(H)\u2014, (C1-C10) azidoalkyloxy, (C1-C10) cyanoalkyloxy, P.G.-HN\u2014C(Q5)-C(O)\u2014O\u2014, (C1-C10) guanidinoalkyl oxy, (C1-C10) quaternaryammoniumalkylcarboxy, and (C1-C10) guanidinoalkyl carboxy, where Q5 is a side chain of any amino acid (including the side chain of glycine, i.e., H), P.G. is an amino protecting group, and","R, R, R, R, R, and Ris each independently: deleted when one of fused rings A, B, C, or D is unsaturated so as to complete the valency of the carbon atom at that site, or","selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) alkyl, (C1-C10) hydroxyalkyl, (C1-C10) alkyloxy-(C1-C10) alkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, C1-C10 haloalkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl, a linking group attached to a second steroid, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkyloxy, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkylcarboxy, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkylaminocarbonyl, H2N\u2014HC(Q5)-C(O)\u2014O\u2014, H2N\u2014HC(Q5)-C(O)\u2014N(H)\u2014, (C1-C10) azidoalkyloxy, (C1-C10) cyanoalkyloxy, P.G.-HN\u2014HC(Q5)-C(O)\u2014O\u2014, (C1-C10) guanidinoalkyloxy, and (C1-C10) guanidinoalkylcarboxy, where Q5 is a side chain of any amino acid, P.G. is an amino protecting group, and","provided that at least two of Rthrough Rare independently selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkyloxy, (C1-C10) alkylcarboxy-(C1-C10) alkyl, (C1-C10) alkylamino-(C1-C10) alkylamino, (C1-C10) alkylamino-(C1-C10) alkylamino-(C1-C10) alkylamino, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkylcarboxy, a substituted or unsubstituted arylamino-(C1-C10) alkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkyloxy-(C1-C10) alkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C10) aminoalkylaminocarbonyl, (C1-C10) quaternaryammonium alkylcarboxy, H2N\u2014HC(Q5)-C(O)\u2014O\u2014, H2N\u2014HC(Q5)-C(O)\u2014N(H)\u2014, (C1-C10) azidoalkyloxy, (C1-C10) cyanoalkyloxy, P.G.-HN\u2014HC(Q5)-C(O)\u2014O\u2014, (C1-C10) guanidinoalkyloxy, and (C1-C10) guanidinoalkylcarboxy; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","The term fused ring used herein can be heterocyclic or carbocyclic, preferably.","The term \u201csaturated\u201d used herein refers to the fused ring of formula I having each atom in the fused ring either hydrogenated or substituted such that the valency of each atom is filled.","The term \u201cunsaturated\u201d used herein refers to the fused ring of formula I where the valency of each atom of the fused ring may not be filled with hydrogen or other substituents.

The interaction between the steroid derivatives and the bacteria membrane disrupts the integrity of the cellular membrane and results in the death of the bacteria cell. In addition, compounds of the present invention also act to sensitize bacteria to other antibiotics. At concentrations of the steroid derivatives below the corresponding minimum bacteriostatic concentration, the derivatives cause bacteria to become more susceptible to other antibiotics by increasing the permeability of the outer membrane of the bacteria. Measurements used to quantitate the effects of the steroid derivatives on bacteria include: measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), measurement of minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and the ability of the steroid derivatives to lower the MICs of other antibiotics, e.g., erythromycin and novobiocin.","A person of skill will recognize that the compounds described herein preserve certain stereochemical and electronic characteristics found in steroids. The term \u201csame configuration\u201d as used herein refers to substituents on the fused steroid having the same stereochemical orientation. For example substituents R3, R7 and R12 are all \u03b2-substituted or \u03b1-substituted. The configuration of the moieties R3, R7, and R12 substituted on C3, C7, and C12 may be important for interaction with the cellular membrane.","In another aspect, the invention features several methods of using the above-described compounds. For example, an effective amount of an anti-microbial composition comprising such a compound is administered to a host (including a human host) to treat a microbial infection. The compound by itself may provide the anti-microbial effect, in which case the amount of the compound administered is sufficient to be anti-microbial. Alternatively, an additional anti-microbial substance to be delivered to the microbial cells (e.g., an antibiotic) is included in the anti-microbial composition. By facilitating delivery to the target cells, the compounds can enhance the effectiveness of the additional antimicrobial substance. In some cases the enhancement may be substantial. Particularly important target microbes are bacteria (e.g., Gram-negative bacteria generally or bacteria which have a substantial (>40%) amount of a lipid A or lipid A-like substance in the outer membrane). Other microbes including fungi, viruses, and yeast may also be the target organisms.","The compounds can also be administered in other contexts to enhance cell permeability to introduce any of a large number of different kinds of substances into a cell, particularly the bacterial cells discussed above. In addition to introducing anti-microbial substances, the invention may be used to introduce other substances such as macromolecules (e.g., vector-less DNA).","The invention can also be used to make anti-microbial compositions (e.g., disinfectants, antiseptics, antibiotics etc.) which comprise one of the above compounds. These compositions are not limited to pharmaceuticals, and they may be used topically or in non-therapeutic contexts to control microbial (particularly bacterial) growth. For example, they may be used in applications that kill or control microbes on contact.","In yet another aspect, the invention generally features methods of identifying compounds that are effective against a microbe by administering a candidate compound and a compound according to the invention the microbe and determining whether the candidate compound has a static or toxic effect (e.g, an antiseptic, germicidal, disinfectant, or antibiotic effect) on the microbe. Again, bacteria such as those discussed above are preferred. This aspect of the invention permits useful testing of an extremely broad range of candidate anti-microbials which are known to have anti-microbial effect in some contexts, but which have not yet been shown to have any effect against certain classes of microbes such as the bacteria discussed above. As described in greater detail below, this aspect of the invention permits testing of a broad range of antibiotics currently thought to be ineffective against Gram-negative or lipid A-like containing bacteria.","In yet another aspect the invention features compositions which include one of the above compounds in combination with a substance to be introduced into a cell such as an antimicrobial substance as described in greater detail above. The compound and the additional substance may be mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","Other features or advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of several embodiments, and also from the appending claims.","The invention encompasses steroid derivatives that can be made by the synthetic routes described herein, and methods of treating a subject having a condition mediated by a bacterial infection by administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition containing a compound disclosed herein to the subject.","In general, the present invention provides the compounds of formula I described above. The preparation methods and the MIC and MBC of compounds of formula I are described. The cellular membrane permeability is also measured and described.

These characteristics can be determined for each test compound using the assays detailed below and elsewhere in the literature.","Known compounds that are used in accordance with the invention and precursors to novel compounds according to the invention can be purchased, e.g., from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis; Aldrich, Milwaukee; Steroids and Research Plus. Other compounds according to the invention can be synthesized according to known methods and the methods described below using publicly available precursors.","The compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to compounds having amine or guanidine groups covalently tethered to a steroid backbone, e.g., cholic acid. Other ring systems can also be used, e.g., 5-member fused rings. Compounds with backbones having a combination of 5- and 6-membered rings are also included in the invention. The amine or guanidine groups are separated from the backbone by at least one atom, and preferably are separated by at least two, three, or four atoms. The backbone can be used to orient the amine or guanidine groups on one face, or plane, of the steroid. For example, a scheme showing a compound having primary amino groups on one face, or plane, of a backbone is shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"17.19mm","wi":"28.11mm","file":"US07598234-20091006-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The biological activity of the compounds can be determined by standard methods known to those of skill in the art, such as the \u201cminimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)\u201d assay described in the present examples, whereby the lowest concentration at which no change in optical density (OD) is observed for a given period of time is recorded as MIC. When the compound alone is tested against a control that lacks the compound, the antimicrobial effect of the compound alone is determined.","Alternatively, \u201cfractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)\u201d is also useful for determination of synergy between the compounds of the invention, or the compounds in combination with known antibiotics. FICs can be performed by checkerboard titrations of compounds in one dimension of a microtiter plate, and of antibiotics in the other dimension, for example. The FIC is calculated by looking at the impact of one antibiotic on the MIC of the other and vice versa. An FIC of one indicates that the influence of the compounds is additive and an FIC of less than one indicates synergy. Preferably, an FIC of less than 0.5 is obtained for synergism.

For example, substances that generally may not be sufficiently effective against certain bacteria at safe dosages can be made more effective with the compound of the invention, thus enabling use of the substances against new categories of infections. Specifically, many existing antibiotics are effective against some Gram-positive bacteria, but are not currently indicated to treat Gram-negative bacterial infection. In some cases, the antibiotic may be ineffective by itself against Gram-negative bacteria because it fails to enter the cell. Compounds of the invention may increase permeability so as to render the antibiotics effective against Gram-negative bacteria.","In addition, fractional inhibitory concentration is also useful for determination of synergy between compounds of the invention in combination with other compounds having unknown anti-bacterial activity or in combination with other compounds, e.g., compounds which have been tested and show anti-bacterial activity. For example, compounds of the invention may increase permeability so as to render compounds lacking anti-bacterial activity effective against bacteria. The FIC can also be used to test for other types of previously unappreciated activity of substances that will be introduced into the cell by means of permeability enhancing compounds according to the invention.","While we do not wish to be bound to any single specific theory, and such a theory is not necessary to practice the invention, one mechanism of action is the lipid A interaction of multiple (usually three) moieties, which under physiological conditions are positively charged, e.g., guanidino or amino moieties. The moieties extend away from the general plane of the remainder of the molecule, thus mimicking certain aspects of the structure of polymyxins. In this regard, compounds of the invention will generally be useful in the way that polymyxins are useful. For example, polymyxin B (PMB) and polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) are useful for permeabilizing bacterial membranes. Moreover, in regard to systemic administration, those skilled in the art will recognize appropriate toxicity screens that permit selection of compounds that are not toxic at dosages that enhance microbial permeability.","As noted, the invention also involves topical as well as non-therapeutic (antiseptic, germicidal, or disinfecting) applications in which the compounds are contacted with surfaces to be treated. The term \u201ccontacting\u201d preferably refers to exposing the bacteria to the compound so that the compound can effectively inhibit, kill, or lyse bacteria, bind endotoxin (LPS), or permeabilize Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes. Contacting may be in vitro, for example by adding the compound to a bacterial culture to test for susceptibility of the bacteria to the compound. Contacting may be in vivo, for example administering the compound to a subject with a bacterial disorder, such as septic shock. \u201cInhibiting\u201d or \u201cinhibiting effective amount\u201d refers to the amount of compound which is required to cause a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. Examples of bacteria which may be inhibited include and . In addition, the compounds of the invention can be used to inhibit antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms.","The method of inhibiting the growth of bacteria may further include the addition of antibiotics for combination or synergistic therapy. The appropriate antibiotic administered will typically depend on the susceptibility of the bacteria such as whether the bacteria is Gram-negative or Gram-positive, and will be easily discernable by one of skill in the art. Examples of particular classes of antibiotics to be tested for synergistic therapy with the compounds of the invention (as described above) include aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin), penicillins (e.g., piperacillin), cephalosporins (e.g., ceftazidime), fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), carbepenems (e.g., imipenem), tetracyclines and macrolides (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin). The method of inhibiting the growth of bacteria may further include the addition of antibiotics for combination or synergistic therapy. The appropriate antibiotic administered will typically depend on the susceptibility of the bacteria such as whether the bacteria is Gram-negative or Gram-positive, and will be easily discernable by one of skill in the art. Further to the antibiotics listed above, typical antibiotics include aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, netilmicin, tobramycin, streptomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, erythromycin estolate\/ethylsuccinate, gluceptate\/lactobionate\/stearate, beta-lactams such as penicillins (e.g., penicillin G, penicillin V, methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, azlocillin and piperacillin), or cephalosporins (e.g., cephalothin, cefazolin, cefaclor, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefonicid, cefinetazole, cefotetan, cefprozil, loracarbef, cefetamet, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefixime, cefpodoxime, and cefsulodin). Other classes of antibiotics include carbapenems (e.g., imipenem), monobactams (e.g., aztreonam), quinolones (e.g., fleroxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, lomefloxacin and cinoxacin), tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline), and glycopeptides (e.g., vancomycin, teicoplanin), for example. Other antibiotics include chloramphenicol, clindamycin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, rifampin and mupirocin, and polymyxins, such as PMB.","Administration","The compounds may be administered to any host, including a human or non-human animal, in an amount effective to inhibit not only growth of a bacterium, but also a virus or fungus. These compounds are useful as antimicrobial agents, antiviral agents, and antifungal agents. The compounds may be administered to any host, including a human or non-human animal, in an amount effective to inhibit not only growth of a bacterium, but also a virus or fungus. These compounds are useful as antimicrobial agents, antiviral agents, and antifungal agents.","The compounds of the invention can be administered parenterally by injection or by gradual infusion over time. The compounds can be administered topically, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracavity, or transdermally. Preferred methods for delivery of the compound include orally, by encapsulation in microspheres or proteinoids, by aerosol delivery to the lungs, or transdermally by iontophoresis or transdermal electroporation. Other methods of administration will be known to those skilled in the art.","Preparations for parenteral administration of a compound of the invention include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic\/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringer's dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like.","The invention provides a method of treating or ameliorating an endotoxemia or septic shock (sepsis) associated disorder, or one or more of the symptoms of sepsis comprising administering to a subject displaying symptoms of sepsis or at risk for developing sepsis, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. The term \u201cameliorate\u201d refers to a decrease or lessening of the symptoms of the disorder being treated. Such symptoms which may be ameliorated include those associated with a transient increase in the blood level of TNF, such as fever, hypotension, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock and multiple organ failure. Patients who require such treatment include those at risk for or those suffering from toxemia, such as endotoxemia resulting from a Gram-negative bacterial infection, venom poisoning, or hepatic failure, for example. In addition, patients having a Gram-positive bacterial, viral or fungal infection may display symptoms of sepsis and may benefit from such a therapeutic method as described herein. Those patients who are more particularly able to benefit from the method of the invention are those suffering from infection by B, , staphylococci, or pneumococci. Patients at risk for sepsis include those suffering from gunshot wounds, renal or hepatic failure, trauma, burns, immunocompromised (HIV), hematopoietic neoplasias, multiple myeloma, Castleman's disease or cardiac myxoma.","In addition, the compounds may be incorporated into biodegradable polymers allowing for sustained release, the polymers being implanted in the vicinity of where delivery is desired, for example, at the site of a bacterial infection. The biodegradable polymers and their use are described in detail in Brem et al., J. Neurosurg, 74:441-446 (1991).","As mentioned above, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation having an effective amount of a compound of formula I for treating a patient having a bacterial infection. As used herein, an effective amount of the compound is defined as the amount of the compound which, upon administration to a patient, inhibits growth of bacteria, kills bacteria cells, sensitizes bacteria to other antibiotics, or eliminates the bacterial infection entirely in the treated patient. The dosage of the composition will depend on the condition being treated, the particular derivative used, and other clinical factors such as weight and condition of the patient and the route of administration of the compound. However, for oral administration to humans, a dosage of 0.01 to 100 mg\/kg\/day, preferably 0.01-1 mg\/kg\/day, is generally sufficient. Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, dependent on route of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments including other antibiotic agents.","For example, the term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d as used herein for treatment of endotoxemia refers to the amount of compound used is of sufficient quantity to decrease the subject's response to LPS and decrease the symptoms of sepsis. The term \u201ctherapeutically effective\u201d therefore includes that the amount of compound sufficient to prevent, and preferably reduce by at least 50%, and more preferably sufficient to reduce by 90%, a clinically significant increase in the plasma level of TNF. The dosage ranges for the administration of compound are those large enough to produce the desired effect. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, condition, sex, and extent of the infection with bacteria or other agent as described above, in the patient and can be determined by one skilled in the art. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. In any event, the effectiveness of treatment can be determined by monitoring the level of LPS and TNF in a patient. A decrease in serum LPS and TNF levels should correlate with recovery of the patient.","In addition, patients at risk for or exhibiting the symptoms of sepsis can be treated by the method as described above, further comprising administering, substantially simultaneously with the therapeutic administration of compound, an inhibitor of TNF, an antibiotic, or both. For example, intervention in the role of TNF in sepsis, either directly or indirectly, such as by use of an anti-TNF antibody and\/or a TNF antagonist, can prevent or ameliorate the symptoms of sepsis. Particularly preferred is the use of an anti-TNF antibody as an active ingredient, such as a monoclonal antibody with TNF specificity as described by Tracey, et al. (330:662, 1987).","A patient who exhibits the symptoms of sepsis may be treated with an antibiotic in addition to the treatment with compound. Typical antibiotics include an aminoglycoside, such as gentamicin or a beta-lactam such as penicillin, or cephalosporin or any of the antibiotics as previously listed above. Therefore, a preferred therapeutic method of the invention includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of cationic compound substantially simultaneously with administration of a bactericidal amount of an antibiotic. Preferably, administration of compound occurs within about 48 hours and preferably within about 2-8 hours, and most preferably, substantially concurrently with administration of the antibiotic.","The term \u201cbactericidal amount\u201d as used herein refers to an amount sufficient to achieve a bacteria-killing blood concentration in the patient receiving the treatment. The bactericidal amount of antibiotic generally recognized as safe for administration to a human is well known in the art, and as is known in the art, varies with the specific antibiotic and the type of bacterial infection being treated.","Because of the antibiotic, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties of the compounds, they may also be used as preservatives or sterillants of materials susceptible to microbial or viral contamination. The compounds of the invention can be utilized as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents directed toward various specific applications. Such applications include use of the compounds as preservatives in processed foods when verified as effective against organisms including , either alone or in combination with antibacterial food additives such as lysozymes; as a topical agent () and to kill odor producing microbes (). The relative effectiveness of the compounds of the invention for the applications described can be readily determined by one of skill in the art by determining the sensitivity of any organism to one of the compounds.","While primarily targeted at classical Gram-negative-staining bacteria whose outer capsule contains a substantial amount of lipid A, it may also be effective against other organisms with a hydrophobic outer capsule. For example, spp. have a waxy protective outer coating, and compounds of the invention in combination with antibiotics may provide enhanced effectiveness against Mycobacterial infection, including tuberculosis. In that case, the compounds could be administered nasally (aspiration), by any of several known techniques.","Apart from anti-microbial action, the permeability provided by the compounds may enhance introduction of a great variety of substances into microbes. For example, the compounds may be used to enhance introduction of macromolecules such as DNA or RNA into microbes, particularly Gram-negative bacteria. In that case, there may be no need for the traditional vectors (e.g., phages) used to package nucleic acids when transfecting the microbes. Conditions and techniques for introducing such macromolecules into microbes using the compounds of the invention will in most cases be routine.","The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intraocular, intratracheal, and epidural) administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient and the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into associate the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion and as a bolus, etc.","A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide a slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the ingredients in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the ingredient to be administered in a suitable liquid carrier.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the skin may be presented as ointments, creams, gels and pastes comprising the ingredient to be administered in a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier. A preferred topical delivery system is a transdermal patch containing the ingredient to be administered.","Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.","Formulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations, wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration, as for example, a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such as carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, other bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) conditions requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tables of the kind previously described.","Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit, daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the administered ingredient.","It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients, particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example, those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.","The carrier in the pharmaceutical composition must be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the active ingredient of the formulation (and preferably, capable of stabilizing it) and not deleterious to the subject to be treated.","Without further elaboration, it is believed that the above description has adequately enabled the present invention.

Reference strains were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.) or Bactrol disks from Difeo Laboratories (Detroit, Mich.). The following specific ATCC strains were used: 10798 25922 13883 27853 14028 29212 25923 19615 , and 90028 . Bacterial strains were maintained on Mueller-Hinton agar plates, and was maintained on Sabouraud Dextrose agar plates.","Tryptic soy broth (TSB) was made by dissolving 27.5 grams of tryptic soy broth without dextrose (DIFCO Laboratories) in 1 liter of deionized water and sterilizing at 121\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. Solid agar (TSA) plates were made by dissolving 6.4 grams of tryptic soy broth and 12 grams of agar (purified grade, Fischer Scientific) in 800 mL of deionized water and sterilizing at 121\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes. Aliquots (20 mL) of the homogeneous solution were then poured in sterile plastic petri dishes (100\u00d715 mm, Fisher Scientific). Solutions of compounds were made by dissolving the HCl salt of the respective compound into an appropriate amount of deionized and sterilized water followed by microfiltration.","Representative procedure for measuring MIC and MBC values: A suspension was prepared of (ATCC 10798) containing \u02dc10CFU (colony forming units)\/mL from a culture incubated in TSB at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. Aliquots of 1 mL of the suspension were added to test tubes containing 1 mL TSB and incrementally varied concentrations of cholic acid derivatives and\/or erythromycin or novobiocin. In the sensitization experiments, erythromycin or novobiocin were added 15 minutes later than the cholic acid derivatives. The samples were subjected to stationary incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. Sample turbidity was determined by measuring absorption at 760 nm (HP 8453 UV-Visible Chemstation, Hewlett Packard). Additionally, an alliquot from each of the samples showing no measurable turbidity was subcultured on TSA plates (alliquots were diluted to provide fewer than 300 CFU). Colonies that grew on the subculture after overnight incubation were counted and the number of CFU\/mL in the samples were calculated. The calculated values were compared to the number of CFU\/mL in the original inoculum. MIC values were determined as the concentrations of the studied compounds at which the number of CFU\/mL remained constant or decreased after incubation for 24 hours. The MBC values were determined as the lowest concentrations of the studied compounds that allowed less than 0.1% of the original bacterial suspension to survive.","Using a technique described by J. M. Shupp, S. E. Travis, L. B. Price, R. F. Shand, P. Keim, RAPID BACTERIAL PERMEABILIZATION REAGENT USEFUL FOR ENZYME ASSAYS, Biotechniques, 1995, vol. 19, 18-20, we have shown that the cholic acid derivatives increase the permeability of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The values for half maximum luminescence (indicating permeabilization of the outer membrane allowing luciferin to enter the cell) for 2 is 7 \u03bcg\/mL and for 10 is 33 \u03bcg\/mL. These values correspond to the measured MICs of 2 and 10.","PMB is known to have membrane permeabilization and bactericidal properties. PMB has a hydrophobic acyl group and a macrocylic heptapeptide containing a D amino acid and four diaminobutyric acid (DAB) residues. One of the DAB side chains is involved in forming the macrocylic ring, leaving the other three side chains with free amines. Thus, PMB has an array of amines oriented on one face, or plane, of a hydrophobic scaffolding. It has been suggested that the primary role of the macrocylic ring is to orient the amine groups in a specific arrangement necessary for binding the lipid A portion of LPS. The relative spatial orientation of these primary amine groups is the same in the cholic acid derivatives as in PMB.","The stereochemistry of the steroid backbone results in different activities of the cholic acid derivatives (compare 2 and 8, Tables 1, 2, 6 and 7). Compounds with guanidine groups attached to the steroid have lower MIC values than compounds containing amine groups (compare 1, 2, 4 and 5, compare Tables 1-8). The length of the tether between the amine or guanidine groups and the steroid backbone also influences activity (compare 1-3, Tables 1, 2, 6 and 7). Ester tethers between amine groups and the steroid backbone provide compounds with MIC values that are higher than the corresponding compounds containing ether tethers (compare 1, 2, 6 and 7, tables 1 and 2).","The group attached to the backbone at C-20 or C-24 also influences the activity of the cholic acid derivatives. A long carbon chain attached to the steroid via an ether linkage at C-24 lowers the MIC of the compound as compared to the compound with a hydroxyl group at C-24 (compare 2, 9 and 10, Tables 1, 2, 6 and 7). Short chains of carbon or oxygen attached at C-20 decrease the MIC values of the cholic acid derivatives (compare 10 and 11, Tables 1 and 2). Covalently linking the cholic acid derivatives increases the activity of the compounds (compare 10 and 12, Tables 1 and 2).","Ability to permeabilize outer membrane: Compounds 11, 106, and 108-114 () were tested for antibiotic activity. They were also tested for the ability to permeabilize the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, causing sensitization to hydrophobic antibiotics that cannot cross the outer membrane. The permeabilization of the outer membrane was measured using erythromycin and novobiocin. These antibiotics are active against Gram-positive bacteria, but inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, due to the barrier formed by the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.","Most of the experiments were performed with K-12 strain ATCC 10798; however, to demonstrate that the activity of the cholic acid derivatives was not species dependent, the activity of selected compounds was also measured with (ATCC 27853). The MICs of erythromycin and novobiocin against (ATCC 10798) at 70 and >500 \u03bcg\/mL were measured. The threshold measure of permeabilization was the concentration of the cholic acid derivatives required to lower the MIC of either erythromycin or novobiocin to 1 \u03bcg\/mL.","Results of the MIC, MBC and permeabilization (with erythromycin) measurements are shown in  (in , Compound A is polymyxin B nonapeptide). As  illustrates, the MIC and MBC values of the compounds dropped dramatically as the length of the side chain extending from C-17 increased. The apparent role of the hydrophobic steroid side chain is to facilitate membrane insertion and self-promoted transport after initial association with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (as shown in ). Outer membrane permeabilization occurs as a result of association with the lipid A on the outer leaflet of the membrane. Permeabilization of the outer membrane alone does not cause cell death, suggesting that the compounds must pass through the outer membrane to kill bacteria. This ability to traverse the outer membrane, and thereby disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane, is required for the compounds to have lethal activity.","As observed, compounds lacking a hydrophobic side chain are less effective in killing bacteria. It is hypothesized that these compounds are capable of permeabilizing the outer membrane (i.e., associating with the lipid A on the outer leaflet of the membrane), but incapable of crossing through the outer membrane.","The fractional inhibition concentration (FIC) values of the compounds, were calculated using erythromycin and novobiocin as the secondary compounds. With the exception of 114, the compounds displayed FIC values of less than 0.5 with erythromycin, with some values near 0.05 (Table 9).","Details from studies with novobiocin are also shown in Table 9. The fact that results with erythromycin and novobiocin were comparable demonstrates that the activity of the cholic acid derivatives is not antibiotic-dependent. Similar trends were observed with (ATCC 10798) and (ATCC 27853), although, as expected, was more resistant than . These results suggest that the activity of the compounds tested is not species-dependent.","Compounds with hydrophobic alkylaminoalkyl side chains were prepared (compounds 133 and 134, ). As observed with other compounds, the incorporation of guanidine groups (in 134) increased the activity of the cholic acid derivatives as compared to compounds containing primary amines. As a control, 135 (), which did not have a hydrophobic side chain, was prepared. The MIC of the control (135) was relatively high, as expected, as was the MBC (). In contrast, the MICs of 133 and 134 were very low; in fact they rivaled PMB in activity. Notably, the MBCs of 133, 134, and PMB were very similar to the MICs; that is, at a threshold concentration these compounds killed all of the bacteria in solution.","As an additional means of demonstrating the membrane disrupting capabilities of the cholic acid derivatives 133 and 134, a luciferin\/luciferase-based cell lysis assay was used (as described in Willardson et al., 1998, 64, 1006 and Schupp et al., 1995, 19, 18). In this assay, containing an inducible luciferase coding plasmid was incubated with the inducing agent (toluene), then treated with a lysis buffer containing either PMB or one of the cholic acid derivatives, and Triton X-100. Luciferin and ATP were then added. Cell lysis resulted in luminescence. The concentrations of the membrane disrupting agents (PMB and the cholic acid derivatives) were varied, and the resulting luminescence was measured. In the absence of the membrane disrupting agents, no luminescence was observed.","The MICs of 133, 134 and PMB and the concentrations required for half maximal luminescence are shown in . As is the case with the MIC values, the compounds 133 and 134 rival PMB in activity in the luminescence assay.","Effect of sulfate group: To observe if the presence of a sulfate group at C-24 in a cholic acid derivative would increase the activity of the compounds, 132 (shown in ) was tested. The MIC of 132 with (ATCC 10798) was 60 \u03bcg\/mL. The concentration required to lower the MIC of erythromycin to 1 \u03bcg\/mL was 4.0 \u03bcg\/mL with the same strain. The antibiotic and permeabilization activities of 132 were lower than those of the parent alcohol 110 (shown in ).","Additional experiments: Additional experiments were carried out using compounds 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134. MIC and MBC data for these compounds with representative strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms are shown in Table 10. For comparison purposes, the MICs of PMB with various organisms were also measured and are presented in Table 10.","In addition to PMB, compounds 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 share some features with other steroid antibiotics. For example, squalamine includes a steroid nucleus and a polyamine side chain (Moore et al., 1993, vol. 90, 1354-1358). It is proposed that squalamine incorporates into lipid bilayers and thus disrupts the bacterial membrane. In squalamine, the polar polyamine functionality is located at the distal end of the molecule, leaving a hydrophobic core. In 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134, the amines are located on one side of the steroid, giving compounds that are facially anphiphilic. An additional series of compounds related to 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 includes cholic acid derivatives with amines at C-24 (e.g., 140 in ). In contrast to 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134, these compounds have been shown to have only weak antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains and no activity against Gram-negative strains.","The cholic acid derivatives 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 display a range of activities, some with submicrogram per milliliter MICs. With many organisms, MIC and MBC values are very similar, especially with the most active compounds. Some of the compounds have lethal activity, presumably due to disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. Others have only sublethal activity, due to permeabilization of the outer membrane.","Compounds lacking a hydrophobic chain (e.g., 106 and 10) have high MIC values, but are effective permeabilizers of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Because these compounds lack a hydrophobic chain, they have sublethal, but not lethal activity against these bacteria. Compounds with hydrophobic chains (e.g., 133 and 134) have lethal activity.","The hemolytic behavior of the cholic acid derivatives 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 suggests that they can act as membrane-disrupting agents, and their antimicrobial activity likely involves membrane disruption. With Gram-negative strains, the target of inactivity is expected to be the cytoplasmic membrane. Compounds such as 106 and 10 ineffectively cross the outer membrane and do not display lethal activity. The hydrophobic chains in 133 and 134 may facilitate self-promoted transport across the outer membrane, allowing them to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane.","The results shown in Table 10 indicate that the presence of a hydrophobic chain is much less important for lethal activity against Gram-positive strains. Without the requirement for crossing an outer membrane, compounds lacking a hydrophobic chain extending from C-17 can effectively kill Gram-positive bacteria.","Various tether lengths were investigated to determine the optimal spacing of the amine or guanidine groups from the steroid. It was found that three carbon tethers gave compounds that were more effective than those with two carbon tethers (e.g., compare the MICs of 1 with those of 2. The resultant increase in antibiotic activity upon substitution of guanidine groups for amines suggests a central role for amine\/guanidine-phosphate interactions.","The nature of the group attached to the steroid backbone at C-17 greatly influenced the activity of the compounds with Gram-negative bacteria. For example, the differences among the MIC and MBC values for 106, 10, and 112 were notable. This trend was also observed in the MIC and MCB values of 2 and 5, as compared to those of 133 and 134 (in this comparison, the benzyl groups in 2 and 5 are expected to be less hydrophobic than the octyl chains found in 133 and 134). The influence of the group attached to the steroid at C-17 is less pronounced with Gram-positive strains; e.g., 5 and 134 have similar MIC values with ","To measure permeabilization, the FIC values for compounds 1, 2, 5, 106, 10, 112, 133, and 134 with erythromycin, novobiocin, and rifampicin were determined. Concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 or 3.0 \u03bcg\/mL of these antibiotics were used, and the concentrations of the cholic acid derivatives required to inhibit bacterial growth of Gram-negative strains were determined. The concentrations required for bacterial growth inhibition and the FIC values are shown in Tables 11-13. Interestingly, the MIC values of the compounds do not directly correlate with their ability to permeabilize the outer membrane. For example, compounds 106 and 10 have relatively high MIC values, but are potent permeabilizers. Nearly all of the compounds demonstrated FIC values of less than 0.5, with some less than 0.03. The cholic acid derivatives that give relatively high FIC values (i.e., 5, 133, and 134) are themselves potent antibiotics.","Ester and amide side chains: Additional compounds, for example, compounds with amide and ester side chains, were tested. Compounds 203b, 6, and 210a (Scheme 12) displayed potent synergism with erythromycin and novobiocin (Table 14). In the triester series (203a, 203b, 6, and 7), the \u03b2-alanine derived compounds are more active than those derived from glycine. Substitution at C24 had minimal effect on the activity of these compounds (compare 203b and 7).","Triamides 209a-c (Scheme 12) were less active than the esters, possibly due to conformational constraints imposed by the amide bonds. With the triamides, substitution at C24 had significant effects on the activity of the compounds (compare 209a and 210a, Table 14). In this series, the glycine derivative was more active than the corresponding \u03b2-alanine derivative.","The relative lack of synergism displayed by the lysine derivative may be attributable to the length of the side chain. As a control, compound 211 (), a derivative of 209c lacking the \u03b1-amino group, was prepared; this compound was less active than 209c as a permeabilizer. Compound 206 also proved to be ineffective as a permeabilizer. These results suggest that the optimal length for the tether between the steroid and the amine functionality is between zero and six atoms.","Further compounds 341-343 and 324-327 were, investigated similarly. The structures of compounds 341-343 and 324-327 are shown in . The MIC of these compounds against (ATTC 25923) are presented in Table 16 as MIC, the MIC of these compounds against (ATTC 25922) are presented in Table 16 as MIC, the concentration of the compounds required to lower the MIC of erythromycin from 36 to 1 \u03bcg\/mL with is shown in Table 16 as c, and the minimum hemolytic concentration of the compounds is shown in Table 16 as MHC. Minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) and minimum hemolytic concentrations (MHC) were measured as described in Li et al., 1999, 43, 1347. The compounds in Table 16 containing a hydrophobic chain at carbon 24 (341-343) were the most active against the Gram-negative strain. The compounds with choline at carbon 24 (324-326) were much less active alone against the Gram-negative strain, yet retained the ability to inhibit the growth of the Gram-positive strain. This difference may be due to the inability of compounds 324-326 to traverse the ourter membrane of the Gram-negative strain studied here. Compound 327 was inactive. Compounds 341-343 exhibited very low MHC; however, compounds 324-326 appear to be non-hemolytic, presumably due to the additional positive charge at carbon 24. The structures of compounds 356-358 are shown in .

16.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0243","num":"0242"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE
