{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/059,614, filed on Jun. 6, 2008.","Modern data processing systems, such as general purpose computer systems, allow the users of such systems to create a variety of different types of data files. For example, a typical user of a data processing system may create text files with a word processing program such as Microsoft Word or may create an image file with an image processing program such as Adobe's PhotoShop. Numerous other types of files are capable of being created or modified, edited, and otherwise used by one or more users for a typical data processing system. The large number of the different types of files that can be created or modified can present a challenge to a typical user who is seeking to find a particular file which has been created.","Modern data processing systems often include a file management system which allows a user to place files in various directories or subdirectories (e.g. folders) and allows a user to give the file a name. Further, these file management systems often allow a user to find a file by searching for the file's name, or the date of creation, or the date of modification, or the type of file. An example of such a file management system is the Finder program which operates on Macintosh computers from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. Another example of a file management system program is the Windows Explorer program which operates on the Windows operating system from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Both the Finder program and the Windows Explorer program include a find command which allows a user to search for files by various criteria including a file name or a date of creation or a date of modification or the type of file. However, this search capability searches through information which is the same for each file, regardless of the type of file. Thus, for example, the searchable data for a Microsoft Word file is the same as the searchable data for an Adobe PhotoShop file, and this data typically includes the file name, the type of file, the date of creation, the date of last modification, the size of the file and certain other parameters which may be maintained for the file by the file management system.","Certain presently existing application programs allow a user to maintain data about a particular file. This data about a particular file may be considered metadata because it is data about other data. This metadata for a particular file may include information about the author of a file, a summary of the document, and various other types of information. A program such as Microsoft Word may automatically create some of this data when a user creates a file and the user may add additional data or edit the data by selecting the \u201cproperty sheet\u201d from a menu selection in Microsoft Word. The property sheets in Microsoft Word allow a user to create metadata for a particular file or document. However, in existing systems, a user is not able to search for metadata across a variety of different applications using one search request from the user. Furthermore, existing systems can perform one search for data files, but this search does not also include searching through metadata for those files.","Methods for managing data in a data processing system and systems for managing data are described herein.","A method of managing data in one exemplary embodiment includes displaying an icon representing a file in a graphical user interface (GUI), where the icon includes one or more predefined decorations. The decorations may be chosen based on the file type, such as slide decorations for presentations, a foldover for documents, etc. This may also be referred to as type conformance. A preview of the content of the file is presented within the icon without launching an application which has created the file (also referred to as the creator application). The pre-defined decorations on the icon may be maintained on the icon while the preview of the content of the file is presented. The format of the icon (e.g., shape of the icon, size of the icon, etc.) may be maintained as well during presentation of the preview.","In some embodiments, various user interface control are provided to allow users to manipulate the presentation of the preview within the icon. Thus, such preview is also referred to as interactive preview and the icon displaying the interactive preview are referred to as a dynamic icon. For example, if the file is a document, buttons may be provided to allow users to page through pages of the document within the icon as if one was turning the pages sequentially. Alternatively, a button may be provided to allow users to zoom into a portion of the document within the icon. Alternatively, a scroll bar may be provided to allow users to scroll up and down the document within the icon. If the file is a video, then a play button may be provided to allow users to initiate playing a preview of the video within the icon. Furthermore, a stop button may be provided to allow users to stop playing the video. In some embodiments, a status indicator, such as a ring, a bar, etc., may be provided to indicate the portion of the preview of the video played. If the file is a still image, then a thumbnail of the image may be displayed as a preview and one or more buttons may be provided to allow users to zoom in or out of the thumbnail of the image.","According to some aspects of the invention, the GUI in which the icon is displayed is associated with a client application, such as a file management application of a hierarchical file system (HFS), such as Finder from Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., and Window Explorer from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash. Via the GUI, users may manage files in the HFS. Alternatively, the GUI in which the icon is displayed is associated with a file searching application, such as Spotlight from Apple, Inc. The GUI may include a result window of the file searching application. Icons of files found by the file searching application may be displayed in the result window and previews of contents of the files, if available, are presented within the icons inside the result window. No additional window may be generated to present the preview.","In some embodiments, the metadata of the file includes a field having an indicator to indicate whether a preview of the content of the file is available. If the preview is available, then a plug-in associated with the creator application of the file is executed to present the preview within the icon. Furthermore, if the preview is interactive according to the metadata, then various user interface control may be generated to allow users to manipulate the presentation of the preview.","According to some aspects of the invention, a background process (also referred to as a daemon) may request icon data of an icon from the plug-in in response to a request from the client application. As mentioned above, the plug-in is associated with a creator application of the file. The icon data includes decorations of the icon (which may be chosen based on the file type) and metadata of the file. As mentioned above, the metadata may include a field having an indicator to indicate whether a preview of the content of the file is available. After the background process receives the icon data from the plug-in, the background process forwards the icon data to the client application. In some embodiments, the client application analyzes the metadata to determine if a preview of the content of the file is available, and if so, whether the preview is interactive. If the preview is available and is interactive, then the client application may generate an icon usable to present the preview and execute the plug-in to present the preview within the icon. User interface control appropriate for the type of content may be provided to allow users to manipulate the presentation of the preview within the icon.","In at least certain embodiments, the icon data from the plug-in further includes badge data and an image (such as a thumbnail). The badge data includes additional information on the file, the creator application of the file, and\/or a third party vendor of the creator application. For example, the badge data may include the version of the creator application. Using the badge data, a badge may be generated and displayed on the icon. For example, a badge containing a graphic image to identify a creator application (e.g., a logo of the creator application) and\/or the third party vendor (e.g., a trademark of the third party vendor) may be displayed on an icon of a file created by the creator application. Such a badge may be referred to as an image badge. Alternatively, a badge containing text of the name of the creator application may be displayed on the icon. Such a badge may be referred to as a text badge.","According to some aspects of the invention, icons representing folders may be badged as well. When an icon is created for a folder, it is determined if all files within the folder is produced by applications from a single third party vendor using badge data in icon data of icons representing the files within the folder. If so, a badge indicative of the single third party vendor is generated. Then the badge is displayed on the icon of the folder. The badge may include text, a graphic image, or a combination of both. The icon of the folder may further include decorations for folders, such as a binder.","In some embodiments, the above operations to create icons, to present previews within the icons, and to create badges for the icons are performed by a single computing machine, such as a personal computer. Alternatively, the above operations to create icons, to present previews within the icons, and to create badges for the icons are performed by various computing machines within a system. According to some aspects of the invention, a server in the system initiates an instance of a preview generator for each client machine in the system. The instance sends at least one of a preview and a thumbnail of a file to the client machine responsive to a request for the file from the client machine to allow the client machine to present the preview. The instance may generate an icon representing the file and execute a plug-in associated with a creator application of the file to present the preview within the icon so that the creator application does not have to be launched. Furthermore, the icon may be cached on the server so that other instances of the preview generator may use the same icon.","Other aspects of the present inventions include various data processing systems which perform these methods and machine readable media which cause a data processing system to perform various methods described herein.","The subject invention will be described with reference to numerous details set forth below, and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the invention. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, in certain instances, well known or conventional details are not described in order to not unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.","The present description includes material protected by copyrights, such as illustrations of graphical user interface images.

The microprocessor  may be a microprocessor from Intel or a G3 or G4 microprocessor from Motorola, Inc. or one or more G5 microprocessors from IBM. The bus  interconnects these various components together and also interconnects these components , , , and  to a display controller and display device  and to peripheral devices such as input\/output (I\/O) devices which may be mice, keyboards, modems, network interfaces, printers and other devices which are well known in the art. Typically, the input\/output devices  are coupled to the system through input\/output controllers . The volatile RAM (Random Access Memory)  is typically implemented as dynamic RAM (DRAM) which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. The mass storage  is typically a magnetic hard drive or a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive or a DVD RAM or other types of memory systems which maintain data (e.g. large amounts of data) even after power is removed from the system. Typically, the mass storage  will also be a random access memory although this is not required. While  shows that the mass storage  is a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system, it will be appreciated that the present invention may utilize a non-volatile memory which is remote from the system, such as a network storage device which is coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface. The bus  may include one or more buses connected to each other through various bridges, controllers and\/or adapters as is well known in the art. In one embodiment the I\/O controller  includes a USB (Universal Serial Bus) adapter for controlling USB peripherals and an IEEE 1394 controller for IEEE 1394 compliant peripherals.","It will be apparent from this description that aspects of the present invention may be embodied, at least in part, in software. That is, the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor, such as a microprocessor, executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory, such as ROM , RAM , mass storage  or a remote storage device. In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the present invention. Thus, the techniques are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system. In addition, throughout this description, various functions and operations are described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However, those skilled in the art will recognize what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code by a processor, such as the microprocessor .","Capturing and Use of Metadata Across a Variety of Application Programs",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","203","205","207","207"]},"The method of  may be implemented for programs which do not store or provide metadata. In this circumstance, a portion of the operating system provides for the capture of the metadata from the variety of different programs even though the programs have not been designed to provide or capture metadata. For those programs which do allow a user to create metadata for a particular document, certain embodiments of the present invention may allow the exporting back of captured metadata back into data files for applications which maintain metadata about their data files.","The method of  allows information about a variety of different files created by a variety of different application programs to be accessible by a system wide searching facility, which is similar to the way in which prior art versions of the Finder or Windows Explorer can search for file names, dates of creation, etc. across a variety of different application programs. Thus, the metadata for a variety of different files created by a variety of different application programs can be accessed through an extension of an operating system, and an example of such an extension is shown in  as a metadata processing software which interacts with other components of the system and will be described further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["301","331"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"11"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"11","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},"Mul-",{},"User",{},"Copied",{}]},{"entry":["Item","Parent in",{},{},{},"ti-",{},"set-","Get-","with","App"]},{"entry":["name","hierarchy","Attribute name","Description\/Notes","CFType","value","Localized","table","table","copy","viewable"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"11","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Item","n\/a","Authors","Who created or","CFString","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Address"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"contributed to the",{},{},{},{},{},{},"Book"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"contents of this item"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Comment","A free form text","CFString","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"comment"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ContentType","This is the type that is","CFString","No","?","No","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"determined by UTI"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ContentTypes","This is the inheritance of","CFString","Yes","?","No","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"the UTI system"]},{"entry":[{},{},"CreatedDate","When was this item","CFDate","No","No","No","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"created"]},{"entry":[{},{},"DisplayName","The name of the item as","CFString","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Finder (or"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"the user would like to",{},{},{},{},{},{},"Launch"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"read it.

formats would be a field which includes an identifier of a plug-in or other software element which may be used to capture metadata from a data file and\/or export metadata back to the creator application. Another field which may be useful in the various metadata formats would be a field which includes an indicator on whether a preview of the content of a file is available. In some embodiments, the field may further include another indicator to tell whether the preview, if available, is interactive.","Various different software architectures may be used to implement the functions and operations described herein. The following discussion provides one example of such an architecture, but it will be understood that alternative architectures may also be employed to achieve the same or similar results. The software architecture shown in  is an example which is based upon the Macintosh operating system. The architecture  includes a metadata processing software  and an operating system (OS) kernel  which is operatively coupled to the metadata processing software  for a notification mechanism which is described below. The metadata processing software  is also coupled to other software programs such as a file system graphical user interface software  (which may be the Finder), an email software , and other applications . These applications are coupled to the metadata processing software  through client application program interface  which provide a method for transferring data and commands between the metadata processing software  and the software , , and . These commands and data may include search parameters specified by a user as well as commands to perform searches from the user, which parameters and commands are passed to the metadata processing software  through the interface . The metadata processing software  is also coupled to a collection of importers  which extract data from various applications. In particular, in one exemplary embodiment, a text importer is used to extract text and other information from word processing or text processing files created by word processing programs such as Microsoft Word, etc. This extracted information is the metadata for a particular file. Other types of importers extract metadata from other types of files, such as image files or music files. In this particular embodiment, a particular importer is selected based upon the type of file which has been created and modified by an application program. For example, if the data file was created by PhotoShop, then an image importer for PhotoShop may be used to input the metadata from a PhotoShop data file into the metadata database  through the metadata processing software . On the other hand, if the data file is a word processing document, then an importer designed to extract metadata from a word processing document is called upon to extract the metadata from the word processing data file and place it into the metadata database  through the metadata processing software . Typically, a plurality of different importers may be required in order to handle the plurality of different application programs which are used in a typical computer system. The importers  may optionally include a plurality of exporters which are capable of exporting the extracted metadata for particular types of data files back to property sheets or other data components maintained by certain application programs. For example, certain application programs may maintain some metadata for each data file created by the program, but this metadata is only a subset of the metadata extracted by an importer from this type of data file. In this instance, the exporter may export back additional metadata or may simply insert metadata into blank fields of metadata maintained by the application program.","The software architecture  also includes a file system directory  for the metadata. This file system directory keeps track of the relationship between the data files and their metadata and keeps track of the location of the metadata object (e.g. a metadata file which corresponds to the data file from which it was extracted) created by each importer. In one exemplary embodiment, the metadata database is maintained as a flat file format as described below, and the file system directory  maintains this flat file format. One advantage of a flat file format is that the data is laid out on a storage device as a string of data without references between fields from one metadata file (corresponding to a particular data file) to another metadata file (corresponding to another data file). This arrangement of data will often result in faster retrieval of information from the metadata database .","The software architecture  of  also includes find by content software  which is operatively coupled to a database  which includes an index of files. The index of files represents at least a subset of the data files in a storage device and may include all of the data files in a particular storage device (or several storage devices), such as the main hard drive of a computer system. The index of files may be a conventional indexed representation of the content of each document. The find by content software  searches for words in that content by searching through the database  to see if a particular word exists in any of the data files which have been indexed. The find by content software functionality is available through the metadata processing software  which provides the advantage to the user that the user can search concurrently both the index of files in the database  (for the content within a file) as well as the metadata for the various data files being searched. The software architecture shown in  may be used to perform the method shown in  or alternative architectures may be used to perform the method of .","The method of  may begin in operation  in which a notification of a change for a file is received. This notification may come from the OS kernel  which notifies the metadata processing software  that a file has been changed. This notification may come from sniffer software elements which detect new or modified files and deletion of files. This change may be the creation of a new file or the modification of an existing file or the deletion of an existing file. The deletion of an existing file causes a special case of the processing method of  and is not shown in . In the case of a deletion, the metadata processing software , through the use of the file system directory , deletes the metadata file in the metadata database  which corresponds to the deleted file. The other types of operations, such as the creation of a new file or the modification of an existing file, causes the processing to proceed from operation  to operation  in which the type of file which is the subject of the notification is determined. The file may be an Acrobat PDF file or an RTF word processing file or a JPEG image file, etc. In any case, the type of the file is determined in operation . This may be performed by receiving from the OS kernel  the type of file along with the notification or the metadata processing software  may request an identification of the type of file from the file system graphical user interface software  or similar software which maintains information about the data file, such as the creator application or parent application of the data file. It will be understood that in one exemplary embodiment, the file system graphical user interface software  is the Finder program which operates on the Macintosh operating system. In alternative embodiments, the file system graphical user interface system may be Windows Explorer which operates on Microsoft's Windows operating system. After the type of file has been determined in operation , the appropriate capture software (e.g. one of the importers ) is activated for the determined file type. The importers may be a plug-in for the particular application which created the type of file about which notification is received in operation . Once activated, the importer or capture software imports the appropriate metadata (for the particular file type) into the metadata database, such as metadata database  as shown in operation . Then in operation , the metadata is stored in the database. In one exemplary embodiment, it may be stored in a flat file format. Then in operation , the metadata processing software  receives search parameter inputs and performs a search of the metadata database (and optionally also causes a search of non-metadata sources such as the index of files ) and causes the results of the search to be displayed in a user interface. This may be performed by exchanging information between one of the applications, such as the software  or the software  or the other applications  and the metadata processing software  through the interface . For example, the file system software  may present a graphical user interface, allowing a user to input search parameters and allowing the user to cause a search to be performed. This information is conveyed through the interface  to the metadata processing software  which causes a search through the metadata database  and also may cause a search through the database  of the indexed files in order to search for content within each data file which has been indexed. The results from these searches are provided by the metadata processing software  to the requesting application which, in the example given here, was the software , but it will be appreciated that other components of software, such as the email software , may be used to receive the search inputs and to provide a display of the search results. Various examples of the user interface for inputting search requests and for displaying search results are described herein and shown in the accompanying drawings.","It will be appreciated that the notification, if done through the OS kernel, is a global, system wide notification process such that changes to any file will cause a notification to be sent to the metadata processing software. It will also be appreciated that in alternative embodiments, each application program may itself generate the necessary metadata and provide the metadata directly to a metadata database without the requirement of a notification from an operating system kernel or from the intervention of importers, such as the importers . Alternatively, rather than using OS kernel notifications, an embodiment may use software calls from each application to a metadata processing software which receives these calls and then imports the metadata from each file in response to the call.","As noted above, the metadata database  may be stored in a flat file format in order to improve the speed of retrieval of information in most circumstances. The flat file format may be considered to be a non-B tree, non-hash tree format in which data is not attempted to be organized but is rather stored as a stream of data. Each metadata object or metadata file will itself contain fields, such as the fields shown in the examples of . However, there will typically be no relationship or reference or pointer from one field in one metadata file to the corresponding field (or another field) in the next metadata file or in another metadata file of the same file type.  shows an example of the layout in a flat file format of metadata. The format  includes a plurality of metadata files for a corresponding plurality of data files. As shown in , metadata file  is metadata from file  of application A and may be referred to as metadata file A. Similarly, metadata file  is metadata from file  of application B and may be referred to as metadata file B. Each of these metadata files typically would include fields which are not linked to other fields and which do not contain references or pointers to other fields in other metadata files. It can be seen from  that the metadata database of  includes metadata files from a plurality of different applications (applications A, B, and C) and different files created by each of those applications. Metadata files , , , and  are additional metadata files created by applications A, B, and C as shown in .","A flexible query language may be used to search the metadata database in the same way that such query languages are used to search other databases. The data within each metadata file may be packed or even compressed if desirable. As noted above, each metadata file, in certain embodiments, will include a persistent identifier which uniquely identifies its corresponding data file. This identifier remains the same even if the name of the file is changed or the file is modified. This allows for the persistent association between the particular data file and its metadata.","User Interface Aspects","Various different examples of user interfaces for inputting search parameters and for displaying search results are provided herein. It will be understood that some features from certain embodiments may be mixed with other embodiments such that hybrid embodiments may result from these combinations. It will be appreciated that certain features may be removed from each of these embodiments and still provide adequate functionality in many instances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["701","703","703","701","705","701","707","713","715","717","701","709","711","701","729","701","734","735","736","701","731","701","732","733","701","705","705","721","722","723","701","721","721"]},"The combination of text entry region  and the search parameter menu bar allow a user to specify a search query or search parameters. Each of the configurable pull down menus presents a user with a list of options to select from when the user activates the pull down menu. As shown in , the user has already made a selection from the configurable pull down menu  to specify the location of the search, which in this case specifies that the search will occur on the local disks of the computer systems. Configurable pull down menu  has also been used by the user to specify the kind of document which is to be searched for, which in this case is an image document as indicated by the configurable pull down menu  which indicates \u201cimages\u201d as the selected configuration of this menu and hence the search parameter which it specifies. The configurable pull down menu , as shown in , represents an add search parameter pull down menu. This add search parameter pull down menu allows the user to add additional criteria to the search query to further limit the search results. In the embodiment shown in , each of the search parameters is logically ANDed in a Boolean manner. Thus the current search parameter specified by the user in the state shown in  searches all local disks for all images, and the user is in the middle of the process of selecting another search criteria by having selected the add search criteria pull down menu , resulting in the display of the pull down menu , which has a plurality of options which may be selected by the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":["701","719","719","719"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 7D","FIG. 7D","FIG. 7D","FIG. 7E","FIG. 7A-7E","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A-7E","FIG. 7D"],"b":["701","719","718","718","718","717","718","717","707","718","718","718","701","717","719","713","713","707","718","717"]},"It will also be appreciated that the various options in the pull down menus may depend upon the fields within a particular type of metadata file. For example, the selection of \u201cimages\u201d to be searched may cause the various fields present in the metadata for an image type file to appear in one or more pull down menus, allowing the user to search within one or more of those fields for that particular type of file. Other fields which do not apply to \u201cimages\u201d types of files may not appear in these menus in order reduce the complexity of the menus and to prevent user confusion.","Another feature of the present invention is shown in . In particular, the side bar region A, which is the user-configurable portion of the side bar, includes a representation of a folder  which represents the search results obtained from a particular search, which search results may be static or they may be dynamic in that, in certain instances, the search can be performed again to obtain results based on the current files in the system. The folder  in the example shown in  represents a search on a local disk for all images done on December 10. By selecting this folder in the side bar region A, the user may cause the display in the display region  of the results of that search. In this way, a user may retrieve a search result automatically by saving the search result into the side bar region A. One mechanism for causing a search result or a search query to be saved into the side bar region A is to select the add folder button  which appears in the bottom portion of the window . By selecting this button, the current search result or search query is saved as a list of files and other objects retrieved in the current search result. In the case where the search query is saved for later use rather than the saving of a search result, then the current search query is saved for re-use at a later time in order to find files which match the search query at that later time.

A user may select individual files from within the display region  and associate them together as one collection. Each file may be individually marked using a specific command (e.g. pressing the right button on a mouse and selecting a command from a menu which appears on the screen, which command may be \u201cadd selection to current group\u201d) or similar such commands. By individually selecting such files or by selecting a group of files at once, the user may associate this group of files into a selected group or a \u201cmarked\u201d group and this association may be used to perform a common action on all of the files in the group (e.g. print each file or view each file in a viewer window or move each file to a new or existing folder, etc.). A representation of this marked group appears as a folder in the user-configurable portion A. An example of such a folder is the folder  shown in the user-configurable portion A. By selecting this folder (e.g. by positioning a cursor over the folder  and pressing and releasing a mouse button or by pressing another button) the user, as a result of this selection, will cause the display within the display region  of the files which have been grouped together or marked. Alternatively, a separate window may appear showing only the items which have been marked or grouped. This association or grouping may be merely temporary or it may be made permanent by retaining a list of all the files which have been grouped and by keeping a folder  or other representations of the grouping within the user-configurable side bar, such as the side bar A. Certain embodiments may allow multiple, different groupings to exist at the same time, and each of these groupings or associations may be merely temporary (e.g. they exist only while the search results window is displayed), or they may be made permanent by retaining a list of all the files which have been grouped within each separate group. It will be appreciated that the files within each group may have been created from different applications.

For example, a first representation (e.g., an icon, a dynamic icon, etc.) of a first file found by the search may contain a preview that is at least one of being resizable or zoomable or scrollable or pageable through within a display region, such as a window, which contains the results of the search.  shows an exemplary method for performing at least some of the functionality of this aspect. In operation , a user's search input is received by a data processing system which, in turn, in operation , performs the search and then presents the search results based on the user's search input. In addition, the results are presented such that, for at least one file which was found by the search, the file is represented by an icon, a dynamic icon having a preview, or other representation of the file, where the preview or the representation is at least one of resizable or zoomable or scrollable or pageable through or a combination of those capabilities. For example, if the file which is found is a picture file, then a thumbnail of the picture file may be the representation which is resizable within the search results window, such that it can be enlarged in size or decreased in size on the display device within the search results window. Further, the picture, which is a thumbnail which represents the file, may be zoomable in that the content of the representation may be zoomed in (e.g. magnified) or out (e.g. demagnified) while maintaining the same area or size of the representation. In addition or alternatively, the content in the representation may be pageable in that multiple different pages of the content may be displayed either sequentially over time by paging through the multiple pages in sequence, as if one were flipping through pages in a book, or multiple pages may be spread out concurrently. One or more of these actions may be possible, depending upon the particular type of content. Images may typically be resizable or zoomable or scrollable and may also be pageable, for example. In at least certain embodiments of the present invention, as shown in operation , the representation within the search results window may be resized or scrolled or zoomed or paged through without having to launch the application which created the content.","A preview, at least in certain embodiments, can apply to files (e.g., documents, still images, video, etc.) or other objects (e.g. records, emails, messages, vCards, etc.). A single page preview can be used for a thumbnail or in any situation where a single image is needed to provide a preview of an item. Multiple items can be previewed at once and compared, or viewed in sequence. When multiple items are previewed at once, they can be of any file type including many different file types. The previews can be shown in the same window as the search results window or in a separate window or in a layer that is overlaid above the item, shown in a search result, which is being previewed in the layer above. Alternatively, the previews of contents of files may be presented within icons and\/or dynamic icons representing the files, where the icons and\/or dynamic icons may be displayed in a window, such as the search result window.","A preview may be presented using a variety of different implementations, such as a plug-in implementation which uses one or more plug-ins, such as a QuickTime plug-in, etc. Each of the previews may be formatted in one of several standard data\/file types (such as PDF, text, HTML, JPEG, a movie format, or a sound\/music format, etc.). The previews may be either generated by the application, which created the item or file represented by the preview, when the item or file is stored or may be generated dynamically when needed. A dynamically generated preview may be produced by invoking a generator plug-in that translates the native format of the item being previewed to one of the \u201cstandard\u201d data\/file types (e.g. PDF, text, HTML, JPEG, a standard movie format, or a standard sound\/music format, etc.). A preview generator plug-in may be loaded in a separate process to protect against failures and\/or security vulnerabilities. Alternatively, a trusted generator plug-in (e.g., QuickTime), or a set of such plug-ins may be loaded directly in the process of presenting the search results and such plug-ins may be used to present the previews. A preview generator may be capable of handling multiple preview requests concurrently and the preview generator and\/or the search software controlling the search results window may manage a queue of preview requests, and the search software can cancel or reorder the preview requests in the queue.","The following figures show examples of previews or other representations which are resizable or zoomable or scrollable or pageable through.  shows an example of a preview  displayed on a display device, either within a search result window or as an overlay on the window.

The user can also switch to display multiple documents or items at once in the view of preview  by selecting the user interface control  which will cause the preview shown in  to appear similar to the preview shown in  which shows multiple documents concurrently. The preview shown in  may also be scrollable.","Previews or other representations which are resizable or scrollable or zoomable or pageable through may also be provided in other user interfaces which may include alternative types of views, such as within a dynamic icon, which is further described below.  provides an example of one method of generating dynamic icons having previews within the dynamic icons. The method may begin in block  in which an icon of a file is generated to represent the file in a graphical user interface (GUI). In block , one or more predefined decorations are put onto the icon based on the file type of the file. For example, a foldover may be put at the top right corner of the icon for documents. In block , a preview of the content of the file is presented within the icon without modifying the format of the icon. For example, the shape and size of the icon, as well as decorations on the icon, remain the same as the preview of the content of the file is presented within the icon. Unlike some existing user interface, no new window is generated to present the preview. In some embodiments, an initial view of the preview may include an image of a predetermined portion of the file, such as the first page of a document, a thumbnail of an image, a pre-selected scene in a video, etc. The initial view of the preview may also be referred to as the initial preview.","In some embodiments, the preview within the icon is interactive such that presentation of the preview may change in response to user input. Various user interface control are provided based on the file type to allow users to manipulate presentation of the preview in block . In one example, where the file is a document, a left arrow button and a right arrow button may be provided to allow users to page through the document, as if one were flipping through pages in a book sequentially. In another example, where the file is a video, a play button may be provided to allow users to initiate playing of a preview of the video. Furthermore, a stop button may be provided to allow users to stop playing the preview of the video. In another example, where the file is an image, a zoom button may be provided to allow users to zoom in and\/or zoom out of a thumbnail of the image presented in the icon. While presenting the preview in response to actuation of the user interface control, the format of the icon (e.g., size of icon, shape of icon, color of icon, etc.) is maintained at block . Furthermore, some or all of the decorations on the icon may be maintained during presentation of the preview. For example, a foldover at the top right corner of an icon of a document is maintained while users page through a preview of the document within the icon until reaching the last page of the document. When the last page of the document is presented, the foldover may be removed to indicate that the last page of the document is being presented. Alternatively, a status indicator is provided to inform users of the status of the presentation of the preview. For instance, a status bar or a status ring may be provided to indicate the portion of a preview of a video that has been played. Details of some examples of dynamic icons are shown in  and A-E below.","In some embodiments, the dynamic icons created according to the method described above are displayed in GUIs associated with hierarchical file system (HFS) management application, such as the Finder program from Apple, Inc., of Cupertino, Calif., which operates on the Macintosh operating system. In alternate embodiments, the HFS management application may be Windows Explorer, which operates on Microsoft's Windows operating system. For example, a GUI associated with a HFS management application may include a window displaying dynamic icons to represent files inside a directory. Users of the GUI may readily preview the content of a file within a respective dynamic icon without opening another window or viewing panel. Alternatively, the dynamic icons are displayed in GUIs associated with a file searching application, such as the Spotlight program from Apple, Inc., of Cupertino, Calif. For example, files resulted from a search by the file searching application may be represented by dynamic icons displayed in a search result window. As such, users of the file searching application may readily preview the content of the files inside their respective dynamic icons without opening another window or viewing panel within the same window.","In some embodiments, the preview is provided in the metadata of the file. As mentioned above, the metadata of the file may include a field which includes an indicator of whether a preview of the content of the file is available. Furthermore, the field may include an indicator of whether the preview, if available, is interactive. If an interactive preview of the content of the file is available according to these indicators, a client application may turn a thumbnail into a live preview of the content.  illustrates one embodiment of a call diagram to change a thumbnail of a file to live preview. Specifically,  illustrates the interaction between a client application  (on the left of ), a daemon  (in the middle of ), and a plug-in  (on the right of ). Some examples of the client application  include a HFS management application and a file searching application. The daemon  may include a GUI creating daemon, such as Quick Look daemon, which operates on the Macintosh operating system. The plug-in  is associated with an application that has created the file (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe creator application\u201d). Note that there may be multiple plug-ins available in the operating system, each plug-in associated with a distinct application usable to create files (e.g., word processing application, video editing application, etc.).","Initially, the client application  interrogates the daemon , which is a process running in the background, for icon data of an icon representing a file .

The icon data includes decorations to be put onto the icon and image metadata indicative of whether a preview of the content of the file is available. The daemon  then forwards the icon data  to the client application . Using the icon data, the client application  may generate the decorations to put onto the icon and determine if a preview of the content of the file is available. If the preview is available, the client application  may present the preview in the icon and provide appropriate user interface control to allow users to manipulate the preview.

Badges associated with icons allow third parties that provide creator applications of files to provide more information, in addition to file types, to icon generating software. For example, third parties may indicate in badge data which version of creator applications are used to create the files, and hence, the icon generating software may generate and display an appropriate badge on icons representing the files.  shows one embodiment of a method to badge icons. In block , an application receives icon data of a file from a plug-in associated with a creator application of the file. The application may include a user interface generator (e.g., Quick Look application from Apple, Inc., of Cupertino, Calif.) to generate a user interface for displaying icons of files for another application, such as Finder application from Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., Spotlight application from Apple, Inc., Window Explorer program from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., etc. The icon data includes file type information, badge data of the file, and an image associated with the file (e.g., a thumbnail, a pre-selected scene of a video, a pre-selected page of a document, etc.). The icon data may be provided as part of the metadata of the file.","In block , decorations for the icon are selected based on the file type. This may also be referred to as type conformance. For example, if a file is recognized as a presentation (e.g., Powerpoint files from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., Keynote files from Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., etc.) according to the file type information, then a slide decoration is provided to the icon of the file. In another example, if a file is recognized as a document (e.g., MSWord files from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., Pages files from Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., etc.) according to the file type information, then a binder decoration is provided to the icon of the file.","In addition to the file type, the badge data in the icon data provides more information on the file, the creator application, and\/or a third party vendor providing the creator application. Via badge data, the third party vendor may provide more hints on the file in addition to the file type. For example, the badge data may indicate the identity of the third party vendor, a version of the creator application, etc. Using the badge data, a badge is generated in block . The badge may include graphics, text, or a combination of both, to represent the third party, the creator application, and\/or other hints provided in the badge data. A badge that includes only graphics is referred to as an image badge. A badge that includes only text is referred to as a text badge.","In block , an icon of the file is generated. Then the image, the badge, and the decorations selected above are displayed on the icon. Via the image, the icon may provide users with an initial preview of the file. Via the decorations, the icon may indicate the file type to users. Via the badge, the icon may convey additional hints about the file to users. Note that all of the above information on the file may be conveyed to users by a display of the icon without user intervention. Users do not have to request the above information and there is no need to open another window or viewing panel to display the above information.","Using badges, the third party vendor may ensure icons of files created by its applications are badged in similar way. Thus, badges allow the third party vendor to provide a substantially uniform look and feel for icons of files created by the third party's applications.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a folder containing only files created by applications from a single third party may be badged as well. As such, users may easily determine the content of the folder without opening the folder.  shows one embodiment of a method to badge a folder. The method may begin in block  in which an icon representing a folder is created. In block , it is determined if all files within the folder are created by applications from the same third party vendor, such as Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., etc. If not all files within the folder are created by applications from the same vendor, then the icon of the folder is not badged. The icon of the folder is displayed without any badges in block .","If all files within the folder are created by the same application or applications from the same third party vendor, then the icon of the folder is badged accordingly. In block , a badge indicative of the vendor is created. The badge may include graphics, text, or a combination of both. For example, if all files within the folder are created by applications from Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., then a badge including the graphic logo representing Apple, Inc. may be created. In block , the badge created is displayed on the icon of the folder. Decorations of the folder may also be displayed on the icon of the folder with the badge. Some exemplary embodiments of badged icons are illustrated in .","Referring to , one embodiment of an image badge on an exemplary icon is shown.

Other decorations may be chosen based on the file type in alternate embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0127"},"figref":"FIG. 30B","b":["3050","3060","3050","3050","3054","3050","3052","3050","3050"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 30C","b":["3070","3074","3072","3070"]},"System Architecture","As described above, these previews or thumbnails may be shown by a set of software routines such as a set of plug-ins, which are separate from a file management software program, such as Finder or Windows Explorer. This separation between the plug-ins which renders the content and Finder or other file management software provides security and stability because, for example, if the plug-in crashes, Finder may not. These plug-ins may be a standard set of plug-ins that translate the native format of an item being previewed into one of a standard data\/file type, such as PDF, text, HTML, JPG, a standard movie format or a standard sound\/music format or into fully rendered content (e.g., a bitmap). The set of plug-ins may be an extensible set of plug-ins and may interact with the file management software, such as Finder or Windows Explorer, through a set of APIs in which the file management software makes a call to a plug-in management daemon which receives the call or API from the file management software (or other software program) and which, in turn, asks for the file type (e.g., UTI) from a file system kernel and matches one of the plug-ins in the standard set of plug-ins, which may be extensible, with the file type and which then calls the matched plug-in to cause the plug-in to load and return the content of the file (either in an immediately displayable form or in a standard format) as a preview to the file management software which, in turn, causes the preview to be displayed in, for example, an icon representing the file and\/or the cover flow view. This may occur in response to merely browsing the files through the use of the file management software, such as Finder, or through the use of a search software program, such as Spotlight, to find files and then display previews or thumbnails of files retrieved by the search. As noted above, the preview or thumbnail may be generated dynamically upon request rather than when the item or file is stored or created by the application. This dynamic generation may be through an API. It will be understood that a dynamic generation of a preview or thumbnail may be provided without invoking or launching the application which created the file or document. Examples of software architectures to dynamically generate previews are discussed in conjunction with  below.","In addition to a file management software program or a search software program, such as Spotlight, other software application programs may provide or use application programming interfaces (API) to request the preview generator or preview daemon to provide a preview or thumbnail of the content of a file within their windows. For example, an email program or a calendar program or a video conferencing application or an instant messaging application program or other application programs may also make a call to the preview generator or preview generator daemon to provide the content of a particular file in the manner described herein. In response to the call through an API from the email program or the calendar program or other program, the preview generator or preview generator daemon asks the file system for the file type and matches the file type with a plug-in having an ability to process that file type and causes that plug-in to be loaded (for example, by calling the plug-in through another optional API). The plug-in, in turn, processes the content of the file to generate the preview or thumbnail and provides that content to the original application which requested the content, such as the email program or a calendar program or, as noted above, a file management software. A preview, such as an interactive preview in a dynamic icon (e.g., the dynamic icons shown in  and ) or thumbnail may be provided in an inline preview manner in a particular view of a HFS management program, such as the cover flow view, a list view, such as the list view shown in  (which includes a preview or thumbnail view) or in a \u201cget information\u201d or \u201cproperties\u201d panel or window or in other uses.","In some embodiments, an interactive preview may be presented through the following set of software routines while also showing an initial set of previews. For example, thumbnails of files may be the initial set of previews shown in a particular view (e.g. list view, cover flow view, icon view), and the set of software routines provide an interactive preview, within the same view, for at least one of these initial previews. The initial previews may also be provided by this set of software routines, but these initial previews may not be interactive with the view; for example, they are not interactive within the view, in response to user commands so they will not, in response to user commands, allow a user to page through or scroll through or browse through the content or to zoom or resize the content or playback the content, such as playback the movie. On the other hand, the interactive preview is interactive in response to user commands in that it can respond to a user command to page through or scroll through or browse or resize or zoom the document represented by the interactive preview or playback the content, either within the particular view (e.g. a list view or cover flow view or icon view (see, e.g.  and A-E)) or zoom out from the particular view or be layered over the particular view. Such user interface for showing both initial previews and interactive previews may be used in a list view or icon view, such as a list view or icon view of files or folders from a search result or a list view or icon view of files and folders from within a file management software window (e.g. a Finder window).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0132"},"figref":"FIG. 31","b":["3001","3011","3012","3011","3003","3007","3007","3011","3003","3005","3010","3009","3003","3011"]},"In some embodiments, all modules in the above software architecture  are implemented and executed on a single individual computing machine, such as a personal computer.
