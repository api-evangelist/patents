title: Method for compressing the dynamic range of measured signals
abstract: A sonar system is provided with the system having comparatively reduced power consumption, data bandwidth and data storage requirements. A sensor array of the system is configured to a sleep mode, low-resolution mode and high-resolution mode. In the sleep mode, all sonar sensors are configured in the mode and no acoustic signals are detected or processed. In the low-resolution mode, a limited number of sonar sensors are powered and acoustic signals received by the sensors are processed with reduced bandwidth and dynamic range, and then stored on a data storage device. In the high-resolution mode, the acoustic signals detected by the sonar sensors are processed with full signal bandwidth and dynamic range and then stored on the data storage device. A 10 bit mu-Law encoding scheme is used to reduce the amplitude scale of measurement or dynamic range of the digitized acoustic signals.

No. 13\/567,306 filed on Aug. 6, 2012 and entitled \u201cSonar Sensor Array and Method of Operating Same\u201d by the common inventors, Timothy B, Straw, Michael J. Obara and Stephen A. Caldwell.","None.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to sonar sensor arrays and more particularly, to a method of use for a sonar sensor array that has reduced power consumption, bandwidth and data storage requirements.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Acoustic sonar sensors are used for many purposes and in a variety of environments. For example, acoustic sonar sensors are used on surface ships and in underwater applications such as line arrays, submarines and unmanned undersea vehicles. Such acoustic sensors are used to detect ships, marine life, marine geology, and other underwater sound sources. The sonar sensors are typically fixed in either a linear arrangement or in a structure that conforms to a hull of a host vehicle.","Current acoustic and other type sonar sensors require a fixed amount of power to operate with the result of a fixed measurement data-rate for a given application. In some applications, the measured signal of interest is present for relatively short periods of time followed by relatively long periods of time in which there is no signal of interest. Sonar sensor arrays that are configured to continuously acquire and record sensor data consume significant amounts of electrical power and utilize large amounts of available memory.","In such sensor arrays, the sensors are constantly powered since signal monitoring continuously occurs. Therefore, the sensor arrays are very inefficient with the result of limited operating time for battery-powered systems wherein a finite amount of electrical energy is available. Furthermore, these existing sensor arrays are constricted by a data-playback restriction such that only a limited amount of playback bandwidth is available for a specific application.","Accordingly, it is general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a sonar sensor array and method of use that addresses the operational deficiencies of prior art sensor arrays.","To attain the objects described, the present invention is directed to a sonar sensor array that utilizes significantly less electrical power, bandwidth and data memory. The sensor array may be configured in any one of three operational modes depending on environmental conditions and programmed system parameters.","A first of the three modes is a sleep mode in which sonar sensors of the array are turned off (not powered) and no monitoring of acoustic signals occurs. The sleep mode is used when there are significantly long periods of time between appearances of targets. A second mode is a low-resolution mode in which a limited number of sonar sensors are activated and acoustic signals are sampled and digitized using reduced bandwidth and dynamic range. Digitized acoustic signal data is stored on a data storage device. A third mode is a high-resolution mode in which all sonar sensors are activated and acoustic signals are sampled and digitized with full bandwidth and full dynamic range. The digitized acoustic signal data is then stored in the data storage device.","In one embodiment, the sonar sensor array cycles between the low-resolution mode and the high-resolution mode wherein processing of the high-resolution mode does not occur unless processing of the low-resolution mode determines the presence of a target of interest. In another embodiment, the sonar sensor array cycles between the sleep mode and high-resolution mode. In such an embodiment, the sonar array system remains in the sleep mode for a predetermined amount of time and then shifts to low-resolution mode. If no acoustic energy representing a target is detected; the sensor reverts to sleep mode. If acoustic energy, representing a target, is detected; the sonar sensor array immediately shifts into high-resolution mode signal processing.","Thus, the present invention is directed to a sonar sensor array that comprises a plurality of sonar sensors, wherein each sensor can be configured to a powered mode in which the sensor detects acoustic signals or to a sleep mode in which the sensor receives no electrical power and does not detect acoustic signals.","The sonar sensor array further comprises a data acquisition device having a signal processor and a data storage device. The signal processor samples and digitizes the acoustic signals received by the sensors and the digitized signal data is stored on the storage device. The data acquisition device is configured to operate in a low-resolution mode of signal processing in which acoustic signals received by the sonar sensors are processed by the signal processor at reduced bandwidth and dynamic range, and then stored on the data storage device. The data acquisition device is also configured to operate in a high-resolution mode in which the acoustic signals received by the sonar sensors are processed by the full signal bandwidth and dynamic range and then stored on the memory device.","The sonar array system further comprises a control circuit for configuring the sonar sensors to the sleep mode or to the powered mode. The control circuit also configures the data acquisition device to the low-resolution mode or to the high-resolution mode depending upon the amplitude level of the detected acoustic signals and whether the detected acoustic signals indicate the presence of a target of interest. During the low-resolution mode, the control circuit configures a limited number of sonar sensors to the powered mode. During the high-resolution mode, the control circuit configures all of the sonar sensors to the powered mode.","In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of processing acoustic signals with the steps of: being provided acoustic signals; sampling the provided signals at a sample rate to produce sampled acoustic signals; digitizing the sampled signals to produce digitized acoustic signals having a first predetermined format and a first amplitude scale of measurement; and compressing the digitized acoustic signals with a 10-bit mu-Law encoding scheme to produce compressed signals having a second amplitude scale of measurement. The method further comprises expanding the compressed signals to produce expanded digital signals having a second predetermined format and processing the expanded digital signals to extract target information.","Referring to , there is shown a sonar system  in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The system  comprises a line array  that has a plurality of sonar sensors . Each sensor  has a corresponding electronic circuit  that contains a switch that, when closed, allows electrical power to be applied to the sensor so as to activate the sensor. When the sensor  is activated; the sensor is in the powered mode. When the switch is open, electrical power is removed from the sensor ; thereby, turning off the sensor. In use, the array of sonar sensors  could be a line array or a planar array.","When the sensor  is off or deactivated; the sensor is in the sleep mode. Each electronic circuit  is capable of receiving a control signal that allows the switch to configure the corresponding sensor to the sleep mode or to the powered mode. Each circuit  includes an output port for providing the acoustic signals sensed by the sonar sensor . A power source  provides electrical power to the circuits  and other components of the array . The power source  is typically a battery of fixed capacity.","The sensor array system  further comprises a data acquisition device  which samples, digitizes and records signals received from the sensors . The acquisition device  comprises a signal processor  and a data storage device . The signal processor  is in data signal communication with the storage device  via a data bus . The signal processor  samples and digitizes acoustic signals.","In one embodiment, the signal processor  is programmed with algorithms such as Fast Fourier Transform or Discrete Fourier Transform. The storage device  may be a non-volatile memory or other suitable memory device. In a preferred embodiment, the data storage device  includes stored data relating to known target signatures or target characteristics. In such an embodiment, the signal processor  compares recently processed acoustic signals with pre-stored data that relates to known target signatures in order to determine if a particular target is or has been in the environment.","The data acquisition device  can be configured to a sleep mode in which some circuitry of the acquisition device is disabled to reduce electrical power consumption. In the sleep mode, no signal processing occurs and thus, no data storage space of the storage device  is used. When the data acquisition device  is configured to the sleep mode, all of the sonar sensors  are configured to the sleep mode with the result of significantly reducing power consumption.","The data acquisition device  can be configured to operate in a high-resolution mode. In the high-resolution mode, all channels (i.e., all of the sonar sensors ) are in the active or powered mode and the signal processor  samples and digitizes acoustic signals with full signal bandwidth and full dynamic range. All data is then stored to the data storage device  for later use.","The data acquisition device  can be configured to a low-resolution mode. In the low-resolution mode, the electrical power and data record bandwidth are significantly reduced. In this mode, only a limited number of the sonar sensors  are powered. In one embodiment of the low-resolution mode, the signal bandwidth is reduced by reducing the signal sample rate, for example, by a factor of 5:1. In another embodiment of the low-resolution mode, a second data rate reduction is effected by compressing the amplitude scale of the measurement, for example, by converting 24-bit linear to 8-bit compounded resolution. This achieves a reduction by a factor of 3:1 in data rate.","The combination of reduced bandwidth and reduced amplitude resolution has an improvement in reduced data rate by a factor of 15:1 compared to the high-resolution mode. In the low-resolution mode, data volume is also further reduced by the utilization of only a limited number of sonar sensors  in the powered mode. This is because a line array of sensors  is typically designed with a physical spacing related to the upper design frequency of interest. The sonar sensor system  can be configured so that only every third, or every fourth, or every fifth, etc. one of the sonar sensors  is configured to the powered mode while the remaining sonar sensors are configured to the sleep mode. The reduction in signal bandwidth (by a factor of 5:1 by reducing the sampling rate in combination with using a limited number of powered sensors ) results in an aggregate data-rate reduction by a factor of 45:1 to 75:1.","The low-resolution mode may be implemented by simultaneously reducing the sampling rate and compressing the amplitude scale of measurement. The signal processor  is programmable and can be configured to the sleep mode, low-resolution mode or high-resolution mode upon receipt of a signal from a control circuit . The sleep mode allows for a periodic time window between the high-resolution mode and the low-resolution mode, or between successive periods of high-resolution modes, in order to further reduce electrical power and is effective when the signal of interest is slowly varying over the time span of several cycles of the high-resolution mode, low-resolution mode and sleep mode.","The control circuit  comprises an energy detector , comparison circuitry  and control signal circuitry . A data bus  is in data signal communication with the signal processor  and the control signal circuitry . A data bus  is in data signal communication with the circuits  which are associated with the sonar sensors . The control signal circuitry  issues digital control signals by the data bus  to change the mode of the signal processor  to the sleep, low-resolution or high-resolution modes.","In a preferred embodiment, the control signal circuitry  is programmable and has a data storage device such as a read-only-memory or other type of non-volatile memory for storing pre-programmed sequences of operation. The signal circuitry  also outputs digital control signals over the data bus  to configure the sonar sensors  to the sleep mode or to the powered mode. The energy detector  detects acoustic signals received by powered sonar sensors  and outputs a signal waveform  that represents the detected acoustic signals.","In one embodiment, the energy detector  comprises a frequency-selective band-pass filter and an averaging circuit. The averaging circuit produces the slowly varying signal waveform  that is proportional to the input of the band-pass filter. The pass-band of the bandpass filter is adjusted to a band of frequencies associated with a target of interest.","The comparator circuitry  compares the amplitude level of the signal waveform  to a predetermined threshold level or reference voltage. If the amplitude level of the signal waveform  exceeds the threshold, then a target is present and the comparison circuitry  issues a signal  to the control signal circuitry  that indicates a target is present. In response, the signal circuitry  outputs a control signal over the data bus  that shifts the operation of the data acquisition device  to the high-resolution mode (in order to determine if a target signature is present) and outputs control signals over the data bus  to configure all sonar sensors to the powered mode.","If the amplitude level of the signal waveform  is less than or equal to the predetermined threshold; then a target is not present and the comparison circuitry  outputs the signal . The signal  indicates a target is not present. In response, the control signal circuitry  outputs a control signal over the data bus  that maintains the data acquisition device  in the low-resolution mode and outputs control signals to maintain a predetermined number of sonar sensors  in the sleep mode.","In an alternate embodiment, the sonar sensor array  includes additional feedback circuitry to automatically adjust or vary the predetermined threshold level or reference voltage to account for variations in ambient noise levels. The sensor array  can include additional feedback circuitry to automatically adjust or vary the predetermined threshold level or reference voltage to account for variations in ambient noise level.","If the sensor array  is to be configured in the sleep mode; then the signal circuitry  outputs a control signal over the data bus  that configures the acquisition device  to the sleep mode and outputs control signals by the data bus  that configure all the sonar sensors  to the sleep mode.","If the system  is to be used in a slowly varying environment where a target of interest may be expected to appear; the circuitry  can be programmed to continuously cycle the acquisition device  between the sleep mode and the low-resolution mode at an appropriate rate and duty cycle. In such an embodiment, the circuitry  is programmed to periodically output control signals by the data bus  that powers a limited number of the sensors .","The energy detector  monitors for a pre-programmed increase in acoustic signal levels. The low-resolution mode processes the acoustic signals to determine if a target of interest is actually present. If a target is present, the circuit  automatically shifts the acquisition device  into the high-resolution mode to make a more precise measurement of the characteristics of the acoustic signals in order to determine if a known target signature is present.","In one embodiment, the circuit  is programmed to the acquisition device  so that the acquisition device cycles between the low-resolution and high-resolution modes without using the sleep mode. This embodiment is suited to environments that have slowly varying targets. The result is a maximum amount of relevant information being recorded but with a minimum of data volume.","Referring to , there is shown a flow chart of the operation of the sonar sensor array  in accordance with the invention. As a reference point, the acquisition device  may be configured into the sleep mode numerous times during a period of operation (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, etc.). In step , all sonar sensors  and the data acquisition device  are in the sleep mode for a predetermined amount of time T. Next, in step , after the time T elapses, the signal circuitry  issues a control signal to power a limited number of sonar sensors  and also issues a control signal to configure the acquisition device  to the low-resolution mode.","If the energy detector  detects acoustic signals from the powered sonar sensors ; the low-resolution mode processes these signals to determine if a target of interest is present. In step , if it is determined that a target of interest is not present; then the circuitry  issues control signals that configure all the sonar sensors  and the data acquisition device  to the sleep mode. If in step , it is determined that a target is present, then in step , the circuitry  issues control signals to power all the sonar sensors  and to configure the data acquisition device  to the high-resolution mode for a predetermined amount of time T. In the high-resolution mode, the acoustic signals received by the sonar sensors  are processed to determine if a target signature is present and then recorded. If in step , it is determined that a target signature is not present; the circuitry  issues control signals that configure all the sonar sensors  and the data acquisition device  to the sleep mode. If in step , it is determined that a target signature is present; then step  implements a predetermined time delay T and then returns to the high-resolution mode processing in step . The high-resolution mode processing will continue for another time segment T. After the predetermined time segment T elapses; step  again determines if a target signature is still present.","If a target signature is still present, then step  initiates another time delay T. Thus, steps ,  and  form a loop that continues until a target signature is no longer present, in which case the control signal circuitry  will shift the data acquisition device  and the sonar sensors  back to the sleep mode. The circuitry  can be programmed to continuously cycle between the sleep mode and low-resolution mode until the low-resolution mode processing determines a target of interest is present. In such an embodiment, steps ,  and  are repeated until step  determines that a target is present, in which case high-resolution processing is implemented.","The control signal circuitry  may be programmed to cycle the sonar array system  between the sleep mode and the high-resolution mode. This embodiment is suitable when there are targets of interest that are infrequent and slow moving. In this embodiment, the high-resolution mode is activated in an intermittent manner wherein data is recorded in short segments separated by time periods in which there is no data recording. This embodiment is useful in environments where there is a high signal-to-noise ratio. In such an embodiment, the circuitry  maintains the sonar array system  in the sleep mode for a predetermined amount of time and then is configured to the high-resolution mode for a predetermined amount of time.","If high-resolution mode processing detects a target signature; then the system  will enter the loop defined by steps ,  and . If the high-resolution processing does not detect a target signature; the circuitry  configures the sonar sensors  and the data acquisition device  to the sleep mode. The control signal circuitry  will continue this pattern in accordance with a stored program of operation.","The present invention is significantly more efficient than prior art sonar array systems.  depicts an example of the differences in operation between a prior art legacy system and the sonar sensor array  for a twenty-four hour period. In the example, the circuitry  cycles the modes of operation between the low-resolution and high-resolution modes. In the legacy system: the system is operating constantly for twenty four hours; all channels (i.e., all sonar sensors) are constantly powered; the amplitude scale of measurement is always 24 bits; the bandwidth is constantly 500 Hz; the sample rate is constantly 1250 SPS (samples\/second); the power consumption is 100% and the data rate is 40 KB\/SEC (kilobytes per second). At the end of the operational period, the legacy system records 3398 MB of data. This inefficient performance is contrasted with the very efficient operation of the sonar sensor array . In this example, the sonar sensor array  is cycled between the low-resolution mode and the high-resolution mode. As apparent by the data shown in the figure, the low-resolution mode detects a suspected target ten times per day and the high-resolution mode is activated only for a ten-second period for each target detected during the low-resolution mode.","In this example, the sonar sensor array  is configured such that the sleep mode is not used and the control signal circuitry  cycles the operation between the low-resolution mode and high-resolution mode depending upon how many times the low-resolution mode detects a suspected target. As shown in , the low-resolution mode operates over a twenty-four hour period as does the legacy system, but the low-resolution mode operates at periodic intervals wherein the duration of each period of low-resolution processing is 100 seconds.","The low-resolution mode is implemented when the energy detector  detects acoustic signals from the powered sonar sensors . A reduced number of the sonar sensors  are utilized in the low-resolution mode which yields a 5:1 reduction in active channels. The amplitude scale of measurement is 8 bits, the bandwidth is 100 Hz and the sample rate is 250 SPS (samples per second). The power consumption in this mode is only ten percent of the power consumption of the prior art legacy system. The resulting data rate is 0.73 KB\/SEC and the amount of data actually recorded is 61.7 MB. If the low-resolution mode determines there is a target; then the control circuit  shifts the signal processing function to the high-resolution mode.","In the high-resolution mode, all of the sonar sensors  are powered (all channels are active), the amplitude scale of measurement is 24 bits, the sample rate is 1250 SPS (samples\/second) and the data rate is 40 KB\/SEC. Although these operational characteristics are the same as the prior art legacy system; the high-resolution mode is implemented for periods of ten seconds for each target detected by low-resolution mode processing. In this example, ten targets are detected in a twenty-four hour period. This means high-resolution mode processing occurs for a total of 100 seconds in a twenty-four hour period. During each ten-second period in which high-resolution mode processing is implemented, the power consumption is 100% and the data rate is 40 KB\/SEC. However, the total amount of data collected in the high-resolution mode is 3.9 MB. As a result of cycling between the low-resolution and high-resolution modes, only 65.6 MB of data is recorded and the total power consumption over a twenty-four hour period is 10.1% of the total power consumed by the legacy system over a twenty-four hour period.","In an alternate embodiment, the sonar sensor array  performs an initial spectral analysis of the acoustic signals detected by the sonar sensors  during low-resolution mode processing in order to confirm that high-resolution mode processing is warranted. In such an embodiment, the system  includes a spectrum analysis device that processes the acoustic signals received by the sonar sensors  and outputs a signal for input into the control circuit  wherein the signal indicates whether high-resolution mode signal processing is warranted.","The present invention provides many advantages and benefits. One advantage is a reduction in overall power consumption of the sonar sensor array ; thereby, extending the lifetime of batteries. Another advantage is the significant reduction of the aggregate data bandwidth; thereby, resulting in relaxed data storage requirements and a decreased load on data processors or transmitters. Data having a low probability of containing signals of interest is either not recorded or is recorded at a reduced data rate; thereby, simplifying future data playback and processing tasks. As a result of the reduced amount of acquired data, lower bandwidth data-exfiltration techniques become viable.","In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a preferred signal compression scheme is now presented which may be utilized by the sonar sensor array  as well as other acoustic signal detection and processing systems. This signal compression scheme compresses the dynamic range of acoustic signals digitized by a high-performance analog-to-digital converter (e.g., 24 bits) into 10 bits of amplitude without a loss of useful information.","Underwater acoustic signals can cover a wide dynamic range depending on local conditions such as ambient noise, merchant shipping, and the presence of active sonar. The instantaneous dynamic range requirement of underwater acoustic signals is typically much less than the total possible range of signal and noise levels. In particular, conditions of very large signals are accompanied by large background noise levels and likewise, very small signal levels are not detectable in the presence of large background noise levels, but are detectable with low ambient noise levels. In addition, the processing and display limits associated with beamformed sonar arrays characteristically exhibit an additional limit on the useable instantaneous dynamic range in underwater acoustic systems. Specifically, large interfering signals in one direction will appear in the side lobes for beams pointing in other directions. Typical side lobes may only be 30 dB down, indicating a processing and display dynamic range of 30 dB. Some currently used sonar towed arrays utilizes 8-bit mu-Law data compression, which has at best approximately 40 dB of instantaneous dynamic range.","Conventional compression of amplitude-quantized data is typically accomplished with 8-bit mu-Law encoding. Ideal 8-bit mu-Law encoding typically provides about 78 dB of total dynamic range (based on a full scale of \u00b18031\/2 counts) and about 40 dB of instantaneous dynamic range. Table 1 shows all 128 possible amplitude values for 8-bit mu-Law coding after expansion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Chord","0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7"]},{"entry":["Steps",{},"000","001","010","011","100 ","101","110","111"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"10"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"14pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"14pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0","0000","0","33","99","231","495","1023","2079","4191"]},{"entry":["1","0001 ","2","37","107 ","247","527","1087","2207","4447"]},{"entry":["2","0010","4","41","115","263","559","1151","2335","4703"]},{"entry":["3","0011","6","45","123","279","591","1215","2463","4959"]},{"entry":["4","0100","8","49","131 ","295 ","623","1279","2591","5215"]},{"entry":["5","0101","10","53","139","311","655","1343","2719","5471"]},{"entry":["6","0110","12","57","147","327","687","1407","2847","5727"]},{"entry":["7","0111","14","61","155","343","719","1471","2975","5983"]},{"entry":["8","1000 ","16","65","163","359","751","1535","3103","6239"]},{"entry":["9","1001 ","18","69","171","375 ","783","1599","3231","6495"]},{"entry":["10 ","1010 ","20","73","179","391","815","1663","3359","6751"]},{"entry":["11 ","1011 ","22","77","187","407","847","1727","3487","7007"]},{"entry":["12","1100","24","81 ","195","423","879","1791","3615","7263"]},{"entry":["13","1101","26","85 ","203","439 ","911","1855","3743","7519"]},{"entry":["14","1110","28","89 ","211","455","943","1919","3871","7775"]},{"entry":["15","1111","30","93 ","219","471","975","1983","3999","8031"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"An example of the 8-bit mu-Law encoding signal-to-noise ratio is shown in .

The analog-to-digital converter  converts the detected acoustic signals  into a 24-bit digital data stream\u2014indicated by reference number . The digital data stream  is then fed into the filter  which filters out any DC offset voltages that are present in the 24-bit digital data stream. The filtered 24-bit digital data stream, indicated by reference number , is then fed to the encoder  wherein the amplitude scale of measurement of the 24-bit digital data stream is compressed using a 10-bit mu-Law encoding scheme. Thus, the encoder  converts 24-bit linear to 10-bit mu-Law in accordance with the steps shown in .","The encoder  outputs a 10-bit digital data stream, indicated by reference number .

This analysis shows an RMS dynamic range of 113 dB. The simulation was performed on full linear encoding, 8-bit mu-Law encoding, and on 10-bit mu-Law encoding. The ensuing simulations actually use 20-bit linear encoding rather than 24-bit linear encoding. The reason for this is that although commercially available, high-performance analog-to-digital converters provide 24-bits of amplitude resolution, the four lower order bits (i.e., 21-24 bits) represent added noise in the amplitude quantization process. The best performing analog-to-digital converters, suitable for sonar applications, exhibit approximately 20-bits of true amplitude quantization. Therefore, the ensuing simulations use 20-bit linear encoding. The results are shown in , which include the time domain and frequency domain analysis of a pure 83.7 Hz sine wave with: \u2212120 dB additive noise for the three encoding schemes; 20-bit linear encoding, the industry standard 8-bit mu-Law encoding scheme after reconstruction; and the 10-bit mu-Law encoding after reconstruction.

By comparison, for the case where the analog-to-digital converter full scale is 2 volts, bit levels in the 000 chord correspond to approximately 1 microvolt step size. Therefore, in order to resolve this issue, a single digital high-pass filter is used to remove the DC offset voltages. It has been found that a single pole, infinite impulse response (IIR) filter of 1 Hz-3 Hz is suitable for removing the DC offset voltages.
