{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention generally relate to devices, systems, and methods for displaying information on a computer relating to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). More particularly, the invention relates to systems and methods for providing a user interface that displays at least one element representing context sensitive characteristics of the UPS, such as backup battery information.","Many battery-powered computing devices, such as laptop personal computers (PC's), include power management software programs that allow the user of the device to monitor the battery power for these devices. For example, some power management software products can provide \u201con screen\u201d displays indicating, for example, the levels of battery charge and battery current, or the time remaining on battery. These features are important to users who want to save data before power is lost or who want to be aware when particular actions (such as accessing a CD-ROM) increase the power usage.","For users of computing devices that use sources of power other than batteries (e.g., commercial electric power), power management and monitoring can still be important. Many computing devices are operably coupled to backup power sources such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS's). An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a type of power supply used to power and protect an electrical load that is sensitive to fluctuations in or the absence of electrical power. The UPS can be connected between the load and a source of electrical power, such as a main power source or other commercially provided electric power. The UPS uses commercially supplied AC power to charge a DC battery and provide the AC power to load. Upon outages of power, the load draws its AC power from the DC battery through a DC to AC inverter. This isolates the load from power surges or brownouts and also furnishes a source of power during brief outages.","UPS devices are commonly connected to devices such as personal computers, to protect the personal computer from power fluctuations, to provide the computer user with backup power should the primary power source be lost, and to enable the computer user to \u201cgracefully\u201d shut down applications that are running, as the backup power is depleted. Use of UPS devices has become especially desirable in areas, such as California, where brief power outages (e.g. \u201crolling blackouts\u201d) sometimes occur, and in many other areas at times of the year (e.g., summer) when peak power demands are so high that power quality is affected (such as by brownouts).","As use of UPS devices has become more widespread, users frequently want to know information about the status of their UPS while it is supplying battery power. Users may also want to know whether power outages or other power-related conditions have occurred at times when the computing device was unattended. This information can, for example, be displayed to the user via information displayed on a computer screen. Some presently available UPS power management software provides such information using an icon representing the UPS on the screen. For example, in computers running a WINDOWS operating system (such as WINDOWS 95, 98, NT, and 2000), available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington, the \u201csystray\u201d can include an icon representing a UPS.","The \u201csystray\u201d (also known as the \u201csystem tray\u201d) is a section of the taskbar in the MICROSOFT WINDOWS desktop user interface that is used to display icons (e.g., icons representing programs) so that a user is continually reminded that they are there and can click on one of them easily. The icons in the systray also can provide a user with the status of a program, such as when an \u201cenvelope\u201d icon appears indicating to a user that the user'selectronic mail program has received a new message.","Because such icons are very small, it is difficult to convey all relevant information to the user quickly and in one place. Thus, some manufacturers provide separate, full applications enabling a user to obtain additional information about the user's UPS. For example, one presently available product allows the user to view UPS data via an application window that must be manually opened by the user to view or configure UPS data and settings. The application window is not automatically displayed when special UPS conditions arise. Also, displaying the application window requires that, the user start and run a new, full application, which can interrupt the user's normal use of the computer. Because this can be inconvenient for the user, many users do not run the separate application and, consequently, do not learn the additional information about their UPS that they may need to know.","The invention provides systems and methods for notifying a user about the operation of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), including notifications relating to specific events, such as loss of primary power to the system or fluctuations in power level which can lead to the UPS transitioning to \u201con battery\u201d, changes in communication with the UPS (e.g., loss of communications and\/or restoration of communications), problems with UPS current, voltage, power, or other parameters, and the like. In at least one embodiment of the invention, these notifications are provided, upon occurrence of a specific event, by displaying a user interface on the display screen of a computer, so that a user can receive information about the event and\/or the UPS operation. At least some systems and methods of the invention may be useful to users of computers that are operably connected to UPS devices.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a system for providing information about the occurrence of at least one predetermined event associated with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in operable communication with the system. The predetermined event can, for example, relate to the UPS communications status and\/or the UPS battery status. The system comprises a worker module and a user interface module. The worker module determines whether the predetermined event has occurred. The user interface module is responsive to the determination of the worker module and generates a user interface providing information relating to the predetermined event. The user interface comprises at least one of a graphical portion and an alphanumerical portion. For example, the user interface can be a UPS status monitor, a system tray icon, an event notifier, and\/or a balloon notifier. The user interface, in one embodiment, can include a control that enables a user to perform a function based on the displayed information. The displayed information can include context-sensitive and\/or event-specific information relating to an operating parameter of the UPS.","At least some embodiments of the invention can be used to provide information about events such as receipt of a predetermined command, loss of primary power, UPS transitioning to \u201con battery\u201d, UPS transitioning from \u201con battery\u201d, change in UPS communication status, battery disconnected\/connected, battery replacement due, data saving\/hibernation threshold reached, shutdown started, UPS not present, UPS self test status, UPS overload status, UPS runtime status, UPS runtime purchase; UPS communication restored, UPS current status, UPS voltage status, UPS power status, and charger failure.","In addition, at least some embodiments of the invention can provide information about UPS operating parameters such as UPS current, UPS voltage, UPS battery level, UPS time remaining, UPS power remaining, battery charge, shutdown time, alarm status, \u201con-battery\u201d status, history of predetermined events, UPS status, line current status, communications status, error status, and self-test status.","In at least one embodiment, the system includes a memory for storing information relating to the predetermined event and\/or the operating parameter of the UPS. In some embodiments, the user interface module can displays the user interface upon occurrence of the predetermined event and for the duration of the predetermined event and\/or upon receipt of a command from a user. In at least one embodiment, the worker module monitors the operating parameter of the UPS and the user interface module dynamically updates at least a portion of the user interface to reflect a change in the operating parameter. In at least one embodiment, the worker module receives information from the UPS relating to an operating parameter of the UPS.","The user interface, in at least one embodiment, is sized so that it can be viewed on a portion of a computer display. For example, in one embodiment, the user interface has a size substantially similar to the size of a toolbar. In at least one embodiment, the user interface is sized so that it can convey information to a user \u201cat a glance\u201d and so that it takes up minimal screen space. One advantage of this approach is that the user can run other programs while still monitoring UPS status information.","In another aspect, the invention provides a method for providing a notification about the operation of a UPS connected to a computer system. For example, the method may be used, in one embodiment, in computer systems that include a processor and a display and which are connectable to a UPS. A determination is made that a first condition relating to the UPS has occurred. Upon occurrence of the first condition, such as a change in UPS communication status, change in UPS battery status, and\/or receipt of a command, a user interface is displayed, the user interface having an indicator capable of conveying UPS information. The indicator comprises at least one of a graphical image and a character image. The indicator can stop being displayed upon occurrence of a second condition, such as receiving a second command, cessation of the first condition, and\/or change in the first condition.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for providing a user, when an event occurs, with information relating to the operation of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), the UPS having an operational status. When it is determined that an event has occurred, a user interface is displayed that provides event-specific information about the operational status of the UPS. The user interface comprises at least one of a graphical indicator and a non-graphical indicator. The displayed operational status information is updated if the information related to the operational status of the UPS changes during the time that the event is occurring. In one embodiment, an alarm is provided to the user during the duration of the event, the alarm notifying the user that the event has occurred. In one embodiment, a control can be displayed (for example, by providing a control as part of the user interface) that enables the alarm to be muted.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a system for notifying a user about the occurrence of at least one event associated with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), the event having a duration. The system comprises means for determining when the event has occurred and means for generating a user interface when the event occurs, the user interface providing information about the UPS during at least the duration of the predetermined event and comprising at least one of a graphical image and a textual image.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a computer program product comprising a computer useable medium and computer readable code embodied on the computer useable medium for providing information about the status of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) during an event, the UPS having at least one operational parameter. The computer readable code comprises computer readable program code devices configured to cause a computer to effect a determination that the event has occurred and computer readable program code devices configured to cause the computer to effect the generating, upon occurrence of the event, of a user interface conveying information about the UPS operational parameter, the user interface comprising at least one of a graphical indicator and an alphanumeric indicator.","Details relating to this and other embodiments of the invention are described more fully herein.","The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead generally being placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention.","Systems and methods of the invention provide techniques for notifying a user about the operation of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that is connected to the system, including notifications relating to specific events, such as loss of primary power to the system or fluctuations in power level which can lead to the UPS transitioning to \u201con battery\u201d, changes in communication with the UPS (e.g., loss of communications and\/or restoration of communications), problems with UPS current, voltage, power, or other parameters, and the like. In at least one embodiment of the invention, these notifications are provided, upon occurrence of a specific event, by displaying a user interface on the display screen of a computer accessible to a user, so that a user can receive information about the event and\/or the UPS operation.","Using icons and graphics, the user interface can, in one embodiment, convey more \u201cat a glance\u201d information about the UPS than a conventional systray icon, although in at least some embodiments of the invention, the invention also includes a systray icon. Further, because the user interface, in at least one embodiment, does not require that the user launch a separate application, the user interface can be more likely to be viewed by the user. In at least one embodiment, the basic user interface does not take up a large portion of the display screen (e.g., takes up less than half of the display).","Systems and methods in accordance with the invention can be implemented using any type of general purpose computer system, such as a personal computer (PC), laptop computer, server, workstation, personal digital assistant (PDA), mobile communications device, interconnected group of general purpose computers, and the like, running any one of a variety of operating systems. In at least one embodiment, the systems and methods of the invention are implemented using software running on a general purpose computer system that is operably connected to a UPS device. In at least one embodiment, the systems and methods of the invention are implemented using software running on a general purpose computer system that is in operable communication with a UPS device, where the UPS device is operably connected to a different general purpose computer system.","Other configurations of the invention also are possible. In at least some embodiments, the systems and methods in accordance with the invention can be implemented using devices connected over a network. For example, in an embodiment, the invention is implemented at a server connected to a plurality of general-purpose computers, each computer connected to a respective UPS device. In another example, in an embodiment, the invention can be implemented in a system having a server connected to a plurality of general purpose computers, with one or more UPS devices connected to the system.","An example of a general-purpose computer system  usable with at least one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in  and includes a central processor , associated memory  for storing programs and\/or data, an input\/output controller , a network interface , a display device , one or more input devices , a fixed or hard disk drive unit , a floppy disk drive unit , a tape drive unit , and a data bus  coupling these components to allow communication therebetween.","The central processor  can be any type of microprocessor, such as a PENTIUM processor, made by Intel of Santa Clara, Calif. The display device  can be any type of display, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), cathode ray tube display (CRT), light emitting diode (LED), and the like, capable of displaying, in whole or in part, the outputs generated in accordance with the systems and methods of the invention. The input device  can be any type of device capable of providing the inputs described herein, such as keyboards, numeric keypads, touch screens, pointing devices, switches, styluses, and light pens. The network interface  can be any type of a device, card, adapter, or connector that provides the computer system  with network access to another computer or other device, such as a printer. In one embodiment of the present invention, the network interface  enables the computer system  to connect to a computer network such as the Internet.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that computer systems embodying the present invention need not include every element shown in , and that equivalents to each of the elements are intended to be included within the spirit and scope of the invention.

The system of  is used with at least one uninterruptible power supply (UPS) , such as the BACK-UPS PRO with Universal Serial Bus (USB) family of devices, available from American Power Conversion (APC), Inc., of West Kingston, R.I. The UPS  need not necessarily be the backup power supply for the computer system  that is implementing the invention (that is, the computer system providing information about the UPS device need not be the device to which the UPS is acting as a backup power source). For example, in one embodiment, the UPS  can be coupled to a different device, such as a server or a general purpose computer (not shown), to which the UPS  serves as a backup power source, while the UPS  is at the same time connected to the computer system , so that the computer system  can be used to monitor the UPS .","Further, in another embodiment, the computer system  employing the invention can be connected to a plurality of UPS's  (any one or more of which supply backup power to one or more other powered devices), and the invention can be implemented and adapted so that the computer system  displays status information (such as the status information described herein) about any of the UPS's to which it is connected. Of course, in at least one embodiment, the UPS  is serving as a backup power source for at least the computer system  implementing the invention.","In , the invention is implemented as a software application  running on the computer system . Although the software application  is illustrated in  as being implemented on a single processor , those skilled in the art will appreciate that the more than one processor  can be used to implement the software application . For example, the functions of one or more of the modules within the software application  can be running on a first processor  while the remaining modules are running on one or more additional processors (not shown).","Referring again to , the software application  of at least one embodiment further comprises a worker module , UPS status monitor module , systray icon module , and event notifier  module, which together comprise a user interface module . A user interface  in accordance with the invention need not include the UPS status monitor , systray icon  (also referred to as \u201csystem tray icon \u201d), and the event notifier ; however, any one or more of the UPS status monitor , systray icon, and event notifier  can serve as a user interface . The functions and appearance of the user interface , UPS status monitor , systray icon , and the event notifier  are described more fully herein. The worker module  of the software application  determines the status (e.g., operating parameters) of the UPS  and the software application  notifies a user, via the user interface , when appropriate. The user interface  can, for example, be displayed to a user, such as by using the display . In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the user interface  can further include other elements, such as icons, balloon notifications, symbols, links, and\/or characters.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","70","112","110","70","210","112","220","120","110","110","130","120"]},"In at least one embodiment, the information displayed in the user interface  is context-sensitive and\/or event-specific and relates to the predetermined condition and\/or event. For example, if the UPS  is on battery, but there are no communications problems, the user interface  need not include communications status information.","When the user interface  is displayed (step ), if any UPS parameter changes (step ), then the user interface , in at least one embodiment, can be updated (step ) to reflect the change. If the predetermined event continues, then the user interface  remains on the display (step ). For example, if the user interface  is a UPS status monitor, then it is displayed for the duration of the predetermined event. In at least some embodiments of the invention, however, the user can take an action to hide the display of the user interface  even though the predetermined event is still continuing (although the steps associated with this action are not shown in , they will be understood by those skilled in the art).","When the predetermined event stops, the display of the user interface  stops (step ). In at least some embodiments of the invention, information relating to the predetermined event is logged (step ) (logging is explained more fully herein). Although  illustrates that the logging of information occurs after the display of the user interface  is stopped, that should not be viewed as limiting. Logging of information can occur at any desired time, including times when no predetermined event has occurred.","Referring again to , the software application  is, in at least one embodiment, user-interface based and is designed to function with the operating system  running on the computer system . Although the following embodiment of the invention is discussed in connection with WINDOWS as the operating system , the invention can, of course, be implemented for use with other operating systems.","Any one or more of the UPS status monitor , systray icon , and event notifier  can serve as a user interface , in accordance with the invention. When predetermined events (such as those described previously) occur relating to the UPS  and\/or elements of the software application , the software application  presents the user with a \u201cview\u201d of information appropriate to the given predetermined event via the user interface  (e.g., UPS status monitor , systray icon , and\/or event notifier ) provided on the user's display . The way the software application  handles events depends on the type of the event. The event may trigger the need for the software application  to process the state change so that the user's computer system  is managed properly from a power protection point of view.","The UPS status monitor , in one embodiment, provides the ability, (e.g., via a \u201cmute\u201d button) to silence and\/or turn off any UPS alarms currently sounding, such as when an \u201con-battery\u201d UPS alarm is sounding. In at least one embodiment, this muting function only mutes the alarms that are sounding at the time the mute function is enabled, and the occurrence of another event that is associated with an alarm (e.g., one \u201con-battery\u201d event) will sound the alarm again. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the UPS status monitor  of the invention may be adapted (e.g., have additional buttons) to permit the user to perform other functions, such as configuring the software application  and\/or the UPS .","The notifications about the status of the UPS  can happen in many different ways. For example, in at least one embodiment, the UPS  has the ability to communicate information about itself (e.g., error conditions, self-test conditions, voltage and current levels, etc.) to the computer system , such as by messages sent from the UPS  to the computer system . In at least one embodiment, the computer system  monitors the UPS  to obtain status information about the UPS , such as by connecting to one or more circuits in the UPS  to monitor the conditions present on those circuits. In at least one embodiment, communication about the status of the UPS  is accomplished using a separate system, such as a hardware or software system (not shown), capable of monitoring the status of the UPS  and providing information about the status of the UPS to the computer system . Those skilled in the art will recognize that many other ways of monitoring the status of the UPS  and events associated with it may be used with embodiments of the invention.","Referring again to , the worker module  (which can be a service or a process) runs continually on the user's computer system  and monitors the status of the UPS  to ensure that the user's computer system  is protected at all times. The worker module  also obtains information relating to the UPS , such as UPS  operating parameter information. The worker module  also displays information on the activities of the software application  on reboot following an extended power outage. In addition, the worker module  constantly polls the UPS  and registers any loss of communication between the UPS  and the computer system . The worker module  continues to poll the UPS  after a loss of communication, until the situation is resolved.","The worker module  is able to determine that a predetermined event has occurred, such as an action related event (Table 1) or a smart event (Table 2). As explained below, the application functions associated with the system tray icon  and the software application  (including the user interface ) can determine whether informational events (Table 3) have occurred (this can be done, for example, by polling the UPS). Upon the occurrence of a predetermined event, the worker module  provides at least a portion of the UPS operating parameter information to the UPS status monitor , the systray icon , and\/or the event notifier , any one or more of which can, depending on the event, notify the user about the occurrence of the event. This operation is explained more fully herein.","The UPS status monitor  displays at least a portion of the information provided by the worker module  in a format such as graphical format, alphanumeric format, and\/or textual format so that the user can determine the status of his or her UPS  at a glance and have access to more advanced features from it. The information can, in one embodiment, take the form of a user interface that includes graphical images and\/or symbols (e.g., images representing batteries, charge indicators, plugs, computers, and the like, including images that also serve as links to other information) and\/or non-graphical images and\/or symbols (e.g., one or more characters such as letter, numbers, and control characters, words, phrases, mathematical symbols and equations, numbers representing timers, and the like, which may include one or more characters that also serve as links to other information).","As will be explained herein, the systray icon  and the event notifier  also can display at least a portion of the information that the worker module  provides and\/or monitors. Any one or more of the UPS status monitor , the systray icon , balloon notifications, and the event notifier , can constitute a user interface , as used herein.","In at least one embodiment of the invention, the UPS status monitor  includes a display, sometimes referred to as a \u201cdashboard.\u201d , which are discussed in greater detail herein, are illustrative examples of a UPS status monitor  during various states of the UPS , in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The UPS status monitor  includes a window containing one or more indicators, such as alphanumeric characters, text and\/or images, that represent UPS status data such as battery capacity, time to shutdown, on-line\/on-battery status.","The images can, for example, include icons, symbols, graphics, pictures, drawings, images, signs, logos, photographs, cartoons, illustrations, diagrams, graphs, charts, tables, maps and other representations that are capable of visually conveying information about the UPS  and\/or related information, such as links to data, manuals, or help files.","The alphanumeric characters and\/or the text can, for example, include many different representations of UPS status data, such as letters, digits, control characters, space characters, and other special characters, along with combinations of letters, digits, and other characters.","The images can, for example, include images representing physical elements associated with the UPS and\/or the computer system. For example, an image usable in at least some embodiments of the invention is an icon having the shape of a conventional plug and\/or socket, to indicate the status of the \u201cline current\u201d powering a UPS. In one embodiment, the icon has a first appearance (e.g., a red color) to indicate that that there is a problem with the line current, and a second appearance (e.g., a green color) indicating that there are no problems with the line current. Another image usable in accordance with the invention is that of a button having a first appearance to indicate that the button has not been pressed and a second appearance to indicate that the button has been pressed. The first and second appearances of the button can, for example, have appropriate shading and\/or shadows to mimic the appearance of a pressed button.","The images also can include alphanumeric characters and\/or text indicators, where the alphanumeric character(s) and\/or the text field briefly describe the current status of the UPS. For example, the text field \u201clow charge\u201d may be displayed to indicate that the UPS battery's charge is below a predetermined threshold and is \u201clow.\u201d In another example, alphanumeric characters such as \u201cVoltage:##.##\u201d could be displayed to indicate a battery voltage that is out of the range of the device measuring it. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many different characters and\/or representations are usable in accordance with the invention.","The UPS status monitor  has two modes of operation, automatic and manual. In automatic mode, UPS status monitor  automatically appears (e.g., by \u201cpopping up\u201d on the user's display screen) when predetermined events occur, such as when the UPS  goes on battery. When the UPS  goes on battery, for example, the UPS status monitor  provides graphical and non-graphical (e.g., alphanumeric and\/or textual) information (e.g., indicators) on battery status, charge level and time remaining until shutdown. The UPS status monitor  disappears either when another predetermined event occurs (such as when the event that caused its display is resolved, e.g., when utility power is restored) or upon a predetermined input from the user. Thus, in at least one embodiment of the invention, during automatic mode, the UPS status monitor  appears only when needed (e.g., when information needs to be provided to the user).","In manual mode, the user can launch the UPS status monitor  from another part of the software application , such as the system tray icon . During manual mode, the information that the UPS status monitor  displays dynamically reflects the current status. For example, if the UPS status monitor  is opened under \u2018normal\u2019 conditions for the UPS  (e.g., when the battery of the UPS  is fully charged and utility power is being supplied to equipment), the display of the UPS status monitor  will not necessarily contain information that is not applicable under \u2018normal\u2019 conditions (e.g., the UPS status monitor  would not contain information such as the time remaining until shutdown). If the UPS status monitor  is manually launched, in this embodiment, it is closed manually.","In at least one embodiment, the UPS status monitor  includes controls that enable the user to take some action based on the current status of the UPS . The controls can be provided in many different ways, such as displaying them to the user as part of the UPS status monitor  that appears on a user's display screen, by having the controls appear or \u201cpop up\u201d when a user moves a pointing device or cursor over part of the UPS status monitor . For example, if the UPS  is supplying battery power and emitting an audible alarm, the UPS status monitor  can display a control that enables the user to mute the alarm (this is illustrated in , discussed herein).","In at least one embodiment, the UPS status monitor  is sized so that it is small enough to be unobtrusive to the user during operation of the computer, yet not so small that a user can ignore the window, and not so large that it takes up so much display space that the user has an incentive to close it prematurely, missing valuable status information. The size of the UPS status monitor  can be important when the UPS status monitor  is running in automatic mode, because the UPS status monitor  may remain on the display for the duration of the event. It can be advantageous, therefore, to have the UPS status monitor  (or other user interface ) take up a minimum amount of space on the display. For example, in an embodiment of the invention, the UPS status monitor  has the size of a toolbar, such as a toolbar in the shape of a row. The UPS status monitor  can, in one embodiment, be positioned anywhere on the display that is desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A through 4D","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["110","50","110","300","310","320","330","110","340","340"]},"As the embodiment of  illustrates, the line current indicator  is illustrated as a \u201cplug\u201d symbol to indicate that the UPS is \u201con-line\u201d (using line current). The UPS state indicator  also shows that the UPS is \u201con line\u201d and further indicates the informational event that power was restored. The charge level indicator  includes a graphical symbol with several levels to indicate the level of charge of the battery in the UPS . In the example UPS status monitor  of , two of the four charge levels are shaded white, indicating that the battery in the UPS  is at a 50% charge level. Of course, other ways of indicating a difference between adjacent symbols or text, such as shading changes, color changes, flashing graphical and\/or non-graphical indicators, and the like, are usable in accordance with the invention. The shutdown time indicator  uses alphanumeric characters to indicate the shutdown time remaining. The indicators shown in  are merely representative of the types of indicators that may be used; those skilled in the art will appreciate that many different types and combinations of indicators are usable.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"],"b":["50","300","320","350","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4D","FIG. 4D"],"b":["110","50","110","350","110","350","350","350","110","50","350"]},"Alarms can be muted in other ways, as well. For example, in one embodiment, the software application  and\/or the system tray icon  can each include access to mute buttons for muting alarms. The system tray icon , for example, can be right or left clicked for a few seconds, to bring up a menu that includes a mute button. In another example, the UPS  may provide a control enabling a user to mute alarms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["110","50","300","50"]},"Although this feature is not visible in the illustrated UPS status monitor  of  and , when a user moves a pointing device over the indicators in the UPS status monitor  (or other icons and\/or alphanumeric characters\/text in the UPS status monitor ), \u201chover over\u201d type alphanumeric\/text descriptions can be displayed (e.g. \u201cpopped up\u201d), as required, to explain what the indicator means and\/or to provide a preview of what action may occur if a user \u201cclicks\u201d on the indicator. Another advantage that hover over text may provide is that it is not intrusive to the user\u2014it appears as required by the user, to provide additional information. Hover over pop-up messages are understood by those skilled in the art.","In at least one embodiment, the UPS status monitor  is updated graphically and\/or textually and\/or by updating alphanumeric characters, to represent changes in parameters of the UPS  as they occur. This can be done in automatic mode, manual mode, or both, and, in at least one embodiment, the same actions and events are applicable regardless of the mode. For example, if the UPS status monitor  is displaying graphical symbols indicative of a 75% charge level (e.g., the charge level indicator  of  has three of the four blocks shaded so as to indicate charge level), and the charge level then drops to 50%, the UPS status monitor  updates the graphical symbols (e.g., the charge level indicator of ) that it displays to reflect the changes in the parameter of the UPS . In another example, if there is a loss of communications between the computer system  and the UPS , the UPS status monitor  is updated graphically to represent the loss of communications. , for example, is a representative illustration of a UPS status monitor  showing graphics and text illustrating the loss of communications. Based on what is displayed by the UPS status monitor , a user can take action in response to the displayed information about the UPS .","Referring to , , and A-D, and , as an example of the operation of the UPS status monitor , when an \u201con-battery event\u201d occurs, the UPS status monitor  indicates, by showing a battery icon and a text message, that the UPS is \u201con battery\u201d. If the user requires more information about the computer system , the UPS status monitor  and\/or the UPS , such as how much time is left to shutdown, the user can access this information via the UPS status monitor . As seen in the representation of the UPS status monitor  shown in , the user can mute the current on-battery alarm from within the UPS status monitor . In addition, in at least one embodiment of the invention, the indicators (and\/or other icons and\/or text ) displayed in the UPS status monitor  are context-sensitive (e.g., event-sensitive, state sensitive, status sensitive, etc.), and are displayed where relevant. For example, in one embodiment, if the status of the UPS  is \u201con-line\u201d, the UPS status monitor  does not necessarily display information on runtime remaining.","Referring again to , at least some embodiments of the invention include a systray icon . The systray icon  is a component that displays a system tray icon on a user's display  that provides basic UPS information \u201cat a glance.\u201d For example, the system tray icon  can indicate states such as on-battery and on-line, loss of communications, restoration of communications, problems, and the like. The system tray icon  can, in some embodiments, provide other features, as well. For example, the system tray icon  can provide basic data about the UPS  through the use of a \u201ctool tip\u201d, which is displayed when the cursor passes over the system tray UPS icon. The tool tip presents the user with a brief description of the current status of the UPS  and the software application  (such as when alarms may be configured to be muted). The system tray icon  also provides a \u201cBalloon\u201d Notification for events that are identified as \u201cinformational\u201d events (see further information below), such as those events occurring where the UPS status monitor  is not already displayed.","Another feature that the system tray icon  provides, in at least one embodiment of the invention, is a menu option, which is accessible by right clicking on the system tray icon . This menu can include options such as Show\/Hide the UPS status monitor , Launch (for launching an application), and muting alarms.","The Launch option launches another application, such as an application in operable communication with the software application , or a particular page of the application, i.e. provide a list of shortcuts to specific areas of the main application. For example, the application launching can produce shortcuts to screens providing information such as UPS Performance Summary, Current Status, Configuration top-level screen (providing access to Notification, Sensitivity, Runtime Settings and Advanced Voltage Setting), and Troubleshooting.","The systray icon  itself can, in one embodiment, include icons capable of representing different states of the UPS , such as \u201con-battery,\u201d \u201con-line\u201d, and \u201cproblem\u201d (such as when the computer system  cannot communicate with the UPS , battery disconnected, charger failure, bad battery, etc). For example,  is a representative illustration of a system tray icon showing normal online operation. As  illustrates, the icon displaying an image of a computer, by itself, indicates that the UPS  is on-line (e.g., running from conventional wall current.).  is a representative illustration of system tray icon showing \u201con-battery\u201d operation. As  illustrates, the \u201cbattery\u201d icon overlayed on top of the computer icon indicates that the UPS  is running from its battery.","In at least some embodiments of the invention, parts of the systray icon  provide functions such as giving test results. For example, if a user initiates a self-test of the UPS  (such as by pressing a \u201cself test\u201d button on the front of the UPS ), when the self-test is complete, the system tray icon  displays a balloon notification telling the user the results of the UPS self-test. In another example, if communication between the UPS  and the computer system  is lost, a icon representing \u2018Lost Communication\u2019 is displayed in the system tray (see, e.g., ) and a \u2018Lost Communication\u2019 balloon notification message , originating from the system tray icon , is presented to the user.  is a representative example of a system tray icon  showing a lost communication status, and  is a representative illustration of a balloon notification message , displayed from the system tray icon , when communication is lost.","In at least some embodiments of the invention, parts of the software application  can track information about the events that occur, to provide further information to a user and\/or to the manufacturer(s) of the UPS  and\/or the software application . For example, in at least one embodiment of the invention, the event notifier  also provides information for an event log. The worker module  maintains a log of all events generated by the UPS  as well some events associated with the software application. The event log includes the date, time and description of the event.","The events that are logged are used to generate information and reports about the performance of the UPS  and can be used for other aspects of the software application . Representative examples of events that can be logged include blackout, undervoltage, overvoltage, sensitivity fluctuation, self-test with result, worksafe condition, shutdown, hibernation, and online (the latter can be used to determine how long the UPS  was on battery due to a power event).  is an illustrative representative screen shot illustrating a performance summary report  based on events that the software application  logged over a time period.","As those skilled in the art will recognize, the invention described herein can be modified to accommodate and\/or comply with any one or more of the above-described technologies and standards.
