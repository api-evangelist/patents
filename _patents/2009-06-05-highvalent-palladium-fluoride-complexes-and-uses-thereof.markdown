No. 61\/059,142 filed Jun. 5, 2008, the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference.","The regioselective fluorination of organic compounds is an important challenge in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (see, for example, Muller et al., 2007, 317, 1881-1886; Park et al., 2001, 41, 443-470; Bohm et al., 2004, 5, 637-643; and Jeschke, 2004, 5, 570-589).","Syntheses of simple fluoroarenes currently rely on the pyrolysis of diazonium tetrafluoroborates (Balz, G.; Schiemann, G. 1927, 60, 1186-1190), direct fluorination using highly reactive, elemental fluorine (Sandford, J. 2007, 128, 90-104), or nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions of electron-poor aromatic systems by displacement of other halogens or nitro groups (Sun et al., 2006, 45, 2720-2725; Adams et al., 1999, 28, 225-231). The reductive elimination of arylfluorides from palladium(II) fluoride complexes is an attractive potential alternative that has been investigated by Grushin (Grushin, 2002, 8, 1006-1014) over the past decade and more recently by Yandulov. A single substrate-p-fluoronitrobenzene\u2014has been prepared successfully in 10% yield in the Yandulov study from a stoichiometric palladium fluoride complex (Yandulov et al., 2007, 129, 1342-1358). Directed electrophilic fluorination of phenylpyridine derivatives and related structures using catalytic palladium(II) acetate and N-fluoropyridinium salts has been reported by Sanford in 2006 (Hull et al., 2006, 128, 7134-7135). Taking advantage of the directing effect of a pyridine substituent, proximal carbon-hydrogen bonds can be fluorinated using microwave irradiation at high temperatures (100-150\u00b0 C., 1-4 h, 33-75% yield). However, the fact that there is an absence in the literature of any general, functional-group-tolerant fluorination reaction methodology reflects the difficulty of forming carbon-fluorine bonds.","The use of F-labelled organic compounds for positron-emission tomography (PET) requires the controlled, efficient introduction of fluorine into functionalized molecules (see, for example, Couturier et al., 2004, 31, 1182-1206; Lasne et al., \u201cChemistry of beta(+)-emitting compounds based on fluorine-18\u201d In 2002; Vol. 222, pp 201-258; and Phelps, 2000, 97, 9226-9233). PET has been used to measure presynaptic accumulation of F-fluorodopa tracer in the dopaminergic regions of the brain (see, for example, Ernst et al., \u201cPresynaptic Dopaminergic Deficits in Lesch-Nyhan Disease\u201d (1996) 334:1568-1572), but fluorination of other organic compounds has been difficult due to lack of an appropriate fluorination method.","Despite the utility of fluorinated organic compounds in multiple pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and agrochemical applications, C\u2014F bond formation remains a challenging organic transformation with no broadly applicable solutions.","While high-valent palladium complexes may be intermediates in the transformations described above, none have been reported to date. Although discrete high-valent palladium fluorides are potential intermediates, electrophilic palladium-carbon bond cleavage is a mechanistic alternative which has not been ruled out. While hundreds of early transition metal fluorides have been structurally characterized (Murphy et al., 97:3425-3468, 1997; which is incorporated herein by reference), only eight palladium complexes with terminal fluoride ligands can be found in the Cambridge Structural Database, none of which contain a palladium center in an oxidation state other than +2 (Fraser et al., 119:4769-4770, 1997; Marshall et al., 17:5427-5430, 1998; Roe et al., 19: 4575-4582, 2000; Grushin et al., 41:4476-4479, 2002; Yahav et al., 125:13634-13635, 2003; Jasim et al., 23:6140-6149, 2004; each of which is incorporated herein by reference).","The present invention provides novel high-valent palladium fluoride complexes and method of using these complexes in the fluorination of organic compounds. The inventive system is particularly useful in preparing F-labeled compounds for PET imaging. The complexes are typically palladium(IV) fluoride complexes as described herein. The complexes include two fixed ligands that stabilize the high-valent palladium complex. In certain embodiments, one of the ligands is a bidentate ligand, and the other ligand is a tridentate ligand. The inventive system was envisioned due to the limited nature of nucleophilic F chemistry. The inventive system relies on the transfer of electrophilic F, which is analogous to the commercially available fluorinating reagent, Selectflour\u00ae (N-chloromethyl-N\u2032-fluorotriethylenediammonium bis(tetrafluoroborate)).","In one aspect, the invention features a palladium complex of formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"37.00mm","wi":"68.24mm","file":"US08686158-20140401-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein:","the dashed line represents the presence or absence of a bond;","Pd has a valency of +4;","n is an integer between 0 and 4, inclusive;","m is an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive;","each occurrence of Ris independently hydrogen; halogen; cyclic or acyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched aliphatic; cyclic or acyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched heteroaliphatic; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched acyl; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched aryl; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched heteroaryl; \u2014OR\u2032; \u2014C(\u2550O)R\u2032; \u2014COR\u2032; \u2014CN; \u2014SCN; \u2014SR\u2032; \u2014SOR\u2032; \u2014SOR\u2032; \u2014NO; \u2014N(R\u2032); \u2014NHC(O)R\u2032; or \u2014C(R\u2032); wherein each occurrence of R\u2032 is independently a hydrogen, a protecting group, an aliphatic moiety, a heteroaliphatic moiety, an acyl moiety; an aryl moiety; a heteroaryl moiety; alkoxy; aryloxy; alkylthio; arylthio; amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, heteroaryloxy; or heteroarylthio moiety; wherein two RA may be taken together to form a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic, heterocyclic, aryl or heteroaryl ring;","each occurrence of Ris independently hydrogen; halogen; cyclic or acyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched aliphatic; cyclic or acyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched heteroaliphatic; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched acyl; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched aryl; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched heteroaryl; \u2014OR\u2033; \u2014C(\u2550O)R\u2033; \u2014COR\u2033; \u2014CN; \u2014SCN; \u2014SR\u2033; \u2014SOR\u2033; \u2014SOR\u2033; \u2014NO; \u2014N(R\u2033); \u2014NHC(O)R\u2033; or \u2014C(R\u2033); wherein each occurrence of R\u2033 is independently a hydrogen, a protecting group, an aliphatic moiety, a heteroaliphatic moiety, an acyl moiety; an aryl moiety; a heteroaryl moiety; alkoxy; aryloxy; alkylthio; arylthio; amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, heteroaryloxy; or heteroarylthio moiety;","each occurrence of Ris independently hydrogen; cyclic or acyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched aliphatic; cyclic or acyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched heteroaliphatic; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched acyl; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched aryl; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched heteroaryl; wherein Rand Rmay be taken together to form a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic or heteroaryl ring; and wherein Rand Rmay be taken together to form a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic, heterocyclic, aryl or heteroaryl ring;","R, R, R, and Rare each independently cyclic or acyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched aliphatic; cyclic or acyclic, substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched heteroaliphatic; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched aryl; substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched heteroaryl;","Z is an anion such as halide, acetate, tosylate, azide, tetrafluoroborate, tetraphenylborate, tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, [B[3,5-(CF)CH]], hexafluorophosphate, phosphate, sulfate, perchlorate, trifluoromethanesulfonate or hexafluoroantimonate; and","F comprises F or F.","In some embodiments, Ris hydrogen.

Although electrophilic fluorinating reagents including acetyl hypofluorites, xenon difluoride, and nitrogen fluorides are commercially available, they are expensive and tend to be poorly regioselective. The inventive complexes may also be useful in fluorination reactions by providing electrophilic F. In particular, the high valent palladium complexes may be useful in conjunction with other transition metal reagents or catalysts for transferring the electrophilic F to an organic compound.","In certain embodiments, the inventive high-valent palladium fluoride complexes described herein are used in conjunction with the palladium(II)-mediated fluorination reactions described in U.S. provisional patent application, U.S. Ser. No. 61\/063,096, filed Jan. 31, 2008, and U.S. Ser. No. 61\/050,446, filed May 5, 2008. Such reactions are particularly useful in preparing aryl fluorides.","In certain embodiments, the inventive high-valent palladium fluoride complexes are reacted with enol silyl ethers under suitable conditions to yield alpha-fluorinated carbonyl compounds. In certain embodiments, the starting material is cyclohexanone enol trimethylsilyl ether. In certain embodiments, the inventive high-valent palladium fluoride complexes are reacted with enamines under suitable conditions to yield fluorinated compounds.","Organic Compounds","As generally described above, the invention provides a process for fluorinating an organic or organometallic compound using a high-valent palladium(IV) fluoride complex. In certain embodiments, the organic or organometallic compound has a particular substituent that is replaced with the fluoride from the complex.","The organic compound utilized in the inventive process includes, but is not limited to, small organic molecules and\/or large organic molecules.

In certain embodiments, the fluorination reaction is regiospecific.","Introduction of fluorine into a certain position of bioactive compound such as a pharmaceutical agent and an agricultural chemical may remarkably reduce the toxicity of the compound. This is due to the mimic and blocking effect characterized by fluorine. Many compounds, such as 5-fluorouracil, have been reported as successful examples.","Attempts to efficiently synthesize fluorine-containing compounds are performed in many fields. Methods to introduce fluorine into a certain position through the use of fluorinating agents or the use of fluorine-containing building blocks have been reported (see, for example, Liu et al., . (1981) 103:7195; Lovey et al., . (1982) 25:71; and Kikuchi et al., (1997) 55:88).","Organofluorine compounds are emerging as chemical specialties of significant and increasing commercial interest.

FDG is not itself metabolized and therefore accumulates in cancer tissues, which in turn can be visualized. The non-invasive nature and the high sensitivity render PET a powerful method for early cancer identification using FDG.","The F radioisotope has a half-life of 109 minutes. The short half-life dictates restrictions on chemical synthesis of PET tracers, because introduction of the fluorine atom has to take place at a very late stage of the synthesis to avoid the unproductive decay of F before it is injected into the body. Fluoride ion is the most common reagent to introduce F but the specific chemical properties of the fluoride ion currently limit the available pool of PET tracers. Due to the narrow functional group compatibility of the strongly basic fluoride ion, only a limited set of chemical reactions can be employed for fluorination, and hence the synthesis of PET tracers is limited to fairly simple molecules such as FDG. The field of PET imaging would benefit from the availability of a new method that is capable of introducing radiolabeled fluoride into structurally more complex organic molecules. An easy access to drug-based PET tracers would simplify determining the fate of such drugs in the body and thereby help to identify and understand their mode of action, bioavailability and time-dependent biodistribution.","Methods of Treatment","A fluorinated compound described herein, such as a fluorinated pharmaceutical agent, can be administered to cells in culture, e.g. in vitro or ex vivo, or to a subject, e.g., in vivo, to treat, prevent, and\/or diagnose a variety of disorders, including those described herein below.

C.; Perrio, C.; Rouden, J.; Bane, L.; Roeda, D.; Dolle, F.; Crouzel, C., Chemistry of beta(+)-emitting compounds based on fluorine-18. In Contrast Agents II, 2002; Vol. 222, pp 201-258; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). We have recently reported the palladium-mediated fluorination of arylboronic acids to form functionalized fluoroarenes and speculated on the intermediacy of discrete high-valent palladium fluorides. High-valent palladium fluoride complexes have also been suggested in other carbon-fluorine bond formations. In 2006, Sanford published the palladium-catalyzed fluorination of phenylpyridine derivatives and related substrates using electrophilic fluorination sources as oxidants under microwave irradiation at 100-150\u00b0 C. (Hull, K. L.; Anani, W. Q.; Sanford, M. S. 2006, 128, 7134-7135; incorporated herein by reference). While high-valent palladium complexes may be intermediates in this transformation, none have been reported to date. In 2008, Vigalok and Vedernikov communicated the formation of fluorobenzene and iodobenzene in 10% and 90% yield, respectively, upon treatment of a diphosphine arylpalladium iodide with 1-fluoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate (Yahav-Levi, A.; Goldberg, I.; Vigalok, A.; Vedernikov, A. N. 2008, 130, 724-731; incorporated herein by reference). The transient formation of a palladium(IV) fluoride followed by either carbon-iodine or carbon-fluorine bond formation via reductive elimination is a potential mechanistic pathway that would explain the observed products. Although discrete high-valent palladium fluorides are potential intermediates in all three examples\u2014Sanford's, Vigalok's, and our own\u2014electrophilic palladium-carbon bond cleavage is a mechanistic alternative which has not been ruled out in any of these examples; in no instance has a high-valent palladium fluoride been observed. In 1992, Canty reported the reaction of a palladium(IV) bromide with silver (I) fluoride to presumably generate a benzyldimethylpalladium(IV) fluoride that was observed by H NMR (Canty, A.

While hundreds of early transition metal fluorides have been structurally characterized (Murphy, E. F.; Murugavel, R.; Roesky, H. W. 1997, 97, 3425-3468; incorporated herein by reference), only eight palladium complexes with terminal fluoride ligands can be found in the Cambridge Structural Database, none of which contain a palladium center in an oxidation state other than +II (Fraser, S.

W.; Yahav-Levi, A.; Goldberg, I.; Vigalok, A. 2008, 47, 5-7; each of which is incorporated herein by reference).","In this Example, the synthesis of a well-defined organometallic palladium(IV) fluoride and its characterization are described. To our knowledge, no high-valent palladium fluoride has previously been characterized by either F NMR or X-ray crystallography. Three structural design elements were considered to synthesize a stable palladium(IV) fluoride. Firstly, we targeted complexes containing a single carbon-based ligand. Carbon-based ligands are strong \u03c3-donors and can thus stabilize high-valent palladium centers, but the presence of multiple carbon-based ligands can result in carbon-carbon reductive elimination with concurrent reduction of the metal center (Canty, A. J.; Traill, P. R.; Skelton, B. W.; White, A. H. 1992, 433, 213-222; incorporated herein by reference). Similarly, other X-type ligands, such as amido and alkoxide ligands, can support high-valent metal centers by both \u03c3- and \u03c0-donation, but also participate in reductive elimination from palladium(IV) to form carbon-X bonds (Dick, A. R.; Kampf, J. W.; Sanford, M. S. 2005, 127, 12790-12791; Pawlikowski, A. V.; Getty, A. D.; Goldberg, K. I. 2007, 129, 10382-10393; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Secondly, neutral nitrogenous donors were selected because they are known to stabilize high-valent metal centers and typically do not participate in reductive elimination (Berry, J. F.; Bill, E.; Bothe, E.; George, S. D.; Mienert, B.; Neese, F.; Wieghardt, K. 2006, 312, 1937-1941; incorporated herein by reference). Finally, we envisioned rigid ligand scaffolds would stabilize the anticipated octahedral coordination sphere of palladium(IV) and thus disfavor reductive elimination and other reductive pathways from an octahedral dpalladium(IV) to a square planar dpalladium(II) (C\u00e1mpora, J.; Palma, P.; del Rio, D.; L\u00f3pez, J. A.; \u00c1lvarez, E.; Connelly, N. G. 2005, 24, 3624-3628; incorporated herein by reference). Tetrapyrazolylborate (Tp) ligands position three neutral nitrogen donor atoms in a facial geometry for chelation to a transition metal (Trofimenko, S. 1967, 89, 3170-3177; Trofimenko, S. 1971, 4, 17-22; Trofimenko, S. 1993, 93, 943-980; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). The Tp ligand has been used in organometallic chemistry to stabilize octahedral complexes due to the three N-Metal-N bond angles near 90\u00b0. The N,N-dimethylaminonaphthyl ligand was selected because it can be installed on palladium by cyclometallation to form a rigid, electron-rich five-membered chelate.","Cyclometallation of N,N-dimethyl-1-naphthylmethanamine (1) with disodium tetrachloropalladate afforded the palladium(II) chloride dimer (2) in 58% yield (). The chloride ligands were subsequently substituted using one equivalent of potassium tetrapyrazolylborate per palladium to afford the palladium(II) borate 3 in 74% yield. Line broadening in the H and C NMR spectra of 3 at room temperature is consistent with previously observed dynamic coordination\/dissociation of the pyrazolyl ligands of the Tp ligand to palladium (Onishi, M.; Ohama, Y.; Sugimura, K.; Hiraki, K. 1976, 955-958; incorporated herein by reference); sharper resonances could be observed at \u221250\u00b0 C. Oxidation of 3 with commercially available 1-fluoro-pyridinium triflate (4) afforded a discrete new compound by H and F NMR. A F NMR fluorine resonance was observed at \u2212287.4 ppm; no other values for F NMR resonances of high-valent palladium fluorides are available, but F NMR shifts of palladium(II) fluorides have been reported in a range from \u2212268 to \u2212301 ppm (Fraser, S. L.; Antipin, M. Y.; Khroustalyov, V. N.; Grushin, V. V. 1997, 119, 4769-4770; Grushin, V. V.; Marshall, W. J. 2006, 128, 12644-12645; each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Additionally, the line broadening in the NMR spectra observed for 3 was not observed for the new compound 5. The palladium fluoride 5 was unstable toward water and when heated in an acetone solution to 50\u00b0 C.; purification, isolation or structural characterization of 5 was not pursued.","The more stable palladium(IV) fluoride 7 could be prepared when using 1-fluoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate (6), an electrophilic fluorination reagent specifically prepared for this purpose (eq 1). The palladium(IV) fluoride complex 7 with a hexafluorophosphate counteranion is more stable than the palladium triflate 5. High-valent palladium fluoride 7 is a moisture- and air-stable orange solid that can be stored in ambient atmosphere without decomposition for at least one week. The solution structure of 7 was characterized by five NMR-active nuclei. Similar to the F NMR resonance observed for 5, a F NMR resonance for 7 is observed is at \u2212294.0 ppm in addition to the hexafluorophosphate resonance at \u221272.7 ppm. The NMR data is consistent with a cationic octahedral palladium(IV) fluoride complex in which three of the four pyrazolyl substituents of the Tp ligand are complexed to palladium. A Jcoupling of 3.4 Hz from one benzyl hydrogen to the terminal fluoride in the H NMR of 7 was observed. In addition, a coupling constant of 6.5 Hz was observed in the C NMR spectrum for one of the carbon atoms of the two amine methyl groups that we attribute to a Jcoupling. An H-F HSQC NMR experiment was performed which both confirmed the Jcoupling and demonstrated the simultaneous coordination of the dimethylamino ligand and the fluoride ligand to palladium in solution.","To unambiguously establish the connectivity of 7, crystals suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis were obtained by cooling a solution of 7 that was heated at reflux in methylene chloride\/hexane\/benzene. The compound crystallized as orange-yellow plates in the triclinic space group P . Disorder was observed only for the hexafluorophosphate counteranion, which was treated with a two-site disorder model [P(1), F(2), F(3), F(4), F(5), F(6), F(7)] and [P(1\u2032), F(2\u2032), F(3\u2032), F(4\u2032), F(5\u2032), F(6\u2032), F(7\u2032)] with refined site occupancy factors of 0.80 (2) and 0.20 (2), respectively. The disorder model was included in the least-squares refinement with mild rigid-bond, similar U, 1,2- and 1,3-distance restraints. The cationic palladium fragment of the complex was fully ordered. The solid state structure of 7 confirmed the solution structure as a palladium(IV) complex with a terminal fluoride ligand (). The palladium-fluorine bond distance is 1.923(4) \u212b, which is the shortest palladium-fluorine bond observed to date. The other bond lengths and angles are within the expected values of a doctahedral palladium(IV) complex supported by a Tp ligand.","In conclusion, we report the synthesis and characterization of an organometallic palladium(IV) fluoride complex. The complex is stable to air and moisture and thermally stable to at least 60\u00b0 C.","Materials and Methods","All reactions were carried out under an ambient atmosphere. Reactions were magnetically stirred and monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using EMD TLC plates pre-coated with 250 nm thickness silica gel 60 F254 plates and visualized by fluorescence quenching under UV light. In addition, TLC plates were stained using eerie ammonium molybdate or potassium permanganate stain. Flash chromatography was performed on Dynamic Adsorbents Silica Gel 40-63 \u03bcm particle size using a forced flow of eluant at 0.3-0.5 bar pressure (Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra, A. 1978, 43, 2925-2927; incorporated herein by reference). Concentration under reduced pressure was performed by rotary evaporation at 25-30\u00b0 C. at appropriate pressure. Purified compounds were further dried under high vacuum (0.01-0.05 Ton). Yields refer to purified and spectroscopically pure compounds. Melting points were measured on a Buchi 510 apparatus. All melting points were measured in open capillaries and are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded on either a Varian Unity\/Inova 600 spectrometer operating at 600 MHz for H acquisitions, a Varian Unity\/Inova 500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz and 125 MHz for H and C acquisitions, respectively, a Varian Mercury 400 spectrometer operating at 375 MHz and 160 MHz for F and P acquisitions, respectively, or a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer operating at 100 MHz for B acquisitions. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm with the solvent resonace as the internal standard. Data is reported as follows: s=singlet, br=broad, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, quin=quintet, m=multiplet; coupling constants in Hz; integration. High-resolution mass spectra were obtained on Jeol AX-505 or SX-102 spectrometers at the Harvard University Mass Spectrometry Facilities. NaPdCl.3HO and KBHwere purchased from Strem. 1-Naphthaldehyde, MeNH.HCl, and NHPFwere purchased from Alfa Aesar.

A crystal 0.050 mm\u00d70.075 mm\u00d70.100 mm in size was selected, mounted on a nylon loop with Paratone-N oil, and transferred to a Bruker SMART APEX II diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems 700 Series Cryostream Cooler and Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.71073 \u212b). A total of 1855 frames were collected at 193 (2) K with an oscillation range of 0.5\u00b0\/frame, and an exposure time of 30 s\/frame using the APEX2 suite of software. (Bruker AXS, 2006a) Data were collected to \u03b8=22.50\u00b0 rather than the routine value of \u03b8=27.50\u00b0 because the crystal examined did not exhibit usable diffraction beyond 22.50\u00b0. Unit cell refinement on all observed reflections, and data reduction with corrections for Lp and decay were performed using SAINT. (Bruker AXS, 2006b) Scaling and a numerical absorption correction were done using SADABS. (Bruker AXS, 2004) The minimum and maximum transmission factors were 0.9237 and 0.9608, respectively. A total of 18585 reflections were collected, 4559 were unique (R=0.0763), and 3098 had I>2\u03c3(I). The lack of systematic absences was consistent with the compound having crystallized in the triclinic space group P1 or P . The centrosymmetric space group P  (No. 2) was selected. The observed mean |E\u22121| value was 0.867 (versus the expectation values of 0.968 and 0.736 for centric and noncentric data, respectively).","The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on Fusing SHELXTL. (Bruker AXS, 2001) The asymmetric unit was found to contain one (fluoro)[1-{(dimethyl-amino)-methyl}naphthalenyl](tetrapyrazoylborate)palladium(IV) cation, one hexafluorophosphate anion, a half-molecule of benzene, and one dichloro-methane. All of the nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement coefficients. The hydrogen atoms were assigned isotropic displacement coefficients U(H)=1.2 U(C) or 1.5 U (C), and their coordinates were allowed to ride on their respective carbons. The hexafluorophosphate anion was treated with a two-site disorder model [P(1), F(2), F(3), F(4), F(5), F(6), F(7)] and [P(1\u2032), F(2\u2032), F(3\u2032), F(4\u2032), F(5\u2032), F(6), F(7\u2032)] with refined site occupany factors of 0.80 (2) and 0.20 (2), respectively, and included in the least-squares refinement with mild rigid-bond, similar U, 1,2- and 1,3-distance restraints. The refinement converged to R(F)=0.0603, wR(F)=0.1534, and S=1.079 for 3098 reflections with I>2\u03c3(I), and R(F)=0.1011, wR(F)=0.1783, and S=1.079 for 4559 unique reflections, 517 parameters, and 252 restraints. The maximum |\u0394\/\u03c3| in the final cycle of least-squares was less than 0.001, and the residual peaks on the final difference-Fourier map ranged from \u22120.864 to 1.312 e\u212b.
