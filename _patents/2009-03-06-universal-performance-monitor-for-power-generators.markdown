{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61\/034,912, which was filed on Mar. 7, 2008 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention encompasses a performance monitor for power generators, and more particularly to a performance monitor for power generators that is adaptable to handle data from any data source.","The power industry has been rapidly changing with the advent of deregulation as well as other socio-economic factors. As a result, increases in efficiency and control of power generation costs are becoming of more importance. To meet the industry needs, a large number of siloed information technology (IT) applications have been introduced. However, these applications are typically not built with integration in mind with each application being too proprietary in nature and specifically tailored for a particular power generation operation. Accordingly, collection and integration of data from these applications and systems are extremely difficult outside of the intended operation. Many utilities have sought to create a large scale data warehouse to solve this integration problem with very little success.","Another difficulty with prior art systems is the disparate number of locations even within the organization that needs access to the data. For example, within a power company, traders on a central trade floor, plant personnel at each power plant, engineers stationed regionally, management dispersed throughout the organization, and third parties all need access to the data in some form. The traditional siloed applications are typically client-server based applications and it is difficult to provide access to everyone in need of the data.","In addition, due to the generally isolated nature of the prior art systems as described above, combining qualitative event type data (e.g., real-time or recorded plant operations data) and quantitative data (e.g., Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and market data) becomes difficult and cumbersome, if not impossible, due to the size and disparity of the data. On the other hand, such information is important in determining proper operation of power generation as back office settlement activities determine penalties associated with under or over production of power, for example. Typically, back office personnel manually extract data from a number of different IT systems in the organization to determine the activities that occurred in prior reporting periods. Many times, logs maintained in word processing or hand written documents must be searched manually.","Moreover, when a type of report is required, IT developers have to develop some level of custom code to extract data from the data and format the data properly onto a report. This task becomes even more complicated when disparate data sources with varying data formats are used.","Accordingly, the invention encompasses a system and method for monitoring power generation operations that substantially overcomes the limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","In one embodiment, the invention encompasses a system and method for collecting power generation operation data from disparate data sources and generating a report of the performance of the operation.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.","To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described, a system encompasses a communications network, a plurality of remotely located data sources to provide power data, the power data including quantitative and qualitative data of one or more power generation units, and a performance monitor in communication with the plurality of remotely located data sources through the communications network, the performance monitor including a communications unit to extract the power data from the plurality of remotely located data sources, a data conversion unit to transform the power data into a common data format, a data store to store the transformed power data, and a user interface unit to display the transformed power data on one or more client devices through the communications network.","In one embodiment, the invention encompasses methods of communicating with a plurality of remotely located data sources from a performance monitor via a communications network, the plurality of remotely located data sources providing power data including quantitative and qualitative data of one or more power generation units, extracting the power data from the plurality of remotely located data sources, transforming the extracted power data into a common data format, storing the transformed power data in a data store, and displaying the transformed power data on one or more client devices through the communications network.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.","General Description","The invention generally encompasses systems including:","a communications network;","a plurality of remotely located data sources to provide power data, the power data including quantitative and qualitative data of one or more power generation units;

In general, the system and method of the present invention is a hosting asset performance monitoring and reporting tool used by owners or power generators, such as independently owned utilities, municipalities, and cooperatives, for example. It is to be understood that other users and benefits may be realized without departing from the scope of the invention. The system and method of the present invention provides, for example, dashboard reporting (e.g., for management-level), summary\/drill-down reporting (e.g., back office processing), daily operational reporting (e.g., operations), query interface for plant supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) information on ad-hoc basis, and near real-time status and logging capabilities. Accordingly, the system and method of the present invention provides, for example, logged information created by automated plant monitoring systems and\/or plant personnel as events occur with relative SCADA and market information. The details of the system and method of the present invention is described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","20","30","20","10","20","20","20","20","20","20","20","10"],"i":["a ","b","b ","b ","a ","a ","b "]},"The hosting monitoring center  includes power data server , market data server , and web server . It is to be understood that these servers may be implemented in a single machine or a plurality of machines without departing from the scope of the invention. The power data server  and market data server  are configured to obtain data from any number of the disparate data sources . The data sources  may be databases from hosted or unhosted systems, such as independent system operators (ISOs), regional system operators (RSOs), and SCADA data centers, for example. The data may also be obtained from internal data sources of hosted and unhosted system, such as data from internal databases, spreadsheets, and other software packages. The power data may, in some embodiments, include market-type data such as, for example, power pricing, fuel pricing, or the like. The power data server  and market data server  convert the collected data into a common format and store the transformed data in data store . The data store  may be a single or a plurality of data storage devices and may be implemented as a direct data repository or a relational database. Other data store configurations may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. The web server  communicates with client devices  to provide monitoring functionality to the users. Client devices  may be workstations, notebooks, digital personal assistants, and other data-enabled devices. The web server  processes the requests from the client devices  and provides the requested information via reports and alarms to be described further below.","In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the web server  communicates with the client devices  via web-based applications. In the exemplary embodiment, the client devices  only need a web browser and do not require any specialized applications. The web server  includes a proprietary XML-HTTP callback architecture to initiate requests from a browser from the client device , for example, back to the web server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["20","16","12","14"]},"The Gateway API in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention extracts data from the hosted system's internal applications. The Gateway API accesses known APIs of other commercial software systems and databases as well as any custom code needed to pull data from the hosted system's internal proprietary applications. In an exemplary embodiment, the Gateway API extracts data and returns the data to the web service client as either a ADO DataSet, XML document, byte array, string, or other similar data types.","The Hosting Interface API in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides the ability to communicate with the Gateway API and contains interface logic to transform data into a common data format. The Hosting Interface API, for example, pulls hourly, snapshot, and market data into the data store . The Hosting Interface API also generates log events from SCADA information.","The SQL server integration services in accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention drive the communication interfaces. The SQL server integration services utilize mapping data to execute, monitor, and report on scheduled interfaces for each hosted system. In accordance with the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the SQL server integration services include \u201cretry\u201d logic to ensure that data is not missed due to any sort of system failure.","Once the qualitative and quantitative information of the hosted power generating unit (e.g., power plant ) is available, the web server  of the hosting monitoring center  provides customized reports to the client devices  through report interfaces implemented on the web server . The report interfaces in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention are built from a customizable library of report interfaces. The report interfaces of the present invention are customized using extensible markup language (XML)-based \u201cconfig files\u201d that contain information about what data to extract and how to format the data on a report interface. Accordingly, the XML config files in accordance with the present invention combine data from any number of disparate systems into a comprehensive report. The XML config files of the present invention simply map data from the data store  directly to a report interface without requiring any customized code.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes page config files and reports config files. The page config file, as shown in , includes XML that may direct the page to change any property of the page itself, or any property of any control on the page. This allows the user interface to be changed without writing any code and increases maintainability across multiple client devices . For example, when the page initially loads, the browser automatically looks for a page config file. If a page config file is found, the browser processes the XML for the page contained in the page config file. Each page or control property identified in the XML is then set based on the page config file setting. To illustrate, a button on the page may be hidden by setting the visible property of the button equal to hidden. Furthermore, properties have been created on certain pages such as a unit status report interface, to be explained below, that allow customization of entire sections of the page through the use of custom user controls. In addition, a config file may define standard .NET framework user controls that make-up a page. A particular user control may be overridden for one or more user or customer locations (e.g., power stations or generators) via the config file. In some embodiments, a class (e.g., basePage) invoked because of a load page event may process the config file, change page properties, and override user controls. In the case scenario where a user control is overridden, a new user control may be loaded and a local variable may be set accordingly.","The reports config file defines the layout of a report interface using XML included in the reports config file. The reports config file includes XML fragments for each object to be displayed on the report interface (e.g., graph, pie chart, data table, etc.) The XML fragment includes information specific to the object being shown (e.g., location on report, height, width, colors, etc.) as well as mapping information back to the data store  as to what data should be displayed. There may be mappings to multiple stored procedures defined for a single report object. For example, a chart may pull hourly megawatt (MW) data from one stored procedure and hourly price information from another in conjunction with a reporting engine to be described below. In an exemplary embodiment, reports config files may be defined for a single report but have different configurations depending on what hosted system (e.g., power plant) the report is for. For example, each reports config file may have a \u201cdefault\u201d configuration defined. For any hosted system (e.g., power plant) or unit (e.g., generators) referred to as \u201clocations,\u201d where the report is to have a different look and feel and\/or different data source, a subsequent \u201coverride\u201d XML fragment is defined for the location. Any location that does not have the override fragment reverts to the default layout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["410","420","430","440","450","410","410","430","410","410","450","410","410"]},"In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the report interface  is categorized as one of the following: dashboard report interface, daily operational report interface, quantitative summary\/drill-down report interface (also referred to as \u201cunit performance\u201d interface), an ad-hoc SCADA query interface, and unit status communication interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5K","FIGS. 5A-5K","FIGS. 5A-5K"],"b":["18","40","16","16","410","410","450","40","40","20","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIGS. 6A and 6B"],"b":["40","16","16","410","410","40","40","20","18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7B"],"b":["430","40","16","440","16","40","40","16","440","18","40"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIGS. 8-11B","FIG. 8"],"b":["805","810","815","820","825"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["905","910","915","920","925","930","935"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1005","1010"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIG. 11B"]},"In addition to the real time monitoring, the system and method of the present invention includes alarm monitoring and tracking of user-defined significant events. For example, the monitoring center  of the present invention tracks and logs when a hosted unit comes on-line or goes off-line. The monitoring center  tracks alarms against any generation operational parameter that is archived in the time-series data store . This is implemented by querying the time-series historical data store  for values archived for a selected operational parameter over a set time interval. For example, for a generator unit on-line alarm, the monitoring center  queries the historical archive in the data store  for a fifteen (15) minute interval and examines breaker status recorded during that timeframe. Any change in the monitored value represents an event, which triggers an alarm. Once examination for the given parameter and time period is complete, the monitored time interval is marked as examined and the alarm as tracked. Future monitoring of the historical archived data in the data store  will check subsequent intervals based on what has already been marked as examined.","The alarming feature is not limited to tracking on\/off types or digital state data. Rather, monitored recorded events may also be examined based on numerical thresholds. For example, generation managers may wish to monitor megawatt (MW) levels and create different events based on the number of megawatts produced at a power generation facility. The plant may want to be alerted when the megawatt (MW) level reaches a specific level, such as 100, 250, and 500. Each MW level reached requires a unique action or log entry to be recorded. Such alarms are defined in the monitoring center  to initiate tracking and logging. For example, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, alarms may be defined by noting the following data points:\n\n","To ensure all intervals are examined, examined archived data may be marked by noting:\n\n","This serves to baseline subsequent interval checks. It is to be understood that other notations may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the system and method of the present invention, monitoring of any number of hosted power generation units is realized by collecting qualitative (e.g., event data) and quantitative (e.g., cost, market data) information from a plurality of disparate data sources, converting the disparate data into a common data format, and storing the transformed data to be served up through a communications network, such as the Internet, to a plurality of client devices that may be located anywhere in the world. The various report interfaces in accordance with the present invention allow the user to monitor the performance of the hosted power generation units including a comparison of the actual performance of the monitored unit with expected (i.e., budgeted) performance. The system and method of the present invention generates reports using XML config files to reduce the time to build and customize any number of reports. The XML config files allow developers to simply map data from database stored procedures directly to a report without writing any code to reduce the time required to deliver a report and eliminate the need for any code changes to existing applications.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the system and method of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["I.
