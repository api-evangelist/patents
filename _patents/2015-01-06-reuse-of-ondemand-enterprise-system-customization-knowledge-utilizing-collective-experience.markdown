title: Reuse of on-demand enterprise system customization knowledge utilizing collective experience
abstract: Systems and methods allow sharing and reuse of acquired customization knowledge of enterprise systems, utilizing collective customization experience. Particular embodiments employ Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) principles to manage customization experience in the context of both Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) environments. Collective customization knowledge may be explicitly retrieved, adapted, shared, reused, and/or traded between tenants, partners, and optionally provider(s), of on-demand enterprise systems. A previous customization case stored within an experience base, may include one or more of the following: information allowing annotation of price information for trading the previous customization case (e.g. to another tenant); information restricting visibility of the previous customization case within the experience base; information defining a rating for the previous customization case within a community; information capturing a reuse frequency of the previous customization case; and/or information rendering anonymous at least a portion of the previous customization case.

Typically the integration of services, provided by partners or independent software vendors, is carried out in time- and cost intensive integration projects.","In most cases, extension or adaptation of a core enterprise system itself is required. In order to extend or adapt standard enterprise systems a very high level of business domain knowledge as well as technical expert knowledge are required. Therefore services are typically integrated by highly specialized expert consultants (system or service integrators).","System integrators typically start from scratch while integrating services into standard enterprise systems. Given a new integration problem system integrators implicitly and manually search for similar problems they solved in the past, e.g. by searching in code fragments or documentations of already solved integration solutions. This implies a high degree of manual work and therefore leads to high integration costs.","Systems and methods allow sharing and reuse of acquired customization knowledge of enterprise systems, utilizing collective customization experience.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous examples and specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention. Particular embodiments as defined by the claims may include some or all of the features in these examples alone or in combination with other features described below, and may further include modifications and equivalents of the features and concepts described herein.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","104","104"]},"In one example, the service integrator inputs a new integration problem that includes a problem description into case-based retrieval framework . The integration problem may be considered an integration case also. However, the term integration problem is used for discussion purposes and is an integration cases that does not include a solution. Case-based retrieval framework  searches knowledge base  to determine integration cases that have been previously solved. Case-based retrieval framework  outputs the integration cases based on the similarity to the new integration problem. The service integrator may then use the integration cases, which include a problem description and problem solution to determine the solution for the new integration problem.","In one embodiment, case-based retrieval framework  is used when an extension to a standard enterprise system is being performed. Such a standard enterprise system is also referred to herein a packaged enterprise software. A standard enterprise system may be a standard software system, such as an enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), or supplier relationship management (SRM) system. The standard enterprise system may be sent to a variety of companies. Each company may want to adapt or extend the standard enterprise system. For example, certain customizations may be performed, such as by adding new service integrator interface (UI) elements to core UI components, adding new process steps to core process models or even extending business objects with additional fields.","In one embodiment, the system integrator may want to integrate a complementary service into the standard enterprise system. The integration problem may be described based on different categories that define the problem, such as the categories of an integration goal, an integration context, and integration requirements. Based on the problem description, case-based retrieval framework  searches knowledge base  for similar integration cases that have already been solved in the past using a case retrieval algorithm. A list of existing integration cases is generated and output to the system integrator. The list contains integration cases that are ranked according to their computed similarity to the integration problem currently.","Once selected, an integration case may be adapted to the integration problem that is trying to be solved. Embodiments of the present invention relate to a framework for performing this adaptation.","Case-based Reasoning Cycle","Particular embodiments use case-based reasoning for determining the integration cases.  depicts a case-based reasoning cycle  for service integration according to one embodiment. Particular embodiments focus on an adapt integration solution phase. However, the entire cycle will be described.","At , a new integration case is initiated. At , an integration goal phase is performed. The integration goal defines the general goal that should be reached by the integration solution. For example, the goal may indicate what kind of target system should be extended, what kind of customizing\/flexibility use case should be implemented, or what kind of integration flavor should be implemented (e.g., a service integrator interface or process extension). As will be described below, the integration goal may be defined using a wizard-based questionnaire.","At , a define integration context phase is performed. The integration context defines the functional area within the enterprise system where the service should be integrated. For example, the functional area may be core UI or process components that need to be extended to integrate the service. The context may be a service context and\/or a target system context. The service context is associated with the provider of the service and describes the context of a service that may be integrated. For example, the service may be provided by an outside provider and\/or the enterprise. The service context may define what service should be integrated or what are the business semantics of the service.","The target system context is a consumer context, that is, the context associated with the customized enterprise system. The target system context determines which functional area of the enterprise system the service should be integrated (business semantics) or what components in the enterprise system should be extended (e.g., UI and\/or process components). The integration context may be defined using a wizard-based questionnaire as will be described below.","At , a define integration requirements phase is performed. The integration requirements may be grouped into different categories that may describe requirements for the integration solution. For example, the categories may be UI extension requirements, process extension requirements, business logic extension requirements, technical integration requirements, and non-functional integration requirements. These integration requirements may be defined using the wizard-based questionnaire and will be described in more detail below.","At , a retrieve similar integration cases phase is performed. In this phase, existing integration cases that have problem descriptions that are considered most similar to the problem description of the new integration problem are determined and output. The similarity is computed using a range of different similarity measures. The different types of similarity measures may depend on different attributes defined in the new integration problem. Customization of weights for the different similarity measures may be provided and are described below.","At , an adapt integration solution phase is performed. A similar integration case that is output may be selected and re-used as a template to be adapted with respect to the new integration problem. In one embodiment, a problem solution part of a similar case may be extracted and adapted to the new application context of the new integration problem to be solved. The integration solution may be modeled using adaptation patterns that may link patterns to extension points of service elements, add patterns, delete patterns, and replace patterns. The adaptation integration solution phase is described in more detail below in connection with .","At , a revised integration solution phase is performed. In this phase, the adapted or solved new integration case is validated as to whether it meets the integration requirements. The criteria may include the correctness of the solution and quality of the solution.","At , a retain integration case phase is performed. After the solved new integration problem has been validated, an integration case with the problem description and the solution is stored in knowledge base . This case may be used in future cases to solve other integration problems. For example, case-based retrieval framework  may learn by the learning of a new experience (new integration case), learning of similarity knowledge (e.g. weights), or learning of adaptation knowledge.","Integration Case Description",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["102","104","302","304","106","306"]},"Case representation meta-model  provides metadata that describes categories for a customization case. For example,  shows different categories included in a customization case  according to one embodiment. Broadly, customization case  includes a customization problem  and a customization solution .","Customization problem  is a description of the problem for the customization case. For example, a description of the problem may be what extension needs to be performed on the standard enterprise system. Customization problem  covers information to decide if this case is applicable for a new customization problem (query case). In one embodiment, the content includes the goal to be achieved by the customization solution, the context of the problem situation, and requirements\/constraints for the customization solution.","Customization solution  is the solution for the problem. The solution for the problem may be how to extend, enhance, and\/or modify the standard enterprise system. Customization solution  includes information that describes a solution to the integration problem sufficiently. For example, the information includes the solution itself (e.g., integration models, substantiated adaptation patterns, extended core models, other documentation), possible alternative solutions, feedback\/solution evaluation, and justification\/explanations.","At , the specific categories for integration case  are shown. The meta-model includes a problem description  (corresponding to customization problem ) and a problem solution  (corresponding to integration solution ).","Problem description  includes different attributes that can be defined for the problem. Although the attributes included in problem description  are described, case-based retrieval framework  is designed in such a way that it is possible to flexibly add further attributes and similarity measures. The attributes outlined are just examples. The integration goal description includes attributes that may define the enterprise system that should be extended, define the customizing or flexibility use case that should be implemented, or define the principle integration flavor of the service in the target consumption environment of the enterprise system.","Different attributes are described in Table 1 in Appendix A. The attributes of Appendix A are only examples, however, and the case description itself is extensible in the sense that further attributes can be added. The adaptation procedure discussed in detail below may utilize one or more of these attributes to compute the differences between the query and retrieved customization case.","The integration context description describes the service that should be integrated into the enterprise system and defines the business semantics of the service to be integrated. Also, in an enterprise system context, the business semantics of the target components in the enterprise system that should be extended by the new service, the target UI components of the enterprise system that should be extended\/adapted, and the target process components of the enterprise system that should be extended\/adapted may be defined. Different attributes for the integration context specification are described in Table 2 of Appendix A.","The integration requirements specification includes different categories of UI extension requirements, process extension requirements, business logic extension requirements, technical integration requirements, and non-functional requirements. UI extension requirements define how an existing UI component of the standard enterprise system should be extended in order to integrate the complementary service (delivered by a third party provider, e.g. ISV).","UI extension requirements are the requirements that define what is needed to extend the UI. UI extension requirements that define a textual description of the integration requirements, how the service should be triggered within a UI component, whether the UI component needs to be extended with additional UI controls, and whether the UI component needs to be extended with additional UI controls to gather information that is required to call the service or show\/display result values of the service implication. Table 3 of Appendix A shows different attributes for the UI extension requirements specification.","Process extension requirements define how an existing process component of the standard enterprise system should be extended in order to integrate the complementary service (delivered by a third party provider, e.g. ISV). Process extension requirements may define the initiator of a process extension scenario, a position with respect to a process where the extension process should be plugged in, whether data should flow from a core process to an extension process, whether data should flow from the extension process to the core process, the communication mode between the core process and the extension process, whether multiple core processes are involved in the integration scenario, and whether multiple extension processes are involved in the integration scenario may be defined. Table 4 of Appendix A describes different attributes for process extension requirements.","Business logic extension requirements define how the existing business or application logic of the standard enterprise system should be extended in order to integrate the complementary service (delivered by a third party provider, e.g. ISV). Business logic extension requirements may define different attributes that may be associated with the business logic of an application. For example, the different attributes may define whether data returned from a service should be persistent in the enterprise system, whether the integration logic has to read data from the enterprise system, whether the integration logic has to write data into the enterprise system, whether the integration logic needs to access additional business logic on the enterprise system, whether an interactive service integrator task is required in the integration logic, whether a human service integrator task is required in the integration logic, whether a customizing parameter has to be set\/adjusted in the enterprise system, and whether a new customizing parameter has to be added to the enterprise system. Table 5 of Appendix A describes attributes in the business logic extension requirements.","External service integration requirements describe requirements that are used to define how to integrate external services. The attributes define whether standard business-to-business (B2B) protocols should be used for the communication with the external service and which technical communication protocols should be used for the communication with the external service. Table 6 of Appendix A shows different attributes for the external service integration requirements.","Non-functional integration requirements define non-functional constraints that the extension logic defined by the service integrator should fulfill. Non-functional integration requirements define whether the integration logic needs to authenticate in the communication with the external service, whether the communication is performance-critical and if caching mechanisms are required, whether the communication with the external service should be logged, whether the messages sent to the service or received from the service should be encrypted, whether the messages sent to the service or received from the service should be digitally signed, and whether some specific transaction handling is required. Table 7 of Appendix A shows different attributes for non-functional integration requirements.","A previous integration\/customization case stored within an experience base for possible reuse, may further include one or more of the following pieces of information: information allowing annotation of price information for trading the previous customization case (e.g. to another tenant); information restricting visibility of the previous customization case within the experience base; information defining a rating for the previous customization case within a community; information capturing a reuse frequency of the previous customization case; and\/or information rendering anonymous at least a portion of the previous customization case.","Case Retrieval","Case representation meta-model  provides metadata that describes categories for an integration case.

The following will describe the retrieve similar integration cases phase. In one example, a case retrieval algorithm uses a similarity assessment based on a local-global principle. The local-global principle computes local similarity measures for attributes and then computes a global similarity measure using the local similarity measures. This process will be described in more detail below.","The similarity assessment computes the similarity between a new integration problem (e.g., query case) and an integration case (e.g., existing case) from knowledge base .  shows an example of a similarity assessment according to one embodiment.

For each attribute, a separate similarity function may be used. However, the same similarity function may be used multiple times in comparing different attributes types. First, a local similarity measure is performed on the respective attribute type. A global similarity measure may then be determined by combining the local similarity measures using an amalgamation function (e.g., a weighted average of the local similarity measures).","The following will describe the global similarity measure and then different examples for local similarity measures for the attributes of the problem description.

A principle of the approach is the dedicated involvement of the system integrator as the human expert within the case adaptation process, by providing recommendations on how to adapt the retrieved customization case to the new problem context.

This common infrastructure provides a source of collective customization knowledge. Systematic management and reuse of project experience within such a cloud-platform according to embodiments could allow customers and partners to share or even trade customization knowledge, increasing the attractiveness of the entire ecosystem.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0248","num":"0247"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1202","1203","1205","1204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0248"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["410","410","405","401","405","410","402","405","401","401","403","403"]},"Computer system  may be coupled via bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD), for displaying information to a computer service integrator. An input device  such as a keyboard and\/or mouse is coupled to bus  for communicating information and command selections from the service integrator to processor . The combination of these components allows the service integrator to communicate with the system. In some systems, bus  may be divided into multiple specialized buses.","Computer system  also includes a network interface  coupled with bus . Network interface  may provide two-way data communication between computer system  and the local network . The network interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) or a modem to provide data communication connection over a telephone line, for example. Another example of the network interface is a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links are another example. In any such implementation, network interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.","Computer system  can send and receive information through the network interface  across a local network , an Intranet, or the Internet . In the Internet example, software components or services may reside on multiple different computer systems  or servers - across the network.

A server  may transmit actions or messages from one component, through Internet , local network , and network interface  to a component on computer system . The software components and processes described above may be implemented on any computer system and send and\/or receive information across a network, for example.","Description of Standard Enterprise System","The case-based adaptation method may be used in extending standard enterprise systems, including on-demand enterprise systems. Standard enterprise systems may be described with a single overall abstracted model that spans across four abstraction layers, such as the presentation layer, business process layer, service layer, and business configuration layer. An enterprise system includes multiple business applications or reference processes that leverage a common service and business configuration layer.  shows a more detailed example of an enterprise system  according to one embodiment. Enterprise system  may be described with a single overall abstracted model that spans across a number (e.g., four) of abstraction layers, such as a presentation layer , a business process layer , a service layer , and a business configuration layer . Enterprise system  includes multiple (service-based) business applications that leverage a common service layer  and business configuration layer .","Presentation layer  comprises all artifacts and components for a service integrator interface (UI) part of the business application. In one embodiment, UI components (UI views ) for a dedicated UI platform with all interrelations are located within presentation layer . The service integrator interface will be described in more detailed below.","Business process layer  contains models  of business processes  that are realized within the business application. Modeling elements for business processes may contain references to elements on other layers. For example, a human activity in a business process can refer to a UI component  with the implementation of the human service integrator interface. An automated activity can refer to a service declared in the service layer  with the implementation of the needed business functionality.","Service layer  contains services offered by enterprise system . Core services provide access to business objects. Composite services represent compositions of core services into larger bundles to provide advanced higher-value business functionality or application logic.","Business configuration layer  contains the configuration data for business applications with available parameters and configuration options (also known as \u2018customizing\u2019) for business applications.","In order to adapt standard business applications to customer specific needs, enterprise systems  provide a large set of proprietary extensibility\/adaptability features .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0260","num":"0259"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"1100"},"Currently, consulting companies expend significant effort in the training and education of new consultants to become domain experts. Consulting companies also expend significant effort to allow consultants to exchange knowledge and share their best practices and experiences gained in on-premise or on-demand integration projects. Moreover, while integration experience may be found in consulting teams, such knowledge is not typically systematically leveraged.","Embodiments as described herein may thus allow response to marketplace pressures to deliver integration solutions in a shorter time with fewer costs to customers. Embodiments could also facilitate off-shore development approaches in the area of system integration in large-scale customer landscapes.","According to a second application Area  of , integration\/extension knowledge may be systematically reused within partner-ecosystems of on-demand enterprise systems. Specifically, on-demand standard enterprise software is finding increasing use. In contrast to on-premise solutions, such on-demand subscribers typically require less on-site consulting.","Subscribers of on-demand standard enterprise software request easier and faster integration of complementary services. This has led to the emergence of eco-systems in which service marketplaces and application stores provide complementary solutions (e.g. add-ons) to standard enterprise systems developed by ISVs\/partners. Moreover, providers of on-demand standard enterprise software have begun to offer partner development environments (PaaS) facilitating the more rapid development of extensions\/complementary solutions and third-party service integrations.","Thus according to various embodiments, multiple tenants and partners (=domain experts) may share a common infrastructure providing a valuable resource to systematically share integration\/extension knowledge. In certain cases, such knowledge exchange might be possible between different tenants.","According to a third potential application area  of , embodiments may allow systematic reuse of integration\/extension knowledge within large-scale, heterogeneous system landscapes. Specifically, large organizations may be able to employ embodiments to reuse existing solutions, or to adapt existing solutions for reuse within the specialized knowledge spheres present within the context of a larger system environment.","Particular embodiments may be implemented in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, system, or machine.
