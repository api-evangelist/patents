The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software, data, and\/or screenshots that may be illustrated below and in the drawings that form a part of this document: Copyright\u00a9 2007, SAP AG. All Rights Reserved.","The present application relates generally to the technical field of algorithms and programming and, in one specific example, to the optimization of search techniques and user interfaces (UIs).","Search techniques are commonly based upon general principles or bases for conducting a search. These principles include often include basing the success of the search upon whether a match, or near match, for the search query is actually discovered and provided as a search result. Such an approach may not take into account the importance of context and relations between search terms when conducting a search.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of an embodiment of the present invention. It will be evident to one skilled in the art, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","The leading digit(s) of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the FIG. number in which that component is first introduced, such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component that appears in multiple figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label, and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.","Illustrated is a system and method for leveraging existing database functionality and operations (e.g., joins, inner and outer joins, cartesian product, difference, union, intersection, and other operations known in the art) to generate Natural Language (NL) based search results. These NL search results may be in the form of a rephrase (e.g., a semantic query). This semantic query may be in the form of a record or tuple value, existing as part of one or more database table attributes (e.g., domains), that are related via one or more relational phrases. The ability to perform various database operations on these tuple values also provides the basis for relating these tuple values through relational phrases (e.g., semantic relations). The generation of search queries and the retrieval of search results (e.g., semantic queries) based upon these search queries may be considered mixed (e.g., a mixed initiative) in that search queries may be made of one or more default domains, and\/or may made of user-specified domains. In certain cases, the role of a user (e.g., a user as a manager, employee, or sales person) within an organization dictates the domains that may be searched and the relationships that may be established between the retrieved tuple values. In certain cases, an administrator may set certain privileges for a user to establish their role and the default queries (e.g., default semantic queries) they are entitled to see. These privileges may also determine the search terms, operators, or other tools for searching that a user may be able to use.","The illustrated system and method may reside as part of an enterprise search application such as SAP ENTERPRISE SEARCH\u2122, or some other suitable enterprise search application. Further, this system and method may be divided into two parts: a training phrase (see e.g., ), and a search phase (see e.g., ). First, users may be allowed to generate training data, and search results may be based upon this training data. In some embodiments, this training phrase may occur contemporaneously with the search phase, such that a user may populate a domain with search terms and then perform a search using these search terms. These search terms may be specific to some type of enterprise or business context. Moreover, during the search phase, existing databases can be used which have not been created solely in the training phase, but are commonly available (e.g., enterprise databases).","Example Domains and Sub-Domains","In some embodiments, a domain is a synonym for category or concept, and likewise sub-domains are sub-categories, or sub-concepts. That is, for example, a term that can be assigned to a domain may also be assigned to a sub-domain, and during the parsing of a search query the query may be assigned or even parsed as part of a domain or sub-domain. Further, in some embodiments, a domain may be a category which, in turn, may be thought of as a set of entities that belong to the same type. For example, a user may enter any of the following search statements including \u2018term1 term2\u2019 (e.g., focusing here only on assignment of term1) such that a query 1 of \u201cMercedes with ID 4711-999 Barcelona\u201d results in the following parsing and domain assignment: on domain level (e.g., \u2018Mercedes with ID 4711-999\u2019 ISA vehicle; Barcelona ISA city) or, optionally on the sub-domain level (e.g., \u201cMercedes with ID 4711-999\u2032 ISA car; Barcelona ISA city\u201d). Further, a query 2 of \u201ccar Barcelona\u201d results in the following parsing and domain assignment: on domain level (e.g., \u201ccar ISA vehicle; Barcelona ISA city\u201d), or optionally on sub-domain level (e.g., \u201ccar ISA car*; Barcelona ISA city\u201d). Still further, an example query 3: \u201cvehicle Barcelona\u201d results in the following parsing and assignment-on domain level (e.g., \u201cvehicle ISA vehicle*; Barcelona ISA city\u201d).","Example Relations","In some embodiments, while hierarchical relations between domains are pervasive in ontologies\/semantic webs, usually relations are considered to be \u201cunidimensional\u201d. Here, however, multi-dimensional relations may be implemented such that individual terms (e.g., as entered by users as part of a search query) can each be assigned to concepts of varying hierarchical levels (e.g., can be assigned to concepts or sub-concepts, and as a consequence, different types of relations with respect to their hierarchical relationship to each other may be considered). For example, based upon the following assignment: term1 ISA airplane; term2 ISA city, the following relations can be asserted: flies to, lands at airport of. And again, based upon the following assignments: term1 ISA vehicle; term2 ISA city, the following relations can be asserted: moves to; arrives at destination. In some embodiments, \u201cmoves to\u201d can be considered to be a superordinate relation as compared to, for example, \u201cflies to\u201d etc.","Some embodiments may include stating that these or other kinds of semantic relations between\/among relations can be expressed by means of rules or other notations which may resemble the notations which are being used to express hierarchical relationships a between domains and sub-domains, etc. Further, as stated above, the hierarchical level of which relations (e.g., hierarchical relations between semantic relations or groups of semantic relations) can be assumed to hold between two terms may depend on the hierarchical level of the domains\/concepts\/categories to which the particular terms have been assigned. Moreover, it should be added that as much as terms can be assigned to domains by default semantic processing and\/or by user initiative, or by a combination of both, the same holds true for the selection of relations between assigned terms. While, for example, the system may propose a default or most probable relation between assigned terms, users could override this relation by selecting a different one, for example, from a set of relations proposed by the system on the basis of assigned terms. Additionally, for the sake of completeness, users may reassign any term to a different domain, initiating a dynamic updating of the set of available relations to select from. For example, when assigning a term to a more subordinate domain level, e.g., to a sub-domain, the resulting set of applicable relations between newly assigned terms may entail more concrete, subordinate relations (e.g., as compared to the initial set of relations to select from).","Example Searches","With regard to the actual searches that are conducted, users may be able to conduct searches and retrieve search results not based upon text containing the literal text string, e.g., \u201cmanager Sue,\u201d but rather users may be able to retrieve search results relating to \u201cmanager who reports to Sue\u201d, \u201cSue reports to manager\u201d, or some other set of search results based upon training data or based upon data pre-existing in an enterprise database. And again, in certain cases, the name of a manager may be supplied as a search result in response to the search queries \u201cmanager who is supervising Sue\u201d or \u201cmanager who reports to Sue\u201d.","In the above examples, \u201cSue\u201d and \u201cManager\u201d may be tuples in one or more databases, and \u201cwho reports to\u201d and \u201creports to\u201d may be semantic relations supplied to link these tuples. For example, various semantic queries may be generated using the search phrase \u201cmanager Sue,\u201d where \u201cmanager\u201d (e.g., a term #1) and \u201cSue\u201d (e.g., a term #2) are parsed out of the search phrase and the relation between these two words is determined. In cases where the terms have been assigned to a domain such as \u201cpersons,\u201d it can be assumed that \u201cManager is a person\u201d and \u201cSue is a person.\u201d Based upon this assumption, certain relations may be inferred and semantic queries generated. Specifically, possible relations may be inferred such that term #1 relates to term #2 (term1RELATION term2), where the relation may be any one of a number of predefined relations (e.g., RELATION:={direct|report to|buy from|sell to| . . . } etc.). These terms may be provided as training data (see e.g., training data packet  below). Example semantic queries resulting from the rephrasing of relations may include:","\u201cWhich manager reports to Sue?\u201d","\u201cWho is the manager of Sue?\u201d","\u201cWhich manager buys from Sue?\u201d","\u201cFrom which manager does Sue buy?\u201d","\u201cTo which manager does Sue sell?\u201d","\u201cWhich manager sells to Sue?\u201d","As previously illustrated, this rephrasing of a search phrase may occur such that terms in the same or different domains may be used to generate a semantic query.","In some embodiments, certain database principles and operations are leveraged to facilitate the generation of semantic queries. In cases where a search is conducted, for example, the search query \u201cmanager Sue\u201d may be parsed and converted to a default search query in the form of \u201c(manager ISA person) AND (Sue ISA person)\u201d, wherein the semantic query \u201cWho is the manager who directs Sue?\u201d is generated that results in \u201cPhil\u201d as a search result based upon ajoin operation being performed. More to the point, tables containing \u201cSue\u201d and\/or the unique key value by which \u201cSue\u201d is identified may be joined. In one embodiment, once joined, a list of semantic relations may be employed to join members of a sub-domain wherein a relationship can be inferred (see e.g., R(Employee; Manager)={reports to\/is trained by\/is hired by\/ . . . }). In some embodiments, once the semantic query is generated and selected by a user, the search result (e.g., \u201cPhil\u201d) may be provided as a result of the execution of the join operation. This result is reflected in the below tables, where OrgUnit serves to uniquely identify each member of the set of persons.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Persons","Domain Key","OrgUnit","Value"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Sue","1","B","Employee"]},{"entry":[{},"John","1","C","Manager"]},{"entry":[{},"Mary","1","A","Manager"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Persons","Domain Key","Value","OrgUnit"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Phil","1","manager","B"]},{"entry":[{},"Peter","1","employee","C"]},{"entry":[{},"Larry","1","employee","A"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"domain","Domain Key"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"person","1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Some embodiments may include inter-domain relations being represented. For example, \u201cSue\u201d may be an owner of one company directing various managers such as \u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cMary.\u201d These managers may be working for different companies. The fact that \u201cSue,\u201d \u201cJohn,\u201d and \u201cMary\u201d all work for different companies implies that they exist as part of the same or different domains. In one example, a search is conducted across domains wherein the search query is \u201cowner Acme\u201d. This search query may be transformed into a default search query (e.g., (owner ISA person) AND (Acme ISA company)) that generates the semantic query such as \u201cowner [a person]\u2014who sells\u2014Acme [company]\u201d; \u201cowner [a person]\u2014who buys\u2014Acme [company]\u201d.

For example, if the user conducts a search as a manager, then the semantic query and search results illustrating persons who the user \u201cis a manager of\u201d may be returned as a default semantic query. In some embodiments, relations which are related to managing activities may be suggested by the method and system if they are suitable to the domains to which search terms are being assigned. Further, if, for example, the user who is conducting a search is an employee, then the persons to whom the user \u201creports to\u201d may be returned as a default semantic query. And again, if, for example, the user's role is as a sales representative, then search queries that contain a name may be, by default, interpreted as referring to, for example, \u201cbusiness partner representatives\u201d (e.g., business contacts). If the user's role is an accounting clerk, search queries containing a name may, by default, be interpreted as referring to \u201cmoney transfer recipients\u201d.","In some embodiments, this mixed initiative searching may be facilitated through a matrix search (e.g., a search using a matrix, or array of matrices such as a multi-dimensional array, as a data structure). A matrix search may include allowing a user to input (e.g., using a GUI) one or several search terms that seem critical to users, in order to retrieve information that matches their needs and expectations. Next, a user may be able to view search results to decide whether they match the user's needs and expectations, and whether additional search results or search result details should be displayed. Additionally, a user may be able to assign search terms to domains (domain assignment), thus identifying or narrowing the range of search results that qualify as meeting user's needs and expectations. Moreover, a user may be able to view proposed semantic relations between search terms, by means of rephrases that state the assumed question the user had in mind when entering search terms. The user may be able to identify the desired semantic relation\u2014as expressed by a rephrase in natural language terms, and\/or to alter the set of results and only secondarily to further narrow search results that meet user's needs and expectations, as indicated by the stated search terms. Still further, a user may be able to reassign any of the search terms to a different domain, or to replace existing search terms with the ones that were entered previously, or any combination of both in order to redefine the search result specification or to change the very relation which may have been inserted by means of system or user initiative, or a combination thereof.","Some embodiments may include a method based on both assignments of search terms to domains, and of interpretations of semantic relations between search terms that follow from the respective domain assignments. Specifically, based on the particular domain assignments, more specific semantic relations between concepts\u2014as implied by the stated search terms and their domain assignments\u2014can be retrieved. For example, a search term can be interpreted as the token for a particular type (e.g., a class), or, in optional wording, as an exemplar (or particular) that belongs to a concept (or universal). Types (or concepts), are subordinates of domains. Alternatively, domains\/concepts\/categories could be considered as synonyms and a subordinate\/intermediate class of sub-domains\/sub-concepts\/sub-categories could be considered\/introduced.","In some embodiments, even in the case where users do not make explicit assignments of search terms to domains, the relevant domains can be inferred with the help of the intermediate type (e.g., or (sub) concept). For example, by using a matrix search when users enter the search term \u201cVolvo,\u201d it can be inferred that \u201cVolvo\u201d is the token of the type \u201ccars,\u201d and, as a consequence, that the search term \u201cVolvo\u201d can be assigned to the domain of \u201cvehicles.\u201d Further, a matrix search can offer rephrases (e.g., explanations of semantic relations between search terms as they have been assigned to particular domains) that relate the search terms in meaningful ways.","Further, in another example, where an explicit assignment of a search term is used, such as \u201cMueller\u201d and \u201cmanager\u201d to the domain \u201cPersons\u201d (or \u201cPeople\u201d), respectively, this allows a user to retrieve the semantic relations that typically apply to this domain (e.g., an intra-domain relation). Specifically, \u201cMueller\u201d (as token for the type \u201cManager\u201d) directs a person of type \u201cEmployee\u201d (as assigned to the domain \u201cPersons\u201d). Once the domain assignment is explicit, only data object attributes need to be taken into account. When the intra-domain relation is \u201cbetween People,\u201d only attributes need to be considered that are person-related: For example, for the data object \u201cContacts\u201d the semantic relation needs to be applied only to the name attributes (e.g., relations between Name attributes, but not between Phone attributes of a contact). In one embodiment, search terms are assigned to domains in terms of \u201c<search term> is a (type of) domain.\u201d Other variants of assignments (e.g., semantic relations) can be employed as well, for example \u201cis not a (type of),\u201d or, \u201cis part of,\u201d etc.","In some embodiments, the following table provides the results of example searches (e.g., user

Such a browser may use, for example, web pages written using a voice based XML (e.g., Voice XML). Further, in some cases, some type of speech recognition software may be used to facilitate the generating of search queries and providing of search results and semantic queries to a user .","Some embodiments may include one or more interfaces used to facilitate semantic searching.

Technologies that may be used to implement these various UI elements and layout elements include: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), and even Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) in the case of UI elements. In certain cases, AJAX may be used to merge certain functionality (see e.g., #A and #B illustrated below) using a dynamic rendering of possible term-domain assignments from which users may select at the time of entering their search terms. Put another way, a UI element written using AJAX may be used to assign a search query to a domain.","Some example layout elements include:\n\n","Example embodiments may include a floor plan that is directly tied to the application parts as specified in the previous section.

There are a number of other optional instances of the floor plan. For example, the relations area #E can be below the best hits area #D or above the best hit header area #C. Also, there can be different design implementations for each floor plan area. For example, the controls for adding or removing input fields in areas #A and #B can appear differently or be arranged at different locations within the same areas. Regarding the best hits area #D, a different set of search results can be displayed, specifically, for example, a single result only can be displayed with an additional link \u201cMore\u201d to display more results.

In this, the case of a database using cubes and MDX, a database using Multidimensional On Line Analytic Processing (MOLAP), Relational On Line Analytic Processing (ROLAP), Hybrid Online Analytic Processing (HOLAP), or some other suitable database application may be used to manage the data. These tables or cubes made up of tables, in the case of, for example, ROLAP, are organized into a RDS or Object Relational Data Schema (ORDS), as is known in the art. These schemas may be normalized using certain normalization algorithms so as to avoid abnormalities such as non-additive joins and other problems. Additionally, these normalization algorithms may include Boyce-Codd Normal Form or some other normalization, and optimization algorithm known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0138"},"figref":"FIG. 35","b":["3500","411","3505","408","3504","3504","3503","3503","3502","3501","3502","3505"]},"Component Design","Some example embodiments may include the above-illustrated modules and operations being written as one or more software components. Common to many of these components is the ability to generate, use, and manipulate the above-illustrated UI elements and layout elements and the data associated therewith. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components can be implemented into the system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), or Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) or other suitable technique. These components are linked to other components via various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Business Application Programming Interfaces (BAPIs) and then compiled into one complete server and\/or client application. The method for using components in the building of client and server applications is well known in the art. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above-illustrated components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a GUI). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. These various levels can be written using the above-illustrated component design principles and can be written in the same programming language or a different programming language. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various levels, and components contained therein, to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, an operation written in C++ using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) can communicate with another remote module written in JAVA\u2122. These protocols include SOAP and CORBA or some other suitable protocol. These protocols are well-known in the art.","Example Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0141"},"figref":"FIG. 36","b":["3600","402","3600"]},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or both), a main memory , and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system  may further include a video display unit  (e.g., a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)). The computer system  also includes an alpha-numeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard), a user interface (UI) cursor controller  (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit , a signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker) and a network interface device (e.g., a transmitter) .","The disk drive unit  includes a machine-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures (e.g., software)  embodying or used by any one or more of the methodologies or functions illustrated herein. The software may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory  and\/or within the processor  during execution thereof by the computer system . The main memory  and the processor  also constitute machine-readable media.","The instructions  may further be transmitted or received over a network  via the network interface device  using any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)).","The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and\/or associated caches and servers) that stores the one or more sets of instructions. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that causes the machine to perform any of the one or more of the methodologies illustrated herein. The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include solid-state memories, optical media, and magnetic media.","Marketplace Applications","One exemplary advantage of an embodiment of the present method and system is to facilitate the tailoring of search results based upon user-controllable NL statements. These NL statement may be used as training data to populate a database containing such search results. This system and method may reside as part of an enterprise search application such as SAP ENTERPRISE SEARCH\u2122, or some other suitable semantic search application. By allowing users (e.g., IT administrators) to generate training data, search results may be based upon common uses of a search query and corresponding search results, where common uses may be industry-defined. For example, where a user conducting a search uses the terms \u201cmanager Sue,\u201d the user may retrieve a search result not based upon text containing the literal text string (e.g., string based searching or \u201cpattern matching\u201d) \u201cmanager Sue,\u201d but rather may retrieve search results relating to \u201cmanager who report to Sue,\u201d \u201cmanagers who instruct Sue,\u201d or some other search results based upon training data supplied. As compared to string-based searching, this semantic searching can allow for more granular, unequivocal or refined searching to occur, such that typically ambiguous search terms can be uncovered.","In some embodiments, the search term \u201cManhattan\u201d, with manhattan being optionally in any one of a number of domains such as \u201cdrinks\u201d, \u201clocations\u201d, or \u201cships\u201d, and the relation between them (e.g., in the case of \u201cmanhattan John\u201d, with optional relations being based on the respective assignment of these terms to domains: {Manhattan cocktails [drinks] sold by John [a person]; manhattan [location] where John [a person] was born; manhattan [ship] steered by captain John [a person]}) can be readily disambiguated based upon assigning terms to domains and identifying suitable relations as they can be inferred on the basis of commonly understood relations between the respective domains or sub-domains.","Further exemplary advantages exist in that users may be able to enter just a few (e.g., 1-2) search terms without the need to use any specific notations (e.g., SQL query expressions) or a specific query language. Further, a user may be able to progressively (e.g., emulating the principle of progressive disclosure) specify their search intent. Some embodiments may include allowing users to take advantage of system support both at the level of the UI (e.g., allowing users to actively express their search intent through using the UI), or at the system level where users are presented with system-initiated rephrases of the users' initial search queries, such that users do not have to reiterate new search queries every time a search is performed.","The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to comply with 37 C.F.R. \u00a71.72(b), requiring an abstract that may allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it may not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition, in the foregoing Detailed Description, it can be seen that various features are grouped together in a single embodiment for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment.
