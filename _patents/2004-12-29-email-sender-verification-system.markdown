title: Email sender verification system
abstract: A method and system for email sender verification. A tag is included in an email that contains an identity datum for the sender that is associated with their email address in a server. The email is sent via a network, thus associating a sender address with the email. At least the identity datum, taken from the tag, is then provided to the server, to retrieve the email address. The email address and the sender address are then compared, verifying that the email came from the sender if these match.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND ART","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION","BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/532,975, filed Dec. 29, 2003.","The present invention relates generally to electronic mail (email), and more particularly to reducing unwanted email. Some anticipated initial applications of the present invention include effective management of non-spam email, support for the cataloging of web sites and pages, and interlinking systems based on an email header syntax.","There is a growing need for improving the management and administration of network services that use the Internet, especially email. One example of the current lack of adequate management and administration is the uncontrolled growth of spam (unsolicited) email, which is a nuisance for spam email recipients.","The strategies currently used to manage spam are filtering, public-key certificate based authentication, and challenge-response. Filtering strategies are not viable because it is impossible to generalize appropriate filters, and this leads to an increased risk of false-positives as higher levels of filtering are applied. Certificate based authentication strategies are presently premature due to the lack of a widely deployed infrastructure for the distribution and management of certificates. Challenge-response strategies are also limited because, instead of actually solving the problem, they merely transfer burdens to the senders of useful emails.","The reason for the explosion of spam emails is the ease with which senders can remain anonymous, without a correspondingly easy ability for recipients to distinguish between senders who intentionally hide their identity from those who do not. Once it is equally easy for recipients to distinguish anonymous and non-anonymous senders, the spam problem will work itself out.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an email sender verification system.","Briefly, one preferred embodiment of the present invention is a method for email sender verification. A tag is included in an email, wherein the tag contains an identity datum for a sender of the email that is also stored in association with an email address of the sender at a server that is physically remote from both the sender and recipient. The email is then sent via a network, wherein a sender address becomes associated with the email. At least the identity datum, taken from the tag, is then provided to the server to retrieve the email address of the sender. The email address is then compared with the sender address, thereby verifying that the email did come from the sender when these match.","An advantage of the present invention is that it assist users in voluntary verification when using the Internet, email and the web, and other online applications.","Another advantage of the invention is that it permits graduated enforcement, permitting simple verification or verification confirmed by tracing, and permitting the data used for verification to be publicly available, semi-privately available, or entirely private and known only to an entity providing services to an email sender.","And another advantage of the invention is that it may be implemented easily and scale ably, by adding as little as a single invention specific server to an existing network, such as the internet, and then employing this with either existing email agents and enhanced email servers or directly using merely enhanced email agents.","Some initial applications include: effective management of non-spam email, support for the cataloging of web sites and pages, and interlinking systems with an email header syntax.","These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become clear to those skilled in the art in view of the description of the best presently known mode of carrying out the invention and the industrial applicability of the preferred embodiment as described herein and as illustrated in the figures of the drawings.","In the various figures of the drawings, like references are used to denote like or similar elements or steps.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is an email sender verification (ESV) system. As illustrated in the various drawings herein, and particularly in the views of , preferred embodiments of the invention are depicted by the general reference character .","The proposed ESV system  is based on the recognition that the current simplicity of email needs to be preserved, while introducing an effective method for managing spam. The uncontrolled growth of spam is based on the anonymity afforded to the sender by the current email system. Simple automated sender verification or sender traceability should therefore be sufficient to drastically reduce or even eliminate the current out-of-control spam situation.","The ESV system  leverages the already deployed email infrastructure to provide plain-text (non-encrypted) sender identification and traceability, while allowing flexible and gradual integration of new network service management and administration capabilities into the network. Important features provided by this approach include permitting control by the sender (user) of their own identity information, providing a distributed architecture with localized aggregation of related data, and support for technologies to manage privacy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 1-3","b":["10","12","14","10","16","12","14","18","20","16","22"]},"In unconventional manner, however, the email agent  or email server  used by the sender  embeds sender identification or sender verification information (an ESV tag ) into the email  and the email agent  or email server  used by the recipient  uses this ESV tag  to verify that the email , in fact, came from the sender . The email agent  may be part of any email-enabled device, such as a workstation, desktop computer, notebook computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), cell phone, Internet-enabled appliance, or browser-capable device.","The ESV tag  can include a well-known item of public identity data that is already in use, such as a telephone number of the sender , or it can include an item of quasi- or completely-private identity data, such as a numeric or alphanumeric key supplied by the ESV system  or by a third party based on a digital certificate, driver license number, bank account number, passport number, etc. The specific choice of the ESV tag  can thus be based on a desired level of assurance, authenticity, privacy, or other criteria. By embedding such third-party verifiable, plain-text, or encrypted information in emails, the senders of the emails become independently verifiable. Since this provides the clear benefit, among others, of permitting email recipients to separate out spam easily, a majority of regular email senders can be expected to voluntarily embed sender identification information in their emails.","In addition to providing simple verification, the ESV system  can provide traceability, for more rigorous verification of the sender  and to provide additional security features. For this the ESV system  can be viewed as involving three major stages, ESV Registration, ESV Identification, and ESV Tracing. In the ESV Registration stage the sender  registers with a local ESV server , and establishes a profile there with identify information about themselves in an ESV database . The ESV tag stage generates and embeds the ESV tag  in any email  that the sender  wishes to be verifiable or traceable. The sender  then sends the email . The ESV Tracing stage permits the recipient  of such an email  to access an ESV server  and ESV database  to verify the sender  and trace the email .","The ESV Registration stage can use identify information that is simple to generate the ESV tag , e.g., a telephone number verifiable by the telephone service provider, or it can use identify information that is more complex, e.g., one or more values generated by a biometric identity system. The ESV databases  thus can be managed by the senders  themselves in an ongoing manner, with the identify information merely being information specific to the respective senders  and verifiable using either a manual or automated system.","The ESV Identification stage establishes a link, the ESV tag , between the email address of a sender  and their identity information. One example of an ESV tag  is a telephone number with RFC  extension encoding. TABLE 1, below, depicts a simple example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"X-esv-sysid: 10.402","; e.g., <Zone id>.<system id>"]},{"entry":[{},"X-esv-id: 1-123-444-5555","; e.g., <phone no>"]},{"entry":[{},"X-esv-type: phone"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"RFC 822 tags and their fields in this example form an ESV tag  that a sender  can include in an email . The tag X-esv-sysid serves to uniquely identify the particular ESV server  (within a private network, if applicable) that has definitive information about the sender  of the email , i.e., that has a profile for this sender  in its ESV database . The fields in this X-esv-sysid tag are <Zone id> and <system id>. The <Zone id> field specifies a country, or unique administrative domain and the <system id> field specifies a particular ESV server  within that zone. In total, these fields in the X-esv-sysid tag provide an Internet address or DNS-based (Domain Name Service) host name for the ESV server  that needs to be used. The X-esv-id tag includes the actual data that can be used to establish the identity of the sender  with the ESV server , and in this example that data is simply a single field containing a telephone number. Since the data in the X-esv-id tag can potentially have different types, however, a X-esv-type tag is further provided to define the type of sender identity being used and thus the verification process to ultimately apply.","The ESV Identification stage may simply use information previously obtained by the email agent of the sender  during the ESV Registration stage, or it may dynamically obtain the information for the ESV tag  from an ESV server  each time it is needed, allowing for enhanced authentication and validation processes.","Since email is an universal Internet application, the ESV Registration stage can also be an anchor point for aggregating other personalization functionality. For example, web searching can be personalized with user preferences and historical usage patterns, such as subjects (e.g. economics, psychology, etc.) that the user is interested and not interested in. These preferences can be incorporated as part of the preference for the user. Another application is storing personal identity information, either directly in encrypted form or as addresses of locations from which such information can be obtained. Examples include biometric identity data, credit card numbers, passwords, etc.","The ESV Tracing stage begins upon receipt of an email  by an email agent . The sender  of the email  is authenticated by establishing that the association between their email address and the ESV tag  embedded in the email  is genuine. This is preferably accomplished in the following manner:","The email agent  of the recipient  contacts the definitive ESV server  (that of the sender ), providing it with the sender address data and the ESV tag  from the email , and, optionally, with tracking path data from the header of the email .","The ESV server  then verifies the association between the sender address and the ESV tag  by querying its ESV database .","Next, the tracking path data is examined to verify that the email  was not tampered with en-route between the sender  and the recipient .","Since it is possible to spoof the sender identifying information in an email, simply checking a sender address against the ESV tag  is not sufficient. However, the tracking path data in the email header, e.g., in the <Received:> field, is a simple way to detect spoofing. The tracking path data accumulated by the email as it passes through intermediate network nodes is outside the control of an email sender who is engaged in spoofing. Thus, the email agent  of the recipient , alone or in conjunction with the definitive ESV server , can verify the authenticity of the sender email address by parsing the <Received:> header fields in the email . The level of assurance of an identify can be enhanced here by establishing that only known connections to SMTP relay hosts adjacent to the sender  of the email  were used.","Sample headers of emails  along with example ESV header field extensions are given in TABLE 2 and TABLE 3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Sample email header with a \u201cphone\u201d ESV type"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Return-Path: <george@strategygroup.net>"]},{"entry":[{},"Errors-To: <george@strategygroup.net>"]},{"entry":[{},"To: gary@strategygroup.net"]},{"entry":[{},"Subject: Meeting"]},{"entry":[{},"Message-ID: <OFB297AEF7.A5B63537-"]},{"entry":[{},"ON88256DFD.007AF2D6@strategygroup.net>"]},{"entry":[{},"From: george@strategygroup.net"]},{"entry":[{},"Date: Mon, 15 Dec 2003 14:23:32 -0800"]},{"entry":[{},"X-esv-sysid: 10.204"]},{"entry":[{},"X-esv-id: 1-650-555-1212"]},{"entry":[{},"X-esv-type: phone"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Another method for providing higher-level assurance against tampering of the emails en-route is to use a simple private-key based encryption system (see e.g., , TBL. 3). The X-esv-id tag information is encrypted using a private key by the ESV server  of the sender . Upon receipt, the email agent  of the recipient  contacts the ESV server  of the sender  to decipher the X-esv-id tag. The X-esv-id tag information here, for example, can simply be the email address of the sender , providing a simple means of validating the sender  without disclosing any private information (such as a phone number). In this variation of the ESV system  the private key is needed only on the ESV server  of the sender , and thus can be changed periodically to provide enhanced security, besides eliminating the need for a public key infrastructure (PKI) and the necessary distribution and management of public keys that such entails.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Sample email header with a \u201cprivate key\u201d ESV type"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Return-Path: <george@strategygroup.net>"]},{"entry":[{},"Errors-To: <george@strategygroup.net>"]},{"entry":[{},"To: gary@strategygroup.net"]},{"entry":[{},"Subject: Meeting"]},{"entry":[{},"Message-ID: <OFB297AEF7.A5B63537-"]},{"entry":[{},"ON88256DFD.007AF2D6@strategygroup.net>"]},{"entry":[{},"From: george@strategygroup.net"]},{"entry":[{},"Date: Mon, 15 Dec 2003 14:23:32 -0800"]},{"entry":[{},"X-esv-sysid: 10.204"]},{"entry":[{},"X-esv-id: qesitoswqda39ae6dkivft"]},{"entry":[{},"X-esv-type: private key"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Summarizing, in its simplest form the gist of the inventive ESV system  is as follows. Use an already well-known plain-text identifier for a sender , such as a telephone number, as a key for aggregating identity information including email addresses. To permit an email  to be verifiable, embed an ESV tag  associated with the email address of the sender  into the email . Independently (from the email ) access the identity information for the sender  in an ESV database  to verify the identity of the sender . This provides a simple and transparent means for recipients  to distinguish between verifiable emails  and non-verifiable (and probable spam) emails.","Optionally, when a dynamic ESV tag  is used, the senders  of emails  can be permitted to set usage policies and patterns for their email addresses and identities on the ESV server . For example, one policy can be that a password accompany a request for a each ESV tag . Before an ESV tag  is generated the ESV system  can then verify that the intended email transmission will comply with the wishes of the registered owner of the email address (in terms of volume and frequency, for example), and otherwise notify the owner and a system administrator\u2014without providing an ESV tag  for sending what may be a forged email and the email transmission is prevented.","Continuing with , these show three example architectures using the ESV system  for a sender  to prepare and send an email  and for a recipient  receive that email . The email  travels, conventionally, from the email agent  of the sender  via the Internet  to the email server  of the recipient . Unlike prior art schemes, however, the email agent  (in this embodiment) of the sender  and the email agent  (in this embodiment) of the recipient  communicate with ESV servers  to permit verifying the sender  of the email .","The ESV servers  and ESV databases  that are used by the sender  and the recipient  may be the same, but this need not and often will not be the case.  therefore show embodiments of the ESV system  that are suitable when these are different.","The embodiments in  are distinct in how the ESV servers  communicate with one another. In  the ESV servers  communicate via a signaling system seven network (SS network ); in  the ESV servers  communicate via a private network  (other than a SS network); and in  the ESV servers  communicate via the Internet  (i.e., via a public rather than a private network). The SS network  provides an efficient telephony-based means of verifying the email address in association with a telephone number of a sender , provides a simple way to make email and web addresses part of telephone directory services.","One benefit of using the private network  is not having to load the SS network  for ESV applications. Another benefit is permitting the deployment of networks that are more suited for verification services.","Having the ESV servers  communicate via the Internet  is conceptually the simplest, but can be subject to many of the same security and timeliness concerns that are common to the Internet today.","The ESV servers  are connected to their respective ESV databases , which both contain definitive sender identify information. An ESV database  contains the subscriber identity information that is maintained and managed by sender  (the subscriber). A sender  always has the option of excluding the ESV tag  from an email. In which case, the recipient  has the option of not accepting the email\u2014similar to anonymous call filtering that works with the caller-id feature for telephone calls today.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In contrast,  show the flows of information in example embodiments of the ESV system .  (and TBL. 2) show examples where a telephone number is associated with the email  in plain text.  (and TBL. 3) depict an example using an encrypted identifier, using private key maintained only on the ESV server  of the sender .  depicts an example where the ESV servers  permit non-ESV enabled email agents  to be used. The emails  in all of the examples are still, however, transported in conventional manner.","In  the ESV tag  is obtained dynamically. In a step  the sender  uses their email agent  to create the email . The email agent  then, typically automatically, in step  sends a request to the ESV server  for an ESV tag  (or for data to use in one). In step  the ESV server  then provides this, based on what is in its ESV database . In step  the ESV tag  is added to the email  and in step  it is sent to the recipient  in essentially conventional manner. In step  the email agent  of the recipient  receives the email , and in step  it sends a request including all or part of the ESV tag  to the ESV server  that was specified in the email . The ESV server  then compares the information in this request with the data in its ESV database , and in step  sends a suitable response (e.g., \u201cvalid\u201d or \u201cinvalid\u201d) back to the email agent  of the recipient . Finally, in step , the recipient  can read (or not read) the email , based on the response from the ESV server .","In  the ESV tag  is not obtained dynamically, but otherwise differs little from the approach just described. In an ESV Registration stage, as discussed previously, the sender  registers. In a step  they draft a request including suitable identity information about themselves, and in step  they send that request to their chosen ESV server . The ESV server  then stores the information it receives about the sender  in its ESV database , and in step  sends a response including an ESV tag  (or for data to use in one) back to the email agent  of the sender , which is stored for later use.","At some indeterminate time later, in step , the sender  creates an email  and in step  their email agent  embeds the ESV tag  into that email , based on the data previously received and stored from the ESV server . In step  the email  is sent to the recipient , in essentially conventional manner. In step  the email agent  of the recipient  receives the email , and in step  it sends a request including all or part of the ESV tag  to the ESV server  that was specified in the email . The ESV server  then compares the information in this request with the data in its ESV database , and in step  sends a suitable response (e.g., \u201cvalid\u201d or \u201cinvalid\u201d) back to the email agent  of the recipient . Finally, in step , the recipient  can read (or not read) the email , based on the response from the ESV server .","In  the ESV tag  is again obtained dynamically, but uses a private key (see e.g., TBL. 3) from the ESV server . In a step  the sender  uses their email agent  to create the email . Their email agent  then, typically automatically, in step  sends a request to the ESV server  for an ESV tag  (or for data to use in one), and in step  the ESV server  provides this back to the email agent  of the sender  in encrypted form, having based what it sends on what it has in its ESV database  for the sender . In step  the email agent  of the sender  adds the ESV tag  to the email  and in step  it is sent to the recipient  in essentially conventional manner. In step  the email agent  of the recipient  receives the email , and in step  it sends a request including all (or at least the part encrypted part) of the ESV tag  to the ESV server  that was specified in the email . The ESV server  then deciphers what it has received in this request and compares it with the data in its ESV database . In step  the ESV server  sends a suitable response back to the email agent  of the recipient  (e.g., \u201cvalid\u201d or \u201cinvalid\u201d). Finally, in step , the recipient  can read (or not read) the email , based on the response from the ESV server .","In  the ESV tag  is obtained dynamically, based on public data or a private key, here using email agents  that can be entirely conventional and using the email servers  of the sender  and the recipient  to handle the ESV tag . In a step  the sender  uses their email agent  to create the email  and in step  they use their email agent  to send the email  to their email server . In step  their email server  requests the ESV tag  from their ESV server , and in step  the ESV server  provides the ESV tag  to the email server  of the sender . In step  the email server  of the sender  now adds the ESV tag  to the email  and sends it to the email server  of the recipient . In step  the email server  of the recipient  receives the email , and in step  the email server  of the recipient  requests validation of the ESV tag  in the incoming email  from the ESV server . In step  the ESV server  sends a suitable response back to the email server  of the recipient  (e.g., \u201cvalid\u201d or \u201cinvalid\u201d). Based on this, in step  the email server  of the recipient  flags the email  (e.g., prefixing the subject with text \u201c[Spam]\u201d or \u201c[Verified]\u201d) and sends it to the email agent  of the recipient . Finally, in step  the recipient  can read (or not read) the email  as they wish.","By centralizing verification in this manner at the email servers  of either or both of the sender  and the recipient , it is possible to eliminate the need to upgrade the email agents  on the user's systems. It is also possible using this architecture to eliminate the need for the users to maintain independent verification profiles, letting such be set by administrators of the email servers  instead. In addition to permitting easy adoption of the ESV system , this permits the operators of the email servers  (i.e., Internet service providers or in-house domain administrators) to handle essentially all adoption overhead of the ESV system  as a \u201cvalue added\u201d service.","It is important here to note that from the user's perspective email under the ESV system  works as before, with all of the additional steps being transparent. This makes adoption of the ESV system  easier and permits incremental deployment. If the ESV system  is not fully deployed end-to-end between a sender  and a recipient , everything simply works as always, albeit without an enhanced sender verification capability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"In contrast, with the new ESV system , the email agent  of the recipient  accesses the ESV server  upon receipt of an email  to verify the identity of the sender .

Construed originally as a flexible translation mechanism for network addresses to and from human readable form, the DNS system has become burdened with business branding, trademarks, marketing memes, etc. This overuse has made the DNS system a vulnerable weak spot in the Internet.","Fields in an ESV header, such as in the esv-sysid tag, can be extended to provide a scheme for unburdening the DNS system. The field <Zone id>.<Sys id> can provide a way to intermediate to the DNS system. By removing the direct addressing link between the IP address of the ESV server  and the DNS system, the DNS system is not directly burdened by the needs of the ESV system . Any system or user that needs to find the IP address of an ESV server  can instead go through an ESV address resolver, at least once. Some main benefits of this approach are that the identity of ESV servers  are not made directly available, and the ESV sysid can be resolved to different IP addresses\u2014making it harder to initiate IP based attacks.","The sub-field <Zone id> provides a method for aggregating related systems. For example, verification servers in a country, in a state, or that provide a type of verification service (e.g., third-party verification), etc. Both the <Zone id> and <Sys id> sub-fields can be numeric or alphanumeric.","The benefits of using the <Zone id> sub-field can also be extended to automated web cataloging. Currently there are many web directories but classification processes are primarily manual, since there is inadequate capability for automated cataloging of the web. Extending the use of <Zone id> to categories and attributes can therefore provide a means for automating web cataloging. This automated cataloging, particularly if supplemented by human-assisted verification, can greatly enhance the ability to locate information on the web, better than non-differentiated search systems currently in deployment. This can provide an automated way to organize the web, similar to the classification in Yellow Page directories or library cataloging. Using the ESV system , it is possible to establish third-party services which can provide human-assisted classification services, which are encoded in the web-pages. Information service providers will then be able to use the classification encoded in the web-pages to build automated directories after validating through the third-party classification providers, and offer as value added information services. For example, libraries can offer ESV classification services for web-pages, since they already have the expertise in organizing knowledge and information.","To accomplish this, ESV header fields, as described herein, can be embedded as part of HTML web pages.
