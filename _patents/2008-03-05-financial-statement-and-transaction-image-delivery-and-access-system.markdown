{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to systems for delivering financial information, and more particularly, to systems for delivering and accessing financial statements and processed financial transaction documents.","In recent years, the use of online banking by commercial and retail customers has increased significantly. Online banking has been found to be much more desirable and efficient than traditional banking. Increasing emphasis is being directed to the use of electronic bank statements, checks, deposit slips and other documents, rather than the paper documents themselves. The use of these images can significantly reduce the expense, need and demand for the use of hard copy documents by customers.","There is, however, an element that is missing in the process. Customers who still use paper transactions along with their online banking are not able to effectively integrate those paper documents with their automated systems. Bank customers do not have the ability to keep imaged copies of bank statements, checks, deposit slips and other documents, on their own computers.","There are three common methods of making banking documents available to customers. First, the customer can receive the physical documents, checks, deposit slips, and other documents. The documents are then filed and are available for manual retrieval for viewing and copying. Customers may also scan the individual documents for placement in computer folders.","This method has many disadvantages. The bank must retain and mail the documents to the customer. This is a costly and inefficient process. The customer must physically store those documents, requiring the labor to do so and the space to accomplish this. Retrieval must be done manually, which is a tedious and costly process. Individual copies or scans must manually be made of the required documents. The documents must be returned to the file and properly archived. This is a very costly process due to associated labor, storage and operational inefficiencies.","An alternative to this system is sending copies of the documents, minimized in sheets, rather than sending the actual documents to the customer. From the customer standpoint, this system has the same drawbacks of maintaining the original documents. In addition, however, making copies for use by the customer is more difficult because of the decreased size and legibility of the copies of the document originals.","A second method involves banks providing CDs of the imaged documents for their customers. Single CDs are created for each customer and mailed. Customers must load the CD and viewer software onto their computers and register each CD before searching. Then customers must search each CD in order to view and use the images. Generally, each CD contains a maximum of one month of data. Therefore, databases must be searched individually and cross database searching is not possible.","The CD system is very cumbersome for the bank. Single CDs must be made for each customer. The CDs must be physically delivered to the customer by mail or courier. The system is generally only viable for large commercial customers making this type of image delivery unavailable for the majority of customers.","From the customer's standpoint, the information is not immediately available due to processing and mail time. Large customers may need the information as close to real time as possible in order to properly manage cash and lockbox situations. The CD system does not allow for this timely delivery.","Also, the use of CDs is inefficient. Even when the information from numerous CDs is loaded on the customer's computer, there is no ability to search across all information. The database on each CD represents only one month of bank images and must be searched individually.","The third method is to provide customers with online access to the images of their documents. In order to access the account information online, customers must log on to the bank Web site and enter the secure section. Then they can search, view and print out the documents individually. This system also has significant drawbacks.","If the server is unavailable, or customers do not have online access at the time the information is needed, online banking can be very frustrating. Since images must be accessed individually, there is no easy way to compile the imaged documents for a particular purpose. For example, it is difficult, if not impossible for a customer to create folders of vendor or supplier specific images. Customers, likewise, cannot feasibly create a folder of images for a given day or month. Even if the time were taken to manually organize all the desired images, the data could not be searched.","On the bank's side, customer information must be retained in the bank's online server for a significant period of time. Retrieval of specific information for a customer query after the information is removed from the online server is a costly process for the bank and the customer. The research process to find needed transactions not located on the banks server is very inefficient. The search process is time consuming, tedious and almost cost prohibitive for the bank and its customers.","A modification of this method is to allow customers online access to or download ability of PDF files of their documents. This has many drawbacks for the customer. The information is not indexed so even basic searches are difficult and cumbersome. Additionally, making copies of individual documents is generally impossible for most customers.","With the methods used currently, there is no effective way to allow customers to become paperless with regards to bank data. Previously, this technology has been unavailable.","The present invention gives financial institutions, such as banks, the ability to provide paperless banking to their customers. Although the technological implementation of the invention is complex, the process of using the invention is made very simple for the customer. A customer-level software application is made available to customers on the bank's Web site for download. Customers can then install the software on their own computers.","When images are produced or received by the bank, those images are extracted from the image server, indexed by an indexer, and made available for download. An email is generated and sent to customers informing them that their bank statements, check, deposit slip and other images are available electronically from the bank.","Customers then log on to the bank's secure Web site and download a file containing their banking images. The provided software application then opens with the downloaded file expanded for immediate use and available for viewing and searching.","Using the provided software application, customers can efficiently review their documents. The imaged documents are high quality digital images making them acceptable as proof of payment and are identical to the hard copy original documents. The downloaded financial transaction document images are automatically organized in folders according to the time period provided. Customers can search one or all folders of the imaged documents on their computers and retrieve all desired images. With the provided software application, customers can print, email and manage a single document or an entire folder of documents.","Another version of the present invention for large commercial customers is also very simple. Software can be downloaded directly onto computers or servers at the customers' locations, or downloads can be managed by a network administrator.","Images can be indexed as they are produced, and the download can be accomplished automatically on the Internet or by sending a secure FTP download. It is also possible to send the images to the customer and have the indexing completed at the customer's location.","With the provided software application, customers can review their documents very quickly. Each imaged document appears exactly as the hard copies of those documents. Customers can also create custom folders to organize their documents. They can search that folder along with all folders of document images on their computers and retrieve desired images. They can print, email and manage a single document or an entire folder of documents.","For very large commercial customers, the benefits are extremely important from a cash management standpoint. Information can be provided to customers daily, if required, within a short time after the images are generated or received. The folder can be immediately sent to the customer electronically. The images are then available for the customer to identify relevant information about transactions based on the data contained in the image. The images can also be used to reconcile accounts receivable, accounts payable, lock boxes and other financial management elements.","Images can also be used for customer support purposes. The images can be quickly searched to locate information for customer or supplier inquiries. The images can then easily be emailed or copied and mailed or faxed to the inquiring party.","For customers, the benefits of going paperless are clear. They have a single location of imaged banking data and a simple interface for accessing the data. The present invention provide customers with immediate access to their information, better organization and control, and a cleaner and more accurate audit process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","110","130","140","140","150","160","150","170"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","210","250","150","250","230","160","150","150","260","270","150","270"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","270","270","410","270","420"]},"When a financial transaction statement is displayed in the second window area , any checks listed in the second window area  are hypertext linked so that they can be selected. Upon selection of one of the check numbers , the corresponding cancelled check image is displayed in the second window area .","Below the first window area , a search manager  is provided that allows a customer to select or input a range of transaction dates with which to confine a financial transaction image search. The search manager  also provides a drop-down list  that allows the customer to search for either \u201call\u201d the financial transaction images within the selected transaction date range, only those financial transaction images that match an input \u201camount,\u201d only those financial transaction images that match an input \u201camount range,\u201d only those financial transaction images that match an input \u201ccheck number,\u201d or only those financial transaction images that match an input \u201ccheck number range.\u201d Other embodiments of the search manager  may provide other searchable fields, such as check date (as opposed to the cleared transaction date) or recipient name.","After the customer enters the search criteria and selects the \u201cSearch\u201d button , the financial transaction images matching the search criteria are displayed in a third window area  directly below the second window area . The search results are listed under various fields, such as date , account number , check number , and amount .

For example, a group of approximately 5% of a bank's customers' financial statements might be consistently generated and mailed out on the 1day of the month, a group of another 5% of a bank's customers' financial statements might be generated and mailed out on the 2day of the month, and so on. (Frequently, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are omitted). The financial statement and document delivery and access system  is designed to interface with such an existing system.","At regular intervals, the system-level data processor  runs a data synchronization process  to download batches of statements and images from the financial institution's image server. The data synchronization process is illustrated in  and explained further below. Step  illustrates the system-level data processor  waiting for a batch to be downloaded. If a data processing error is encountered while waiting for batch synchronization, in step , the system-level data processor  runs a process to handle the data processing problem. Once a batch is successfully downloaded, then the system-level data processor  runs a process  to validate the input path to the downloaded batch. If the input path is valid, then in step  the system-level data processor updates the data processing log  and in step  updates the batch log . If the input path is invalid, then in step , the system-level data processor  runs a process to handle the source data problem.","After completing step , the system-level data processor  runs the following sequence of processes: a process  to preprocess the batch (described further in connection with ); a process  to index the statements, check and other financial transaction images (described further in connection with ); a process  to package each group of statements, check and other financial transaction images associated with a given customer or customer account (described further in connection with ); a process  to archive the packages into a single downloadable file (described further in connection with ), and a process  to deliver the archives to the customer (described further in connection with ). As each of these processes - is completed, the system-level data processor  reports each success or error on the data processing log .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["510","610","570","675","665","670","615","665","675"]},"In step , the system-level data processor  synchronizes its own statement processing archive  with the statement processing archive  maintained by or on behalf of the financial institution. As part of this synchronization process, a multi-statement batch file  is copied from the institution's statement processing archive  to the system statement processing archive . The batch file  is typically in the form of an ASCII text and ASCII-formatted file comprising hundreds or thousands of statements processed by the financial institution on a given day. Banks conventionally simply print this batch file  out onto bank letterhead and mail the statements to their customers. As explained further in connection with , the present invention uses this same batch file  to generate hypertext-formatted statements in which the font, font size, and spatial layout of the text is identical or nearly identical to the font, font size, and spatial layout of the text on the paper statements conventionally mailed to customers","After a new statement batch file  is copied, in step , the system-level data processor  records the event in the data processing log . Then, in step , the system-level data processor  sets a query processor flag to \u201crun\u201d in a query service configuration file .","In one embodiment, a query is constructed that provides the image server database  with a statement date and asks the Image Server database  to return a text file  that lists every account number for which a statement has been created on that date, the transactions that took place during the statement period, the name and location of the multi-page image file(s)  containing check and other financial document images corresponding to those transactions, and the starting and ending bytes of the corresponding check and other financial transaction images in the composite multi-page image file(s) . In other embodiments, information from the composite statement batch file may be parsed to further populate the query service configuration file  with more specific information\u2014for example, a particular account number or range of account numbers\u2014with which to query the image server database .","In step , information from the query service configuration file  is used to query an image server database  hosted by the image server . The query returns an image list  identifying the account numbers, and for each account number the transactions that took place during the statement period, including the transaction posting date, the serial number. The image list also includes the name and location of the corresponding multi-page image file(s)  containing the corresponding check and other financial document images corresponding to the listed transactions, and the starting and ending bytes of the corresponding images in the composite multi-page image file(s) . The system-level data processor stores the image list  in the statement processing archive . The image list  is later used to derive check image files for each cancelled check from the composite multi-page image file(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["520","575","710","625","720","625","730","615","740","615","750","760","520","575"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"],"b":["720","810","570","625","820","625","825","830","825","840","845","850","855","855","830","575"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 7"],"b":["740","740","910","570","655","920","615","925","575","930","615","935","940","935","945","950","955","945","955","945","965","920","950","970","975","530","740","980","935","575"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 5"],"b":["530","1050","570","1010","955","570","1055","570","1050","1015","975","1055","1020","1025","1025"]},"Meanwhile, in step , the indexer  looks for the indexer flag , and when one is detected, in step  it retrieves the indexer run script .
