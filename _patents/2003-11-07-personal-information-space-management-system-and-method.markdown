Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to controlling and managing personal information, and in particular, to managing personal information in an individual user's personal information space.","2. Description of the Related Art","People increasingly manage their personal information through electronic means, such as personal digital assistants, on-line contact and calendar applications and even wireless phones. Hence, a migration of contact, document, financial, and other personal information has been made away from paper calendars, address books and records toward electronic systems. Both the type and the quantity of personal information in electronic form are growing.","Personal Information Managers (PIMs) generally comprise software applications running on a processing device such as a computer and personal digital assistants (PDAs). PDA's are small, electronic devices of varying types, which store reminder, contact, task, notes, and text information as well as other types of files. In the desire to increase the manageability of personal information, PIMS and PDA's have merged with cellular telephones, PIMs have migrated into online contact managers and pocket personal computers have become more and more powerful.","Generally, software PIMs include products such as Microsoft Outlook, Interactive Commerce Corporation's ACT!, and other similar programs are designed to run on a computer. PDA devices include devices such as those using the Palm\u00ae or Microsoft Windows Pocket PC operating systems, as well as other, more basic contact and calendar devices. Each PDA generally includes calendar, contact, personal tasks, notes, documents, and other information, while more sophisticated devices allow a user to fax, send e-mails, and communicate from within the application over a physical or wireless network. Even advanced cellular phones carry enough memory and processing power to store contact information, surf the web, and provide text messaging. Along with the growth in the sophistication of these devices, the need to transfer information between them has grown significantly as well.","Online personal information managers make access to data from any networked terminal possible. Many Internet web portals also now provide file storage, contact and calendar services. For example, major service portals such as Yahoo!, Excite, Lycos, MSN and others provide on-line calendar and contact manager services via a web browser to registered users. This allows a user to log in to their own calendar and address book from any Internet-capable web browsing application since the user's individual data is stored on a host server maintained by the web portal provider. Each of these services includes a data store as well.","All such personal information operated on and stored by a user can be considered within that user's \u201cpersonal information space.\u201d In this context, a \u201cpersonal information space\u201d is a data store of information customized by, and on behalf of the user which contains both public data the user puts into their personal space, private events in the space, and other data objects such as text files or data files which belong to the user and are manipulated by the user. The personal information space is defined by the content which is specific to and controlled by an individual user, generally entered by or under the control of the individual user, and which includes \u201cpublic\u201d events and data, those generally known to others, and \u201cprivate\u201d events and data which are not intended to be shared with others. It should be recognized that each of the aforementioned criteria is not exclusive or required, but defines characteristics of the term \u201cpersonal information space\u201d as that term is used herein. In this context, such information includes electronic files such as databases, text files, word processing files, and other application specific files, as well as contact information in personal information managers, PDAs and cellular phones.","Once a personal information space is defined, the challenge becomes managing information in the space particularly between different devices. For example, if an individual keeps a calendar of information on a personal computer in his or her office using a particular personal information manager application, the individual would generally like to have the same information available in a cellular phone, hand-held organizer, and perhaps a home personal computer. The individual may additionally need some characterization of the information, such as what information is more relevant or important to have in a particular location, and which people the user interacts with regularly, and how the user interacts with them.","Mechanisms exist for moving data between a number of devices and keeping a user's personal information on those devices current between all the devices.","Co-pending application Ser. Nos. 09\/490,550, 09\/491,675 and 09\/491,694 disclose a novel method and system for synchronization of personal information including that which is conventionally found in desktop applications, personal digital assistants, palm computers, and website calendar services, as well as any content in the personal information space including file systems, contact information and\/or calendaring information. Such systems can keep information on different systems in sync, but no qualitative method for evaluating the importance of the information to a user is provided.","Hence, a system whereby a user can automate the process of determining the importance of personal information on one or more of the user's devices based on characteristics of the user's interactions with such information would be useful.","The invention, in one aspect, comprises a system for organizing information in a personal information space. The personal information space includes at least one data source holding at least a portion of the personal information space. The system includes an agent for the data source which provides interaction information regarding data in the data source; and a interaction evaluation engine including one or more weighting characteristics for each interaction, and providing an output reflecting a weighting of one or more characteristics of the interaction.","In a further aspect, the invention is a method for managing a user's personal contact information from a variety of contact data sources, each data source comprising a device or application storing contact information used by the user. In this embodiment, the method may comprise the steps of determining when an interaction between a contact on one of the contact data sources occurs; analyzing one or more characteristics of the interaction event to determine a at least one trait about the interaction; and generating a result based on said step of analyzing.","In yet another aspect, the invention comprises one or more processor readable storage devices having processor readable code embodied on said processor readable storage devices, said processor readable code for programming one or more processors to perform a method. In such aspect, the method may comprise the steps of: determining when an interaction between a contact on one of the contact data sources occurs; analyzing one or more characteristics of the interaction event to determine a at least one trait about the interaction; and generating a result based on said step of analyzing.","In a still further aspect, the invention comprises a contact management method. In this aspect, the method may comprise the steps of determining interactions between a user and the user's contacts via at least one communication means; analyzing one or more characteristics of the interaction to determine at least one trait about the interaction; rating contacts based on the trait; and updating the user's contact information based on said ranking.","In another aspect, the invention is a system for managing a user's personal information. The system may include means for monitoring data interaction by a device or application on a per-user basis; means for evaluating the interaction based on one or more characteristics of the interaction; and means for weighing elements of the data based on said step of evaluating.","The present invention can be accomplished using hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software. The software used for the present invention is stored on one or more processor readable storage media including hard disk drives, CD-ROMs, DVDs, optical disks, floppy disks, tape drives, RAM, ROM or other suitable storage devices. In alternative embodiments, some or all of the software can be replaced by dedicated hardware including custom integrated circuits, gate arrays, FPGAs, PLDs, and special purpose computers. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will appear more clearly from the following description in which the preferred embodiment of the invention has been set forth in conjunction with the drawings.","The system and method of the present invention provide a means for a user to automatically sort and prioritize information belonging in the user's personal information space. In general, the term \u201csmart-filtering\u201d is used to describe the system and method which aid the user in managing personal information. However, such term should not be construed as limiting the invention to a \u201cfilter.\u201d The invention includes mechanisms to characterize information without limiting, rejecting or altering data under consideration. In a basic embodiment, the system analyzes a user's interaction with the user's contact records, and updates devices containing those records to hold only those records used the most, or chosen by the user to be held. In more complex embodiments, the system can analyze a user's interaction with any type of data in the personal information space, and make judgments about the data based on the user's interaction with the data. The system then allows the user to manipulate the data based on this analysis in any number of ways.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","120","110","100","120","100","120","50","60","70","80","90","55","65","75","85","95","55","65","75","85","95","50","60","70","80","90"]},"Each of the applications contains a data store which includes information relative to the particular application. For example, MS Outlook will have associated with it a data store, such as a Microsoft Exchange database or a personal settings file associated with a particular user which stores information in that user's personal information space, such as e-mail, contact, journal, task, and other information. Mobile phone  will have, for example, a built-in memory for storing a number of telephone numbers and other contact information.","In accordance with the present invention, the smart filtering engine extracts information from each of the data stores associated with the applications , , , , and , and assesses the data to determine its importance to the user based on one or more characteristics of the data, and returns an output to the user. One simple example is to rank contact information based on the frequency of use of the information by the user. The engine may comprise code operable on a processing device for implementing this method. In accordance with the method, engine  may communicate with database  to store certain elements of the information from the applications in order to utilize this information in the analysis of the importance of the data to process it in accordance with the present invention.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the database  need not be a physically separate database, but represents a logical database. For example, in one embodiment, the engine may associate data characteristics with individual data records in each application's own data store, by using custom fields or additional records in the application's data store. All equivalent methods of associating data needed to perform the methods of the present invention with user personal information are contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","b "]},"In the embodiment of , the invention is described in the context of analyzing data for updating a telephone address book. As shown in , a first step  involves setting a limit on the number of contacts that user wishes to have input into the device. The step  may comprise a limit which is set by the user, or may comprise a physical limit of memory spaces in the telephone. While more recent models of cellular telephones include hundreds of spaces for contact information, a user may not want to populate all of this information space, the user may have contacts which exceed the number of spaces allowed in the phone, or the number of contacts in the phone may be limited by the user not wishing to include more than a certain number of contacts in the phone. The dashed arrow between step  and step  indicates that the limitation step  is an optional step in accordance with the present invention.","At step , the user interacts with a contact by making a call using an entry from the phone book. Most cellular phones track recent call information and identify if such information is for a user in the phone's address book. At step , the use of the contact is noted, and at step , all contacts under analysis are ranked according to their frequency of use. A simplistic organization might be ranking the contacts in the order of the frequency that they are contacted by the user. In a cellular phone embodiment, this may involve simply analyzing the number of times a user telephones a particular contact in his address book and using the frequency analysis to rank the contact relative to other contacts. In this manner, if the user has, for example 700 contacts, the system will analyze and rank the contacts, and the user may then use that information as needed. For example, the user could instruct the system to update the user's phone with the most frequently called 100 contacts. The frequency of use and ranking may be stored in the smart filtering database at step  whether or not the user chooses to update the user's phone. If the user chooses to update the phone at step , the contact list in the device is updated at step . The storage step  may be performed whether or not the device is updated.","The method then waits for the next use of the phone (or \u201cdata interaction\u201d) at step .","Each use of the phone with the contact information therein comprises an interaction with the data. It should be understood that uses of the phone can include not only making a call using the number from the phone's internal phone book, but also adding, deleting and modifying entries in the phone book, receiving a call, or using the contact information to send an email or text message from the phone. Hence, in the context of this invention, an interaction with data in a user's personal information space is any use of the personal information space data by the user to any degree.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["b ","b"],"b":["215","215","225","215"]},"At step , a user interacts with the data in some form. Examples of such interaction might include using a contact for telephone or email or messenger communications, using a messenger application to contact a \u201cbuddy\u201d (thereby interacting with the buddy data entry), modifying a data file, such as a word processing file or spreadsheet file, accessing a database file, or any number of tasks and interactions that a user makes with data in the user's personal information space.","At step , data from an application is analyzed based on one or more rating factors. One such factor may be frequency, as described with respect to . The nature and number of such factors may depend on the type of information analyzed. For example, if the data is contact information, the type of analysis which may occur can be the frequency of the use, the amount of use (in terms of the length of time one communicates with the contact), a weighting of the use (based on any number of a combination of factors), the length of time between interactions with the contact, the duration of the contact, the type of interaction with the contact, or other types of interactions. After analyzing the character of the use at step , the data is organized based on one or more of the characteristics available to the filtering engine  at step . One example of such organization is ranking the contacts. Other examples of organizing the contacts may include filtering based on the type of contact, the source of the contact (such as, for example, all users at one domain or physical address), or other user-defined filtering criteria.","The implementation with respect to a cell phone and contacts is described with respect to . Other examples include: updating a frequently used file list to enable files to be synchronized to one or more devices; updating a buddy list in an instant messenger application; updating database records frequently used, and the like.","At step , an update step for the user's personal information store may be implemented. This update step may include updating any number of device databases, or a separate database, such as the smart filtering database (described below), with the characteristic analysis of the user's personal information analyzed in step . For example, if a user wishes to populate the user's telephone with  of the most frequently used contact, the user can allow his phone to be updated at step . Other examples include updating a frequently used file list, or updating other lists maintained by applications which track the use of information in the personal information space by the user.","If the device is not to be updated, at step , the information may be stored in smart filtering database  for future use in analysis step . If the device is to be updated, at step  or prior thereto, the user may elect or have elected to mark certain records or data to manually determine what happens during the update step . For example, the user may wish to designate certain records as never to be included in the phone, or always to be included in the phone. If the update step is for a phone, at step , the present invention must check the contact record associated with the data from the application to ensure that the user has not manually selected one of a number of options with respect to the data. If the user has indicated that one or more records should \u201cnever\u201d or \u201calways\u201d be contained in the data store, then at step , the records are updated according to the user preference first and the characterization by the system second. If any record can be updated, then at step , the contact list in the device is updated with all records available. At step , the system then waits for the next analysis point, which may be each individual interaction with the user data from an application, or an analysis based on a timed interaction whereby the system waits a specific amount of time to reexamine the user's contact or application data usage before reanalyzing the data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["302","304","306","308","310","312","314","304","306","308","314","306","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","410","400","410","100","120","450","450","420","422","424","426","420","422","422","424","426","426","426"],"i":"a"},"Each of the respective applications , , ,  has associated therewith a data store agent.

Upon entry and use of an instant messing contact, the object interaction call may call a method which attempts to match the instant messaging information to the contact information. Once matched, this association between the contact and the instant message can allow more sophisticated forms of rating, such as determining preferred methods for contacting a member of a user's contact datastore, or determining most frequently contacted individuals across multiple platforms of communication. This information may further be used to populate similar data fields across different applications.
