title: Printhead capping arrangement
abstract: Microelectromechanical pagewidth printheads include a very large number of ink ejection nozzles fabricated upon a silicon wafer. Ink stored in the printhead subsequent to a printing operation is vulnerable to becoming undesirably viscous thereby causing inconsistent printing. In order to address this problem the present invention provides a printhead recapping mechanism. The mechanism includes a base portion, that includes a solenoid coil and a movable capping portion which incorporates magnetically attractive material responsive to the coil. A spring biases the capping portion to a quiescent capping position when the printhead is not in use. During printing operations a current is applied to the solenoid coil to overcome the biasing spring and draw the capping portion from the capping position.

No. 10\/729,157 filed on Dec. 8, 2003 which is a continuation of Ser. No. 09\/112,774 filed on Jul. 10, 1998, now abandoned, all of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates substantially to the concept of a disposable camera having instant printing capabilities and in particular, discloses a printhead assembly for a digital camera system.","Recently, the concept of a \u201csingle use\u201d disposable camera has become an increasingly popular consumer item. Disposable camera systems presently on the market normally include an internal film roll and a simplified gearing mechanism for traversing the film roll across an imaging system including a shutter and lensing system. The user, after utilizing a single film roll returns the camera system to a film development center for processing. The film roll is taken out of the camera system and processed and the prints returned to the user. The camera system can then be re-manufactured through the insertion of a new film roll into the camera system, the replacement of any worn or wearable parts and the re-packaging of the camera system in accordance with requirements. In this way, the concept of a single use \u201cdisposable\u201d camera is provided to the consumer.","Recently, a camera system has been proposed by the present applicant which provides for a handheld camera device having an internal print head, image sensor and processing means such that images sense by the image sensing means, are processed by the processing means and adapted to be instantly printed out by the printing means on demand. The proposed camera system further discloses a system of internal \u201cprint rolls\u201d carrying print media such as film on to which images are to be printed in addition to ink to supplying the printing means for the printing process. The print roll is further disclosed to be detachable and replaceable within the camera system.","Unfortunately, such a system is likely to only be constructed at a substantial cost and it would be desirable to provide for a more inexpensive form of instant camera system which maintains a substantial number of the quality aspects of the aforementioned arrangement.","It would be further advantageous to provide for the effective interconnection of the sub components of a camera system.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a printhead assembly for a camera system having a chassis and a platen assembly that is mountable on the chassis, the platen assembly being configured to support passage of a print medium along a printing path, the printhead assembly comprising","an ink reservoir assembly that is mountable on the chassis and defines at least three ink reservoirs in which differently colored inks are received, the ink reservoir assembly defining an outlet;","a guide assembly that is positioned in the ink reservoir assembly to define at least three discrete ink paths that open at the outlet; and","at least one printhead integrated circuit that is positioned in the outlet to span the printing path, the, or each, printhead integrated circuit defining at least three sets of inlet apertures, each set of inlet apertures being aligned with a respective ink path.","The ink reservoir assembly may define three ink reservoirs and the guide assembly may define three discrete ink paths.","Both the ink reservoir assembly and the guide assembly may be elongate to span the printing path. The ink reservoir assembly may include an elongate base member and an elongate cover member, the cover member having a roof wall, a pair of opposed side walls and a pair of spaced inner walls, the side walls and the inner walls depending from the roof wall and being generally parallel to each other and the base member having a floor and a pair of opposed end walls and defining an elongate opening in which the printhead integrated circuits are mounted, the guide assembly being interposed between lower ends of the inner walls and the floor.","The guide assembly may include a pair of guide walls that extend from respective lower ends of the inner walls inwardly towards the elongate opening to define the three distinct ink paths that terminate at respective sets of inlet apertures of the printhead integrated circuits.","The base member, the cover member and the guide assembly may be molded of a plastics material.","One of the end walls may define a number of air inlet openings that are treated to be hydrophobic to permit the ingress of air into the ink reservoirs as ink is fed from the ink reservoirs and to inhibit the egress of ink.","A sponge-like member may be positioned in each ink reservoir to store the ink while inhibiting agitation of ink during general use of the camera system.","The invention extends to a camera system that includes a printhead assembly as described above.","In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided in a camera system comprising: an image sensor device for sensing an image; a processing means for processing the sensed image; a print media supply means for the supply of print media to a print head; a print head for printing the sensed image on the print media stored internally to the camera system; a portable power supply interconnected to the print head, the sensor and the processing means; and a guillotine mechanism located between the print media supply means and the print head and adapted to cut the print media into sheets of a predetermined size.","Further, preferably, the guillotine mechanism is detachable from the camera system. The guillotine mechanism can be attached to the print media supply means and is detachable from the camera system with the print media supply means. The guillotine mechanism can be mounted on a platen unit below the print head.","Turning initially simultaneously to  and  there are illustrated perspective views of an assembled camera constructed in accordance with the preferred embodiment with  showing a front perspective view and  showing a rear perspective view. The camera  includes a paper or plastic film jacket  which can include simplified instructions  for the operation of the camera system . The camera system  includes a first \u201ctake\u201d button  which is depressed to capture an image. The captured image is output via output slot . A further copy of the image can be obtained through depressing a second \u201cprinter copy\u201d button  whilst an LED light  is illuminated. The camera system also provides the usual view finder  in addition to a CCD image capture\/lensing system .","The camera system  provides for a standard number of output prints after which the camera system  ceases to function. A prints left indicator slot  is provided to indicate the number of remaining prints. A refund scheme at the point of purchase is assumed to be operational for the return of used camera systems for recycling.","Turning now to , the assembly of the camera system is based around an internal chassis  which can be a plastic injection molded part. A pair of paper pinch rollers ,  utilized for decurling are snap fitted into corresponding frame holes eg. , .","As shown in , the chassis  includes a series of mutually opposed prongs eg. ,  into which is snapped fitted a series of electric motors , . The electric motors ,  can be entirely standard with the motor  being of a stepper motor type. The motor ,  include cogs ,  for driving a series of gear wheels. A first set of gear wheels is provided for controlling a paper cutter mechanism and a second set is provided for controlling print roll movement.","Turning next to , there is illustrated an ink supply mechanism  utilized in the camera system.  illustrates a back exploded perspective view,  illustrates a back assembled view and  illustrates a front assembled view. The ink supply mechanism  is based around an ink supply cartridge  which contains printer ink and a print head mechanism for printing out pictures on demand. The ink supply cartridge  includes a side aluminium strip  which is provided as a shear strip to assist in cutting images from a paper roll.","A dial mechanism  is provided for indicating the number of \u201cprints left\u201d. The dial mechanism  is snap fitted through a corresponding mating portion  so as to be freely rotatable.","As shown in , the mechanism  includes a flexible PCB strip  which interconnects with the print head and provides for control of the print head. The interconnection between the Flex PCB strip and an image sensor and print head integrated circuit can be via Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) Strips , . A moulded aspherical lens and aperture shim  () is also provided for imaging an image onto the surface of the image sensor integrated circuit normally located within cavity  and a light box module or hood  is provided for snap fitting over the cavity  so as to provide for proper light control. A series of decoupling capacitors eg.  can also be provided. Further a plug  () is provided for re-plugging ink holes after refilling. A series of guide prongs eg. \u2013 are further provided for guiding the flexible PCB strip .","The ink supply mechanism  interacts with a platen unit  which guides print media under a printhead located in the ink supply mechanism.  shows an exploded view of the platen unit , while  show assembled views of the platen unit. The platen unit  includes a first pinch roller  which is snap fitted to one side of a platen base . Attached to a second side of the platen base  is a cutting mechanism  which traverses the platen unit  by means of a rod  having a screw thread which is rotated by means of cogged wheel  which is also fitted to the platen base . The screw threaded rod  mounts a block  which includes a cutting wheel  fastened via a fastener . Also mounted to the block  is a counter actuator which includes a pawl . The pawl  acts to rotate the dial mechanism  of  upon the return traversal of the cutting wheel. As shown previously in , the dial mechanism  includes a cogged surface which interacts with pawl , thereby maintaining a count of the number of photographs by means of numbers embossed on the surface of dial mechanism . The cutting mechanism  is inserted into the platen base  by means of a snap fit via clips .","The platen unit  includes an internal recapping mechanism  for recapping the print head when not in use. The recapping mechanism  includes a sponge portion  and is operated via a solenoid coil so as to provide for recapping of the print head. In the preferred embodiment, there is provided an inexpensive form of printhead re-capping mechanism provided for incorporation into a handheld camera system so as to provide for printhead re-capping of an inkjet printhead.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIG. 8"],"b":["80","75","75","76","62","77","76"]},"A second moveable arm  of the solenoid actuator is also provided. The arm  is moveable and is also made of ferrous material. Mounted on the arm is a sponge portion surrounded by an elastomer strip . The elastomer strip  is of a generally arcuate cross-section and act as a leaf spring against the surface of the printhead ink supply cartridge  () so as to provide for a seal against the surface of the printhead ink supply cartridge . In the quiescent position an elastomer spring unit ,  acts to resiliently deform the elastomer seal  against the surface of the ink supply unit .","When it is desired to operate the printhead unit, upon the insertion of paper, the solenoid coil  is activated so as to cause the arm  to move down to be adjacent to the end plate . The arm  is held against end plate  while the printhead is printing by means of a small \u201ckeeper current\u201d in coil . Simulation results indicate that the keeper current can be significantly less than the actuation current. Subsequently, after photo printing, the paper is guillotined by the cutting mechanism  of  acting against Aluminium Strip , and rewound so as to clear the area of the re-capping mechanism . Subsequently, the current is turned off and springs ,  return the arm  so that the elastomer seal is again resting against the printhead ink supply cartridge.","It can be seen that the preferred embodiment provides for a simple and inexpensive means of re-capping a printhead through the utilisation of a solenoid type device having a long rectangular form. Further, the preferred embodiment utilises minimal power in that currents are only required whilst the device is operational and additionally, only a low keeper current is required whilst the printhead is printing.","Turning next to ,  illustrates an exploded perspective of the ink supply cartridge  whilst  illustrates a close up sectional view of a bottom of the ink supply cartridge with the printhead unit in place. The ink supply cartridge  is based around a pagewidth printhead  which comprises a long slither of silicon having a series of holes etched on the back surface for the supply of ink to a front surface of the silicon wafer for subsequent ejection via a micro electro mechanical system. The form of ejection can be many different forms such as those set out in the tables below.","Of course, many other inkjet technologies, as referred to the attached tables below, can also be utilised when constructing a printhead unit . The fundamental requirement of the ink supply cartridge  is the supply of ink to a series of colour channels etched through the back surface of the printhead . In the description of the preferred embodiment, it is assumed that a three colour printing process is to be utilised so as to provide full colour picture output. Hence, the print supply unit includes three ink supply reservoirs being a cyan reservoir , a magenta reservoir  and a yellow reservoir . Each of these reservoirs is required to store ink and includes a corresponding sponge type material \u2013 which assists in stabilising ink within the corresponding ink channel and inhibiting the ink from sloshing back and forth when the printhead is utilised in a handheld camera system. The reservoirs , ,  are formed through the mating of first exterior plastic piece  and a second base piece .","At a first end  of the base piece  a series of air inlet \u2013 are provided. Each air inlet leads to a corresponding winding channel which is hydrophobically treated so as to act as an ink repellent and therefore repel any ink that may flow along the air inlet channel. The air inlet channel further takes a convoluted path assisting in resisting any ink flow out of the chambers \u2013. An adhesive tape portion  is provided for sealing the channels within end portion .","At the top end, there is included a series of refill holes (not shown) for refilling corresponding ink supply chambers , , . A plug  is provided for sealing the refill holes.","Turning now to , there is illustrated a close up perspective view, partly in section through the ink supply cartridge  of  when formed as a unit. The ink supply cartridge includes the three colour ink reservoirs , ,  which supply ink to different portions of the back surface of printhead  which includes a series of apertures  defined therein for carriage of the ink to the front surface.","The ink supply cartridge  includes two guide walls ,  which separate the various ink chambers and are tapered into an end portion abutting the surface of the printhead . The guide walls ,  are further mechanically supported by block portions eg.  which are placed at regular intervals along the length of the ink supply unit. The block portions  leave space at portions close to the back of printhead  for the flow of ink around the back surface thereof.","The ink supply unit is preferably formed from a multi-part plastic injection mould and the mould pieces eg. ,  () snap together around the sponge pieces , . Subsequently, a syringe type device can be inserted in the ink refill holes and the ink reservoirs filled with ink with the air flowing out of the air outlets \u2013. Subsequently, the adhesive tape portion  and plug  are attached and the printhead tested for operation capabilities. Subsequently, the ink supply cartridge  can be readily removed for refilling by means of removing the ink supply cartridge, performing a washing cycle, and then utilising the holes for the insertion of a refill syringe filled with ink for refilling the ink chamber before returning the ink supply cartridge  to a camera.","Turning now to , there is shown an example layout of the Image Capture and Processing integrated circuit (ICP) .","The Image Capture and Processing integrated circuit  provides most of the electronic functionality of the camera with the exception of the print head integrated circuit. The integrated circuit  is a highly integrated system. It combines CMOS image sensing, analog to digital conversion, digital image processing, DRAM storage, ROM, and miscellaneous control functions in a single integrated circuit.","The integrated circuit is estimated to be around 32 mmusing a leading edge 0.18 micron CMOS\/DRAM\/APS process. The integrated circuit size and cost can scale somewhat with Moore's law, but is dominated by a CMOS active pixel sensor array , so scaling is limited as the sensor pixels approach the diffraction limit.","The ICP  includes CMOS logic, a CMOS image sensor, DRAM, and analog circuitry. A very small amount of flash memory or other non-volatile memory is also preferably included for protection against reverse engineering.","Alternatively, the ICP can readily be divided into two integrated circuits: one for the CMOS imaging array, and the other for the remaining circuitry. The cost of this two integrated circuit solution should not be significantly different than the single integrated circuit ICP, as the extra cost of packaging and bond-pad area is somewhat cancelled by the reduced total wafer area requiring the color filter fabrication steps.","The ICP preferably contains the following functions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Function",{}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1.5 megapixel image sensor"]},{"entry":[{},"Analog Signal Processors"]},{"entry":[{},"Image sensor column decoders"]},{"entry":[{},"Image sensor row decoders"]},{"entry":[{},"Analogue to Digital Conversion (ADC)"]},{"entry":[{},"Column ADC's"]},{"entry":[{},"Auto exposure"]},{"entry":[{},"12 Mbits of DRAM"]},{"entry":[{},"DRAM Address Generator"]},{"entry":[{},"Color interpolator"]},{"entry":[{},"Convolver"]},{"entry":[{},"Color ALU"]},{"entry":[{},"Halftone matrix ROM"]},{"entry":[{},"Digital halftoning"]},{"entry":[{},"Print head interface"]},{"entry":[{},"8 bit CPU core"]},{"entry":[{},"Program ROM"]},{"entry":[{},"Flash memory"]},{"entry":[{},"Scratchpad SRAM"]},{"entry":[{},"Parallel interface (8 bit)"]},{"entry":[{},"Motor drive transistors (5)"]},{"entry":[{},"Clock PLL"]},{"entry":[{},"JTAG test interface"]},{"entry":[{},"Test circuits"]},{"entry":[{},"Busses"]},{"entry":[{},"Bond pads"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The CPU, DRAM, Image sensor, ROM, Flash memory, Parallel interface, JTAG interface and ADC can be vendor supplied cores. The ICP is intended to run on 1.5V to minimize power consumption and allow convenient operation from two AA type battery cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["48","48","201"]},"The latest advances in the field of image sensing and CMOS image sensing in particular can be found in the October, 1997 issue of IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices and, in particular, pages 1689 to 1968. Further, a specific implementation similar to that disclosed in the present application is disclosed in Wong et. al, \u201cCMOS Active Pixel Image Sensors Fabricated Using a 1.8V, 0.25 \u03bcm CMOS Technology\u201d, IEDM 1996, page 915","The imaging array uses a 4 transistor active pixel design of a standard configuration. To minimize integrated circuit area and therefore cost, the image sensor pixels should be as small as feasible with the technology available. With a four transistor cell, the typical pixel size scales as 20 times the lithographic feature size. This allows a minimum pixel area of around 3.6 \u03bcm\u00d73.6 \u03bcm. However, the photosite must be substantially above the diffraction limit of the lens. It is also advantageous to have a square photosite, to maximize the margin over the diffraction limit in both horizontal and vertical directions. In this case, the photosite can be specified as 2.5 \u03bcm\u00d72.5 \u03bcm. The photosite can be a photogate, pinned photodiode, charge modulation device, or other sensor.","The four transistors are packed as an \u2018L\u2019 shape, rather than a rectangular region, to allow both the pixel and the photosite to be square. This reduces the transistor packing density slightly, increasing pixel size. However, the advantage in avoiding the diffraction limit is greater than the small decrease in packing density.","The transistors also have a gate length which is longer than the minimum for the process technology. These have been increased from a drawn length of 0.18 micron to a drawn length of 0.36 micron. This is to improve the transistor matching by making the variations in gate length represent a smaller proportion of the total gate length.","The extra gate length, and the \u2018L\u2019 shaped packing, mean that the transistors use more area than the minimum for the technology. Normally, around 8 \u03bcmwould be required for rectangular packing. Preferably, 9.75 \u03bcmhas allowed for the transistors.","The total area for each pixel is 16 \u03bcm, resulting from a pixel size of 4 \u03bcm\u00d74 \u03bcm. With a resolution of the area of the imaging array  is 6,000 \u03bcm\u00d74,000 \u03bcm, or 24 mm.","The presence of a color image sensor on the integrated circuit affects the process required in two major ways:","The CMOS fabrication process should be optimized to minimize dark current","Color filters are required. These can be fabricated using dyed photosensitive polyimides, resulting in an added process complexity of three spin coatings, three photolithographic steps, three development steps, and three hardbakes.","There are 15,000 analog signal processors (ASPs) , one for each of the columns of the sensor. The ASPs amplify the signal, provide a dark current reference, sample and hold the signal, and suppress the fixed pattern noise (FPN).","There are 375 analog to digital converters , one for each four columns of the sensor array. These may be delta-sigma or successive approximation type ADC's. A row of low column ADC's are used to reduce the conversion speed required, and the amount of analog signal degradation incurred before the signal is converted to digital. This also eliminates the hot spot (affecting local dark current) and the substrate coupled noise that would occur if a single high speed ADC was used. Each ADC also has two four bit DAC's which trim the offset and scale of the ADC to further reduce FPN variations between columns. These DAC's are controlled by data stored in flash memory during integrated circuit testing.","The column select logic  is a 1:1500 decoder which enables the appropriate digital output of the ADCs onto the output bus. As each ADC is shared by four columns, the least significant two bits of the row select control 4 input analog multiplexors.","A row decoder  is a 1:1000 decoder which enables the appropriate row of the active pixel sensor array. This selects which of the 1000 rows of the imaging array is connected to analog signal processors. As the rows are always accessed in sequence, the row select logic can be implemented as a shift register.","An auto exposure system  adjusts the reference voltage of the ADC  in response to the maximum intensity sensed during the previous frame period. Data from the green pixels is passed through a digital peak detector. The peak value of the image frame period before capture (the reference frame) is provided to a digital to analogue converter (DAC), which generates the global reference voltage for the column ADCs. The peak detector is reset at the beginning of the reference frame. The minimum and maximum values of the three RGB color components are also collected for color correction.","The second largest section of the integrated circuit is consumed by a DRAM  used to hold the image. To store the 1,500\u00d71,000 image from the sensor without compression, 1.5 Mbytes of DRAM  are required. This equals 12 Mbits, or slightly less than 5% of a 256 Mbit DRAM. The DRAM technology assumed is of the 256 Mbit generation implemented using 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS.","Using a standard 8F cell, the area taken by the memory array is 3.11 mm. When row decoders, column sensors, redundancy, and other factors are taken into account, the DRAM requires around 4 mm.","This DRAM  can be mostly eliminated if analog storage of the image signal can be accurately maintained in the CMOS imaging array for the two seconds required to print the photo. However, digital storage of the image is preferable as it is maintained without degradation, is insensitive to noise, and allows copies of the photo to be printed considerably later.","A DRAM address generator  provides the write and read addresses to the DRAM . Under normal operation, the write address is determined by the order of the data read from the CMOS image sensor . This will typically be a simple raster format. However, the data can be read from the sensor  in any order, if matching write addresses to the DRAM are generated. The read order from the DRAM  will normally simply match the requirements of a color interpolator and the print head. As the cyan, magenta, and yellow rows of the print head are necessarily offset by a few pixels to allow space for nozzle actuators, the colors are not read from the DRAM simultaneously. However, there is plenty of time to read all of the data from the DRAM many times during the printing process. This capability is used to eliminate the need for FIFOs in the print head interface, thereby saving integrated circuit area. All three RGB image components can be read from the DRAM each time color data is required. This allows a color space converter to provide a more sophisticated conversion than a simple linear RGB to CMY conversion.","Also, to allow two dimensional filtering of the image data without requiring line buffers, data is re-read from the DRAM array.","The address generator may also implement image effects in certain models of camera. For example, passport photos are generated by a manipulation of the read addresses to the DRAM. Also, image framing effects (where the central image is reduced), image warps, and kaleidoscopic effects can all be generated by manipulating the read addresses of the DRAM.","While the address generator  may be implemented with substantial complexity if effects are built into the standard integrated circuit, the integrated circuit area required for the address generator is small, as it consists only of address counters and a moderate amount of random logic.","A color interpolator  converts the interleaved pattern of red, 2\u00d7 green, and blue pixels into RGB pixels. It consists of three 8 bit adders and associated registers. The divisions are by either 2 (for green) or 4 (for red and blue) so they can be implemented as fixed shifts in the output connections of the adders.","A convolver  is provided as a sharpening filter which applies a small convolution kernel (5\u00d75) to the red, green, and blue planes of the image. The convolution kernel for the green plane is different from that of the red and blue planes, as green has twice as many samples. The sharpening filter has five functions:\n\n","These functions are all combined into a single convolution matrix. As the pixel rate is low (less than 1 Mpixel per second) the total number of multiplies required for the three color channels is 56 million multiplies per second. This can be provided by a single multiplier. Fifty bytes of coefficient ROM are also required.","A color ALU  combines the functions of color compensation and color space conversion into the one matrix multiplication, which is applied to every pixel of the frame. As with sharpening, the color correction should match the most popular settings, rather than the most accurate.","A color compensation circuit of the color ALU provides compensation for the lighting of the photo. The vast majority of photographs are substantially improved by a simple color compensation, which independently normalizes the contrast and brightness of the three color components.","A color look-up table (CLUT)  is provided for each color component. These are three separate 256\u00d78 SRAMs, requiring a total of 6,144 bits. The CLUTs are used as part of the color correction process. They are also used for color special effects, such as stochastically selected \u201cwild color\u201d effects.","A color space conversion system of the color ALU converts from the RGB color space of the image sensor to the CMY color space of the printer. The simplest conversion is a 1's complement of the RGB data. However, this simple conversion assumes perfect linearity of both color spaces, and perfect dye spectra for both the color filters of the image sensor, and the ink dyes. At the other extreme is a tri-linear interpolation of a sampled three dimensional arbitrary transform table. This can effectively match any non-linearity or differences in either color space. Such a system is usually necessary to obtain good color space conversion when the print engine is a color electrophotographic","However, since the non-linearity of a halftoned ink jet output is very small, a simpler system can be used. A simple matrix multiply can provide excellent results. This requires nine multiplies and six additions per contone pixel. However, since the contone pixel rate is low (less than 1 Mpixel\/sec) these operations can share a single multiplier and adder. The multiplier and adder are used in a color ALU which is shared with the color compensation function.","Digital halftoning can be performed as a dispersed dot ordered dither using a stochastic optimized dither cell. A halftone matrix ROM  is provided for storing dither cell coefficients. A dither cell size of 32\u00d732 is adequate to ensure that the cell repeat cycle is not visible. The three colors\u2014cyan, magenta, and yellow\u2014are all dithered using the same cell, to ensure maximum co-positioning of the ink dots. This minimizes \u2018muddying\u2019 of the mid-tones which results from bleed of dyes from one dot to adjacent dots while still wet. The total ROM size required is 1 KByte, as the one ROM is shared by the halftoning units for each of the three colors.","The digital halftoning used is dispersed dot ordered dither with stochastic optimized dither matrix. While dithering does not produce an image quite as \u2018sharp\u2019 as error diffusion, it does produce a more accurate image with fewer artifacts. The image sharpening produced by error diffusion is artificial, and less controllable and accurate than \u2018unsharp mask\u2019 filtering performed in the contone domain. The high print resolution (1,600 dpi\u00d71,600 dpi) results in excellent quality when using a well formed stochastic dither matrix.","Digital halftoning is performed by a digital halftoning unit  using a simple comparison between the contone information from the DRAM  and the contents of the dither matrix . During the halftone process, the resolution of the image is changed from the 250 dpi of the captured contone image to the 1,600 dpi of the printed image. Each contone pixel is converted to an average of 40.96 halftone dots.","The ICP incorporates a 16 bit microcontroller CPU core  to run the miscellaneous camera functions, such as reading the buttons, controlling the motor and solenoids, setting up the hardware, and authenticating the refill station. The processing power required by the CPU is very modest, and a wide variety of processor cores can be used. As the entire CPU program is run from a small ROM [.], program compatibility between camera versions is not important, as no external programs are run. A 2 Mbit (256 Kbyte) program and data ROM  is included on integrated circuit. Most of this ROM space is allocated to data for outline graphics and fonts for specialty cameras. The program requirements are minor. The single most complex task is the encrypted authentication of the refill station. The ROM requires a single transistor per bit.","A Flash memory  may be used to store a 128 bit authentication code. This provides higher security than storage of the authentication code in ROM, as reverse engineering can be made essentially impossible. The Flash memory is completely covered by third level metal, making the data impossible to extract using scanning probe microscopes or electron beams. The authentication code is stored in the integrated circuit when manufactured. At least two other Flash bits are required for the authentication process: a bit which locks out reprogramming of the authentication code, and a bit which indicates that the camera has been refilled by an authenticated refill station. The flash memory can also be used to store FPN correction data for the imaging array. Additionally, a phase locked loop rescaling parameter is stored for scaling the clocking cycle to an appropriate correct time. The clock frequency does not require crystal accuracy since no date functions are provided. To eliminate the cost of a crystal, an on integrated circuit oscillator with a phase locked loop  is used. As the frequency of an on-integrated circuit oscillator is highly variable from integrated circuit to integrated circuit, the frequency ratio of the oscillator to the PLL is digitally trimmed during initial testing. The value is stored in Flash memory . This allows the clock PLL to control the ink-jet heater pulse width with sufficient accuracy.","A scratchpad SRAM is a small static RAM  with a 6T cell.

There is no connection between the segments on the print head integrated circuit. Any connections required are made in the external TAB bonding film, which is double sided. The division into eight identical segments is to simplify lithography using wafer steppers. The segment width of 1.25 cm fits easily into a stepper field. As the print head integrated circuit is long and narrow (10 cm\u00d70.3 mm), the stepper field contains a single segment of  print head integrated circuits.

Four are for the four phases of the main stepper motor, two are for the guillotine motor, and the remaining transistor is to drive the capping solenoid. These transistors are allocated 20,000 square microns (600,000 F) each. As the transistors are driving highly inductive loads, they must either be turned off slowly, or be provided with a high level of back EMF protection. If adequate back EMF protection cannot be provided using the integrated circuit process chosen, then external discrete transistors should be used. The transistors are never driven at the same time as the image sensor is used. This is to avoid voltage fluctuations and hot spots affecting the image quality. Further, the transistors are located as far away from the sensor as possible.","A standard JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface  is included in the ICP for testing purposes and for interrogation by the refill station. Due to the complexity of the integrated circuit, a variety of testing techniques are required, including BIST (Built In Self Test) and functional block isolation.

The overhead for the large arrays the image sensor and the DRAM is smaller.","The JTAG interface is also used for authentication of the refill station. This is included to ensure that the cameras are only refilled with quality paper and ink at a properly constructed refill station, thus preventing inferior quality refills from occurring. The camera must authenticate the refill station, rather than vice versa. The secure protocol is communicated to the refill station during the automated test procedure.

It will be evident that the preferred embodiment further provides for a refillable camera system. A used camera can be collected and its outer plastic cases removed and recycled. A new paper roll and batteries can be added and the ink cartridge refilled. A series of automatic test routines can then be carried out to ensure that the printer is properly operational. Further, in order to ensure only authorised refills are conducted so as to enhance quality, routines in the on-integrated circuit program ROM can be executed such that the camera authenticates the refilling station using a secure protocol. Upon authentication, the camera can reset an internal paper count and an external case can be fitted on the camera system with a new outer label. Subsequent packing and shipping can then take place.","It will be further readily evident to those skilled in the art that the program ROM can be modified so as to allow for a variety of digital processing routines. In addition to the digitally enhanced photographs optimised for mainstream consumer preferences, various other models can readily be provided through mere re-programming of the program ROM. For example, a sepia classic old fashion style output can be provided through a remapping of the colour mapping function. A further alternative is to provide for black and white outputs again through a suitable colour remapping algorithm. Minimum colour can also be provided to add a touch of colour to black and white prints to produce the effect that was traditionally used to colourize black and white photos. Further, passport photo output can be provided through suitable address remappings within the address generators. Further, edge filters can be utilised as is known in the field of image processing to produce sketched art styles. Further, classic wedding borders and designs can be placed around an output image in addition to the provision of relevant clip arts. For example, a wedding style camera might be provided. Further, a panoramic mode can be provided so as to output the well known panoramic format of images. Further, a postcard style output can be provided through the printing of postcards including postage on the back of a print roll surface. Further, cliparts can be provided for special events such as Halloween, Christmas etc. Further, kaleidoscopic effects can be provided through address remappings and wild colour effects can be provided through remapping of the colour lookup table. Many other forms of special event cameras can be provided for example, cameras dedicated to the Olympics, movie tie-ins, advertising and other special events.","The operational mode of the camera can be programmed so that upon the depressing of the take photo a first image is sampled by the sensor array to determine irrelevant parameters. Next a second image is again captured which is utilised for the output. The captured image is then manipulated in accordance with any special requirements before being initially output on the paper roll. The LED light is then activated for a predetermined time during which the DRAM is refreshed so as to retain the image. If the print copy button is depressed during this predetermined time interval, a further copy of the photo is output. After the predetermined time interval where no use of the camera has occurred, the onboard CPU shuts down all power to the camera system until such time as the take button is again activated. In this way, substantial power savings can be realized.","Ink Jet Technologies","The embodiments of the invention use an inkjet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.","The most significant problem with thermal inkjet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal inkjet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.","The most significant problem with piezoelectric inkjet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewide print heads with 19,200 nozzles.","Ideally, the inkjet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-camera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new inkjet technologies have been created. The target features include:","low power (less than 10 Watts)","high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)","photographic quality output","low manufacturing cost","small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)","high speed (<2 seconds per page).","All of these features can be met or exceeded by the inkjet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. 45 different inkjet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table below.","The inkjet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems","For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS integrated circuit with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the inkjet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a integrated circuit area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.","Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.","Cross-Referenced Applications","The following table is a guide to cross-referenced patent applications filed
