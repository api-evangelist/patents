No. 60\/324,147 filed Sep. 21, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to triazine compounds. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and compositions for making and using triazine compounds.","Synthesis of novel compounds leads to new possibilities for discovery of novel therapeutic interventions. By using structure and activity relationship investigations, compounds can be tailored so that the compounds have at least one activity that can be predicted from its structure. Using high-throughput assays allows for the rapid determination of the activity of the newly synthesized compounds.","Novel compounds for new therapeutic interventions are needed for many areas of medicine and disease treatment. For example, chronic and acute inflammatory conditions form the basis for diseases affecting all organ systems including, but not limited to, asthma, acute inflammatory diseases, vascular inflammatory disease, chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, angiopathy, myocarditis, ncphritis, Crohn's disease, arthritis, type I and II diabetes and associated vascular pathologies. The incidence of these inflammatory conditions is on the rise in the population as a whole, with diabetes alone affecting 16 million people.","While inflammation in and of itself is a normal immune response, chronic inflammation leads to complications and ongoing system damage due to the interactions of unknown cellular factors. In particular, chronic inflammation can cause endothelial damage resulting in vascular complications. Coronary artery, cerbrovascular and peripheral vascular disease resulting from atherosclerotic and thromboembolic macroangiopathy are the primary causes of mortality in chronic inflammatory diseases.","Many humans and animals have limited lifespans and lifestyles because of conditions relating to lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, or because of genetic predispositions to develop a disease. For example, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is a common consequence of endothelial injury and is believed to be an early pathogenetic event in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques or complications related to vascular injury or as a result surgical interventions. Abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular occlusive lesions, including arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and graft atherosclerosis after organ transplantation.","Percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PTCA) procedures are the most common in-patient hospital procedure in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, about one-third of the patients that undergo balloon angioplasty have restenosis of the widened segment of the vessel within approximately 6 months. It may be necessary to perform another angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery on restenosed arteries. A key feature of restenosis is an injury response that results in activation of an inflammatory cascade and remodeling of the cells both inside and outside the carotid artery wall. This includes excessive growth of connective tissue and smooth muscle into the lumen of the artery known as neointimal hyperplasia. Currently there are no effective pharmacological treatments available that control the pathogenesis of vascular occlusive lesions, such as, but not limited to, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and graft atherosclerosis after organ transplantation. Identification of effective therapeutics with minimal side effects will restore quality of life without requiring additional surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass surgery.","Control or modulation of factors produced by the body in response to injury, surgery, metabolic factors or loss of control of in feedback mechanisms, leading to too much or too little of a factor has long been the goal of administering pharmacological agents. One disease that rapidly growing in the industrialized countries is the occurrence of diabetes and all of its attendant sequellae. One of the factors important in the damage associated with diabetes is the presence of glycated proteins.","Glycated proteins and advanced glycation end products (AGE) contribute to cellular damage, particularly, diabetic tissue injury, by at least by two major mechanisms; modulation of cellular functions through interactions with specific cell surface receptors, and alteration of the extracellular matrix leading to the formation of protein cross-links. Studies suggest that glycated protein and AGE interactions with cells may promote inflammatory processes and oxidative cellular injury. AGE increases lipoprotein oxidisability and atherogenicity. Its binding to matrix proteins induces synthesis of cytokines and activates cellular messangers. Diseases where glycated protein and AGE accumulation is a suspected etiological factor include vascular complications of diabetes, microangiopathies, renal insufficiency and Alzheimer's disease.","The exact mechanisms by which high plasma glucose, as seen in diabetes, causes microvascular damage are not completely understood. One potential mechanism by which hyperglycemia can be linked to microangiopathies is through the process of non-enzymatic glycation of critical proteins. Non-enzymatic glycation, i.e. the linking of proteins with glucose, leads to the formation of glycated proteins. The first step in this glycation pathway involves the non-enzymatic condensation of glucose with free amino groups in the protein, primarily the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues, forming the Amadori adducts. These early glycation products can undergo further reactions such as rearrangements, dehydration and condensations to form irreversible advanced glycation end products (AGE). These are a highly reactive group of molecules whose interaction with specific receptors on the cell-surface which are thought to lead to pathogenic outcomes.","Other major area of disease of where treatments are needed and for which adequate and effective therapies do not exist are cellular proliferative disorders, or disorders caused by unwanted or unintended cellular growth. As mentioned, smooth muscle cell (SMC) hyperplasia is a major event in the development of atherosclerosis and is also responsible for the significant number of failure rates following vascular procedures such as angioplasty, stent implantation and coronary artery bypass surgery. In the normal vessel, SMC are quiescent, but they proliferate when damage to the endothelium occurs. Naturally occurring growth modulators, many of which are derived from the endothelium, tightly control SMC proliferation in vivo. When the control becomes unregulated, a pathological state is induced in the subject.","Another major area of unwanted cellular growth, that is unchecked by the body's regulatory systems, is cancer or oncological conditions. Many therapies have been used and are being used in an effort to restore health or at least stop the unwanted cell growth. Many times, therapeutic agents can have an effect individually, but often, therapeutic regimes require combinations of different pharmacological agents with treatments such as surgery or radiation.","There is a present need for treatments of chronic or acute diseases, such as atherosclerosis, unwanted cellular growth or cellular proliferation, diabetes, inflammatory conditions and vascular occlusive pathologic conditions, because occurrence is frequent, the currently available treatments are costly and the conditions are refractory to many pharmacological therapies. The mechanisms involved in the control or prevention of such diseases are not clear and there exists a need for preventive and therapeutic treatments of these and other diseases Thus, what is presently needed are novel compounds that find utility in methods and compositions for treatment and prevention of chronic and acute diseases.","The present invention is directed to methods and compositions comprising novel compounds, primarily based on a substituted triazine core.

In this case, Yand Ymay be selected from a wide range of substituents, including, but not limited to, cycloalkyl with up to 10 carbon atoms;",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0154"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00012","num":"00012"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00012","he":"14.99mm","wi":"18.80mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00012.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0146","num":"0155"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00013","num":"00013"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00013","he":"29.13mm","wi":"51.48mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00013.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["2","x","2 ","2","x ","1 "],"sup":["1","1","1","1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0156"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00014","num":"00014"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00014","he":"12.53mm","wi":"14.56mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00014.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0157"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00015","num":"00015"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00015","he":"17.53mm","wi":"22.10mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00015.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["2","3","x","2"],"sup":["1","1 ","1 ","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0158"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00016","num":"00016"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00016","he":"14.14mm","wi":"35.05mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00016.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0159"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00017","num":"00017"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00017","he":"15.49mm","wi":"43.86mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00017.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","1 ","2 "]},"It is also noted that AYtogether, and DYtogether, can also represent a wide range of chemical moieties bonded to the triazine core such as halide or secondary amino groups such as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0152","num":"0161"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00018","num":"00018"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00018","he":"17.86mm","wi":"42.93mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00018.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0162"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00019","num":"00019"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00019","he":"17.86mm","wi":"62.99mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00019.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0163"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00020","num":"00020"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00020","he":"14.39mm","wi":"22.69mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00020.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0164"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00021","num":"00021"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00021","he":"11.60mm","wi":"24.89mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00021.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["2 ","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0165"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00022","num":"00022"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00022","he":"16.51mm","wi":"25.06mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00022.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0166"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00023","num":"00023"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00023","he":"29.21mm","wi":"75.01mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00023.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"1 "},"Representative compounds in accordance with the present invention are presented in Table 1.

In all structures presented in any text, table, scheme or figure herein, any hydrogen atoms that are required for any atom to attain its usual valence, whether a carbon atom or a heteroatom, should be inferred if it is not specifically indicated in a structure.","One method of preparation of the compounds is shown in the scheme below. The compounds were prepared by reacting cyanuric chloride sequentially with monomers of primary or secondary amines to afford the desired 1,3,5-triazine derivatives[1,2,3,4]. Thus, the amine starting compounds that are used to react with cyanuric chloride are termed \u201cmonomers.\u201d The N,N,N-tris(amino-substituted)-1,3,5-triazines were prepared without the need for purification between each step of the synthesis, and the final product was isolated by standard procedures. Purification was accomplished using flash column chromatography as needed. It is within the skill of the art of organic synthesis to prepare, isolate and purify these organic compounds described herein, and to modify the syntheses shown. For example, it is possible to synthesize the compounds of the present invention by using an excess of any monomers of primary or secondary amines in any of the three steps shown in Scheme 1, such that the excess monomer, serves as both substituent for the triazine core, as well as a base, in which case i-PrNEt base can be excluded.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0175","num":"0184"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00026","num":"00026"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00026","he":"119.80mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US07132423-20061107-C00026.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The pendant amino groups can be substituted by functional groups depicted as Rto Rgroups in Scheme 1. The degree of functionality of a pendant amino group is determined by the structure and complexity of the amine monomer, and will affect the overall molecular diversity of the N,N,N-tris(amino-substituted)-1,3,5-triazines. A wide range of amine monomers may be used in this invention. Once bonded to the triazine core, the pendant amino groups can be described as secondary or tertiary substituted, depending on the degree of substitution at the nitrogen atom.","Table 2 presents charts of N,N,N-tris(amino)-1,3,5-triazine compounds of Libraries I\u2013III of this invention, respectively, along with the amine precursor monomers used in the preparation of the compounds. General procedures and synthetic procedures are detailed in Example 1\u20135. The sequence in which each monomer is added in Scheme 1 is also presented in Table 2, where Monomer 1 is added first, Monomer 2 added second, and Monomer 3 is added third. While not intending to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that this order of addition is significant, because each synthetic stop necessarily involves the reaction of a monomer with a different triazine precursor. That is, monomer 1 reacts with cyanuric chloride, monomer 2 reacts with an amino dichloro(triazine), and monomer 3 reacts with a diamino chloro(triazine), as shown in Scheme 1. Thus, the order in which the monomers are employed is based on the general synthetic principle that the relative nucleophilicity and\/or basicity of monomers 1\u20133 used in the synthetic scheme should generally increase from monomer 1 to monomer 3. This strategy permits the most nucleophilic and\/or basic amine monomer to be reacted with the more sterically congested and presumably less-reactive diamino chloro(triazine), where its greater reactivity may assist the reaction proceeding to completion. In some cases, more than one order of monomer addition will provide the desired product, but the reaction sequences provided in Table 2 represents the optimum synthetic methods presently known.","Note that only in a general sense do the substituents indicated as N, N, and Nin the general structures above correspond with the actual N,N,N-nomenclature of the N,N,N-tris(amino)triazines. Because the order in which N, N, and Nsubstituents are assigned a 2-, 4-, or 6-position on the triazine core is dependent on the name of each amino group in the molecule, it is not always true that one particular amino group always appears as an N, N, or Nsubstituent, even when only a single substituent is being permuted at one position. For example, many of the compounds of Table 2 contain both cycloheptyl amino and 3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl amino groups, yet these groups take on different 2-, 4-, or 6-positions as a function of the name of the third substituent on the triazine core. As a result, the syntheses are discussed in terms of permuting amino groups at one pendant N, N, or Nposition (rather than N, N, or Nposition) in the structure above, while maintaining the other amino groups constant. Further, note that the compound names used in the Tables, Claims and specification were typically generated using Beilstein's Autonom\u2122 4.01.188, as well as the earlier CD \u201cstand-alone\u201d version of Beilstein's Autonom\u2122, Autonom 2000. Typically, the compound names generated in this fashion were used, regardless of whether the compound name is an IUPAC, CAS, Beilstein, or other nomenclature. In each case however, the names unambiguously identify the compound specified.","A. Amino Groups Derived from Monomer 1","The sequence of monomer reaction with the triazine core, shown in Scheme 1, is Monomer 1, Monomer 2, and Monomer 3, added in that order.

comprising the compounds of the present invention for the treatment and prevention of conditions or diseases that have as an aspect of the disease or condition, unwanted cellular proliferation occurring or are the result of cellular proliferation. For example, many vascular diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, organ transplant sequellae, vascular occlusive conditions including, but not limited to, neointimal hyperplasia, restenosis, transplant vasculopathy, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriosclerosis, are caused by or have collateral damage due to unwanted cellular proliferation. Smooth muscle cell (SMC) hyperplasia is a major event in the development of atherosclerosis and is also responsible for the significant number of failure rates following vascular procedures such as angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery, particularly due to restenosis. Proliferation of arterial wall SMC in response to local injury is a major feature of many vascular proliferative disorders. Neointimal hyperplasia is commonly seen after various forms of vascular injury and a major component of the vein graft's response to harvest and surgical implantation into high-pressure arterial circulation. Proliferation of SMC in response to local injury is a major feature of vascular proliferative disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty.","One aspect of the present invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, preferably comprising compositions and compounds having cellular. antiproliferative activity. These compounds and compositions comprising such compounds are referred to as antiproliferative compounds or compositions.

These compounds and compositions comprising these compounds are, among other things, generally useful for treating cardiovascular disorders associated with proliferative activity. Specifically, these compounds include N-cycloheptyl-N-(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine, and N-cycloheptyl-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-N-naphthalen-2-yl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine. Using the same activity scale used in Table 3, and discussed above, the first compound, N-cycloheptyl-N-(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine, is characterized as a compound exhibiting medium or moderate activity, while the second compound, N-cycloheptyl-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-N-naphthalen-2-yl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine, is characterized as a compound exhibiting high activity.","As used herein, when a proteoglycan is referred to, the entire molecule or fragments are included therein. For example, perlecan refers to the entire perlecan molecule or fragments thereof. Different fragments of perlecan may have the same or different effects on cells and the effects may be the same as or different from the effects that the entire perlecan molecule has on cells. These fragments and activities are contemplated in the present invention and compounds included in the present invention may have at least one activity that modulates or effects the fragements' activities or the entire molecule's activities. Although the discussion herein refers specifically to perlecans it is important to note that the compositions, methods, and assays described herein are equally applicable in the context of other proteoglycans, including HSPGs, and including but not limited to, chondroitan sulfates (e.g., A, B, and C), dermatan sulfates, syndecans and glypicans.","Methods for identifying the activity and screening for one or more of these compounds or molecules that induce synthesis of proteoglycans such as HSPG (heparan sulfate proteoglycan) are taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/091,357, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Assays of effects of compounds in vivo are also taught in the incorporated references and are known to those skilled in the art. In general, methods comprise the addition of such compounds to assays and measurement of HSPG synthesis including, but not limited to, the production of syndecans, glypicans and perlecans, for example, syndecans 1, 2 and 4; and glypican-1. Other assays that can be used to determine the activity of the compounds of the present invention include other methods for measuring the induction of perlecan synthesis. For example, in one assay, perlecan is induced in cells by certain inducers, and the response is measured. Compounds of the present invention are then added to a replicate assay and the effect on perlecan induction is determined. Using such methods, compounds are determined that can either inhibit perlecan, elevate induction of perlecan, or that have no effect at all. Those compounds that are effective as therapeutic agents can then be used in animals, humans or patients with cellular proliferation disease aspects, such as vascular-associated diseases or SMC proliferation pathologies.","Another assay for determining compounds having SMC effects comprises adding a composition suspected of effecting SMC proliferation to smooth muscle cells in growth medium or serum-free medium. The change in cell proliferation can be measured by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as incorporation of labeled nucleotides into dividing cells' DNA, and compared to the proliferation of cells which are not treated with the compound. Other measurements include directly determining levels of HSPG synthesis by measuring the amount or change in amount of HSPG such as with ELISA for HSPGs, and compared to the amount of HSPG synthesis in untreated cells. Other indirect or direct measurement are contemplated by the present invention and are known to those skilled in the art. For example, such methods include, but are not limited to, measurement of RNA levels, RT-PCR, Northern blotting, Western blotting promoter-based assays to identify compounds that affect one or more proteoglycans and assays for proteoglyean biological activity shown by recombinant proteins, partially purified proteins, or lysates from cells expressing proteoglycans in the presence or absence of compounds of interest.","An assay for identifying and determining an activity of one or more of the compounds of the present invention comprises identifying compounds that interact with the promoter regions of a gene, or interact and effect proteins that interact with the promoter region, and are important in the transcriptional regulation of the protein's expression. For example, if perlecan were the protein, in general, the method comprises a vector comprising regulatory sequences of the perlecan gene and an indicator region controlled by the regulatory sequences, such as an enzyme, in a promoter-reporter construct. The protein product of the indicator region is referred to herein as a reporter enzyme or reporter protein. The regulatory region of the sequence of perlecan comprises a range of nucleotides from approximately \u22124000 to +2000 wherein the transcription initiation site is +1, more preferably, from \u22122500 to +1200, most preferably, from \u22121500 to +800 relative to the transcription initiation site.","Cells are transfected with a vector comprising the promoter-reporter construct and then treated with one or more compositions comprising at least one compound of the present invention. For example, the transfected cells are treated with a composition comprising a compound suspected of effecting the transcription of perlecan and the level of activity of the perlecan regulatory sequences are compared to the level of activity in cells that were not treated with the compound. The level of activity of the perlecan regulatory sequences are determined by measuring the amount of the reporter protein or determining the activity of the reporter enzyme controlled by the regulatory sequences. An increase in the amount of the reporter protein or the reporter enzyme activity shows a stimulatory effect on perlecan, by positively effecting the promoter, whereas a decrease in the amount or the reporter protein or the reporter enzyme activity shows a negative effect on the promoter and thus, on perlecan.","Additionally, the present invention comprises methods and compositions that can be used with gene therapy methods and composition, such as those gene therapy methods comprising administering compositions comprising nucleic acids that effect the synthesis or expression of HSPGs, particularly perlecan. Such methods and compositions are taught in U.S. patent application Ser.

Glycosidase Modulation Activity","The present invention also comprises methods and compositions comprising compounds described herein that have an activity associated with modulation of glycosidase enzymes and thus, effecting the substrates for such enzymes. Glycosidase enzymes and their activity with their substrates, such as proteoglycans or glycated proteins, are aspects of a variety of diseases such as vascular conditions, including those conditions discussed supra, proteoglycan-associated diseases, supra, associated diseases with vascular components, including but not limited to, kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiovascular disease, generalized vascular disease, proliferative retinopathy, and macroangeopathy, inflammatory diseases and metastatic diseases such as cancer, cellular proliferative conditions, and solid and blood borne tumors or other oncological conditions. Compounds described herein that have an activity that effects the concentrations of substrates of glycosidase enzymes are used in methods of treatment of such vascular, inflammatory, metastatic and systemic diseases.","An aspect of the present invention comprises methods and compositions for the modulation of enzymes, such as glycosaminoglycan degrading enzymes, which effect or are effected by proteoglycan levels, amount or activity. For example, the present invention comprises methods and compositions comprising compounds that modulate enzymes including but not limited to, heparanase, chondroitanase, heparan sulfate endoglycosidase, heparan sulfate exoglycosidase, polysaccharide lyases, keratinase, hyauronidase, glucanase, amylase, glycosidases, or other proteoglycan degrading enzymes are useful for the treatment of conditions such as diabetic vasculopathy, cancer, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases. For example, the present invention comprises methods and compositions of compounds that inhibit, impair or down-regulate the activity of proteoglycan degrading enzymes.","Proteoglycans such as HSPG are important components of the subendothelial extracellular matrix and the basement membrane of blood vessels. Rosenberg et al., 99 J. C. I2062\u201370 (1997). Basement membranes are continuous sheets of extracellular matrix composed of collagenous and noncollagenous proteins and proteoglycans that separate parenchymal cells from underlying interstitial connective tissue. They have characteristic permeabilities and play a role in maintaining tissue architecture.","In addition to HSPGs, the basal lamina consists predominantly of a complex network of adhesion proteins, fibronectin, laminin, collagen and vitronectin. Wight et al., 6 C. O. L326\u2013334 (1995). Heparan sulfate (HS) is an important structural component of the basal lamina. Each of the adhesion proteins interacts with HS side chains of HSPGs within the matrix. Thus, HSPGs function as a barrier to the extravasation of metastatic and inflammatory cells. Cleavage of HS by the endoglycosidase heparanase produced by metastatic tumor cells and inflammatory cells destroys the filtering properties of the lamina. In addition, the degradation of the HS may assist in the disassembly of the extracellular matrix and thereby facilitate cell migration by allowing blood bome cells to escape into the bloodstream. Vlodavsky et al., 12 IM112\u2013127 (1992).","Heparanase activity has been described in a number of tissues and cell types including liver, placenta, platelets, fibroblasts, neutrophils, activated T and B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and endothelial cells (7\u201316). Nakajima et al., (31) CL277\u2013283 (1986); Nakajima et al., 36 J. C. B157\u2013167 (1988); Ricoveri et al., 46 CR3855\u20133861 (1986); Gallagher et al., 250 B. J. 719\u2013726 (1988); Dempsey et al., 10 G467 (2000); Goshen et al., 2 M. H. R679 (1996); Parish et al., 76 ICB104\u2013113 (1998); Gilat et al., 181 J. E. M1929\u20131934 (1995); Graham, et al., 39 B. M. B. I56371 (1996); Pillarisetti et al., 270 J. B. C29760\u201329765 (1995). An important process in tissue invasion by blood-borne tumor cells and white cells involves their passage through the vascular endothelial cell layer and subsequent degradation of the underlying basal lamina or basement membranes and extracellular matrix with a battery of secreted proteases and glycosidases. Nakajinia et al., 220 S611\u2013613 (1983); Vlodavsky et al., 12 IM112\u2013127 (1992).","Heparanase activity was shown to correlate with the metastatic potential of animal and human tumor cell lines. Nakajima et al., 31 CL277\u2013283 (1986); Nakajima et al., 212 PCBR113\u2013122 (1986); Freeman et al., 325 B. J. 229\u2013237 (1997); Vlodavsky et al., 5 N. M793\u2013802 (1999); Hulett et al., 5 NM803\u2013809 (1999). It is also known to regulate growth factor activity. Many growth factors remain bound to heparan sulfate in storage form and are disassociated by heparanase during angiogenesis, improving the survival rate of cancer cells.","Serum heparanase levels in rats were higher by more than an order of magnitude after injection of the rats with highly metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma cells. In addition, heparanase activity in the sera of rats bearing MTLn3 tumors correlated well with the extent of the metastases. Moreover, serum\/urine heparanase activity in cancer patients was shown to be 2\u20134 fold increased in particular where tissue metastases were present. Because the cleavage of HS appears to be essential for the passage of metastatic tumor cells and leukocytes through basement membranes, studies of heparanase inhibitors provides the potential of developing a novel and highly selective class of anti-metastatic and anti-inflammatory drugs.","The present invention comprises methods and compositions comprising compounds that modulate heparanase activity or the activity of other glycosidases, including, but not limited to enzymes with glycosaminoglycan activity such as chondroitinase, heparan sulfate endoglycosidase, heparan sulfate exoglycosidase, polysaccharide lyases, keratinase, hyaluranidase, glucanase, and amylase.

Generally autoimmune disease results when (1) the immune system mistakenly identifies a cell surface molecule on normal tissue as a foreign molecule (2) the synthesis and secretion of chemokines, cytokines and lymphokines is not shut down after the eradication of the disease or (3) the immune system overreacts to the apparent infection and destroys vast quantities of surrounding normal tissue.","To be effective in an immune response, the immune effector cells must bind to the luminal\/apical surface of the blood vessel walls. This is accomplished through the interaction of adhesion molecules on the immune effector cells with their locally upregulated cognate receptors on the endothelial cells lining the vasculature near the site of infection. After binding to the apical surface and before entering the inflamed tissue, the immune effector cells must breach the basement membrane (BM) and extracellular matrix (ECM) that surround the basal portion of the blood vessels and give the vessels their shape and strength. The BM and ECM consists of structural proteins embedded in a fiber meshwork consisting mainly of complex carbohydrate containing structures (glycosaminoglycans), of which the main constituent is heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). In order to breach this barrier the immune effector cell must weaken or destroy it, which is accomplished through the local secretion of proteases and heparanase(s).","Thus, the inhibition of heparanase or the activity of other glycosidases using the compounds of the present invention finds utitlity in treating arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. More specifically, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of at least one autoimmune-related disease in a cell, tissue, organ, animal, or patient including, but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondilitis, gastric ulcer, seronegative arthropathies, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosis, antiphospholipid syndrome, iridocyclitis\/uveitis\/optic neuritis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic vasculitis\/wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, orchitis\/vasectomy reversal procedures, allergic\/atopic diseases, asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, allergic contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, transplants, organ transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis syndrome, gram positive sepsis, gram negative sepsis, culture negative sepsis, fungal sepsis, neutropenic fever, urosepsis, meningococcemia, trauma\/hemorrhage, bums, ionizing radiation exposure, acute pancreatitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol-induced hepatitis, chronic inflammatory pathologies, Crohn's pathology, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, nephrosis, atopic diseases, hypersensitity reactions, allergic rhinitis, hay fever, perennial rhinitis, conjunctivitis, endometriosis, asthma, urticaria, systemic anaphalaxis, dermatitis, pernicious anemia, hemolytic disesease, thrombocytopenia, graft rejection of any organ or tissue, kidney translplant rejection, heart transplant rejection, liver transplant rejection, pancreas transplant rejection, lung transplant rejection, bone marrow transplant (BMT) rejection, skin allograft rejection, cartilage transplant rejection, bone graft rejection, small bowel transplant rejection, fetal thymus implant rejection, parathyroid transplant rejection, xenograft rejection of any organ or tissue, allograft rejection, anti-receptor hypersensitivity reactions, Graves disease, Raynoud's disease, type B insulin-resistant diabetes, asthma, myasthenia gravis, -meditated cytotoxicity, type III hypersensitivity reactions, POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes syndrome), polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin changes syndrome, anti-phospholipid syndrome, pemphigus, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, idiopathic Addison's disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma, diabetes mellitus, chronic active hepatitis, vitiligo, vasculitis, post-MI cardiotomy syndrome, type IV hypersensitivity contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allograft rejection, granulomas due to intracellular organisms, drug sensitivity, metabolic\/idiopathic, Wilson's disease, hemachromatosis, alpha-l-antitrypsin deficiency, diabetic retinopathy, hashimoto's thyroiditis, osteoporosis, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis evaluation, primary biliary cirrhosis, thyroiditis, encephalomyelitis, cachexia, cystic fibrosis, neonatal chronic lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), familial hematophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, dermatologic conditions, psoriasis, alopecia, nephrotic syndrome, nephritis, glomerular nephritis, acute renal failure, hemodialysis, uremia, toxicity, preeclampsia, ankylosing spondylitis, Behcet's disease, bullous pemphigoid, cardiomyopathy, celiac sprue-dermatitis, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic inflammatory demyclinating polyneuropathy, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cicatricial pemphigoid, CREST syndrome, cold agglutinin disease, discoid lupus, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibromyalgia-fibromyositis, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barr\u00e9, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), IgA nephropathy, insulin dependent diabetes, juvenile arthritis, lichen planus, m\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, multiple sclerosis, pemphigus vulgaris, polyarteritis nodosa, Cogan's syndrome, polychondritis, polyglandular syndromes, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, primary agammaglobulinemia, Raynaud's phenomenon, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatic fever, Sjogren's syndrome, stiff-man syndrome, Takayasu arteritis, temporal arteritis\/giant cell arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis; okt3 therapy, anti-cd3 therapy, cytokine therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy (e.g., including but not limited toasthenia, anemia, cachexia, and the like), chronic salicylate intoxication, and the like.","Compounds having heparanase activity inhibition, that are effective for example, in treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease, can be determined using assays such as those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/952,648, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Such assays, which are used for measurement of cellular and enzymatic activities, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and in methods for diagnosing metastases, metastatic potential and inflammatory states, are performed with and without the addition of at least one of the compounds of the present invention to determine the activity of the compound. Existing heparanase assays are taught in Goshen et al., 2 M. H. R679\u201384 (1996); Nakajima et al., 31 CL277\u201383 (1986); and Vlodasky et al., 12 IM112\u201327 (1992); Freeman and Parish, 325 B. J. 229\u201337 (1997); Kahn and Newman, 196 A. B373\u201376 (1991). Solid-phase heparanase assays have also been developed where chemically and biosynthetically radiolabeled heparin and HS chains were attached to a solid support, with release of radiolabel from the solid support being a measure of enzyme activity. Assays using such procedures are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,581, which is entirely expressly herein incorporated by reference.","In general, a preferred assay comprises attaching one of a binding partner to a substrate for the enzyme to be measured, forming the substrate-binding partner. Incubation with a sample comprising the enzyme to be measured allows for activity by the enzyme to be measured in a reaction mixture. A portion or the whole reaction mixture, depending on the amount needed, is then mixed with the complementary binding partner, so that the binding partners are bound together. This is the first binding reaction. After incubating to allow for binding, washings are performed. A complementary binding partner, complementary to the first binding partner attached to the substrate, is added. This complementary binding partner may or may not be the same as the first complementary binding partner. This is the second binding reaction. The complementary binding partner in the second binding reaction is labeled in a manner that is detectable. For example, the complementary binding partner is labeled with an enzyme that causes a detectable color change when the appropriate reaction conditions exist. The difference between the activity of the enzyme in the presence of a compound and the absence of compound is used to determine the activity of the compound.","An example of a heparanase assay comprises the following steps. A composition comprising biotin-HS (heparan sulfate) is mixed with a biological sample such as a tumor sample, bodily fluid, or other fluid suspected of having heparanase activity, to form a reaction mixture. This sample may be pretreated to remove contaminating or reactive substances such as endogenous biotin. A control portion for this reaction mixture does not contain a compound of the present invention, whereas a test portion contains one or more compounds disclosed herein. After incubation, an aliquot or portion of the reaction mixture portions is removed and placed in a biotin-binding plate. The biotin-binding plate comprises any means for binding biotin, preferably to a solid surface. See WO 02\/23197, which is entirely expressly incorporated herein by reference. After washing with buffers, a streptavidin-enzyme conjugate is added to the biotin-binding plate. Reagents for the enzyme are added to form a detectable color product. For example, a decrease in color formation, from a known standard, indicates there was heparanase activity in the sample. The difference between the activity of the enzyme in the presence of a compound and the absence of compound is used to determine the activity of the compound.","Using the above assays or those taught in the Examples herein, the amount of enzyme activity in a sample can be determined and the activities of compounds of the present invention can be determined. For example, a composition comprising a compound of the present invention is added to a known amount of heparanase either before or during the incubation of the heparanase and its substrate-binding partner. If the compound alters the activity of the heparanase, the assay methods of the present invention will show a change in the amount of detectable label. Such assays are used for high throughput determination of the activity of compounds. See WO 02\/23197, which is entirely expressly incorporated herein by reference.","The activities of the compounds included in the present invention modulate the activity of glycosidases, either positively or negatively, include effects on the glycosidases either directly or indirectly.

Pharmacological inhibition of AGE-induced cell activation provides the basis for therapeutic intervention in many diseases, notably in diabetic complications and Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic approaches for inhibition of AGE-induced inflammation include, but are not limited to, blocking the glycation of proteins, blocking AGE interactions with receptors and blocking AGE-induced signaling or signaling-associated inflammatory responses.","At least one activity of some of the compounds of the present invention is to block AGE effects by inhibiting AGE-induced signaling. The sequence of these signaling events leading to inflammation are not clear, but inhibition of these signaling events leads to reduced or no inflammatory results. Compounds that block AGE-induced up-regulation of inflammatory molecules were determined using screening assays. Other aspects of the present invention comprise methods and compositions comprising compounds that block glycated protein-induced inflammation. Some compounds may effect AGE formation or AGE cross-linking.","At least one activity of some of the compounds of the present invention is to block AGE effects by inhibiting reactions with receptors of AGE and such activities are also contemplated by the methods of the present invention for treatment of related pathologies. For example, RAGE, a known receptor for AGE, is a therapeutic target. Blocking RAGE inhibited AGE-induced inflammation. Prior to use of the compounds of the present invention, the multiple functions of RAGE and possible long term side effects of accumulated AGE in plasma, have prevented this method of treatment from being implemented. However, using the methods and compositions of the present invention, more specific inhibitory compounds can be used for treatments and overcome the current problems with treatments that target receptors.","Compounds of the present invention that have at least the activity of modulating inflammation activity are shown in TABLE 5.

There is ample in vivo evidence that suggests that diabetes-related complications can be reduced by 1) preventing glycation of proteins, 2) by breaking the cross-links in glycated proteins or 3) by blocking glycated protein interaction with receptors. Despite the importance of AGE in the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathies, there are no currently available medications known to block AGE formation.","Endothelium is the target organ of damage in diabetes. See Laight et al., 15 DM. R. R274\u201382 (1999); Stehouwer et al., 34 C55\u201368 (1997). Up-regulation of molecules involved in endothelial inflammation, such as IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) leads to endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy. See Stehouwer et al., 34 C55\u201368 (1997); Libby, 247 J. I. M349\u201358 (2000); Van Lente, 293 C. C. A31\u201352 (2000).","IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and atherosclerosis. See Horii et al., 39 KI. S71\u20135 (1993); Huber et al., 19 AT. V. B2364\u201367 (1999); Shikano et al., 85 N81\u20135 (2000); Pickup et al., 8(67) LS291\u2013300 (2000). IL-6 also promotes the growth of renal mesangial cells thus contributing to nephropathy. See Kado et al., 36 A. D67\u201372 (1999). The serum IL-6 level in diabetic subjects was significantly higher than in normal healthy controls (3.48+\/\u22123.29 pg\/ml vs 0.784+\/\u22120.90 pg\/ml, mean+\/\u2212SD). In addition the urinary IL-6 level is a good indicator of diabetic nephropathy. Serum IL-6 is useful in the evaluation of atherosclerosis and nephropathy.","MCP-1, another pro-inflammatory cytokine is found highly expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions and postulated to play a central in monocyte recruitment into the arterial wall and developing lesions. See Libby, 247 J. I. M349\u201358 (2000). Recent results show that MCP-1 is also a key pathogenic molecule in diabetic nephropathy. See Eitner et al., 51 KI69\u201378 (1997); Banba et al. 58 KI684\u201390 (2000). Glycated albumin stimulates endothelial production of IL-6 and MCP-1. The effects of glycated albumin on IL-6 production are comparable to that of TNF\u03b1, a known inducer of IL-6. These cytokines are known to be factors in vascular diseases.","The activity of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting glycated protein- and AGE-induced inflammation can be determined using the assays described herein and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/026,335, which is herein incorporated in its entirety. Such assays comprise measurement of the specific activity of biological components involved in a known cellular response. The assays provide a measurable response in which the activity of the compounds is determined. One assay comprises measurement of the effects of compounds on an inflammatory response by cells to the presence of a stimulating agent. Yet another assay comprises endothelial cells that are stimulated by the addition of a glycated protein, the stimulating agent. The endothelial cells respond by producing specific cytokines. The amount of cytokines produced are determined by measurement protocols known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of the present invention are then added to the assay and the production of cytokines is measured. From the comparison of the assay without the compound with the assay with the compound, the biological effect of the compound can be determined. The compound may have an inhibitory effect, a stimulatory effect, or no effect at all.","The amount and type of cytokine produced can be determined using immunological methods, such as ELISA assays. The methods of the present invention are not limited by the type of assay used to measure the amount of cytokine produced, and any methods known to those skilled in the art and later developed can be used to measure the amount of cytokines produced in response to the stimulating agent and to the compound having unknown activity.","An aspect of the present invention comprises methods and compositions for the treatment of diseases, preconditions or pathologies associated with inflammatory cytokines and other inflammation related molecules including, but not limited to IL-6, VCAM-1, AGE-induced MCP-1, (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), heme oxygenase, insulin-like growth factor, selectins, IP-10, MIG and I-TAC, NF-\u03baB, IL-1\u03b2 (interleukin 1\u03b2), IL-11 (interleukin 11), m-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor), fibrinogen, TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1), adhesion molecules, selectins, VCAM-1 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1), CRP (C-reactive protein), and PAI-1(plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Examples of such diseases include the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the development of diabetic vasculopathy in type II diabetes. For example, affecting the activity or level of TNF\u03b1 is a key mediator of tissue damage following acute or chronic inflammatory reactions. The present invention contemplates providing compositions and methods that modulate the effects of cytokines and inflammatory molecules such as TNF\u03b1, IL-6, VCAM-1, IP-10, MIG, I-TAC and AGE-induced MCP-1, and treat the associated diseases, acute or chronic conditions, preconditions and pathologies.","Assays for determining the activity of compounds capable of modulating inflammation include those taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/026,335 and 09\/969,013, which are both expressly incorporated by reference. In general, once the baseline response to the stimulating agent for the production of cytokines by the endothelial cells is established, thus comprising the control levels for the screening assay, the methods comprise addition of compounds of the present invention. The effect of the compound on the baseline response is determined by comparing the amount of cytokine produced in the presence of the stimulating agent and the amount of cytokine produced in the presence of the stimulating agent and the compound of the present invention. In a preferred method, compounds that have inhibitory effects on the inflammation of the cells in the presence of glycated albumin are then used as therapeutic agents. One or more compounds may be added to the screening assay. Combinations or mixtures of compounds can be added. Different amounts and formulations of the compounds are added to determine the effects on the screening assay. The screening assay may also be used to determine stimulatory compounds or compounds that have no effects in the assay.","The present invention comprises methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of disease, conditions and pathologies associated with inflammation. Such methods comprise administration of compositions comprising compounds capable of modulating the activity of molecules associated with inflammation such as AGE or cytokines or other cellular factors, including release rates or activity, and include compositions comprising compounds disclosed herein with inflammation modulating activity. Administration of such compounds that are effective in modulating inflammation are administered to humans and animals suspected of having or who have inflammatory diseases, for example, diabetic-induced vasculopathies, autoimmune diseases, renal insufficiency, Alzheimer's syndrome, and inflammation-induced diseases such as atherosclerosis.

Cytotoxic Activity","An embodiment of the present invention comprises methods and compositions comprising compounds that have at least the activity of causing cellular death or a cessation of cellular activity, referred to herein as cytotoxic activity. This activity can be used in methods for in vitro or in vivo cytotoxicity. For example, compounds having this activity can be selectively delivered to an area within a living organism to selectively kill cells in that area. Such methods are using in treating hyperproliferative cells, such as cancers, or other unwanted cellular growth or cellular activities. One aspect of the invention provides compositions comprising compounds that nonselectively kill cells. Another aspect of the invention provides compounds that selectively kill cells, for example, cells that have a particular cellular marker or other identifying characteristic such as metabolic rate or uptake of a particular compound, such as sodium, calcium or thymidine.","The present invention also provides compositions for and methods of treatment of biological conditions including, but not limited to, conditions for which cytotoxic activity is a treatment.

The activity of compound provided, with or without other therapeutic agents, helps determine for which application, to treat which disease, the coated medical device is being administered. For example, compound-coated stents can prevent multiple components of neointimal hyperplasia or restenosis as well as reduce inflammation and thrombosis. Local administration of a compound of the present invention and other therapeutic agents to stented coronary arteries may also have additional therapeutic benefit. For example, higher tissue concentrations of the compounds of the present invention and other therapeutic agents may be achieved utilizing local delivery rather than systemic administration. In addition, reduced systemic toxicity may be achieved utilizing local delivery rather than systemic administration while maintaining higher tissue concentrations. In utilizing local delivery from a stent rather than systemic administration, a single procedure may suffice with better patient compliance. An additional benefit of combination therapeutic agent and\/or compound therapy may be to reduce the dose of each of the therapeutic agents, thereby limiting toxicity, while still achieving a reduction in restenosis, inflammation and thrombosis. Local stent-based therapy is therefore a means of improving the therapeutic ratio (efficacy\/toxicity) of anti-restenosis, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic therapeutic agents.","Although exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described with respect to the treatment of restenosis and other related complications, it is important to note that the local delivery of a compound of the present invention, alone or as part of a therapeutic agent combination, may be utilized to treat a wide variety of conditions utilizing any number of medical devices, or to enhance the function and\/or life of the device. For example, intraocular lenses, placed to restore vision after cataract surgery is often compromised by the formation of a secondary cataract. The latter is often a result of cellular overgrowth on the lens surface and can be potentially minimized by combining one or more compounds of the present invention having activity that is effecting in proventing unwanted cellular growth with the device. Other medical devices that often fail due to tissue in-growth or accumulation of proteinaceous material in, on and around the device, such as shunts for hydrocephalus, dialysis grafts, colostomy bag attachment devices, ear drainage tubes, leads for pace makers and implantable defibrillators can also benefit from the combinations of the compounds of the present invention, possibly other pharmaceutical agents, and the devices. Other surgical devices, sutures, staples, anastornosis devices, vertebral disks, bone pins, suture anchors, hemostatic barriers, clamps, screws, plates, clips, vascular implants, tissue adhesives and sealants, tissue scaffolds, various types of dressings, bone substitutes, intraluminal devices, and vascular supports could also provide enhanced patient benefit using this compound-device combination approach. Essentially, any type of medical device may be coated in some fashion with at least one compound of the present invention, alone or as part of a therapeutic agent combination, which enhances treatment over the use of the device or therapeutic agent without combination with the compound.","As disclosed supra, the compounds of the present invention can be administered in combinational therapies with other therapeutic agents, and are not limited to only the other therapeutic agents disclosed herein. Thus, the present invention also contemplates, in addition to various medical devices, the coatings on these devices may be used to deliver a compound of the present invention in combination with other therapeutic agents. This illustrative list of therapeutic agents can be administered through pharmeutical means or in association with medical devices and such therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antiproliferative\/antimitotic agents including natural products such as vinca alkaloids (e.g., vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine), paclitaxel, epidipodophyllotoxins (e.g., etoposide, teniposide), antibiotics (dactinomycin (actinomycin D) daunorubicin, doxorubicin and idarubicin), anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, bleomycins, plicamycin (mithramycin) and mitomycin, enzymes (L-asparaginase which systemically metabolizes L-asparagine and deprives cells which do not have the capacity to synthesize their own asparagine); antiplatelet agents such as G(GP) IIb\/IIa inhibitors and vitronectin receptor antagonists; antiproliferative\/antimitotic alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustards (mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide and analogs, melphalan, chlorambucil), ethylenimines and methylmelamines (hexamethylmelamine and thiotepa), alkyl sulfonates-busulfan, nirtosoureas (carmustine (BCNIU) and analogs, streptozocin), trazenes-dacarbazinine (DTIC); antiproliferative\/antimitotic antimetabolites such as folic acid analogs (methotrexate), pyrimidine analogs (fluorouracil, floxuridine, and cytarabine), purine analogs and related inhibitors (mercaptopurine, thioguanine, pentostatin and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine)); platinum coordination complexes (cisplatin, carboplatin), procarbazine, hydroxyurea, mitotane, aminoglutethimide; hormones (e.g. estrogen); anticoagulants (heparin, synthetic heparin salts and other inhibitors of thrombin); fibrinolytic agents (such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase and urokinase), aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, abciximab; antimigratory; antisecretory (breveldin); anti-inflammatory agents such as adrenocortical steroids (cortisol, cortisone, fludrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, 6\u03b1-methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone, and dexamethasone), non-steroidal agents (salicylic acid derivatives, i.e., aspirin; para-aminophenol derivatives, i.e., acetominophen; indole and indene acetic acids (indomethacin, sulindac, and etodalac), heteroaryl acetic acids (tolmetin, diclofenac, and ketorolac), arylpropionic acids (ibuprofen and derivatives), anthranilic acids (mefenamic acid, and meclofenamic acid), enolic acids (piroxicam, tenoxicam, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenthatrazone), nabumetone, gold compounds (auranofin, aurothioglucose, gold sodium thiomalate); immunosuppressives. (Cyclosporine, tacrolimus (FK-506), sirolimus (rapamycin), azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil); angiogenic agents: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF); angiotensin receptor blockers; nitric oxide donors; anti-sense oligionucleotides and combinations thereof; cell cycle inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and growth factor signal transduction kinase inhibitors.","Although any number of stents may be utilized in accordance with the present invention, for simplicity, a limited number of stents will be described in exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The skilled artisan will recognize that any number of stents may be utilized in connection with the present invention. In addition, as stated above, other medical devices may be utilized. For example, though stents are described, sleeves outside the vessels are also contemplated, as are other medical devices that can provide a substrate for administration for at least one of the compounds of the present invention.","A stent is commonly used as a tubular structure left inside the lumen of a duct to relieve an obstruction. Typically, stents are inserted into the lumen in a non-expanded form and are then expanded autonomously, or with the aid of a second device in situ. A common method of expansion occurs through the use of a catheter-mounted, angioplasty balloon that is inflated within the stenosed vessel or body passageway in order to shear and disrupt the obstructions associated with the wall components of the vessel and to obtain an enlarged lumen.","A stent may resemble an expandable cylinder and may comprise a fenestrated structure for placement in a blood vessel, duct or lumen to hold the vessel, duct or lumen open, more particularly for protecting a segment of artery from restenosis after angioplasty. The stent may be expanded circumferentially and maintained in an expanded configuration that is circumferentially or radially rigid. The stent may be axially flexible and when flexed at a band, for example, the stent avoids any externally protruding component parts.","The stent may be fabricated utilizing any number of methods. For example, the stent may be fabricated from a hollow or formed stainless steel tube that may be machined using lasers, electric discharge milling, chemical etching or other means. The stent is inserted into the body and placed at the desired site in an unexpanded form. In one embodiment, expansion may be effected in a blood vessel by a balloon catheter, where the final diameter of the stent is a function of the diameter of the balloon catheter used. It should be appreciated that a stent in accordance with the present invention may be embodied in a shape-memory material including, for example, an appropriate alloy of nickel and titanium or stainless steel.","Structures formed from stainless steel may be made self-expanding by configuring the stainless steel in a predetermined manner, for example, by twisting it into a braided configuration. In this embodiment, after the stent has been formed it may be compressed so as to occupy a space sufficiently small as to permit its insertion in a blood vessel or other tissue by insertion means, wherein the insertion means include a suitable catheter, or flexible rod. Upon emerging from the catheter, the stent may be configured to expand into the desired configuration where the expansion is automatic or triggered by a change in pressure, temperature or electrical stimulation.","Furthermore, a stent may be modified to comprise one or more reservoirs. Each of the reservoirs may be opened or closed as desired. These reservoirs may be specifically designed to hold the the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination to be delivered. Regardless of the design of the stent, it is preferable to have the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination dosage applied with enough specificity and a sufficient concentration to provide an effective dosage in the affected area. In this regard, the reservoir size in the bands is preferably sized to adequately apply the the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination dosage at the desired location and in the desired amount.","In an alternative embodiment, the entire inner and outer surface of the stent may be coated with the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination in therapeutic dosage amounts. The coating techniques may vary depending on the the compound or compound\/therapeutic agent combination. Also, the coating techniques may vary depending on the material comprising the stent or other intraluminal medical device.","One or more compounds of the present invention and, in some instances, other therapeutic agents as a combination, may be incorporated onto or affixed to the stent in a number of ways. In one embodiment, the compound is directly incorporated into a polymeric matrix and sprayed onto the outer surface of the stent. The compound elutes from the polymeric matrix over time and enters the surrounding tissue. The compound preferably remains on the stent for at least three days up to approximately six months, and more preferably between seven and thirty days.","Any number of non-erodible polymers may be utilized in conjunction with the compound, and such polyermic compositions are well known in the art. In one embodiment, the polymeric matrix comprises two layers. The base layer comprises a solution of poly(ethylene-covinylacetate) and polybutylmethacryiate. The compound is incorporated into this base layer. The outer layer comprises only polybutylmethacrylate and acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the compound from eluting too quickly. The thickness of the outer layer or topcoat determines the rate at which the compound elutes from the matrix. Essentially, the compound elutes from the matrix by diffusion through the polymer matrix. Polymers are permeable, thereby allowing solids, liquids and gases to escape therefrom. The total thickness of the polymeric matrix is in the range from about one micron to about twenty microns or greater. It is important to note that primer layers and metal surface treatments may be utilized before the polymeric matrix is affixed to the medical device. For example, acid cleaning, alkaline (base) cleaning, salinization and parylene deposition may be used as part of the overall process described above.","The poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate), polybutylmethacrylate and compound solution may be incorporated into or onto the stent in a number of ways. For example, the solution may be sprayed onto the stent or the stent may be dipped into the solution. Other methods include spin coating and plasma polymerization. In one embodiment, the solution is sprayed onto the stent and then allowed to dry. In another embodiment, the solution may be electrically charged to one polarity and the stent electrically charged to the opposite polarity. In this manner, the solution and stent will be attracted to one another. In using this type of spraying process, waste may be reduced and more precise control over the thickness of the coat may be achieved.","Drug-coated stents are manufactured by a number of companies including Johnson & Johnson, Inc. (New Brunswick, N.J.), Guidant Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.), Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, Minn.), Cook Group Incorporated (Bloomington, Ind.), Abbott Labs., Inc. (Abbott Park, Ill.), and Boston Scientific Corp. (Natick, Mass.). See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,273, 913; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 20020051730; WO 02\/26271; and WO 02\/26139, each expressly entirely incorporated herein by reference.","Expression Profiles and Microarray Methods of Use","Other aspects of the present invention comprise compositions and methods for microarray devices. Such microarray devices and methods comprise a variety of microarrays that may be used, for example, to study and monitor gene expression in response to treatment with the compounds of the present invention. The microarrays may comprise nucleic acid sequences, carbohydrates or proteins that are determinative for specific cells, tissues, species, disease states, prognoses, disease progression, or any other combination of molecules that can be used to determine an effect of one or more of the compounds of the present invention","For example, the microarrays of the present invention may be derived from, or representative of, for example, a specific organism or cell type, including human microarrays, vascular microarrays, inflammation microarrays, cancer microarrays, apoptosis microarrays, oncogene and tumor suppressor microarrays, cell-cell interaction microarrays, cytokine and cytokine receptor microarrays, blood microarrays, cell cycle microarrays, neuroarrays, mouse microarrays, and rat microarrays, or combinations thereof. In further embodiments, the microarrays may represent diseases including cardiovascular diseases, vasculopathic conditions, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurological diseases, immunological diseases, various cancers, infectious diseases, endocrine disorders, and genetic diseases.","Alternatively, the microarrays useful in assessing the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention may represent a particular tissue type including, but not limited to, heart, liver, prostate, lung, nerve, muscle, or connective tissue; preferably coronary artery endothelium, umbilical artery endothelium, umbilical vein endothelium, aortic endothelium, dermal microvascular endothelium, pulmonary artery endothelium, myometrium microvascular endothelium, keratinocyte epithelium, bronchial epithelium, mammary epithelium, prostate epithelium, renal cortical epithelium, renal proximal tubule epithelium, small airway epithelium, renal epithelium, umbilical artery smooth muscle, neonatal dermal fibroblast, pulmonary artery smooth muscle, dermal fibroblast, neural progenitor cells, skeletal muscle, astrocytes, aortic smooth muscle, mesangial cells, coronary artery smooth muscle, bronchial smooth muscle, uterine smooth muscle, lung fibroblast, osteoblasts, prostate stromal cells, or combinations thereof.","The present invention further contemplates microarrays comprising a gene expression profile comprising one or more polynucleotide sequences including complementary and homologous sequences, wherein said gene expression profile is generated from a cell type treated with a compound of the present invention and is selected from the group comprising coronary artery endothelium, umbilical artery endothelium, umbilical vein endothelium, aortic endothelium, dermal microvascular endothelium, pulmonary artery endothelium, myometrium microvascular endothelium, keratinocyte epithelium, bronchial epithelium, mammary epithelium, prostate epithelium, renal cortical epithelium, renal proximal tubule epithelium, small airway epithelium, renal epithelium, umbilical artery smooth muscle, neonatal dermal fibroblast, pulmonary artery smooth muscle, dermal fibroblast, neural progenitor cells, skeletal muscle, astrocytes, aortic smooth muscle, mesangial cells, coronary artery smooth muscle, bronchial smooth muscle, uterine smooth muscle, lung fibroblast, osteoblasts, and prostate stromal cells.","The present invention contemplates microarrays comprising one or more protein-binding agents, wherein a protein expression profile is generated from a cell type treated with a compound of the present invention and is selected from the group comprising coronary artery endothelium, umbilical artery endothelium, umbilical vein endothelium, aortic endothelium, dermal microvascular endothelium, pulmonary artery endothelium, myometrium microvascular endothelium, keratinocyte epithelium, bronchial epithelium, mammary epithelium, prostate epithelium, renal cortical epithelium, renal proximal tubule epithelium, small airway epithelium, renal epithelium, umbilical artery smooth muscle, neonatal dermal fibroblast, pulmonary artery smooth muscle, dermal fibroblast, neural progenitor cells, skeletal muscle, astrocytes, aortic smooth muscle, mesangial cells, coronary artery smooth muscle, bronchial smooth muscle, uterine smooth muscle, lung fibroblast, osteoblasts, and prostate stromal cells.","More specifically, the present invention contemplates methods for the reproducible measurement and assessment of the expression of specific mRNAs or proteins in, for example, a specific set of cells. One method combines and utilizes the techniques of laser capture microdissection, T7-based RNA amplification, production of cDNA from amplified RNA, and DNA microarrays containing immobilized DNA molecules for a wide variety of specific genes, including HSPGs such as perlecan, to produce a profile of gene expression analysis for very small numbers of specific cells. The desired cells are individually identified and attached to a substrate by the laser capture technique, and the captured cells are then separated from the remaining cells. RNA is then extracted from the captured cells and amplified about one million-fold using the T7-based amplification technique, and cDNA may be prepared from the amplified RNA. A wide variety of specific DNA molecules are prepared that hybridize with specific polynucleotides of the microarray, and the DNA molecules are immobilized on a suitable substrate. The cDNA made from the captured cells is applied to the microarray under conditions that allow hybridization of the cDNA to the immobilized DNA on the microarray. The expression profile of the captured cells is obtained from the analysis of the hybridization results using the amplified RNA or cDNA made from the amplified RNA of the captured cells, and the specific immobilized DNA molecules on the microarray. The hybridization results demonstrate, for example, which genes of those represented on the microarray as probes are hybridized to cDNA from the captured cells, and\/or the amount of specific gene expression. The hybridization results represent the gene expression profile of the captured cells. The gene expression profile of the captured cells can be used to compare the gene expression profile of a different set of captured cells. For example, gene expression profiles may be generated from cells treated (and not treated) with a compound of the present invention. The similarities and differences provide useful information for determining the differences between the same cell type under different conditions, more specifically, the change in gene expression in response to treatment with a compound of the present invention.","The techniques used for gene expression analysis are likewise applicable in the context of protein expression profiles. Total protein may be isolated from a cell sample and hybridized to a microarray comprising a plurality of protein-binding agents, which may include antibodies, receptor proteins, small molecules, and the like. Using any of several assays known in the art, hybridization may be detected and analyzed as described above. In the case of fluorescent detection, algorithms may be used to extract a protein expression profile representative of the particular cell type. In this regard, the change in protein expression in response to treatment of cells with a compound of the present invention may be evaluated.","Thus, in one aspect, the present invention comprises at least one microarray corresponding to a population of genes isolated from a particular tissue or cell type in methods that is used to detect changes in gene transcription levels that result from exposing the selected tissue or cells to at least one compound of the present invention. In this embodiment, a biological sample derived from an organism, or an established cell line, may be exposed to at least one compound of the present invention in vivo or ex vivo. Thereafter, the gene transcripts, primarily mRNA, of the tissue or cells are isolated by methods well-known in the art. S., MC: A L. M(2001). The isolated transcripts are then contacted with a microarray under conditions where the transcripts hybridize with a corresponding probe to form hybridization pairs. Thus, the microarray provides a model of the transcriptional responsiveness following exposure to at least one compound of the present invention. Such information can be used to determine therapeutic candidates. A hybridization signal may then be detected at each hybridization pair to obtain a gene expression profile.","Gene and\/or protein expression profiles and microarrays may also be used to identify activating or non-activating compounds of a particular gene such as perlecan or other HSPG. Compounds that increase transcription rates or stimulate, maintain, or stabilize the activity of a protein are considered activating, and compounds that decrease rates or inhibit the activity of a protein are non-activating. Moreover, the biological effects of a compound may be reflected in the biological state of a cell. This state is characterized by the cellular constituents. One aspect of the biological state of a cell is its transcriptional state. The transcriptional state of a cell includes the identities and amounts of the constituent RNA species, especially mRNAs, in the cell under a given set of conditions. Thus, the gene expression profiles, microarrays, and algorithms discussed herein may be used to analyze and characterize the transcriptional state of a given cell or tissue following exposure to an activating or non-activating compound, specifically, a compound of the present invention.","Microarray techniques and methods for analyzing results are well known in the art.

For example, methods for providing diagnostics and predictors relating to biomolecules including HSPGS, particularly, perlecan, are contemplated by the present invention. Also within the scope of this invention are methods providing diagnostics and predictors relating to the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention. The present invention further contemplates methods of providing expression profile databases, and methods for producing such databases, for normal and diseased tissues.","The expression profile database may be an internal database designed to include annotation information about the expression profiles generated to assess the effect of the compounds of the present invention and through other sources and methods. Such information may include, for example, the databases in which a given biomolecule was found, patient information associated with the expression profile, including age, cancer or tumor type or progression, information related to a compound of the present invention such as dosage and administration information, descriptive information about related cDNAs associated with the sequence, tissue or cell source, sequence data obtained from external sources, expression profiles for a given gene and the related disease state or course of disease, for example whether the expression profile relates to or signifies a particular disease state, and preparation methods. The expression profiles may be based on protein and\/or polynucleotide microarray data obtained from publicly available or proprietary sources. The database may be divided into two sections: one for storing the sequences and related expression profiles and the other for storing the associated information. This database may be maintained as a private database with a firewall within the central computer facility. However, this invention is not so limited and the expression profile database may be made available to the public.","The database may be a network system connecting the network server with clients. The network may be any one of a number of conventional network systems, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), as is known in the art (e.g., Ethernet). The server may include software to access database information for processing user requests, and to provide an interface for serving information to client machines. The server may support the World Wide Web and maintain a website and Web browser for client use. Client\/server environments, database servers, and networks are well documented in the technical, trade, and patent literature.","Through the Web browser, clients may construct search requests for retrieving data from, for example, a microarray database and an expression profile database. For example, the user may \u201cpoint and click\u201d to user interface elements such as buttons, pull down menus, and scroll bars. The client requests may be transmitted to a Web application that formats them to produce a query that may be used to gather information from the system database, based, for example, on microarray or expression data obtained by the client, and\/or other phenotypic or genotypic information. Specifically, the client may submit expression data based on microarray expression profiles obtained from a patient treated with a compound of the present invention and use the system to obtain a diagnosis based on that information based on a comparison by the system of the client expression data with the expression data contained in the database. By way of example, the system compares the expression profiles submitted by the client with expression profiles contained in the database and then provides the client with diagnostic information based on the best match of the client expression profiles with the database profiles. Thus, in one aspect, the comparison of expression profiles aids the clinician in determining the effectiveness of treatment with a compound of the present invention. Based on such a comparison, the clinician may alter or adjust the treatment regimen.","In addition, the website may provide hypertext links to public databases such as GenBank and associated databases maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), part of the National Library of Medicine as well as, any links providing relevant information for gene expression analysis, genetic disorders, scientific literature, and the like.

A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition.","Optimal precision in achieving concentrations of drug within the range that yields maximum efficacy with minimal toxicity may require a regimen based on the kinetics of the compound's availability to one or more target sites. Distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of a drug may be considered when determining the optimal concentration for a treatment regimen. The dosages of a compound disclosed herein may be adjusted when combined to achieve desired effects. On the other hand, dosages of these various therapeutic agents may be independently optimized and combined to achieve a synergistic result wherein the pathology is reduced more than it would be if either agent were used alone.","In particular, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of a compound disclosed herein may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the therapeutic index and it may be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. Compounds exhibiting large therapeutic indices are preferred except when cytotoxicity of the compound is the activity or therapeutic outcome that is desired. Although compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, a delivery system can target such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. Generally, the compounds of the present invention may be administered in a manner that maximizes efficacy and minimizes toxicity.","Data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosages of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose may be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information may be used to accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","Moreover, the dosage administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be optimized using a pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic modeling system. For example, one or more dosage regimens may be chosen and a pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic model may be used to determine the pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic profile of one or more dosage regimens. Next, one of the dosage regimens for administration may be selected which achieves the desired pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic response based on the particular pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic profile. See WO 00\/67776, which is entirely expressly incorporated herein by reference.","Methods are known in the art for determining effective doses for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes for the disclosed pharmaceutical compositions or the disclosed drug combinations, whether or not formulated in the same composition. For therapeutic purposes, the term \u201cjointly effective amount,\u201d as used herein, means that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. For prophylactic purposes (i.e., inhibiting the onset or progression of a disorder), the term \u201cjointly effective amount\u201d refers to that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that inhibits in a subject the onset or progression of a disorder as being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. Thus, the present invention provides combinations of two or more therapeutic agents wherein, for example, (a) each therapeutic agent is administered in an independently therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount; (b) at least one therapeutic agent in the combination is administered in an amount that is sub-therapeutic or subprophylactic if administered alone, but is therapeutic or prophylactic when administered in combination with the second or additional therapeutic agents according to the invention; or (c) both therapeutic agents are administered in an amount that is subtherapeutic or sub-prophylactic if administered alone, but are therapeutic or prophylactic when administered together. Combinations of three or more therapeutic agents are analogously possible. Methods of combination therapy include coadministration of a single formulation containing all active agents; essentially contemporaneous administration of more than one formulation; and administration of two or more active agents separately formulated.","Dosages","More specifically, the pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. In the case of oral administration, the daily dosage of the compositions may be varied over a wide range from about 0.0001 to about 1,000 mg per patient, per day. The range may more particularly be from about 0.001 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of body weight per day, about 0.1\u2013100 mg, about 1.0\u201350 mg or about 1.0\u201320 mg per day for adults (at about 60 kg).","The daily dosage of the pharmaceutical compositions may be varied over a wide range from about 0.01 to about 1000 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound or 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 800, 900, or 1000 milligrams of the active compound for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg of body weight per day. In one embodiment, the range is from about 0.2 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg of body weight per day. In another embodiment, the range is from about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg of body weight per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of about 1 to about 10 times per day.","In the case of injections, it is usually convenient to give by an intravenous route in an amount of about 0.01\u201330 mg, about 0.1\u201320 mg or about 0.1\u201310 mg per day to adults (at about 60 kg). In the case of other animals, the dose calculated for 60 kg may be administered as well.","Doses of a compound of the present invention can optionally include 0.0001 to 1,000 mg\/kg\/administration, or 0.001 to 100.0 mg\/kg\/administration, from 0.01 to 10 mg\/kg\/administration, from 0.1 to 10 mg\/kg\/administration, including 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 and\/or 100\u2013500 mg\/kg\/administration or any range, value or fraction thereof, or to achieve a serum concentration of 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.9, 2.0, 2.5, 2.9, 3.0, 3.5, 3.9, 4.0, 4.5, 4.9, 5.0, 5.5, 5.9, 6.0, 6.5, 6.9, 7.0, 7.5, 7.9, 8.0, 8.5, 8.9, 9.0, 9.5, 9.9, 10, 10.5, 10.9, 11, 11.5, 11.9, 20, 12.5, 12.9, 13.0, 13.5, 13.9, 14.0, 14.5, 4.9, 5.0, 5.5., 5.9, 6.0, 6.5, 6.9, 7.0, 7.5, 7.9, 8.0, 8.5, 8.9, 9.0, 9.5, 9.9, 10, 10.5, 10.9, 11, 11.5, 11.9, 12, 12.5, 12.9, 13.0, 13.5, 13.9, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5, 15.9, 16, 16.5, 16.9, 17, 17.5, 17.9, 18, 18.5, 18.9, 19, 19.5, 19.9, 20, 20.5, 20.9, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 96, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, and\/or 5000 \u03bcg\/ml serum concentration per single or multiple administration or any range, value or fraction thereof.","As a non-limiting example, treatment of humans or animals can be provided as a one-time or periodic dosage of a compound of the present invention 0.1 to 100 mg\/kg such as 0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 mg\/kg, per day, on at least one of day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40, or alternatively or additionally, at least one of week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, or 52, or alternatively or additionally, at least one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 years, or any combination thereof, using single, infusion or repeated doses.","Specifically, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered at least once a week over the course of several weeks.

Thus, this term includes, but is not limited to, single-stranded, double-stranded, or multi-stranded DNA or RNA. Polynucleotides may further comprise genomic DNA, cDNA, or DNA-RNA hybrids. Moreover, the polynucleotides of the present invention may be synthetically produced.","Polynucleotides may comprise chemically modified, biochemically modified, or derivatized nucleotides. For example, a polynucleotide may comprise, in part, modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides or micleotide analogs. In other embodiments, polynucleotides may comprise sugars, caps, nucleotide branches, and linking groups such as fluororibose and thioate. In addition, the sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. Furthermore, a polynucleotide may be modified after polymerization to facilitate its attachment to other polynucleotides, proteins, metal ions, labeling components, or a solid support.","The backbone of the polynucleotide may comprise modified or substituted sugar and\/or phosphate groups. Alternatively, the backbone of the polynucleotide may comprise a polymer of synthetic subunits such as phosphoramidites and thus may be an oligodeoxynucleoside phosphoramidate or a mixed phosphoramidate-phosphodiester oligomer.

(1996) 24:2318\u20132323.","The term \u201chomology\u201d, as used herein, refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits an identical sequence from hybridizing to a target polynucleotide; it is referred to using the functional term \u201csubstantially homologous.\u201d The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous sequence or probe to the target sequence under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target sequence which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding, the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target sequence.","The term \u201cgene\u201d refers to a polynucleotide sequence that comprises coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide or precursor, and may also include expression control sequences or other control or regulatory sequences.

The gene may be derived in whole or in part from any source known to those of ordinary skill in the art including a plant, a fungus, an animal, a bacterial genome or episome, eukaryotic, nuclear or plasmid DNA, cDNA, viral DNA, or chemically synthesized DNA. A gene may constitute an uninterrupted coding sequence or it may include one or more introns, bound by the appropriate splice junctions. Moreover, a gene may contain one or more modifications in either the coding or the untranslated regions that could affect certain properties of the polynucleotide or polypeptide, such as the biological activity or the chemical structure of the expression product, the rate of expression, or the manner of expression control. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, mutations, insertions, deletions, and substitutions of one or more nucleotides. In this regard, such modified genes may be referred to as variants of the native gene.","\u201cGene expression\u201d refers to the process by which a polynucleotide sequence undergoes successful transcription and translation such that detectable levels of the nucleotide sequence are expressed as proteins or the polynucleotide sequence undergoes transcription , if RNA is copied from DNA, or replication if DNA is copied from DNA, such that the resulting nucleotide copies are detectable.","The term \u201cgene expression profile\u201d refers to a group of genes representing a particular cell or tissue type (e.g., neuron, coronary artery endothelium, or disease tissue) in any activation state. In one aspect, a gene expression profile is generated from cells exposed to a compound of the present invention. This profile may be compared to a gene expression profile generated from the same type of cell or tissue type prior to treatment with a compound of the present invention. Furthermore, a series of gene expression profiles may be generated from cells or tissues treated with a compound of the present invention, specifically, at different doses or a time-course to assess the effects of the compound. A gene expression profile is also known as a gene expression signature.","The term \u201cdifferential expressioN\u201d refers to both quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the temporal and tissue expression patterns of a gene. For example, a differentially expressed gene may have its expression activated or completely inactivated in normal versus disease conditions. Such a qualitatively regulated gene may exhibit an expression pattern within a given tissue or cell type that is detectable in either control or disease conditions, but is not detectable in both. \u201cDifferentially expressed polynucleotide,\u201d as used herein, refers to a polynucleotide sequence that uniquely identifies a differentially expressed gene so that detection of the differentially expressed polynucleotide in a sample is correlated with the presence of a differentially expressed gene in a sample.","Similarly, a differentially expressed protein may have its expression activated or completely inactivated in normal versus disease conditions. Such a qualitatively regulated protein may exhibit an expression pattern within a given tissue or cell type that is detectable in either control or disease conditions, but is not detectable in both. A \u201cdifferentially expressed protein,\u201d as used herein, refers to an amino acid sequence that uniquely identifies a differentially expressed protein so that detection of the differentially expressed protein in a sample is correlated with the presence of a differentially expressed protein in a sample.","\u201cCell type,\u201d as used herein, refers to a cell from a given source (e.g., tissue or organ), a cell in a given state of differentiation, or a cell associated with a given pathology or genetic makeup.","The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which may include translated, untranslated, chemically modified, biochemically modified, and derivatized amino acids. A polypeptide may be naturally occurring, recombinant, or synthetic, or any combination of these. Moreover, the term \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d as used herein, refers to proteins, polypeptides, and peptides of any size, structure, or function. For example, a polypeptide may comprise a string of amino acids held together by peptide bonds. A polypeptide may alternatively comprise a long chain of amino acids held together by peptide bonds. Moreover, a polypeptide may also comprise a fragment of a naturally occurring protein or peptide. A polypeptide may be a single molecule or may be a multi-molecular complex.

As used herein, the term \u201cimmunological binding properties\u201d refers to non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific. Indeed, a functional equivalent of a monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin, for example, may inhibit the binding of the parent monoclonal antibody to its antigen. A functional equivalent may comprise F(ab\u2032)fragments, F(ab) molecules, Fv fragments, single chain fragment variable displayed on phage (scFv), single domain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, or the like so long as the immunoglobulin exhibits the characteristics of the parent immunoglobulin.","As used herein, the term \u201cisolated\u201d refers to a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, an antibody, or a host cell that is in an environment different from that in which the polynucleotide, the polypeptide, the antibody, or the host cell naturally occurs. An isolated polynucleotide, polypeptide, antibody, or host cell is generally substantially purified.","As used herein, the term \u201csubstantially purified\u201d refers to a compound that is removed from its natural environment and is at least about 60% to 99.9% free from other components, or is at least about 60% free, at least about 65% free, at least about 70% free, at least about 75% free, at least about 80% free, at least about 83% free, at least about 85% free, at least about 88% free, at least about 90% free, at least about 91% free, at least about 92% free, at least about 93% free, at least about 94% free, at least about 95% free, at least about 96% free, at least about 97% free, at least about 98% free, at least about 99% free, at least about 99.9% free, or at least about 99.99% free from other components with which it is naturally associated.

Liposome formulations, loading of liposomes and administration and delivery of liposomes are known in the art.","\u201cHybridization,\u201d broadly defined, refers to any process by which a polynucleotide sequence binds to a complementary sequence through base pairing. Hybridization conditions can be defined by, for example, the concentrations of salt or formamide in the prehybridization and hybridization solutions, or by the hybridization temperature, and are well known in the art. Hybridization can occur under conditions of various stringency. Hybridization may also refer to the binding of a protein-capture agent to a target protein under certain conditions, such as normal physiological conditions.","As understood herein, the term \u201cactivation\u201d refers to any alteration of a signaling pathway or biological response including, for example, increases above basal levels, restoration to basal levels from an inhibited state, and stimulation of the pathway above basal levels.","The term \u201cbiological activity\u201d refers to the biological behavior and effects of a protein or peptide. The biological activity of a protein may be affected at the cellular level and the molecular level. For example, an antisense oligonucleotide may prevent translation of a particular mRNA, thereby inhibiting the biological activity of the protein encoded by the mRNA. In addition, an antibody may bind to a particular protein and inhibit that protein's biological activity.","The term \u201coligonucleotide\u201d as used herein refers to a polynucleotide sequence comprising, for example, from about 4 nucleotides (nt) to about 1000 nt. Oligonucleotides for use in the present invention are preferably from about 15 nt to about 150 nt, more preferably from about 150 nt to about 1000 nt in length. The oligonucleotide may be a naturally occurring oligonucleotide or a synthetic oligonucleotide. Oligonucleotides may be prepared by the phosphoramidite method (Beaucage and Carruthers, TL. (1981) 22:1859\u20131862), or by the triester method (Matteucci et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1981) 103:3185), or by other chemical methods known in the art.","The term \u201cmicroarray\u201d refers generally to the type of genes or proteins represented on a microarray by oligonucleotides (polynucleotide sequences) or protein-binding agents, and where the type of genes or proteins represented on the microarray is dependent on the intended purpose of the microarray (e.g., to monitor expression of human genes or proteins). The oligonucleotides or protein-binding agents on a given microarray may correspond to the same type, category, or group of genes or proteins. Genes or proteins may be considered to be of the same type if they share some common characteristics such as species of origin (e.g., human, mouse, rat); disease state (e.g., cancer); function (e.g., protein kinases, tumor suppressors); same biological process (e.g., apoptosis, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, proliferation, differentiation). For example, one microarray type may be a \u201ccancer microarray\u201d in which each of the microarray oligonucleotides or protein-binding agents correspond to a gene or protein associated with a cancer. An \u201cepithelial microarray\u201d may be a microarray of oligonucleotides or protein-binding agents corresponding to unique epithelial genes or proteins. Similarly, a \u201ccell cycle microarray\u201d may be an microarray type in which the oligonucleotides or protein-binding agents correspond to unique genes or proteins associated with the cell cycle.","The term \u201cdetectable\u201d, one in sense, refers to a polynucleotide expression pattern which is detectable via the standard techniques of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (RT-PCR), differential display, and Northern analyses, which are well known to those of skill in the art. Similarly, polypeptide expression patterns may be \u201cdetected\u201d via standard techniques including immunoassays such as Western blots. In general, the term \u201cdetectable is used when a result of an action, such as addition of a compound in an assay step, is observable, particularly by physical means, such as a color change.","A \u201ctarget gene\u201d refers to a polynucleotide, often derived from a biological sample, to which an oligonucleotide probe is designed to specifically hybridize. It is either the presence or absence of the target polynucleotide that is to be detected, or the amount of the target polynucleotide that is to be quantified. The target polynucleotide has a sequence that is complementary to the polynucleotide sequence of the corresponding probe directed to the target. The target polynucleotide may also refer to the specific subsequence of a larger polynucleotide to which the probe is directed or to the overall sequence (e.g., gene or mRNA) whose expression level it is desired to detect.","A \u201ctarget proteiN\u201d refers to an polypeptide, often derived from a biological sample, to which a protein-capture agent specifically hybridizes or binds. It is either the presence or absence of the target protein that is to be detected, or the amount of the target protein that is to be quantified. The target protein has a structure that is recognized by the corresponding protein-capture agent directed to the target. The target protein or amino acid may also refer to the specific substructure of a larger protein to which the protein-capture agent is directed or to the overall structure (e.g., gene or mRNA) whose expression level it is desired to detect.","The term \u201ccomplementary\u201d refers to the topological compatibility or matching together of the interacting surfaces of a probe molecule and its target. The target and its probe can be described as complementary, and furthermore, the contact surface characteristics are complementary to each other. Hybridization or base pairing between nucleotides or nucleic acids, such as, for example, between the two strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule or between an oligonucleotide probe and a target are complementary.","The term \u201cbackground\u201d refers to non-specific binding or other interactions between, for example, polynucleotides, polypeptides, small molecules and polypeptides, or small molecules and polynucleotides. \u201cBackground\u201d may also refer to the non-specific binding or other interactions in the context of assays including immunoassays.","In the context of microarrays, the term \u201cbackground\u201d refers to hybridization signals resulting from non-specific binding, or other interactions, between the labeled target polynucleotides and components of the oligonucleotide microarray (e.g., the oligonucleotide probes, control probes, the microarray support) or between target proteins and the protein-binding agents of a protein microarray. Background signals may also be produced by intrinsic fluorescence of the microarray components themselves. A single background signal may be calculated for the entire microarray, or a different background signal may be calculated for each target polynucleotide or target protein. The background may be calculated as the average hybridization signal intensity, or where a different background signal is calculated for each target gene or target protein. Alternatively, background may be calculated as the average hybridization signal intensity produced by hybridization to probes that are not complementary to any sequence found in the sample (e.g., probes directed to polynucleotides of the opposite sense or to genes not found in the sample such as bacterial genes where the sample is mammalian polynucleotides). The background can also be calculated as the average signal intensity produced by regions of the microarray which lack any probes or protein-binding agents at all.","A \u201csmall molecule\u201d comprises a compound or molecular complex, either synthetic, naturally derived, or partially synthetic, composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, which may also contain other elements, and which may have a molecular weight of less than about 100 to about 15,000 Daltons, or less than about 15,000, less than about 14,000, less than about 13,000, less than about 12,000, less than about 11,000, less than about 10,000, less than about 9,000, less than about 8,000, less than about 7,000, less than about 6,000, less than about 5,000, less than about 4,000, less than about 3,000, less than about 2,000, less than about 1,000, less than about 900, less than about 800, less than about 700, less than about 600, less than about 500, less than about 400, less than about 300, less than about 200, or less than about 100.","The term \u201cfusion proteiN\u201d refers to a protein composed of two or more polypeptides that, although typically not joined in their native state, are joined by their respective amino and carboxyl termini through a peptide linkage to form a single continuous polypeptide. It is understood that the two or more polypeptide components can either be directly joined or indirectly joined through a peptide linker\/spacer.","The term \u201cnormal physiological conditions\u201d means conditions that are typical inside a living organism or a cell. Although some organs or organisms provide extreme conditions, the intra-organismal and intra-cellular environment normally varies around pH 7 (i.e., from pH 6.5 to pH 7.5), contains water as the predominant solvent, and exists at a temperature above 0\u00b0 C. and below 50\u00b0 C. The concentration of various salts depends on the organ, organism, cell, or cellular compartment used as a reference.","The term \u201ccluster\u201d refers to a group of clones or biomolecular sequences related to one another by sequence homology. In one example, clusters are formed based upon a specified degree of homology and\/or overlap (e.g., stringency). \u201cClustering\u201d may be performed with the sequence data. For instance, a biomolecular sequence thought to be associated with a particular molecular or biological activity in one tissue might be compared against another library or database of sequences. This type of search is useful to look for homologous, and presumably functionally related, sequences in other tissues or samples, and may be used to streamline the methods of the present invention in that clustering may be used within one or more of the databases to cluster biomolecular sequences prior to performing a method of the invention. The sequences showing sufficient homology with the representative sequence are considered part of a \u201ccluster.\u201d Such \u201csufficient\u201d homology may vary within the needs of one skilled in the art.","As used herein, the term \u201cinternal database\u201d refers to a database maintained within a local computer network. It contains, for example, biomolecular sequences associated with a project. It may also contain information associated with sequences including, but not limited to, a library in which a given sequence is found and descriptive information about a likely gene associated with the sequence. The internal database may typically be maintained as a private database behind a firewall within an enterprise network. However, the invention is not limited to only this embodiment and an internal database could be made available to the public. The internal database may include sequence data generated by the same enterprise that maintains the database, and may also include sequence data obtained from external sources.","The term \u201cexternal database,\u201d as understood herein, refers to a database located outside all internal databases. Typically, an enterprise network differing from the enterprise network maintaining the internal database will maintain an external database. The external database may be used, for example, to provide some descriptive information on biomolecular sequences stored in the internal database. In one embodiment, the external database is GenBank and associated databases maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), part of the National Library of Medicine.","As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Solid or liquid samples were dissolved in an appropriate NMR solvent (CDClor DMSO-d), placed in a NMR sample tube, and data were collected according to the spectrometer instructional manuals. Most samples were analyzed in Variable Temperature mode, typically at about 55\u00b0 C., though some data for some samples were collected with the probe at ambient temperature. NMR data were processed using NUTS: NMR Utility Transform Software (Lite Version-20011128) by Acorn NMR.","LC-MS. The Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) instrumentation used to examine the compounds of the present invention was typically a quadrupole\/time-of-flight mass spectrometer, with electrospray ionization (ESI).

The changes of heparanase expression determined by densitometric analysis. The induction and measurement of endothelial heparanase protein reported in the Tables herein were carried out according to this Example.","Preparation of Biotinylated HS","Heparan sulfate (HS) was biotinylated using biotin with extended spacer arms using succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (NHS-LC-Biotin) obtained from Pierce. About 0.5 ml HS solution (2 mg\/ml in NaHCO3, pH 8.5) was mixed with 0.05 ml of a freshly prepared solution of NHS-LC-Biotin in dimethyl sulfoxide. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Unconjugated biotin was removed by centrifugation (10,000 RPM) through Microcon-3 filter (Millipore) followed by dilution with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). This procedure was repeated five times to ensure complete removal of free biotin. Unwanted aldehydes in the reaction were then quenched by incubation with one milliliter of Tris-glycine buffer(25 mm\u2013183 mM, pH 8.3) at room temperature for 20 minutes. The mixture was subjected to three rounds of microfiltration as described above. Biotinylated HS (5 mg\/ml in PBS) was aliquoted and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. To obtain maximum biotinylation, a 25-fold molar excess of biotin was used. Using HABA reagent, it was determined that the ratio of HS to biotin was 1:2.","The extent of biotinylation of HS was determined using Avidin-HABA (Pierce Chemical Co). The HABA assay can be used over a wide range of pH and salt concentrations. HABA (4-hydroxyazobenzene-2\u2032-carboxylic acid) is a dye that binds to avidin and can serve as an indicator of unoccupied binding sites. Avidin combines stoichiometrically with biotin, making it possible to use any physiochemical differences between avidin and the avidin-biotin complex as the basis of a qualitative and quantitative assay method for either component.","When HABA binds to avidin, there is a large spectral change in the HABA dye. A new absorption band appears at 500 nm, which is characteristic of the quinoid form of the dye. The avidin-biotin complex does not bind HABA and because the dissociation constant of the complex is so low, the dye is stoichiometrically displaced by biotin. Consequently, the HABA assay can be the basis of both colorimetric and titrimetric assays. The amount of avidin can be calculated directly from the increased absorbance at 500 nm, or the dye may be used as an indicator in a spectrophotometric titration with biotin.","The absorption band that results from the avidin-HABA complex decreases proportionately when biotin is added. Since biotin has such a high affinity for avidin, it displaces the HABA dye. The unknown amount of biotin can be determined by preparing a standard curve using known amounts of biotin to displace the HABA which bound to avidin, and plotting against the absorbance at 500 mu.","HABA solution was prepared by adding 24.2 mg of HABA (Pierce) to 9.9 ml H20, and then adding 0.1 ml 1 M NaOH. Avidin-HABA reagent was prepared by adding 10 mg of avidin and 600 gl of HABA solution to 19.4 ml of phosphate buffered saline. To 1 ml of Avidin-HABA reagent in a cuvette, 100 \u03bcl of biotinylated HS was added, and the optical density was measured at 500 nm in a spectrophotometer. A standard curve was determined using known amounts of HABA. The decrease in optical density of the HABA following the addition of biotinylated HS was determined.","Heparanase Assay","Biotin-labeled HS made as described above was digested with heparanase, under both control and treated conditions, and the reaction containing undegraded and degraded HS was bound to in a biotin-binding plate. Streptavidin, conjugated with an enzyme, was added to the binding plate. Quantitation of the color reaction measured the amount of available biotin binding sites. A decrease in color from a known amount reflects HS digestion by heparanase. Control conditions have no added compound of the present invention, and treated conditions have compounds of the present invention added.","A lyophilized powder of heparanase (heparanase III obtained from Seikagaku) containing 0.1 units of enzymatic activity was hydrated in 100 \u03bcl of Reaction Buffer (3.33 mM calcium acetate pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mg\/ml BSA). This solution was then diluted to a working concentration of heparanase solution (0.01 micro-units to 1 milli-unit) in Reaction Buffer. Enzyme activity was defined by the manufacturer of the heparanase (Seikagaku) as follows: one unit of enzyme activity is defined as amount required to generate 1 micromole of hexuronic acid per minute. Biotin-HS was diluted to a desired concentration in Reaction Buffer.","To determine heparanase activity, 10 \u03bcl of heparanase solution, with or without at least one of the compounds of the present invention, was mixed with 200 \u03bcl of the biotin-HS substrate in a 96 well plate. The reaction was incubated at 43\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. One hundred microliters of the reaction mixture was added to a hydrated biotin-binding plate (Chemicon) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The biotin-binding plates were hydrated with 200 \u03bcl of 1\u00d7 Assay Buffer (Chemicon). Wells were washed five times with 1\u00d7 Assay Buffer and incubated with 100 \u03bcl of 1:3000 diluted Streptavidin-Enzyme Conjugate (Chemicon) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The wells were washed five times with 1\u00d7 Assay Buffer and incubated for 20 minutes with 100 \u03bcl of Substrate Solution (Chemicon). Color development in the wells was assessed by measuring the optical density at 450 nm in a microplate reader (Labsystems, Muliskan Ascent model). Differences between the control and the treated conditions indicate the heparanase modulating activity of the added compound or compounds.","AGE-induced Inflammatory Response Determined by IL-6 ELISA","Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC, Clonetics) were cultured according to manufacturer in growth medium (Clonetics): basal medium containing human epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, vascular endothelial growth factor, heparin binding growth factor-B, long R3-insulin-like growth factor-1, ascorbic acid, gentamicin\/amphotericin and 5% FBS. These cell were allowed to reach at least 90% confluency before subjected to experimental treatments. Glycated human serum albumin (G-HSA) was from US Biologicals. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 was from R&D Systems.","Endothelial cells were treated with control medium or medium containing 10 to 100 ng\/ml TNF-\u03b1 or 300 \u03bcg\/ml glycated-HAS (treated cells or treatments) for 24 hrs, in control and compound-added duplicates, containing 10 \u03bcM compound. All treatments, compound-added and controls were carried out in serum free media containing 0.2% albumin. Media from all conditions were collected and used for IL-6 ELISA.","IL-6 ELISA was carried out using human IL-6 DuoSet ELISA development kit as described by manufacturer (R&D Systems). Mouse anti-human Il-6 was used as the capture antibody (2 ug\/ml) and biotinylated goat anti-human IL-6 (200 ng\/ml) was used as the detection antibody. Culture media were incubated with capture antibody (in 96 well) for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with wash buffer (0.05% tween-20 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4) followed by incubation with detection antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Following three washes wells were incubated with Streptavidin-HRP for 20 min. Color development was read at 450 nm in a Microplate reader.","The effects of compounds of the present invention on G-HSA induced IL-6 are shown in . G is G-HSA, and C is control, no treatment with compounds or G-HSA. Endothelial cells under basal conditions secreted about 25 pg\/ml of IL-6. Incubation of endothelial cells with G-HSA induced a 3 fold increase in IL-6 secretion by endothelial cells. Addition of compounds of the present invention, as indicated by each compound's number, to G-HSA containing media significantly reduced endothelial secretion of IL-6. These inhibitory effects varied, the most effective compounds showed an 80% decrease in IL-6 secretion. These data show the compounds of the present invention have anti-inflammatory activity.","Cytotoxicity\/Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay","An appropriate number of cells are plated in four 96-well plates, one plate for \u201cday 0\u201d and three plates for days 1\u20133.
