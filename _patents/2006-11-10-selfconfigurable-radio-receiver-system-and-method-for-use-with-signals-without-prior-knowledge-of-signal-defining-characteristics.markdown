title: Self-configurable radio receiver system and method for use with signals without prior knowledge of signal defining characteristics
abstract: A method, radio receiver, and system to autonomously receive and decode a plurality of signals having a variety of signal types without a priori knowledge of the defining characteristics of the signals is disclosed. The radio receiver is capable of receiving a signal of an unknown signal type and, by estimating one or more defining characteristics of the signal, determine the type of signal. The estimated defining characteristic(s) is/are utilized to enable the receiver to determine other defining characteristics. This in turn, enables the receiver, through multiple iterations, to make a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate for each of the defining characteristics. After the type of signal is determined by its defining characteristics, the receiver selects an appropriate decoder from a plurality of decoders to decode the signal.

Field of Invention","The invention relates to radio receivers and, more particularly, to an autonomous radio receiver capable of receiving a signal without a priori knowledge about the defining characteristics of the signal, recognizing these characteristics directly from the received signal, and appropriately decoding the signal based on the signal type.","b. Background of the Invention","Conventional radio receivers typically have complete prior knowledge of the defining characteristics of signals they are designed to receive. Because conventional radio receivers know what type of signal they are going to receive they are typically hardwired or manually configured to do so. Conversely, conventional radio receivers are incapable of receiving signal types different from that which they were intended for. In some cases where they do have such capability, conventional radio receivers require specific pre-configuration according to a pre-determined schedule. Thus, conventional radio receivers are capable of only receiving pre-determined\/pre-programmed types of signals. For example, cellular telephones are designed according to several different standards, and single-mode telephones are typically preconfigured to receive only one type of cellular telephony signal. Indeed, a single-mode telephone configured to use Code Division Multiple Access (a popular system in the United States) is unable to receive a signal using Global Systems Mobile (GSM) signals, which is the European standard. While there are dual-mode telephones to solve the CDMA\/GSM dichotomy, there remains the issue and potential future issue of varying frequency bands, data rates, modulation types, modulation indices, pulse shapes, and so on, which may affect the usability of cellular telephones. Therefore, there is a need for a system capable of receiving multiple signal types without a priori knowledge about the defining characteristics of the signals, and accurately recognizing defining features of the incoming signals and respond intelligently without explicit pre-configuration or reprogramming to define the functions of the receiver. In other words, there is a need for a system capable of recognizing multiple signal types and autonomously reconfiguring itself to decode the particular type of signal that is received.","It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a system for autonomously receiving and decoding a plurality of signals having a variety of signal types without prior knowledge of the defining characteristics of the signals.","According to the present invention, the above-described and other objects are accomplished by providing a system inclusive of hardware and a suite of software modules to autonomously recognize various defining characteristics of a signal that are unknown prior to reception. Some of these defining characteristics include, but are not limited to, the angle of arrival, data rate, symbol timing, carrier frequency and phase, modulation index, modulation type, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), code type, and decoded message bits. The signal characteristics are recognized by estimating one or more characteristics of the signal, and the estimated characteristic is utilized to enable the apparatus and system to determine other defining characteristics. Through multiple iterations of estimation and calculation, the system is able to make a maximum-likelihood (ML) or near-ML estimate for each of the defining characteristics. The ML estimates assist in identifying the type of signal and the system selects an appropriate decoder from a plurality of decoders to eventually decode the signal.","The present invention is an autonomous radio receiver capable of receiving a signal without prior knowledge about the defining characteristics of the signal, instead recognizing these characteristics directly from the received signal, and appropriately decoding the signal based on the signal type.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","110"],"sub":["t ","c ","t"]},"The radio receiver  also includes a frequency correction module (FCM)  in communication with MIM . FCM  may be any hardware and\/or software suitably configured to track the offset frequency of the incoming signal with unknown characteristics without knowledge a priori of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), data rate, modulation type, etc. Thus, FCM  receives the incoming signal and the estimated modulation index from MIM , and outputs a signal having an estimated offset frequency based on the incoming signal and the estimated modulation index. FCM  is in communication with a multiplier  and outputs the signal having an estimated frequency offset to multiplier , and multiplier  mixes the original signal with the signal having the estimated frequency offset to produce a frequency-corrected received signal.","Radio receiver  also includes a joint estimator module (JEM)  in communication with MIM  and multiplier . JEM  may be any hardware and\/or software suitably configured to receive the estimate of the modulation index and\/or the actual modulation index from MIM  and to utilize the estimated modulation index and frequency corrected received signal to estimate and\/or determine defining characteristic(s) of the incoming signal. In the preferred embodiment JEM  utilizes the estimated modulation index to estimate and\/or determine the data rate of the incoming signal, the SNR of the incoming signal, the waveform shape and pulse shape of the incoming signal, and\/or symbol timing.","As discussed in greater detail below, one or more of the estimates and\/or characteristics produced by JEM  is transmitted back to MIM  to refine the estimate of the modulation index and\/or help determine the modulation index. Furthermore, one or more of the estimates and\/or characteristics produced by JEM  is transmitted to a modulation classifier module (MCM) , a carrier synchronization module (CSM) , and\/or a fine symbol synchronizer (FSS) , all in communication with JEM  and with each other.","MCM  may be any hardware and\/or software suitably configured to derive approximations of the maximum likelihood (ML) modulation classification based on one or more estimations and\/or characteristics received from multiplier  (i.e., MIM  and FCM  estimates), JEM , CSM , and\/or FSS .","CSM  may be any hardware and\/or software suitably configured to track the carrier phase independent of the modulation of the incoming signal. Furthermore, CSM  is such that it includes a structure that performs the carrier synchronization function for all orders of phase-shift-keying (PSK) modulation based on one or more estimations and\/or characteristics received from MIM , multiplier  (i.e., MIM  and FCM  estimates), JEM , MCM , and\/or FSS .","FSS  may be any hardware and\/or software suitably configured to determine an estimate of the symbol timing of the incoming signal. FSS  determines the estimate of the symbol timing of the incoming signal based on one or more estimates and\/or characteristics received from signal combiner  (i.e., MIM  and FCM  estimates), JEM , and\/or CSM .","In general operation, radio receiver  functions to receive an incoming signal, and through estimations and one or more refining iterations, determines the signal type and decodes the incoming signal utilizing an appropriate decoder. How MIM , FCM , JEM , MCM , CSM , and FSS  calculate the estimations and perform the iterations to determine the signal type is discussed in greater detail below. Notably, the workings of MIM , FCM , JEM , MCM , CSM , and FSS  depend on whether radio receiver  is performing coarse estimations, fine estimations, non-coherent estimations, or coherent estimations, and on what information has been estimated and\/or determined by prior iterations.","Again, MIM  is configured to receive signals with unknown characteristics. Because radio receiver  does not know exactly what type of signal it may receive, MIM  is configured to receive and estimate the modulation index for an array of signal types.","For example, phase-shift keying (PSK) is a method of digital communication in which the phase of a transmitted signal is varied to convey information. There are several methods that can be used to accomplish PSK. The simplest PSK technique is called binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). It uses two opposite signal phases (0 and 180 degrees). In the case of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, a phase modulation index \u03b2 other than 90 degrees may be used. When this is done, the fraction of power allocated to the discrete carrier becomes P=Pcos\u03b2 with the remaining fractional power P=Psin\u03b2 available for data detection. When using this signaling mode, the power spectrum of the data modulation should be such that it does not interfere with the extraction of the discrete carrier by an appropriate carrier tracking loop such as a phase-locked loop (PLL). In other words, the discrete carrier should be inserted at a point where the power spectrum of the data modulation is minimum, and preferably equal to zero. In the case of digital data, this rules out direct modulation of the carrier with a Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) data stream whose spectrum is maximum at direct current (DC) which at radio frequencies would correspond to the carrier frequency. Thus, for example, the data may be first modulated onto a sub-carrier whose frequency is selected significantly higher than the data rate so that the sidebands of the data modulation are sufficiently reduced by the time they reach the carrier frequency. More sophisticated forms of PSK exist. In multiple phase-shift keying with or without phase compensation. In the most general scenario, a taxonomy of cases for analysis is illustrated by the tree diagram of  for the sampled version of the SSME .  begins at the square node in the middle and proceeds outward to any of the eight leaf nodes representing combinations of \u03c9, {circumflex over (\u03c9)}, \u03c9, and \u03c9. For SSME , a few of the tree branches of , namely, and , do not apply.","Other signals use a coherent communication mode where carrier synchronization is established directly from the data-bearing signal (e.g., using a conventional Costas loop). In this case, none of the transmitted power is allocated to a discrete carrier and the system is said to operate in a suppressed carrier mode which, in the case of BPSK, corresponds to \u03b2=90\u00b0. Although a Costas loop operates with a less efficient performance (e.g., larger mean-square phase tracking error) than a PLL, it offers the advantage of not requiring a discrete carrier to lock onto and thus all of the transmitted power can be used for the purpose of data detection.","Given that the foregoing or other transmission modes may be received by radio receiver , it is important that MIM  be able to estimate the modulation index or equivalently, the ratio of transmitted carrier to data power of the various received signals. In one exemplary embodiment, MIM  utilizes an ML estimation approach to estimate the modulation index along with appropriate approximation of the nonlinearities that result, to allow for practical implementations at course and fine modes.","With reference again to , radio receiver  is shown operating in a coarse mode according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. When radio receiver  receives an incoming signal (which is represented as r(t)), the signal is transmitted to MIM  and signal combiner . MIM  estimates an initial modulation index without a priori knowledge of the modulation, data rate, and\/or symbol timing of the incoming signal. The incoming signal with the initial estimate of the modulation index is then transmitted to other modules of radio receiver  to estimate other defining characteristics.","If the signal with the initially estimated modulation index includes a residual carrier, the signal is transmitted to FCM  for frequency acquisition and tracking. If the signal with the initial estimated modulation index does not include a residual carrier, the signal is also transmitted to FCM  for frequency acquisition and tracking. Furthermore, the signal with the initially estimated modulation index and corrected frequency is also transmitted to JEM , , CSM  AND\/OR .","The signal with the initially estimated modulation index is transmitted to JEM  so that the received signal can be used to estimate an initial data format (via data format module ), an initial SNR (via SNR module ), an initial data rate (via data rate module ), and\/or an initial estimate of the symbol timing (via CSS ). Furthermore, the signal with the initial estimated modulation index is transmitted to CSM  so that the received signal can be used to initially track the carrier phase of the incoming signal. Moreover, CSM  also receives and uses the initial estimates of the data format (from data format module ), the SNR (from SNR module ), the data rate (from data rate module ), and\/or the estimate of the symbol timing (from CSS ); and\/or receives the original signal combined with the output of FCM  from multiplier  in initially tracking the carrier phase of the incoming signal.","FSS  receives and uses the initial estimates of the data format (from data format module ), the SNR (from SNR module ), and\/or the data rate (from data rate module ); and\/or receives the original signal combined with the output of FCM  from multiplier  to initially estimate the symbol timing of the incoming signal. Likewise, MCM  receives and uses the initial estimates of the data format (from data format module ), the SNR (from SNR module ), the data rate (from data rate module ), and\/or the estimate of the symbol timing (from CSS ); and\/or receives the original signal combined with the output of FCM  multiplier  to initially estimate the modulation classification of the incoming signal. In one exemplary embodiment, the initial estimate of the carrier phase tracking, the initial estimate of the symbol timing, the initial estimate of the modulation classification, the initial estimate of the data format, and\/or the initial estimate of the data rate are used to refine and\/or determine the type of the incoming signal in a fine mode of operation of radio receiver .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","150","160","140","132","136","100"]},"For reference purposes,  is a block diagram of the detailed operations of radio receiver . The MIM  estimates and\/or determines the action of total power that is allocated to a non-modulated carrier signal and to a data-modulated signal and outputs an estimated modulation index including such estimate. FCM  receives the incoming signal and the estimated modulation index from MIM , and outputs a signal having an estimated corrected frequency based on the incoming signal and the estimated modulation index. FCM  outputs the signal having an estimated corrected frequency to multiplier  which mixes the original signal with the signal having the estimated frequency correction to produce a frequency corrected received signal. JEM  receives the modulation index estimate and frequency corrected received signal to estimate various defining characteristic(s) of the incoming signal, including data rate of the incoming signal, SNR of the incoming signal, waveform shape and pulse shape of the incoming signal, and\/or symbol timing.

As before, the performance of the estimator is still independent of the data symbol sequence as well as the carrier phase and allows for the same enhancement by increasing the number of pairs of observables per symbol in accordance with the true value of SNR.","For the case of M-PSK, it was noted that the kth transmitted complex symbol in the interval (k\u22121) T\u2266t\u2266kT can be represented in the form d=ewhere \u03c6takes on one of M phases uniformly spaced around the unit circle. A special case of the above corresponding to M=4 results in conventional QPSK. It is well-known that on nonlinear channels OQPSK provides a performance advantage since it reduces the maximum fluctuation in the signal amplitude by limiting the maximum phase change to 135\u00b0 rather than 180\u00b0. Since for OQPSK, the complex representation of a symbol extends over 1\u00bd symbols (because of the offset between the I and Q channels), it cannot conveniently be represented in the polar form d=eas above. Rather, the I and Q channel modulations are considered separately. For convenience, SSME  is discussed, however, the same conclusions also apply to SSME .","For implementing a universal SSME structure  that will handle OQPSK as well as conventional QPSK, the results of inputting the I and Q channel baseband signals to half-symbol I&Ds are partitioned into even and odd outputs.","Date rate module , in one exemplary embodiment, is configured to determine and\/or estimate the data rate of the incoming signal. Knowledge of this parameter is important in carrying out ML detection of other parameters such as the carrier phase or modulation type. Here, the data rates are assumed to come from a set of known values and related by integer powers of an integer base B. This assumption allows estimation of the true data rate based on estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computed for various assumed data rates. In one embodiment, the SNR utilized is SSME  and\/or SSME  discussed above. These estimators are appealing in that the only parameter required for their operation is the assumed data rate. Hence, estimation of the data rate can be done jointly with that of the SNR.","Though this approach provides a way of estimating both the data rate and SNR together, it will be shown that it is sensitive to symbol timing error or jitter. In fact, the presence of symbol timing error can severely degrade the performance of this estimator. To overcome this, a modification is proposed in which the jitter is quantized and estimated alongside the data rate and SNR. This approach, based on a so-called generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), is robust in the presence of symbol timing error and can be used to jointly estimate the data rate, SNR, and symbol timing error all at once. The estimates of the symbol timing error obtained can then be used as coarse initial estimates for the data transition tracking loop (DTTL), which is used later in the receiver to obtain a fine estimate of the timing.","The baseband signal received at the autonomous radio is assumed to consist of a constant amplitude digital data stream corrupted by artifacts due to the conversion from IF to baseband as well as additive noise.

This data rate estimation technique halts as soon as the condition {circumflex over (\u03bc)}={circumflex over (\u03bc)}, is not satisfied. This may lead to a premature termination of the algorithm. To prevent a premature halting of the algorithm, a GLRT-type modification is utilized. This GLRT-type estimation algorithm is based on the principle that the true data rate and symbol timing error should yield the largest value of the mean of the SNR. Incorrect values of these quantities, on the other hand, should lead to a degraded estimate of the SNR mean. As opposed to the previous algorithm, which lowers the assumed data rate until the SNR decreases, this algorithm computes the SNR for all data rates and all jitter values. The advantage to this is that it can prevent the algorithm from prematurely terminating, which can easily happen when the true SNR is low.","With reference to data rate module , carrier synchronization techniques have been developed assuming that the modulation format and signal constellation characteristics are known a priori. In other words, the modulation index is chosen so that either the carrier is fully suppressed or a residual carrier component remains. Notably, constellation characteristics refers to the shape of the constellation (e.g., a circle for multiple-phase shift keying (M-PSK) or a square for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)), and its size in terms of the number of signal points it contains. Aside from knowing the modulation index and signal constellation structure, it is also customary to have knowledge of the data rate and type (e.g., NRZ versus Manchester code) since the true optimum design of the loop depends on this information.","For radio receiver , the most optimistic situation would be that the receiver contains a carrier synchronization structure that is capable of tracking the carrier phase independent of the above-mentioned considerations. While this is not completely possible since, for example, a squaring loop (or equivalently a BPSK Costas loop) cannot track a QPSK modulation and likewise a 4power loop (or equivalently, a QPSK Costas loop, sometimes referred to as an inphase-quadrature (I-Q) loop) cannot properly track a BPSK signal. Nevertheless, while in principle each carrier synchronization loop developed for a given modulation format, constellation, and data rate\/type has certain unique characteristics, they do share a number of similarities (e.g., a common front end demodulator structure, that allows one to consider designs that could be operational in the absence of complete a priori knowledge of all of these characteristics). For example, if the modulation is restricted to the M-PSK class, then it is possible to construct a universal structure that performs the carrier synchronization function for all values of M. This structure is derived by first determining the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of carrier phase based on an observation of the received signal, namely, M-PSK plus additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and then using this to motivate a closed loop carrier synchronization loop. By making an analogy between the closed loop bandwidth and the noise bandwidth of an integrate-and-dump (I&D) filter of duration equal to the observation time for the open loop MAP estimate, the closed loop approaches the Cramer-Rae lower bound on the variance of an unbiased estimate of the phase of a modulated carrier.","Still further, if the modulation is known to be other than suppressed carrier (i.e., a modulation index less than \u03c0\/2 radians), then it is still possible to exploit the power in both the data and residual carrier components for carrier tracking purposes provided one has knowledge of the modulation index itself. Such knowledge could be derived non-coherently (i.e., in the absence of carrier synchronization) from a suitable modulation index estimator. Loops of this type are often referred to as \u201chybrid carrier tracking loops,\u201d and like their suppressed carrier counterparts, are motivated by the same MAP considerations.","In various exemplary embodiments, the matched filters in the I and Q arms of the loop are replaced with simple low pass filters to make the carrier synchronizer operation somewhat independent of the exact pulse shape, but without some attendant loss in performance. These systems include a fixed modulation bandwidth which implies a fixed data symbol rate for all values of M. These systems include simplifications based on low SNR approximations applied to the nonlinearities inherent in the MAP phase estimate. When this is done, the error signal in the loop for M-PSK is of the form sin M\u03c6, where \u03c6 is the loop phase error, which from simple trigonometry can be written as sin M\u03c6=2 sin [(M\/2)\u03c6] cos [(M\/2)\u03c6]. Thus, it is seen that the error signal in the loop for M-PSK is formed from the product of the error signal sin [(M\/2)\u03c6] and the lock detector signal cos [(M\/2)\u03c6] in the loop for M\/2-PSK modulation. This relationship forms the basis for implementing a universal structure.","In the past, carrier synchronization loops have typically fallen into two categories: those that track a discrete carrier (e.g., the phase-locked loop (PLL)) and those that track a fully suppressed carrier (e.g., the Costas loop). A fully suppressed carrier comes about when a digital modulation is impressed on a carrier with a modulation index equal to \u03c0\/2 radians, whereas a discrete (residual) carrier component appears in the spectrum when the modulation is less than \u03c0\/2 radians.","For implementing a universal SSME structure that will handle OQPSK as well as conventional QPSK, the results of inputting the I and Q channel baseband signals to halfsymbol I&Ds are partitioned into even and odd inputs. SNR estimator  can use the other embodiments SSME - for estimating SNR when QAM is transmitted.","Date rate module , in one exemplary embodiment, is configured to determine and\/or estimate the data rate of the incoming signal. Knowledge of this parameter is important in carrying out ML detection of other parameters such as the carrier phase or modulation type. Here, the data rates are assumed to come from a set of known values and related by integer powers of an integer base B. This assumption allows estimation of the true data rate based on estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computed for various assumed data rates. In one embodiment, the SNR utilized is SSME  and\/or SSME  discussed above. These estimators are appealing in that the only parameter required for their operation is the assumed data rate. Hence, estimation of the data rate can be done jointly with that of the SNR.","Though this approach provides a way of estimating both the data rate and SNR together, it will be shown that it is sensitive to symbol timing error or jitter. In fact, the presence of symbol timing error can severely degrade the performance of this estimator. To overcome this, a modification is proposed in which the jitter is quantized and estimated alongside the data rate and SNR. This approach, based on a so-called generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), is robust in the presence of symbol timing error and can be used to jointly estimate the data rate, SNR, and symbol timing error all at once. The estimates of the symbol timing error obtained can then be used as coarse initial estimates for the data transition tracking loop (DTTL), which is used later in the receiver to obtain a fine estimate of the timing.","To account for the presence of symbol timing error, typically a digital transition tracking loop (DTTL) is used. However, the DTTL architecture requires knowledge of the data rate to function as required. To overcome this restriction, the proposed SSME based data rate estimator can be modified to provide a coarse estimate of the symbol timing error in addition to the data rate, which can then be used to obtain a finer estimate of the symbol timing error using a DTTL. As the data rate of the received signal is not known a priori, at radio receiver  the symbol timing error corresponding to one specific data rate is one thing that can be independently quantized. By quantizing the jitter corresponding to one data rate, the quantized jitter for the remaining rates may be automatically determined.","As the number of quantization steps increases exponentially as the assumed data rate decreases, it is tempting to think that a better estimate of the data rate, SNR, and symbol timing error for lower true data rates than for higher rates will be obtained. However, this is offset by the fact that for a fixed observation time interval, an exponentially larger number of observations for higher true data rates than for lower ones is obtained. Hence, there is an implicit tradeoff between the number of signal observations and the number of jitter quantization levels for each true data rate.","One of the advantages of uniformly quantizing the symbol timing error to Nsteps is that it leads to an efficient all digital implementation of the SSME system.","Furthermore, SSME  is also a generalized structure to account for the quantized symbol timing error, and to account for computing an ensemble average of the observed SNRs. An ensemble average of the observed SNRs is important in estimating the mean of the SNR of the SSME system. To do this, the discrete-time signal yis partitioned into blocks over which the SNR is to be computed. For each block, the SSME computes an estimate of the SNR and then an ensemble average of the SNR is computed over the blocks.","There are several things to note regarding the structure of all digital SSME system . First, all digital SSME system  includes discrete summations analogous to the sampled version of the SNR estimator discussed above with regard to SNR . Furthermore, note that all of the signals starting from the half signal integrator outputs are indexed with a semicolon followed by n. Finally, note that to form a single SNR estimate, a total of BN, samples are squared and accumulated. This was chosen as such here to keep the total observation time interval or epoch block fixed.","All other things being equal, a modulation classifier that requires the least knowledge of channel parameters is preferred.

The additive noise is a white Gaussian process with single-sided power spectral density NW\/Hz. The local clock produces a timing reference for the I and Q I&D filters that depends on its estimate {circumflex over (\u03b5)} of \u03b5.","One can immediately apply the same small and large argument approximations to the hyperbolic tangent nonlinearity and, analogous to , arrive at DTTL-like implementations which are illustrated in the block diagrams of .","As discussed above, open loop MAP estimation of symbol epoch involves finding the conditional (on the symbol timing) likelihood function of the received signal based on a single observation of the received signal over a block of symbols. Furthermore, since the unknown symbol epoch is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the symbol interval, the MAP estimate is equivalent to the ML estimate. Moreover, the traditional closed-loop estimation scheme motivated by the MAP estimation approach employs an error signal derived from the derivative of the CLF that can be updated at intervals corresponding to the symbol time. Since for rectangular pulses (e.g., an NRZ data stream) the derivative of the CLF, which is related to the derivative of the pulse shape, is undefined, closed-loop structures motivated by the MAP estimation approach generally do not exist. Nevertheless, with suitable approximations of the derivative of the pulse shape, such a closed loop (e.g., the DTTL) will in fact provide symbol synchronization for an NRZ data stream with rectangular pulses. The closed-loop approach provides a continuous updating (tracking) of the symbol timing (once per bit interval) which is desirable in the presence of channel dynamics whereas the open approach is usually regarded as either a one shot estimator (i.e., compute the MAP or MMS estimate based on a single observed long block of data), or a block-by-block estimator where the single shot is sequentially repeated over and over.","What is important to observe is that the open loop estimation techniques can be modified to provide sequential updates at the symbol rate to the symbol timing epoch estimates and as such resemble the closed-loop techniques with however, improved performance. As such, the presented invention includes a sequential digital implementation of the MAP estimation of symbol epoch that can track the dynamics in this parameter yet provide a performance approaching that of the true optimum MAP estimation technique.","Because of the assumption that the unknown parameter being estimated (i.e., symbol epoch) is constant over the observation, the implementation in  (referenced as ) includes a running accumulator with uniform weighting. In other embodiments where the parameter is dynamic but slowly varying, one can assume that the unknown parameter is constant over a finite number of symbol intervals. As such, the uniform running accumulator is replaced with a weighted running accumulator which reflects a fading memory and is analogous to what is done in a closed-loop architecture by using a digital filter following the error signal. This embodiment (referenced as ) is illustrated in the block diagram of , wherein the feedback term is multiplied by a constant \u03b1<1. This achieves a running accumulator with a geometric weighting which has the input-output characteristic:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0254","num":"0270"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00051","num":"00051"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["y","i"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"=","mn":"0"},"mi":"\u221e"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":["\u03b1","m"]},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":["i","m"],"mo":"-"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"55"}}]}}}}},"Since the running accumulator also accomplishes the data detection (matched filter) function, then the epoch estimate index, \u00eeof (55) may be used to determine in each symbol interval which running accumulator output to use for making a hard decision on that symbol.","When the pulse shape is other than rectangular, the modification that allows the bank of N correlations to be replaced by a sliding accumulator as in  is not possible. However, if N is large and the pulse shape is approximated by a piecewise constant staircase function with N steps, then the correlation of the received signal and the pulse shape in a quantization interval can be written as:\n\n\u222b()()\u222b()\u2003\u2003(56)\n","where pis the assumed constant value of p(t) in the interval i\u0394\u2266t\u2266(i+1)\u0394. In view of (56), one modification of  that is necessary to allow for the inclusion of an arbitrary pulse shape is to replace the uniform sliding accumulator with a weighted sliding accumulator (see ) where the weights are equal to the piecewise constant values of p(t). Furthermore, for sufficiently large N, one can approximately replace the integral of over the quantization interval by the value of r(t) at the midpoint of this interval times the duration of this interval, \u0394.
