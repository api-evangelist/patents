No. 60\/344,440, entitled \u201cBANK OF KNOWLEDGE,\u201d filed Oct. 23, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention relates in general to supply chain management and, more particularly, to a system and method for managing supplier intelligence associated with a procurement process.","Financial pressures continue to provide business executives with opportunities to reduce expenses while generating revenue growth. Procurement decisions, such as purchasing decisions regarding particular products, suppliers, and shipping of purchased products, often have a substantial impact on a business organization's financial bottom line, providing opportunities for reducing expenses as well as increasing revenue. In addition, such procurement decisions often influence the organization's general operation and the quality of goods or services procured by the organization.","Procurement decisions are often complex and involve the analysis of heterogeneous information, which may be constantly evolving, over a period of time. For example, such information may include large volumes of product data, purchaser (or client) requirements, supplier constraints, legal regulations and contractual terms and obligations. Contractual terms and obligations may originate from contracts between the business organization and its various suppliers. Some business organizations may deal with hundreds or even thousands of suppliers, and may therefore have hundreds or thousands of supplier contracts active at any particular time. These supplier contracts define the business terms and conditions between the business organization and the many suppliers.","In accordance with the present invention, systems and methods for managing supplier intelligence associated with a procurement process are provided.","According to one embodiment, a method of managing supplier intelligence is provided. The method includes collecting procurement data regarding a procurement process from a plurality of data sources. The procurement data includes information regarding a plurality of business divisions of a business entity. The method further includes generating, for each business division, a set of spend formulas for determining spending associated with that business division. The method further includes generating a set of supplier intelligence business rules based on a variety of business parameters. Each supplier intelligence business rule may interrelate at least one spend formula associated with a first one of the business divisions with at least one spend formula associated with a second one of the business divisions. The method further includes automatically analyzing at least a portion of the procurement data based on one or more of the set of supplier intelligence business rules to determine the financial effects of a decision made by the first business division on the second business division. The method further includes automatically generating a visual output indicating the results of the analysis.","According to another embodiment, a system for managing supplier intelligence is provided. The system includes a data warehouse, a supplier intelligence business rules database, an analysis module, and a data visualization module. The data warehouse is operable to collect procurement data regarding a procurement process, including information regarding a plurality of business divisions of a business entity, from a plurality of data sources. The supplier intelligence business rules database operable to store a set of supplier intelligence business rules generated based on a variety of business parameters and interrelating spend formulas associated with a various ones of the business divisions. The analysis module is operable to analyze at least a portion of the procurement data based on one or more of the set of supplier intelligence business rules to determine the financial effects of a decision made by the first business division on the second business division. The data visualization module is operable to generate a visual output indicating the results of the analysis.","Various embodiments of the present invention may benefit from numerous advantages. It should be noted that one or more embodiments may benefit from some, none, or all of the advantages discussed below.","One advantage is that supplier intelligence systems and methods may be provided for managing a large volume of supplier management information, including information regarding multiple suppliers, contractual issues, international regulations, new products and services, particular business needs and human elements, for example, in order to assist various procurement decision-makers in making procurement decisions.","In particular embodiments, a large volume of information, such as products, prices, multiple purchase orders, geography, inventory and shipping costs, for example, may be automatically analyzed to optimize procurement decisions in real time according to a set of heuristics and business rules. For example, a supplier intelligence system may be operable to analyze the effects that decisions made by particular spend categories or divisions of a business entity have on each other based on a total-cost-of-ownership view. In this matter, the supplier intelligence system may be operable to analyze a supply chain more effectively than previous or existing systems.","Another advantage is that supplier intelligence systems and methods may be operable to analyze procurement data regarding each spending division, or silo, of a business organization. For example, a particular supplier intelligence system may be operable to analyze a complete procurement process, or supply chain, including the spending behaviors of each spending division of the business organization. Such analyses may include performing a variety of simulations based on a set of hypothetical procurement decisions in order to optimize particular procurement or supplier management decisions.","Yet another advantage is that the supplier intelligence system may be operable to determine the financial effects of decisions made by particular spending divisions on other spending divisions. Often, particular spending divisions of a business organization often make decisions that are financially advantageous to that division, without realizing various negative financial effects of their decisions on other divisions of the business entity, or on the total cost associated with the procurement process or supply chain. By analyzing the total-cost-of-ownership associated with a procurement process or supply chain, the supplier intelligence system may be operable to identify such financial relationships between particular divisions or silos of the business organization and to suggest particular procurement decisions accordingly. Such systems and methods may be more effective, efficient, faster and\/or less expensive than previous systems and methods of managing supplier information and procurement decisions.","Other advantages will be readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.","Example embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring now to  of the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like parts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10","10","10"]},"As shown in , procurement data management system  may include one or more purchasing data sources , a procurement data warehouse , an information management system , and a knowledge integration interface . Information management system  comprises various components, including a contracts management component , a spend management component , a compliance management component , and a supplier intelligence component .","Purchasing data sources  may be operable to store, or otherwise have access to, various source data  regarding any number of historical procurement events and\/or business entities. The terms \u201cbusiness entity\u201d and \u201cbusiness organization\u201d as used throughout this document includes any individual or group of individuals associated with any type of for-profit or non-profit business enterprise.","Purchasing data sources  may include operational applications, manual source data applications (such as spreadsheet files, for example) and\/or various other data sources suitable to store or have access to information regarding procurement events. In some embodiments, purchasing data sources  may include one or more databases or applications operable to support operational systems. For example, a particular purchasing data source  may include an on-line transaction processing (OLTP) system, a teleprocessing monitor, a data management system (such as a DB2, ORACLE, or SYBASE system, for example) and may have capabilities for on-line data entry and batch processing. In particular embodiments, source data  associated with purchasing data sources  generally includes structured, as opposed to unstructured, data. It should be understood that various purchasing data sources  may be physically and geographically distributed.","Source data  may include information from purchase orders (such as information regarding suppliers, products, prices, refunds, rebates, margins, and dates, for example), invoices, general ledger account information (such as general ledger account codes, for example), a listing of procured products and services, where such procurements are made, who is responsible for making such procurements, payment information, and any other type of information regarding historical procurement events. It should be understood that the term \u201cproducts\u201d as used throughout this document includes both goods and services, whether or not accompanied by the term \u201cservices.\u201d","Procurement data warehouse  may include a collection of procurement data , which may include source data  received from one or more purchasing data sources . As shown in , one or more processing tools  may be used to facilitate the transportation of such source data  from purchasing data sources  to procurement data warehouse . Processing tools  may include data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tools operable to extract source data  from purchasing data sources , transform or otherwise process such source data , and load such source data  into procurement data warehouse . Such ETL tools are described in greater detail below with reference to ETL tools  of . Processing tools  may also include one or more additional tools operable to process source data , such as various data mapping and classification tools, as described in greater detail below with reference to data processing sub-system  of .","Procurement data  may also include data received from information management system . For example, procurement data  may include data extracted from electronic procurement contracts by contracts management component  of information management system , as discussed below in greater detail. It should be understood that procurement data warehouse  may be operable to exchange various information with information management system  in order to generate outputs  enabling users (such as procurement decision-makers, for example) to make better purchasing decisions, indicated by reference numeral . It should be understood that the term \u201cuser\u201d as used throughout this document refers to any person or group of people associated with a procurement process or business entity, such as business rule experts, subject matter experts, business analysts, data analysts, managers, system administrators, purchasing or spending decision-makers, or business consultants, for example.","Knowledge integration interface  may be operable to bring together supplier information , purchaser information , and the various components of information management system  in order for such information to be processed to generate various outputs . In particular embodiments, knowledge integration interface  includes an interface and a set of utilities and routines that bring together supplier information , purchaser information  and the components of information management system . For example, knowledge integration interface  may be operable to receive or extract particular supplier information  and determine where to route the particular supplier information  such that the supplier information  may be presented to a user in a format such that the user may discover hidden value or particular business opportunities.","Supplier information may include various information regarding any number of suppliers, such as spending patterns with particular suppliers, information regarding supplier alignment, and information regarding compliance and\/or non-compliance with agreements made between particular suppliers and the purchasing organization, for example.","Purchaser information may include various information regarding the purchasing business organization, such as information regarding particular business opportunities, such as information regarding opportunities for reducing expenses and\/or generating revenue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","10","30","30","40","42","44","46","40","42","44","46","42","48"]},"Document processing sub-component  may include a scanning module , a digital images database , and an optical character recognition module . Scanning module  may be operable to scan or otherwise process one or more paper contracts  to generate digital images  of the one or more paper contracts . Digital images  may be stored in digital images database . Paper contracts  may include contracts stored on paper, microfiche, microfilm, aperture card, or any other format in which the text of the contracts is not computer-editable. Optical character recognition module  is operable to convert the digital images  associated with each paper contract  into an electronic contract , such that the text of the electronic contract  is computer-editable. For example, optical character recognition module  may convert digital images  into electronic contracts  based on patterns of pixels in digital images . Each electronic contract  may be stored in an electronic contracts database  of data extraction sub-component . It should be understood that electronic contracts  comprise computer-editable, but unstructured, text.","Data extraction sub-component  may include electronic contracts database , a text mining module , an extracted information database , a data organization database , and a linguistic rules database . As discussed above, electronic contracts database  is operable to store electronic contracts  received from document processing sub-component . Text mining module  may include text mining tools, or software,  and may be operable to analyze electronic contracts  to extract relevant information  based on a set of linguistic rules  stored in linguistic rules database . Text mining tools  may be operable to automatically identify, group, and map key concepts within a large volume of unstructured textual data. Text mining tools  may include lexical processing and information clustering operable to extract key phrases and identify relevant relationships within electronic contracts .","In particular embodiments, text mining tools  may include Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to extract relevant information . Using NLP technologies, documents may be transformed into a collection of concepts, described using terms discovered in the text. Thus, text mining tools  may be operable to extract more information than just picking up keywords from textual data. For example, text mining tools  may be operable to extract facts, determine their meaning, resolve ambiguities, and determine an author's intent and expectations.","In particular embodiments, text mining tools  may include software developed for use in contracts management component  and\/or may include one or more commercially available software products, such as text mining software available from CLEARFOREST CORP. It should be understood that the term \u201ctext mining\u201d as used throughout this document includes both data mining and text mining. In other words, \u201ctext mining\u201d is intended to refer to the extraction of particular information from both data and unstructured text (or \u201cfree text\u201d). Thus, for example, text mining module  may be operable to extract relevant information  from both data and text.","Data organization module  may be operable to organize and\/or otherwise process extracted information  stored in extracted information database . Such organization and\/or other processing may include sorting, categorizing, filtering, cleansing, merging, or deleting information, for example.","Extracted information database  may also include one or more contract pointers . Each contract pointer  may be linked to one or more particular portions or items of extracted information  and may point to one or more corresponding electronic contracts , or portions of one or more electronic contracts , stored in electronics contracts database . For example, a particular contract pointer  may be linked to a particular contract term included within extracted information  and may point to the specific clause in a particular electronic contract  from which the particular contract term was extracted. In particular embodiments, contract pointers  may be generated by text mining module  or data organization module .","Linguistic rules  include logical constructs, or statements, that may be used to analyze textual information, or data, in natural language format, such as text in English, French or Japanese, for example. The extraction of relevant information  from electronic contracts database  using text mining tools  may include both syntactic analysis as well as semantic analysis. Thus, linguistic rules  may be provided for performing both syntactic analysis and semantic analysis.","Syntactic analysis includes identifying or understanding the location of particular pieces of information, such as characters or words, for example. Thus, an example linguistic rule at the syntactic level may search for blank spaces between characters in order to locate each word in a group of words. As another example, syntactic linguistic rules may be used to locate particular parts of speech, such as verbs, nouns and adjectives, within a group of words. As yet another example, linguistic rules concerning syntactic analysis may utilize a dictionary to check and\/or correct spellings of particular words.","Semantic analysis involves trying to understand the meaning of a word or group of words, such as a phrase, sentence or paragraph, for example. Example linguistic rules  at the semantic level may utilize a dictionary to understand the meaning of particular words. Semantic linguistic rules  may also utilize a thesaurus to look up synonyms to extend the semantic analysis.","Each linguistic rule , including both syntactic and semantic rules, may perform either shallow parsing or deep parsing. Shallow parsing involves analysis limited to a single sentence, while deep parsing involves analysis extending across more than one sentence or paragraph. Deep parsing may be used to resolve ambiguities in a particular text. For example, linguistic rules designed for deep parsing may be able to distinguish between the use of the word \u201cacquisition\u201d to refer to a business relationship (\u201ccompany A is in acquisition discussions with company B\u201d) or to a product (\u201ccompany A manufactures data acquisition systems\u201d) by analyzing one or more prior and\/or subsequent statements to resolve the ambiguity.","Linguistic rules  may be designed to extract one or more pieces or items of information related to a particular business issuer or parameter from an electronic contract . For example, one or more linguistic rule  may be designed to extract telephone\/fax number information from an electronic contract , which may include information concerning each identified telephone\/fax number, such as the number itself, whether the number is for a home phone, office phone, cellular phone, mobile phone, or fax machine, and the name of the person and\/or company associated with the number. First, one or more linguistic rules may be designed to locate each telephone\/fax number within the electronic contract . For example, such linguistic rules  may look for any three consecutive numbers followed by a dash or period and followed by four consecutive numbers. The linguistic rules  may also look at the text preceding the first three numbers to identify three additional consecutive numbers that may be located within parenthesis or followed by a period or hyphen. Such linguistic rules  may be used to extract telephone or fax numbers from electronic contract . One or more additional linguistic rules  may then be used to identify the type of each identified telephone or fax number. For example, one or more linguistic rules  may be designed to search the five words prior and subsequent to each identified number for words identifying the type of each identified number, such as \u201coffice,\u201d \u201chome,\u201d \u201ccell,\u201d \u201cmobile,\u201d \u201cpager,\u201d \u201cfax\u201d or \u201cfacsimile,\u201d for example. One or more additional linguistic rules  may also be used to identify a person and\/or company associated with each identified number. For example, one or more linguistic rules  may be designed to search the sentence prior to and subsequent to each identified number for any person or company name. Thus, such linguistic rules  may be used to extract various information associated with each identified telephone or fax number. Such information may be linked and\/or stored together within extracted information database .","Automatically extracting relevant information  from electronic contracts database  using text mining tools  based on linguistic rules  allows the extraction of relevant information from a large volume of unstructured text and\/or data sources in a relatively small period of time, and avoids the need to manually search such information to extract the relevant portions. For example, in particular embodiments, text mining module  may be operable to extract relevant information  from several thousand electronic supplier contracts  within a few hours, based on various factors such as the size of the electronic contracts  as well as the number and complexity of linguistic rules , for example.","Linguistic rules  may be developed or generated by linguistic rules development sub-component . One or more knowledge acquisition sessions, indicated by reference numeral , may be used to identify one or more business issues, or needs, . Each knowledge acquisition session  may include a structured interview designed to understand a particular business process, as well as why the particular business process is performed in a particular manner. For example, a particular knowledge acquisition session  regarding a procurement or supply management process may include an interview to discern the details of the process, as well as why the process is performed in a particular manner, in order to identify a set of relevant business issues .","Business issues  may include a variety of issues associated with a particular business process, which may include a variety of issues regarding contracts associated with that business process. For example, in a situation concerning a procurement process and procurement contracts, business issues  may include issues such as financial obligations, rebate opportunities, refund opportunities, margin opportunities, type of license (such as software, for example), volume commitment, warranty period, term of agreement, transfer of license terms, authorized agency terms, maintenance notices, pricing, and contract termination notification, for example.","One or more relevant business parameters  may be identified for each business issue . For example, supposing margin opportunities is identified as a business issue , one or more parameters relevant to identifying and\/or describing particular margin opportunities associated with a set of contracts may be identified as relevant parameters . Such relevant parameters  may include the name of the supplier, the name of the product, and the amount of the margin, for example.","One or more linguistic patterns  may then be identified for each identified relevant parameter . For example, supposing telephone number has been identified as a relevant parameter , the associated linguistic patterns  may include the pattern of three consecutive numbers followed by a hyphen or period and further followed by four consecutive numbers, as well as the pattern concerning the presence of particular words such as \u201cphone,\u201d \u201ctelephone,\u201d \u201cfax,\u201d \u201cfacsimile,\u201d \u201ccell,\u201d \u201cmobile,\u201d \u201coffice,\u201d and \u201chome\u201d located within a particular number of words before and\/or after a group of consecutive numbers, for example.","One or more linguistic rules  may then be generated, or written, for each identified linguistic pattern  in order to extract relevant information  regarding each relevant parameter  from electronic contracts  stored in electronic contracts database . Linguistic rules  may be developed, tested, and revised using an iterative process, such as described in greater detail below, with reference to .","Data processing sub-component  may be operable to process and\/or analyze extracted information  in order to generate various types of output . As shown in , data processing sub-component  may include one or more contracts applications .","Contracts applications  may be operable to receive extracted information  and\/or electronic contracts  (or portions thereof, such as particular sentences, clauses or paragraphs, for example) from electronic contracts database  and to process such information to generate one or more various outputs . In particular embodiments, contracts applications  are operable to generate various outputs  based on requests  received from users, such as business analysts, for example.","Contracts applications  may also be operable to identify business opportunities associated with a procurement process. In particular embodiments, contracts applications  may be operable to analyze particular procurement data  with respect to particular extracted information  to determine whether a business opportunity is available. For example, contracts applications  may be operable to compare particular extracted information  regarding rebate opportunities from a particular supplier and particular procurement data  regarding purchases made form that supplier in order to discover potential or existing rebate opportunities. For example, if a particular supplier, Supplier A, contract specifies a rebate for spending $20,000 on product X, contracts applications  may be operable to identify, from analyzing procurement data  to determine the amount spent on product X from Supplier A, whether the rebate opportunity is available. In a particular embodiment, contracts application  may also be operable to generating a notification if it is determined that the business opportunity is available, and to communicate the opportunity notification to appropriate individuals (such as procurement managers, for example) or business entities.","In this manner, various business opportunities may be automatically identified by contracts management component  based on extracted information  that may not be efficiently identified by human management of supplier contracts. Such business opportunities may include opportunities to reduce costs (such as by obtaining or enforcing discounts, for example), to increase revenue generation (such as by obtaining or enforcing refunds, rebates or margins, for example) and to reduce legal exposure due to non-compliance with contractual terms, for example.","As shown in , contracts applications  may be associated with, or coupled to, an output sub-system  operable to generate various types of visual outputs that may be analyzed or interpreted by users, such as business analysts. In particular embodiments, output sub-system  includes a data visualization module  operable to generate various data visualizations  and a business intelligence reports  operable to generate business intelligence reports .","Data visualizations  may include two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualizations, such those illustrated by , A, B,  and , and may include a plurality of such visualizations through which a user may navigate using one or more navigation tools. Such navigation tools may be provided by contracts applications  or any other suitable application, and may include on-line browsers and search engines, for example. Data visualizations  may illustrate one or more areas of business opportunity which may be analyzed by a user, such as a business analyst, in order to further filter and isolate complex data in a manner that reveals particular patterns (such as spend patterns, for example) or business opportunities, such as described above regarding the rebate opportunity example. For example, a particular data visualization  may include a graph illustrating discount information regarding procurements from a particular supplier that may be analyzed by a business analyst to discover potential discount opportunities.","Business intelligence reports  may include textual reports (which may include pictorial representations) generated by business intelligence reporting module . In a particular embodiment, contracts applications  are operable to receive a request  from a user based on the user's analysis of a particular data visualization , for example, and to communicate with business intelligence reporting module  to generate an appropriate business intelligence report  based on particular extracted information  and\/or electronics contracts  (or portions thereof).","In particular embodiments, output sub-system  is operable to provide searching or navigation tools allowing users to search or browse various outputs , such as data visualizations  and\/or business intelligence reports . For example, in particular embodiments, output sub-system  may include a browser and\/or a search engine allowing a user to search for particular contracts or portions of contracts and to view and navigate through the results of such searches.","In some embodiments, contracts applications  are operable to process extracted information  associated with a particular business parameter (such as a particular business issue  or relevant parameter , for example) in order to generate one or more particular outputs  (such as a data visualization  or business intelligence report ) regarding that business parameter. For example, in a particular embodiment, contracts applications  are operable to receive, process and\/or analyze particular extracted information  regarding potential rebates from a particular supplier in order to generate an output  that may be used to identify a rebate opportunity regarding a particular product.","As discussed above, contracts applications  may be operable to include electronic contracts  or portions of electronic contracts  (such as particular sentences, clauses or paragraphs of electronic contract , for example) received from electronic contracts database  within various outputs . For example, as shown in , a particular contract pointer may be used to point to a particular electronic contract  stored in electronic contracts database . The pointed-to electronic contract, shown as electronic contract , may be forwarded to contracts applications  for processing. Contracts applications  may be able to include electronic contract , or portions thereof, in a particular output . For example, contracts applications  may allow a user to browse such electronic contracts , or portions thereof, in order to identify relevant contract language, for example.","In addition to the various forms of output generated by output sub-system , contracts application  may be operable to generate output data  to be imported into procurement data warehouse . As shown in , procurement data warehouse  is associated with, or utilized by, each of spend management component , compliance management component  and supplier intelligence component  of system . Thus, in particular embodiments, as discussed below regarding ,  and , contracts management component  may be operable to extract relevant information  from electronic contracts  and process such extracted information  to generate output data  which may be used as an input by spend management component , compliance management component  and\/or supplier intelligence component  of system . In an alternative embodiment, extracted information  may be received directly as input data by spend management component , compliance management component  and\/or supplier intelligence component  of system  without being processed by contracts applications .","Contracts applications  and output sub-system (or particular functionalities thereof) may include separate entities or software modules or may be a collected set of modules, such as modules or functionalities provided by a particular software package, for example. For example, in a particular embodiment, data visualizations module  may comprise the software package MINDSET provided by SILICON GRAPHICS, INC., and contracts applications  and business intelligence reporting module  may comprise software modules or functionalities provided by a particular business intelligence software package provided by MICROSTRATEGY, INC.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3B","b":["104","48","90","92","30","104","104","106","108","110"]},"As shown in , supplier spend section  may be operable to display a summary of spending made by purchaser XYZ Systems, Inc. from supplier ABC, Inc.

In particular embodiments, display  is presented by an Internet browser and includes various icons, pull-down menus and\/or hypertext items (which may include underlined and\/or colored text, for example) that may be selected by a user to retrieve additional information regarding particular items. For example, as shown in , a user may select the hypertext item  labeled \u201cGlobal_Alliance_Agreement.doc\u201d to retrieve a display of the particular electronic contract  associated with that filename such that the user may browse through the text of that particular electronic contract .","Returning to , in operation, contracts management component  may periodically update its various databases and modules. It should be understood that events described throughout this document as occurring \u201cperiodically\u201d include events that occur at regular, irregular or random intervals and\/or events that are triggered by the occurrence of various other events. For example, electronic contracts module  may periodically receive new electronic contracts , such as electronic contracts  generated by document processing sub-component . Text mining module  may periodically analyze electronic contracts database  to extract new relevant information , to modify, replace, or delete existing relevant information  and\/or to generate new or updated contract pointers .","In particular embodiments, text mining module  is operable to extract relevant information  from at least the new electronic contracts  each time one or more new electronic contracts  are added to electronic contracts database . In addition, text mining module  may be operable to extract new or updated relevant information  from some or all electronic contracts  stored in electronic contracts database  in response to a modification, addition or deletion of one or more linguistic rules  stored in linguistic rules database . Linguistic rules  may be added, deleted or modified periodically, such as when a new business issue  is identified, for example. In a particular embodiment, text mining module  is operable to \u201cre-mine,\u201d or re-analyze all of the electronic contracts  stored in electronic contracts database  to extract a new set of relevant information  each time one or more new electronic contracts  are added to electronic contracts database .
