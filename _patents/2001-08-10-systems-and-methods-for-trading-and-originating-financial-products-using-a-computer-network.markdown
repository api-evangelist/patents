{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/224,240 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Trading and Originating Commercial Loans Using a Computer Network\u201d filed Aug. 10, 2000, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to systems and methods for providing information relating to financial products such as commercial loans. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention are directed to a data processing system for buying, selling, trading, originating, and providing information on financial products over a computer network, such as the Internet.","During the past decade, institutions having loans on their balance sheets have moved from a \u201chold to maturity\u201d philosophy to a proactive portfolio management model. The larger, more sophisticated institutions first adopted the proactive portfolio management model, and this popularity of this model has migrated down to smaller institutions. Managers of such proactive portfolios, such as executives, often are concerned with four issues: liquidity, capacity, exposure, and credit risk. Such executives are increasingly recognizing the emerging secondary whole loan market as the appropriate mechanism for managing these concerns.","The secondary whole loan market is in its infancy, however and still lacks necessary efficiencies and liquidity. Trading and originating commercial loans currently is handled in a costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming manner. The lack of a centralized clearing mechanism for commercial loans hampers both sellers and buyers of commercial loans.","Executives and other sellers of commercial loans face a number of obstacles. For example, the commercial loan market is fragmented and has no central clearing mechanism, making it difficult to locate the best buyer for a given loan. Frequently, executives are unable to inform more than a few buyers about a commercial loan opportunity. Such limited distribution of opportunities limit the efficiency with which a transaction can occur and can result in a seller not achieving the best price or terms for the sale. In addition, lack of historical transaction data impedes the ability of parties to a transaction to price assets quickly and accurately. This makes the analysis of a sell decision inefficient and time-consuming.","Even if executives overcome these obstacles, usually there is a long delay between the decision to sell and the actual execution of the sale, further complicating the process and increasing the risk of not achieving the required sale price. The inefficiencies and lack of internal resources often force executives to make less desirable decisions. For example many parties allocate internal resources to make the necessary divestitures to maintain liquidity or asset\/liability maturity requirements. The parties often turn away potentially profitable new loans because of geographic, product, or borrower diversification purposes. In the case of sub or non-performing assets, the remaining choices are to employ expensive and time-consuming workout strategies or do nothing.","Investors trying to acquire loans run into many of the same problems described above. Investors also incur significant time and dollar expenses performing acquisition due diligence, and run into supply limitations due to the unpredictable nature of deal flow.","There are at least three significant obstacles to efficient secondary market trading and participation: the inability to readily price assets in relation to existing market conditions, the inability of sellers to quickly and effectively reach a broad and qualified investor audience, and the significant time and cost associated with conducting traditional due diligence.","In at least one embodiment, the invention provides publicly available mark-to-market tools that enable users to price their assets at any time. In at least one embodiment, the invention provides a pricing model that gives sellers an indication of an asset's market value given its individual characteristics and prevailing market conditions.","In at least one embodiment, the invention provides an efficient marketplace for trading commercial debt, including an open, market-driven exchange that reduces transaction costs, compresses transaction cycles, and enables extended buyer and seller participation in the secondary commercial debt market.","In at least one embodiment, the invention solves and addresses portfolio managers' concerns by providing a vertical Internet portal for the auction of commercial loans. This solution provides liquidity and efficiency in the secondary commercial loan market and enables executives to appropriately address their portfolio management needs. In another aspect, the present invention provides an Internet location that can serve as a central clearing mechanism for listing and auctioning financial products such as commercial loans. This Internet location provides benefits. First, it provides a consolidated site for sellers, buyers, agents, borrowers, and service providers to list, evaluate, solicit, and bid on loans. In addition, it is automated to compress the auction cycle and reduce overall transaction costs, which helps connect and expand the universe of buyers and sellers.","In another embodiment, the invention includes systems and methods providing quick, accurate, and free pricing information that can dramatically increase loan sale transaction volume. In still another embodiment of the invention, the portal includes proprietary pricing tools which, when coupled with historical performance data (also proprietary), can achieve extremely high execution rates for bringing loans to market. For example, one version of the proprietary pricing tools and proprietary performance data helped the inventors achieve a 97% execution rate when bringing loans to market.","These and other embodiments of the present invention help lower transaction and opportunity costs, enabling embodiments of the present invention to consolidate and dominate this fragmented and rapidly expanding market.","In at least one embodiment, the invention provides a method for trading financial products over a computer network. Seller information is received from a first client, the seller information relating to a financial product offered for sale on behalf of a seller, at least some of the seller information comprising due diligence information, the due diligence information capable of fulfilling at least a portion of a request for due diligence on the financial product. The seller information about the financial product is stored in a database. A second client is provided with an opportunity to obtain the due diligence information on behalf of a potential buyer of the financial product. A bid is stored for the financial product from the second client in the database, if it can be shown that second client has obtained the due diligence information.","Embodiments of this aspect can include the following. In one embodiment, the due diligence information comprises an electronic representation of a physical due diligence document, such as an electronic image substantially replicating the physical due diligence document. In one embodiment, the second client can request information relating to the financial product, including the due diligence information. In one embodiment, the second client can be provided with a list of financial products offered for sale, and in one embodiment the second client can search for financial products offered for sale that meet a condition, such as a condition specified by the second client. In at least one embodiment, the second client can place a bid on the financial product, and in at least one embodiment the bid can be accepted on behalf of the seller.","In at least one embodiment, the above method further includes the step of computing a price for the financial product. The price is based at least in part on at least one of the following: market information (which can, for example, include at least one indicator selected from the group consisting of U.S. Federal Funds rate, U.S. prime rate, bond rate, U.S. treasury bill rate, U.S. treasury bond rate, U.S. treasury note rate, S&P 500 index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ Combined Composite Index.), seller information, due diligence information, and trade history information (which can, for example relate to at least one bid for a financial product that was accepted.)","In another aspect, at least one embodiment of the invention provides a computerized exchange for trading financial products, wherein the exchange is accessible using a computer network, comprising a server, a pricing engine, and a database. The server is in operable communication with a client and is programmed for receiving requests from a client to price a financial product offered for sale. The pricing engine is in communication with the server and computes a price for the financial product offered for sale, the price based at least in part on at least one of the following: market information, information that the seller has provided about the financial product; information that the client provides about the financial product, due diligence information, and trade history information. The database stores information relating to the least one financial product offered for sale and the computed price for that financial product.","In another aspect, in at least one embodiment, the invention comprises a computerized system for trading financial products, comprising means for receiving information about at least one financial product for sale, the information including due diligence information capable of fulfilling at least a portion of a request for due diligence on the financial product; means for computing a price on the financial product, the price based at least in part on at least one of the following: market information, information received about the financial product, due diligence information, and trade history information; means for providing a potential bidder on the financial product with the due diligence information and a price for the financial product; and means for storing a bid on the financial product if the bidder has received the due diligence information on the financial product.","The foregoing and other objects, aspects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description and from the appendices.","The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead generally being placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention.","As used herein, the Internet refers at least to a collection of networks and gateways that use the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols to communicate with one another.

In addition, Content Management , in one embodiment, includes an interface permitting the management and download of templates used by Sellers to prepare the documentation for financial products they want to sell, along with the ability to upload this information to the site. Examples of this interface are provided herein.","Financial Product Management  is a Subsystem for allowing a Seller to specify a financial product (e.g., loan, security, certificate of deposit, mutual fund, etc.), a Buyer to specify the type of financial product she is interested in buying, and the function to match Buyers to Sellers based on the criteria specified by each. Financial Product Management , in at least one embodiment, includes screens and forms used to collect information about the financial product from the Seller. For example, Financial Product Management  can include features such as financial product summaries, detailed financial product information (such as pictures, maps, text and spreadsheets), which can be provided by the Seller, a third party, and\/or the administrator of the system , and financial product pricing. In addition, Financial Product Management , in one embodiment, includes all screens and logic to display financial product information to potential Buyers. These features and functions are illustrated and described more fully herein.","Financial product pricing, in accordance with the invention, can be determined in a number of different ways, as will be described herein. For example, in at least one embodiment, the loan pricing is determined using the Pricing Engine subsystem , described more fully herein. In at least one embodiment, the financial product pricing is determined by an analyst (i.e., a person). In at least one embodiment, the financial product price is determined using a combination of information from both the Pricing Engine Pricing Engine  and the analyst. However, in at least one embodiment, the Pricing Engine Pricing Engine  is entirely automatic. Pricing Engine Pricing Engine .","In one embodiment of the invention, financial product information is provided in summary form to a prospective Buyer or other user. The summary form, in one embodiment, is generated automatically, using templates a user receives from information provided in forms filled out by a Seller. In at least one embodiment, the summary form of financial product information is created at least in part by an individual accessing the information. Buyers can obtain detailed information and\/or materials (e.g., due diligence information, such as certificates of insurance, etc,) about a given financial product, as well. In at least one embodiment, a fee is charged for at least some of the detailed information about the financial product for sale. In addition, in one embodiment of the invention, Buyers cannot bid on or purchase a financial product for sale unless the system  has proof that the Buyer has at least been provided with the appropriate due diligence information. This feature, provided in at least one embodiment of the invention, can help to satisfy National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) requirements. For example, in one embodiment, this proof is satisfied by a Buyer's purchasing the due diligence materials. Examples of these materials and this process are discussed in more detail herein.","In at least one embodiment, Financial Product Management  includes an interface permitting a Seller to upload financial product data and materials and request the generation of a detailed financial product summary for a specific financial product the Seller is offering for sale, so that potential buyers can have access to that information. As noted previously, the generation of the detailed financial product summary can be automated, accomplished by one or more persons, or a combination of the two. In at least one embodiment, selected individuals (called \u201cQuality Control\u201d representatives and managers) are assigned to manage and monitor one or more financial products associated with one or more Sellers, so in at least this embodiment, the Financial Product Management  includes screens and logic to allow a Quality Control Representative to view the list of financial products he\/she is responsible for and for a Quality Control Manager to allocate and assign loans to Quality Control Representatives.","For example, a Quality Control Representative can assist a bidder with questions the bidder has about a financial product for sale, any information about or documentation for the financial product, the bidding process, or about the seller of the financial product. Quality Control Representatives, in one embodiment, have access to at least a portion of the Seller  and Buyer  information (including, for example, lists of financial products that a Buyer  has bid on, lists of documentation associated with a given financial product, etc.), and can monitor the bidding process for one or more financial products. Quality Control Managers, in one embodiment, have access to at least a portion of the Seller  and Buyer  information, as well, and further have access to and can monitor the actions of the Quality Control Representatives.","Transaction Management , in one embodiment, is a subsystem that provides for the handling and tracking of financial product transactions, such as between Buyers and Sellers. Transaction Management  includes substantially all screens and logic to allow a Buyer to bid on or to buy a specific financial product offered by a Seller and can allow the Seller to accept or reject a specific bid from a Buyer. In at least one embodiment, Transaction Management  includes logic and\/or rules that permit the system  to take action on behalf of a Buyer or a Seller. For example, Transaction Management  can include logic whereby it is authorized to accept a bid from a Buyer on behalf of a Seller if a specified condition (e.g., price) is met. In a similar example, Transaction Management  can include logic whereby it is authorized to place bids for a financial product on behalf of a Buyer, in accordance with one or more conditions.","In one embodiment, Transaction Management  includes logic to implement one or more types of auctions of a financial product offered for sale, including sealed-bid format and \u201cEnglish\u201d auction format. In one embodiment, the sealed bid format presents the bidder (also referred to herein as the Buyer) with a form to enter the bid and provide any contingencies to the bid (e.g., \u201cThis bid is valid if the seller can substantiate that the borrower is willing to close on Sep. 19, 2001\u201d). In the English auction format, bids are accepted without contingencies.","In one embodiment, Transaction Management  can also include the logic and screens required to allow Buyers and Sellers to close the transaction (either by completing it or aborting it) using the system . In at least one embodiment, however, closing the transaction is accomplished outside of the system .","Referring again to , Marketing Reports  includes logic and forms to interface with tools such as Crystal Reports (available from Crystal Decisions, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.) and the like to generate \u201cAdHoc\u201d Marketing Reports. In one embodiment, the Marketing Reports  includes design and implementation within Crystal Reports or similar tool of approximately 12 standard Marketing Reports.","The Search\/Filter subsystem  is a component that matches user-provided search criteria with Seller\u2014provided financial product information previously uploaded to the system . In one embodiment, searches (also referred to herein as a financial product \u201cfilter,\u201d e.g., \u201cloan filter\u201d) are filtered by one or more criteria. For example, the Search\/Filter subsystem  of one embodiment can filter searches by criteria such as Geographic Location, Loan Type, Loan Amount, Interest Rate Range, Maturity Status, Loan Quality (four subcategories), and\/or other criteria, as those skilled in the art will appreciate. Examples of searches and filtering in accordance with an embodiment of the invention are provided herein. In one embodiment, the Search\/Filter subsystem  includes substantially all forms and logic to perform the search function and present the information back to the user (e.g., a Buyer) conducting the search.","The Pricing Engine Pricing Engine  is a subsystem that computes a price for the loan. In at least one embodiment, the Pricing Engine  uses loan data received from the Seller, information (such as the current prime interest rate) obtained from third parties, historical financial product trade information, and\/or information provided by an Analyst to generate data that is used to compute a price for the loan. For example, in one embodiment, such data is provided to a spreadsheet program, such as MICROSOFT EXCEL (available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington), to price the loan. The resulting calculations are stored in the Financial Product Information database  and thereby made available to the Buyers, the Seller, Analysts or Quality Control Reps.","The Pricing Engine Pricing Engine , in one embodiment, includes substantially all screens and logic to allow a user to specify the loan to \u201cprice\u201d. In one embodiment, the Pricing Engine Pricing Engine  also bases its computations on additional loan pricing parameters, such as those provided by a Seller or an Analyst. In one embodiment, the Pricing Engine Pricing Engine  includes a \u201cback-end\u201d process that runs an instance of MICROSOFT EXCEL using the loan data, captures the MICROSOFT EXCEL output, and stores the information in the Financial Product Information database . Examples of the operation of the Pricing Engine Pricing Engine , in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, are provided herein. The Pricing Engine Pricing Engine , in one embodiment, includes logic to generate notifications to parties (e.g., Buyers, Sellers, etc.) to a transaction or potential transaction.","In at least one embodiment, the Pricing Engine  can provide a substantially \u201cquick\u201d estimate of the value of a financial product. This feature is referred to in the example embodiment shown herein as \u201cQuick Price\u201d. The price estimate is based at least in part on one or more assumptions, such as that a given financial product will perform according to its stated terms. This feature is explained more fully herein.","In one embodiment, a Notifier subsystem  generates these and other notifications. For example, Sellers can be notified, such as by a telephone call, letter, electronic mail message (\u201cemail\u201d), facsimile (\u201cfax\u201d), automated message, or other appropriate notification, whenever a Buyer has expressed interest in a financial product that the Seller  is selling, such as when a Buyer  has ordered due diligence materials relating to a financial product that the Seller  is selling. In another example, a Buyer  who has viewed a financial product and\/or ordered information about a financial product can be notified as to the closing date for bids on a given financial product. In still another example, a Buyer  who has bid on a financial product can receive notifications as to who has \u201cwon\u201d or \u201clost\u201d the bidding process.","Referring again to , the Off-the-Shelf Application Components  can include virtually any type of application component, including those regularly used in electronic commerce web sites, such as Credit Validation  and E-Mail . Credit Validation , on one embodiment, is an interface to an off-the-shelf credit card validation system used to handle the acceptance of payment for information about financial products, such as detailed financial product summaries, due diligence information, and other information provided to a Buyer or potential Buyer. Credit Validation , in one embodiment, includes substantially all forms and logic to allow the Buyer to initiate the interaction with the Credit Validation  to authorize the purchase, such as via a credit card or other suitable payment mechanism","In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, E-Mail  is an \u201cOff-the-shelf\u201d component (such as MICROSOFT OUTLOOK) used to allow a Buyer, Seller, or other entity to receive alerts from the system when events impacting a financial product occur. For example, a Buyer can receive notification when new due diligence materials become available, when a condition to the loan (e.g., term) has changed, when a bid higher than the Buyer's bid has been submitted, etc. E-Mail , in one embodiment, includes logic that detects these events and includes software to generate the e-mail using the commercial e-mail package.","The Administration Components  of at least one embodiment of the invention include Administration , Configure Site , and User Administration . Administration  is the administration tools used with the system .

The financial product can be a single product (e.g., a single loan) or a group of products (e.g., a group of loans, or a group of various types of financial products). Moreover, as described herein, at least some of the other types of actions provided by systems and methods of the present invention (such as pricing a financial product and bidding on a financial product) are similarly usable with at least some of these types of financial products.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["102","3","4","30","102","100","102","30","30","102","30"]},"When the system  receives the request (step ), it provides one or more forms to the Seller , such as pricing forms, so that the Seller  can provide the system  with some of the information needed to compute a price for the financial product.  are representative screen shots illustrating forms , , ,  that the system  provides to the Seller , in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, the forms , , ,  are constructed and arranged to automatically upload information that a Seller  has stored in another file, such as a spreadsheet file. In one embodiment, the system  stores a profile of the Seller , such that portions of the forms , , ,  can be \u201cfilled out\u201d by the system in advance (e.g., \u201cSeller's reference Number, Seller's name, etc.). The profile of a Seller , in one embodiment, also stores other information provided by a Seller , such as preferences, criteria for accepting bids, restrictions on bids (e.g., certain users may be prohibited from bidding), restrictions on access to information (bidders may be required to sign on and\/or acknowledge specific conditions before receiving information), specification of type of bidding to occur (e.g., type of auction), permission for the system  to accept bids on behalf of the Seller , etc. This type of information also can be provided in the forms , , , .","Referring again to , after the system  sends the forms , , ,  to the Seller  (step ) and receives a response (step ), the system  can compute a price for the financial product. In at least one embodiment, the Pricing Engine  uses data and characteristics about the financial product to compute the price for the financial product. The data and characteristics can include, but are limited to, parameters such as terms, time periods, conditions, locations, appraisals, discounts, liens, status, sponsors, servicing type, status, maturity, principal balance, financial product type, origination date, monthly payment, maturity date, interest rate, interest accrual method, and performance level.","As part of the price computation, the system  retrieves historical trade data (step ) that it has stored relating to prior trades. For example, the system  can use Transaction Management  and query its Transaction Data database  () to retrieve this data. This data helps the system  to analyze the relationship and similarity between the financial product being offered for sale and previous trades of financial products having one or more similar characteristics. For example, a Seller  may be listing a residential mortgage for a property with an outstanding loan balance of $310,000, an interest rate of 8.65%, a 30-year term, with an excellent payment history, which is located in a suburban community. The system  could then search for prior trades of other residential mortgages sharing some or all of these characteristics. The prior trade history could, for example, provide data such as cents on the dollar that the mortgage sold for on the secondary market and what factor(s) had the greatest impact on the price of the mortgage.","Based on the retrieved historical trade data, the system performs regression analysis (step ) using both the historical trade data and the seller's inputs, to get an estimate for how at least a portion of the various characteristics of the financial product affects the price of the financial product. Based on the results of the regression analysis, the system  then assigns a scaling factor (step ) to at least a portion of the characteristics (i.e., the various fields on the forms , , , ). The system  also takes into account external variables (step ), such as the U.S. Federal Funds rate, U.S. prime rate, bond rate, U.S. Treasury bill rate, U.S. Treasury bond rate, U.S. Treasury note rate, S&P 500 index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ Combined Composite Index. The system  can be provided with external variables from virtually any known source of the information, including trade journals such as the WALL STREET JOURNAL, BLOOMBERG BUSINESS NEWS, etc. In one embodiment, the system  can automatically retrieve the information from a known location (such as on a computer network). In one embodiment, a user such as a system administrator also can provide the information to the system  via manual input.","Referring again to , the system  computes a price for the financial product (step ) and provides the price to the Seller  (step ). If the Seller  accepts the computed price (step ), the system  stores the computed price as the selling price (step ) of the financial product. In at least one embodiment, if the Seller  has accepted the computed price, the financial product is identified as a \u201csponsored\u201d product (step ) and is stored as such. \u201cSponsored,\u201d in one embodiment, indicates to potential Buyers  at least that the price of the financial product can be relied on as having the approval of the entity sponsoring the website of the system .","The price computed in  can, in one embodiment, provide a benchmark for a Seller  to determine what price is appropriate for the financial product it is selling, given current market conditions and historical trade data. Sellers  can revisit the process of  at any time and can get a price appropriate to the market conditions and trade history then in existence. This feature may help Sellers  recognize the true market value of their financial products.","If, however, the Seller  does not accept the computed price, the system  prompts the Seller  for its own price (step ), which the system  receives and stores as the listed price for the financial product (step ). In at least one embodiment, financial products having seller-provided prices are identified in such a manner that potential Buyers  can determine that the financial product is not \u201csponsored\u201d (step ). In at least one embodiment, such products are labeled as \u201cdirect events\u201d.","After the system  has a price for the financial product (whether the system  computes it or whether the Seller  provides it), the system  prepares a summary of the financial product based on the information it has about the financial product (step ). In one embodiment, the summary is created by taking selected inputs from the forms , , ,  and putting them into a predetermined template. In at least one embodiment, the financial product summary is created automatically by the system , without human intervention. In one embodiment, the summary is created in whole or in part by a person, such as an Analyst (as described previously) who reviews the information to create the financial product summary. Examples and illustrations of the loan summary are provided herein (see, for example,  which illustrates an example screen shot of a loan summary for an example loan for sale, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.)","The system  also prepares a set of documentation on the financial product being offered for sale (step ), so that potential Buyers  can view the documents and conduct any necessary due diligence.

In addition to immediate information access, the features and advantages of the some embodiments of the invention (including at least the \u201cQuick Price\u201d, feature, the financial product computation tools, module, Forward Loan workflow tools, and automated email alerts that notify users when information on a selected financial product is updated,) as described herein, may facilitate the evaluation and workflow processes associated with trading financial products.","In one embodiment, the system  queries the Seller  for the necessary documents, which the Seller  can provide to the system in many different ways, including electronic transmission, physical mailing of the actual documents (in paper form, on diskette or CD-ROMs, etc). In at least one embodiment, the Seller  can upload some or all of the information, which can include standard financial product information data, to the system  in predetermined formats such as MICROSOFT WORD, MICROSOFT EXCEL, ADOBE ACROBAT, and the like. In at least one embodiment, the seller-provided information includes due diligence information that is capable of fulfilling at least a portion of a buyer's need for due diligence on the financial product. In at least one embodiment, the due diligence information comprises an electronic representation of a physical due diligence document, such as an electronic image substantially replicating the physical due diligence document. This is accomplished, in at least one embodiment, by using a document format such as PDF. In at least one embodiment, the due diligence information is scanned to create electronic image files representing the physical due diligence documents.","In one embodiment, the data uploaded to the site is in PDF format files built from Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel templates downloaded from the system . For example, this data can be original financial product data or updates to financial product data (if the Seller  resells the financial product).","After the necessary documentation and financial product information is received, the system  organizes the information (step ) for viewing and\/or purchase by entities such as potential Buyers . In at least one embodiment, the system  uses a standardized format to organize the documents and\/or the financial product summary, so that those accessing financial products have a consistent view and interface. The system  also can, if applicable, add links to information from third parties  that is of interest and\/or relevant to the financial product offered for sale.

The request can be a request for all listed financial products or can be a request for financial products meeting one or more criteria. For example, in one embodiment, when a user accesses the system , if the user has a profile stored on the system , and the profile lists loan criteria, the system  can automatically bring up financial products meeting the stored criteria. Although not shown here, in one embodiment, a user may store the results of previous searches and bring those searches up, as part of step .","The request of step , in one embodiment, is in the form of a search form, presented, for example, as part of a graphical user interface (GUI).

The search form  shown in  is provided by way of example only. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many different types of form and inputs can be used for querying for a financial product meeting a user's requirements. For example, in one embodiment, the system  can store a profile of a given user, where the profile specifies criteria that a user may have concerning financial products of interest and, based on that profile, conduct a search for financial products, automatically or upon request by a user.","Referring again to , based on the search criteria, the system  retrieves search results from its databases (step ). If there are no matches (step ), the system notifies the user (step ) and, if the user wants to search again (e.g., using different criteria) (step ), the system  conducts the search again. If the user does not want to search again, the process ends.","If there were matches to the search (step ), the system provides the results to the user (step ).  is a representative example screen shot illustrating the search results  resulting from a search for a financial product, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

As explained further herein, users are able to compute a price for the financial product based on specific requirements and terms. As with the processes of computing a price for Sellers , Buyers  can use at least one embodiment of the invention to determine an appropriate price for a given financial product, given the current market conditions and the trade history.","Referring again to , a user can request further information, including due diligence materials, about any financial product listed in the search results (step ). In at least one embodiment of the invention, if the user making such a request is not registered with the system  (step ), the user is prompted to register (step ) and, if the prompt is accepted (step ), the appropriate steps are taken to register the user (step ). If the user declines to register, the process ends and further information about the financial product is not provided. Registration can require the user to provide specific types of information and may require the user to sign or otherwise acknowledge certain obligations, such as confidentiality obligations, relating to the information to be provided to the user.","Registration can include the user reviewing the terms of his or her registration, and, if desired, can review the terms in another format, such as PDF. At this point, the newly registered user can be added to the system  using various techniques. For example, the user might be required to print out form, fill it in, and return it to the administrator of the system , the system can automatically enroll the user to the system, or the user can be added to the system using a combination of automatic enrollment and filling out forms. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many different methods for registering users and assigning corresponding authentication information (for example, a username and password) are within the spirit and scope of the invention.","The process shown in steps ,, , and  also can be used, in one embodiment, to obtain additional information from users (registered or otherwise) where applicable. For example, a Seller  may have as a condition of its listing the requirement that the system obtain certain additional information from a user before providing some or all of its loan information to a user.","Referring to , when the necessary conditions (e.g., registration or other conditions) are met, the system  provides information about the financial product to the user (step ).

However, in at least one embodiment of the invention, the system  tracks whether or not a Buyer  who is attempting to bid on a financial product has obtained the due diligence materials. One reason for doing this is to insure that the Seller  and\/or the system  have satisfied NASD requirements for disclosure prior to the sale of a financial product.","In at least one embodiment of the invention, if a user has obtained loan information, such as due diligence materials, the system  can provide the user with automatic updates for any additional information relevant to (or that the system  receives) about the loan. The updates can, for example, be provided periodically, or as needed, or at the request of a Seller , or at the request of a Buyer .","Referring again to , the user can take other actions after receiving the results of the search (step ). For example, the user can compute a price for a listed financial product (step ), which is explained more fully herein. This can be a \u201cquick price\u201d as described herein, or can be another pricing mechanism, such as that described below. If the time to bid for a financial product is approaching or is a predetermined amount of time away (e.g., three days), the system  notifies the user reviewing the information (steps  and ).","A user can also submit questions to the system  about a financial product and\/or any documentation that the user has received about the financial product (step ). The queries can be submitted in many different ways, including via a message sent over a computer network, such as an email, via a telephone call or fax to an administrator of the system , via a letter, or any other suitable means of communication. The system  can respond to the queries (step ) in similarly varied ways, and need not respond to the user in the manner in which a query was received. If necessary, in at least one embodiment, although not illustrated in , the system  can query a Seller  for any information or responses needed to respond to the query of a user. If the system  has updated financial product information (step ) to provide to a user, it can do so.","In at least one embodiment, the user can perform actions on the search results not illustrated here, such as \u201cHIDE\u201d and \u201cUNHIDE\u201d. With the \u201cHIDE\u201d function, a user may filter the list of search results further by \u201chiding\u201d any financial products that are not of interest. In this situation, subsequent user searches will not display \u201chidden\u201d loans. At any time, a user can \u201cUNHIDE\u201d search results to view all posted loans that meet his search criteria.","It should be understood that, in accordance with various embodiments of the invention, steps  through  can be done in virtually any order and need not be completed in the order shown.","In at least one embodiment of the invention, the system  can perform searches of financial products automatically on behalf of any entity for which the system  has stored a set of preferences or a profile. This type of search can be done on a periodic basis, or every time a new financial product for sale or information about a financial product for sale is added to the system , or any time any characteristic of a financial product changes, or on a basis set by a user (e.g., weekly, daily, etc.).  is a flowchart illustrating a process for automatically searching a database of financial products, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.","The system  receives one or more bidder preferences (step ), representing one or more criteria that a bidder has for the type of financial product he is looking for. In at least one embodiment, the bidder himself provides the bidder preferences. In at least one embodiment, the system  extrapolates at least one bidder preference based on the profile of the bidder. In at least one embodiment, the system extrapolates at least one bidder preference based on a bidder's trading history.","The system  selects at least one preference on which to search (step ), and searches its databases for financial products meeting the criteria in whole or in part (step ). If no matches are located (step ), the system can modify the criteria on which it searches (steps , ). For example, if no matches were found using five criteria specified by a bidder, the system  could attempt a search using just four of the five criteria. In at least one embodiment, a user can specify whether or not the system  can attempt such changes to the criteria.","If matches were found (step ), the system  can still attempt to determine whether the search should be expanded (step ). For example, if just one or two matches were located, the system  may attempt to modify the criteria to expand the results to some predetermined number of matches (step ).","The system  notifies bidders of any matches (or lack thereof) (step ), and can, if desired, store the results of its searches (step ). The notification can be by any suitable means, including email messages, postings to a personalized web page (which the system  can maintain for a bidder), telephone messages, fax messages, pager messages, letters, so-called \u201cInstant\u201d messages sent to a mobile communications device, and the like. The stored results can be used, for example, at a later time, such as when a bidder logs on to the system  and seeks more information about the financial products being sold.","As noted previously, users of the system  (including at least Buyers , Sellers , and visitors\/others) can price financial products offered for sale on the system .  is a flowchart illustrating a process for pricing a financial product, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.","A user of the system can submit a request to the system  to price a financial product (step ), and the system  provides the user with a pricing model form (step ).  is a representative screen shot illustrating a pricing form  for pricing a financial product, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. As  indicates, users input the characteristics of the financial product they are interested in purchasing, such as the type of product, the principal balance, etc. Generally, the characteristics the user enters correspond to the information that the user has received about a financial product. However, in at least one embodiment, the user's entries can deviate from the listed information. For example, a user may want to calculate a cash flow for a financial product that assumes a different interest rate than currently listed for the product.","The system  receives the pricing computation request (step ), and, if requested (step ) computes a price (step ) for the financial product. In at least one embodiment, the computation is done in substantially the same way as the computation done for a seller seeking a price (see ). For example, in , if the user presses the \u201ccalculate\u201d button , the system  returns a calculated price, such as in cents on the dollar, basis points, or other suitable measure, for the value of the financial product.  is a representative screen shot illustrating a form for performing a computation on a financial product, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, and  is a representative screen shot illustrating the results of the computation requested in the screen shot of , in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
