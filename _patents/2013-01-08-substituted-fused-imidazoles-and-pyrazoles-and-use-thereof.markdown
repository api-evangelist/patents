{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel substituted fused imidazoles and pyrazoles, to processes for preparation thereof, to the use thereof, alone or in combinations, for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to the use thereof for production of medicaments for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to bind to the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.","Through the formation of cGMP and the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial role in different physiological processes, more particularly in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion, and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in the event of disorders based on disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which can lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible NO-independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.","Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates, the effect of which is based on NO. This is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","A few years ago, some substances which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, were described, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681]. The more recent stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase include BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543 and riociguat (BAY 63-2521) (see, for example, Stasch J.-P. et al., 2006; 5: 755-768; Stasch J.-P. et al., 2009; 4: 853-865. Stasch J.-P. et al., 2011; 123: 2263-2273). Interestingly, some of these sGC stimulators, for example YC-1 or BAY 41-2272, also exhibit PDE5-inhibitory action in addition to direct guanylate cyclase stimulation. In order to maximize the cGMP pathway, it is pharmacologically desirable to stimulate the synthesis of cGMP and simultaneously to inhibit degradation via PDE-5. This dual principle is particularly advantageous in pharmacological terms (see, for example, Oudout et al., Eur. Urol. 2011, 60, 1020-1026.).","The dual principle is fulfilled in the context of the present invention when the inventive compounds exhibit an effect on recombinant guanylate cyclase reporter cell lines according to the study in B-2 as the minimal effective concentration (MEC) of \u22663 \u03bcM and exhibit inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) according to the study in B-6 as IC>100 nM.","Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) is the name of one of the enzymes which cleave the phosphoric ester bond in cGMP, forming 5\u2032-guanosine monophosphate (5\u2032-GMP). In humans, phosphodiesterase-5 occurs predominantly in the smooth musculature of the corpus cavernosum penis and the pulmonary arteries. Blockage of cGMP degradation by inhibition of PDE5 (with, for example, sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil) leads to increased signals of the relaxation signalling pathways and specifically to increased blood supply in the corpus cavernosum penis and lower pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels. They are used for treatment of erectile dysfunction and of pulmonary arterial hypertension. As well as PDE5, there are further, exclusively cGMP-cleaving phosphodiesterases (Stasch J.-P. et al. 2011).","As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, WO 00\/06568 and WO 00\/06569 disclose fused pyrazole derivatives, and WO 03\/095451 carbamate-substituted 3-pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines. 3-Pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines with phenylamide substituents are described in E. M. Becker et al., 1 (13), 2001. WO 2004\/009590 describes pyrazolopyridines with substituted 4-aminopyrimidines for treatment of CNS disorders. WO 2010\/065275 and WO 2011\/149921 disclose substituted pyrrolo- and dihydropyridopyrimidines as sGC activators. As sGC stimulators, WO 2012\/004259 describes fused aminopyrimidines, and WO 2012\/004258, WO 2012\/143510 and WO 2012\/152629 fused pyrimidines and triazines. WO 2012\/28647 discloses pyrazolopyridines with various azaheterocycles for treatment of cardiovascular disorders.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (dual principle) and have an identical or improved therapeutic profile compared to the compounds known from the prior art, for example with respect to their in vivo properties, for example their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and\/or their metabolic profile and\/or their dose-activity relationship.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"43.60mm","wi":"51.22mm","file":"US09023849-20150505-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}],"sup":"3 ","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["where","Ris hydrogen, deuterium, fluorine, chlorine, iodine, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkenyl, (C-C)-alkynyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, phenyl or 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl,\n        \n        ","where","# is the attachment site to the carbonyl group,","## is the attachment site to the pyrimidine or triazine ring,","m is a number 0, 1 or 2,","Ris hydrogen, fluorine, (C-C)-alkyl, hydroxyl or amino,\n        \n        ","Ris hydrogen, fluorine, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl, cyano, (C-C)-cycloalkyl, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy or a group of the formula -M-R,\n        \n        ","Rand Rtogether with the carbon atom to which they are bonded form a (C-C)-alkenyl group, an oxo group, a 3- to 6-membered carbocycle or a 4- to 7-membered heterocycle,\n        \n        ","Ris hydrogen, fluorine, (C-C)-alkyl or hydroxyl,","Ris hydrogen, fluorine, (C-C)-alkyl or trifluoromethyl,\n\nthe ring Q is 8- to 9-membered heteroaryl,\n"]}},"Ris halogen, cyano, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl, hydroxyl, oxo or (C-C)-alkoxy,","n is a number 0, 1 or 2,","Ris trifluoromethyl, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl, phenyl or 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl,\n    \n    "]}},"Inventive compounds are the compounds of the formula (I) and the N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof, the compounds, encompassed by formula (I), of the formulae specified hereinafter and the N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof, and the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter as working examples and the N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts thereof, to the extent that the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter are not already N-oxides, salts, solvates and solvates of the N-oxides and salts.","Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically compatible salts of the inventive compounds. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the inventive compounds.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds include acid addition salts of mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulphonic acids, for example salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, naphthalenedisulphonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds also include salts of conventional bases, by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, by way of example and with preference ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","In the context of the invention, solvates refer to those forms of the inventive compounds which, in solid or liquid state, form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of the solvates in which the coordination is with water. Preferred solvates in the context of the present invention are hydrates.","Depending on their structure, the inventive compounds may exist in different stereoisomeric forms, i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or if appropriate also as conformational isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers). The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers and diastereomers, and the respective mixtures thereof. The stereoisomerically homogeneous constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this, in particular HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","If the inventive compounds can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the inventive compounds. An isotopic variant of an inventive compound is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the inventive compound has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into an inventive compound are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of an inventive compound, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active ingredient distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. Furthermore, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic advantages as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the inventive compounds may therefore, in some cases, also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the inventive compounds can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and\/or starting compounds.","In addition, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the inventive compounds. The term \u201cprodrugs\u201d here denotes compounds which may themselves be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) to inventive compounds during their residence time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, the substituents, unless specified otherwise, are each defined as follows:","Alkyl in the context of the invention is a linear or branched alkyl radical having the number of carbon atoms specified in each case.

For this purpose, they can be administered in a suitable manner, for example by the oral, parenteral, pulmonal, nasal, sublingual, lingual, buccal, rectal, dermal, transdermal, conjunctival, otic route, or as an implant or stent.","For these administration routes, the inventive compounds can be administered in suitable administration forms.","Suitable administration forms for oral administration are those which work according to the prior art, which release the inventive compounds rapidly and\/or in a modified manner and which contain the inventive compounds in crystalline and\/or amorphized and\/or dissolved form, for example tablets (uncoated or coated tablets, for example with gastric juice-resistant or retarded-dissolution or insoluble coatings which control the release of the inventive compound), tablets or films\/oblates which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity, films\/lyophilizates or capsules (for example hard or soft gelatin capsules), sugar-coated tablets, granules, pellets, powders, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols or solutions.","Parenteral administration can bypass an absorption step (e.g. intravenously, intraarterially, intracardially, intraspinally or intralumbally) or include an absorption (e.g. intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracutaneously, percutaneously or intraperitoneally). Suitable administration forms for parenteral administration include injection and infusion formulations in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilizates or sterile powders.","For the other administration routes, suitable examples are inhalable medicament forms (including powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions or sprays, tablets, films\/oblates or capsules for lingual, sublingual or buccal administration, suppositories, ear or eye preparations, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions (lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal therapeutic systems (e.g. patches), milk, pastes, foams, sprinkling powders, implants or stents.","Preference is given to oral or parenteral administration, especially oral administration.","The inventive compounds can be converted to the administration forms listed. This can be accomplished in a manner known per se by mixing with inert nontoxic pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These excipients include carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecylsulphate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabilizers (e.g. antioxidants, for example ascorbic acid), dyes (e.g. inorganic pigments, for example iron oxides) and flavour and\/or odour correctants.","In general, it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg\/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration, the dose is about 0.001 to 2 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.001 to 1 mg\/kg, of body weight.","It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts, specifically as a function of the body weight, route of administration, individual response to the active ingredient, nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. For instance, in some cases, less than the aforementioned minimum amount may be sufficient, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of greater amounts, it may be advisable to divide them into several individual doses over the day.","The working examples which follow illustrate the invention.

The blank value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration, and so the selected data set encompasses the period from 7.00 am on the day of the experiment to 9.00 am the following day.","The data are smoothed over an adjustable period by determination of the average (15-minute average) and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred to Excel templates and tabulated. For each day of the experiment, the data obtained are stored in a dedicated file bearing the experiment number. Results and test protocols are filed in order in paper form sorted by numbers.","Literature","Klaus Witte, Kai Hu, Johanna Swiatek, Claudia M\u00fcssig, Georg Ertl and Bj\u00f6rn Lemmer: Experimental heart failure in rats: effects on cardiovascular circadian rhythms and on myocardial \u03b2-adrenergic signaling.

Determination of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Intravenous and Oral Administration:","The pharmacokinetic parameters of the inventive compounds are determined in male CD-1 mice, male Wistar rats and female beagles. Intravenous administration in the case of mice and rats is effected by means of a species-specific plasma\/DMSO formulation, and in the case of dogs by means of a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. In all species, oral administration of the dissolved substance is performed via gavage, based on a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. The taking of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right Vena jugularis externa prior to substance administration. The operation is effected at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anaesthesia and administration of an analgesic (atropine\/rimadyl (3\/1) 0.1 ml s.c.). The blood is taken (generally more than 10 time points) within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. When the blood is taken, it is passed into heparinized tubes. Then the blood plasma is obtained by centrifugation and is optionally stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (which may also be a chemically unrelated substance) is added to the samples of the inventive compounds, calibration samples and qualifiers, and there follows protein precipitation by means of acetonitrile in excess. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions, and subsequent vortexing, is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analysed by means of LC-MS\/MS using C18 reversed-phase columns and variable eluent mixtures. The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.","The plasma concentration\/time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, t(terminal half life), MRT (mean residence time) and CL (clearance), using a validated pharmacokinetic calculation program.","Since the substance quantification is performed in plasma, it is necessary to determine the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose, a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the plasma concentration is measured (by means of LC-MS\/MS; see above) and determined by calculating the ratio of the c\/cvalue.","B-5. Metabolic Study","To determine the metabolic profile of the inventive compounds, they are incubated with recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, liver microsomes or primary fresh hepatocytes from various animal species (e.g. rats, dogs), and also of human origin, in order to obtain and to compare information about substantially the complete phase I and phase II metabolism, and about the enzymes involved in the metabolism.","The inventive compounds were incubated with a concentration of about 0.1-10 \u03bcM. For this purpose, stock solutions of the inventive compounds having a concentration of 0.01-1 mM in acetonitrile were prepared, and then pipetted with 1:100 dilution into the incubation mixture. The liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH-generating system consisting of 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 1 unit glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes were incubated in suspension in Williams E medium, likewise at 37\u00b0 C. After an incubation time of 0-4 h, the incubation mixtures were stopped with acetonitrile (final concentration approx. 30%) and the protein was centrifuged off at approx. 15 000\u00d7g. The samples thus stopped were either analysed directly or stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until analysis.","The analysis is effected by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-UV-MS\/MS). For this purpose, the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed with suitable C18 reversed-phase columns and variable eluent mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution or 0.05% formic acid. The UV chromatograms in conjunction with mass spectrometry data serve for identification, structural elucidation and quantitative estimation of the metabolite, and for quantitative metabolic assessment of the inventive compound in the incubation mixtures.","B-6. Inhibition of Human Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5)","PDE 5 preparations are obtained from human platelets by disruption (Microfluidizer\u00ae, 800 bar, 3 passes), followed by centrifugation (75 000 g, 60 min, 4\u00b0 C.) and ion exchange chromatography of the supernatant on a Mono Q 10\/10 column (linear sodium chloride gradient, elution with a 0.2-0.3M solution of sodium chloride in buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 2 mM magnesium chloride). Fractions having PDE 5 activity are combined (PDE 5 preparation) and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.","To determine their in vitro action on human PDE 5, the test substances are dissolved in 100% DMSO and serially diluted. Typically, dilution series (1:3) from 200 \u03bcM to 0.091 \u03bcM are prepared (resulting final concentrations in the test: 4 \u03bcM to 0.0018 \u03bcM). In each case 2 \u03bcl of the diluted substance solutions are placed into the wells of microtitre plates (Isoplate-96\/200 W; Perkin Elmer). Subsequently, 50 \u03bcl of a dilution of the above-described PDE 5 preparation are added. The dilution of the PDE 5 preparation is selected such that, during the later incubation, less than 70% of the substrate is converted (typical dilution: 1:100; dilution buffer: 50 mM tris\/hydrochloric acid pH 7.5, 8.3 mM magnesium chloride, 1.7 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA). The substrate, [8-H]cyclic guanosine-3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (1 \u03bcCi\/\u03bcl; Perkin Elmer) is diluted 1:2000 with assay buffer (50 mM tris\/hydrochloric acid pH 7.5, 8.3 mM magnesium chloride, 1.7 mM EDTA) to a concentration of 0.0005 \u03bcCi\/\u03bcl. By addition of 50 \u03bcl (0.025 \u03bcCi) of the diluted substrate, the enzyme reaction is finally started. The test mixtures are incubated at room temperature for 60 min and the reaction is stopped by adding 25 \u03bcl of a suspension of 18 mg\/ml yttrium scintillation proximity beads in water (phosphodiesterase beads for SPA assays, RPNQ 0150, Perkin Elmer). The microtitre plates are sealed with a film and left to stand at room temperature for 60 min Subsequently, the plates are analysed for 30 s per well in a Microbeta scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). ICvalues are determined using the graphic plot of the substance concentration against percentage PDE 5 inhibition.","Representative ICvalues for the inventive compounds are reproduced in the table below (table 3):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0572","num":"0863"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 3"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Example No.","IC[nM]"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"2","3700"]},{"entry":[{},"3","690"]},{"entry":[{},"5","440"]},{"entry":[{},"6","690"]},{"entry":[{},"8","400"]},{"entry":[{},"9","85"]},{"entry":[{},"10","480"]},{"entry":[{},"11","4000"]},{"entry":[{},"12","3500"]},{"entry":[{},"15","310"]},{"entry":[{},"16","64"]},{"entry":[{},"17","230"]},{"entry":[{},"18","16"]},{"entry":[{},"19","370"]},{"entry":[{},"21","75"]},{"entry":[{},"22","530"]},{"entry":[{},"23","440"]},{"entry":[{},"24","25"]},{"entry":[{},"25","160"]},{"entry":[{},"26","95"]},{"entry":[{},"27","340"]},{"entry":[{},"28","450"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The organ-protective effects of the sGC stimulators were shown in a therapeutically relevant \u201clow nitric oxide (NO)\/high renin\u201d hypertension model in rats.

NO-independent stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase reduces target organ damage in low- and high-renin models of hypertension. J. Hypertension. 2010; 28: 1666-1675). This involved treating renin-transgenic rats (TGR(mRen2)27) to which the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME had been administered via drinking water simultaneously with an sGC stimulator or vehicle over several weeks. Haemodynamic and renal parameters were determined during the treatment period.
