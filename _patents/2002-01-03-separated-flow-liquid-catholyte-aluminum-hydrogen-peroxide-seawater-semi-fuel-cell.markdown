U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,296,184 to Stachurski, U.S. Pat. No. 4,352,864 to Struthers, U.S. Pat. No. 4,485,154 to Remick et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,492,741 to Struthers, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,659 to Zito show some of the electrochemical power cells that have been developed.","The '184 patent to Stachurski illustrates an electrochemical cell which has at least two compartments separated by a semi-permeable membrane. The compartments contain first and second solvents, electrolyte and electrode. The first compartment is divided by a membrane which behaves as a bipolar electrode during the passage of electric current.","The '864 patent to Struthers illustrates a fuel cell which has a metal anode immersed in a base electrolyte solution and connected with an electric circuit, a cathode comprising an acid solution, a carbon catalyst and electron distributor plate in that solution and connected with an electron supply and a wettable impermeable membrane and disposed between the electrolyte and cathode solution and establishing an acid-base reaction interface where hydroxide ions are generated for conduction through the electrolyte to the anode.","The '154 patent to Remick et al. illustrates an electrically rechargeable anionically active reduction-oxidation electric storage-supply system and process. The system and process use a sodium or potassium sulfide-polysulfide anolyte reaction and an iodide-polyiodide, chloride-chlorine, or bromide-bromine species catholyte reaction. The catholyte and anolyte are separated by an ion selective membrane permeable to positive sodium and potassium ions and substantially impermeable to negative bromide, chloride, iodide, sulfide and polysulfide ions.","The '741 patent to Struthers illustrates a primary fuel cell including an elongate case defining a central ion exchange compartment with opposite ends and containing a liquid ionolyte. The case also defines an anode section at one end of the case and including a gas compartment containing boron monoxide gas fuel, a liquid compartment between the gas compartment and the ion exchange compartment and containing a liquid anolyte. The ionolyte and anolyte are separated by a cationic membrane. The gas and liquid compartments are separated by an anode plate including an electron collector part, a catalyst material carried by the part and a gas permeable hydrophobic membrane between the boron monoxide gas and the catalyst material.","The '659 patent to Zito illustrates an electrochemical apparatus having at least one cell. Each cell has a positive electrode and a negative electrode with a dual membrane in each cell dividing it into positive chambers for posilyte and anolyte solutions which are recirculated through separate pumps and storage tanks and back to the chambers. The dual membranes in each cell provide a third chamber between the positive chamber and the negative chamber through which an idler electrolyte is circulated.","Emphasis has been placed on aluminum and magnesium anodes due to their high faradic capacity, low atomic weight and high standard potentials. Of particular interest is their application to undersea vehicles due to the availability of seawater to act as an electrolyte or electrolyte solution, thus further enhancing their effectiveness as an energy source on a systems basis.","A useful electrochemical energy source must permit high voltages, have a large storage capacity, operate safely, and reliably deliver the stored energy over extended discharge times. Therefore, the energy source must achieve a reasonably high cell potential, have a high Faradaic capacity, and have a high energy density at low current densities. Additionally, the energy source must be relatively inexpensive, environmentally, and SSN friendly, safe, capable of a long shelf life, and not prone to spontaneous chemical or electrochemical discharge.","High energy density Al-Aqueous primary batteries and semi-fuel cells for high current density (>500 mA\/cm) applications have been developed. These include aluminum-silver oxide and aluminum-hydrogen peroxide semi-fuel cells. U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,905 to Marsh et al. illustrates one such battery. In the Marsh et al. patent, a dual flow aluminum hydrogen peroxide battery is provided comprising an aqueous hydrogen peroxide catholyte, an aqueous anolyte, a porous solid electrocatalyst capable of reducing the hydrogen peroxide and separating the anolyte from the catholyte, and an aluminum anode positioned within the anolyte. The separation of the catholyte and anolyte chambers helps prevent hydrogen peroxide poisoning of the aluminum anode.","Despite these systems, there remains a need for a system with still better performance, particularly one in which the chemical reaction of the solution phase catholyte with the aluminum anode is eliminated.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a semi-fuel cell which has improved performance.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a semi-fuel cell as above which has improved electrochemical efficiency and which can be used as a seawater energy source.","It is still a further object of the present invention to provide an improved method for operating a semi-fuel cell.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an improved cathode for use in a semi-fuel cell.","The foregoing objects are attained by the semi-fuel cell, the method, and the cathode of the present invention.","In accordance with the present invention, a semi-fuel cell broadly comprises a housing, an anode and a porous cathode in the housing, an aqueous catholyte stream flowing within the housing, an aqueous anolyte stream flowing in the housing and separated from the catholyte stream, and means for preventing migration of the catholyte through the porous cathode and into the anolyte stream. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the anolyte stream comprises a stream of NaOH\/seawater electrolyte, the catholyte comprises an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, and the preventing means comprises a membrane attached to or impregnated into the porous cathode, which membrane allows passage of OH ions through the membrane while inhibiting the flow of hydrogen peroxide through the membrane.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for operating a semi-fuel cell broadly comprises the steps of: providing a housing having at least one anode and at least one porous cathode; flowing a catholyte stream into contact with said at least one porous cathode through at least one catholyte channel; flowing an anolyte stream into contact with at least one anode through at least one anolyte channel; and preventing contact between each respective anolyte stream and each respective catholyte stream.","Other details of the semi-fuel cell of the present invention, as well as other advantages and objects attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","14","16","16","18"]},"Each cell stack  is hydraulically fed in parallel via an inlet conduit  with seawater and a low-concentration, 4 wt % sodium hydroxide aqueous electrolyte. The catholyte, consisting of a hydrogen peroxide solution, is carried separately and injected directly into the electrolyte and seawater mixture upstream of the cell gap at the required concentration, as determined by the system power load. An outlet conduit  is provided to remove spent electrolyte and spent catholyte.","Electrochemical reduction of the cathodic species, or catholyte, occurs on the electrocatalyst surface of the electrodes , receiving electrons from the anode oxidation reaction, which is depicted in FIG. . In a system such as this, the half cell and overall cell reactions can be written as follows:\n\n","The problem with this type of system is that the catholyte, in this case hydrogen peroxide, is allowed to come into direct contact with the aluminum anode, resulting in a parasitic direct chemical reaction which does not produce electron transfer and only consumes active energetic materials, thus reducing the overall energy yield of the system. In most cases, this parasitic reaction will consume over 50% of the available energetic materials.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00035","num":"00035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["30","30"]},"The cell stack  has a housing  which may be formed from any suitable material known in the art. Within the housing  are positioned a one or more anodes  and one or more cathodes . Each anode  is preferably formed from an aluminum containing material such as an aluminum alloy. Each cathode or positive electrode  is formed from a porous, electrically conductive material which has been catalyzed with at least one of palladium and iridium to effect improved electrochemical reduction of the catholyte. In a preferred embodiment, each cathode  is formed from a carbon fiber matrix material which has been catalyzed with palladium and iridium.","Attached to a first surface  of each anode  is a member  formed from an electrically non-conductive material such as a polypropylene material. The member  is shaped to form a number of flow channels  for the catholyte solution. The member  may be attached to the surface  of the anode  using any suitable means known in the art such as an adhesive.","Attached to a second surface  of each anode  is a plurality of separators . The separators  are also preferably formed from an electrically non-conductive material such as a polypropylene material and also may be attached to the surface  using any suitable means known in the art.","The cell stack  further has inlet means (not shown) for supplying the catholyte such as an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution to the flow channels . If desired, the cell stack  can have an outlet means (not shown) for exhausting spent catholyte.","In accordance with the present invention, each cathode  is provided with means  for preventing migration of the catholyte through the porous cathode structure. The migration prevention means  preferably comprises a material or membrane which allows OH ions which are created during the reduction of the catholyte to pass through itself while inhibiting the passage of hydrogen peroxide through the material or membrane . The material or membrane may be attached to a surface  of the respective cathode  so as to cover the surface . Alternatively, the material or membrane may be impregnated into the respective cathode . When a membrane is used for the migration preventing means , the membrane may be a microporous membrane or an anion selective membrane.","As can be seen from , the cell  has one or more flow channels  for the anolyte, which is preferably a NaOH\/seawater electrolyte. The flow channels  are located between the anode surface  and a surface of the cathode  containing the migration preventing means . As can be seen from this description, the anolyte flowing through the channels  never comes into contact with the catholyte. The cell stack  may be provided with inlet means (not shown) for supplying anolyte to each of the flow channels  and outlet means (not shown) for exhausting spent anolyte from each of the flow channels . Further, the hydrogen peroxide catholyte is introduced into the semi-fuel cell  on the side of the cathode or positive electrode  away from the anode .","As mentioned before, the migration preventing means  allows ions which are created during the reduction of the hydrogen peroxide catholyte to travel into the NaOH\/seawater electrolyte to complete the charge balance during the electrochemical reaction.","The operation of semi-fuel cell stack  requires the separate metering of the liquid hydrogen peroxide catholyte so that the catholyte is not mixed with any seawater or electrolyte as it enters or exits the cell stack . If desired, the catholyte flow may be dead ended within the cell stack .","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the seawater electrolyte is mixed with sodium hydroxide, injected into the flow channels  and passed through the cell stack . This is desirable to carry heat and Al(OH)reaction product out of the cell stack .","The concentration of the hydrogen peroxide metered into the cell stack  can be at concentrations as high as about 70% or as low as about 0.001%. The static hydraulic pressure of the hydrogen peroxide liquid channel(s)  preferably is greater than the sodium hydroxide\/seawater pressure. This difference in pressure is a function of the cathode and\/or membrane porosity.","Introduction of a separate flow channel for the pure hydrogen peroxide catholyte eliminates solution phase mixing. Prior art cells had separated flow but used a mixed flow of hydrogen peroxide and seawater and sodium hydroxide, requiring greater volume flow capacity, thus yielding lower energy density. Incorporation of an anion-selective or micro-porous membrane onto the surface or within the surface of each cathode  is most advantageous. The membrane allows OH ions to pass through it, and inhibits the transfer through it of hydrogen peroxide liquid. Prior art cells had mixed hydrogen peroxide with sodium hydroxide, which results in the de-protonation of the hydrogen peroxide into HO ions. The anion selective membrane would be ineffective under these prior art circumstances.","One of the advantages to the semi-fuel cell of the present invention is improved electrochemical efficiency by upwards of 75%. This is achieved by reducing and substantially eliminating the chemical reaction which occurs in solution phase semi-fuel cells between the catholyte and the anode.","The half cell and overall cell reactions for the cell  of the present invention can be written as follows:\n\n","The semi-fuel cell configuration of the present invention could be used for other liquid phase catholyte semi-fuel cells with aluminum alloy anodes and other liquid catholytes such as sodium hypochlorite. In other systems, the particular membrane used for the migration preventing means  may be chosen on the basis of the particular anions or cations which are to be transferred.","The semi-fuel cell stack  of the present invention can be used as energy systems such as those required for undersea vehicle applications requiring high energy storage such as torpedo propulsion and unmanned underwater vehicle applications.","It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a separated flow liquid catholyte aluminum hydrogen peroxide seawater semi-fuel cell which fully satisfies the objects, means, and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Therefore, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
