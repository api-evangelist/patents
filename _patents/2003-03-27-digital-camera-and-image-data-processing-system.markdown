{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a digital camera and an image data processing system comprising an image pickup function, which picks up an image with a solid-state image pickup device and performs photoelectric transfer to obtain analog image data, and a digital image data recording function which converts the analog image data to form digital image data and records the data on a recording medium.","2. Description of the Related Art","In conventional digital cameras, when a still image or the like is picked up with a Charged Coupled Device (CCD), after the image data is converted from analog to digital, it is compressed with a predetermined compression format (e.g., JPEG), recorded, and stored in a recording medium such as a memory card.","The compressed and stored image data (hereinafter referred to as \u201cJPEG data\u201d) is decompressed and displayed when reproducing the data onto the liquid-crystal monitor on the digital camera. When an index image or the like is displayed, a thumbnail image is prepared independently of the JPEG compressed image. This thumbnail image is read out to shorten the read-out process time.","Digital cameras can be easily connected to an external  control device (e.g., personal computer) so that image data recorded on a recording medium can be transferred thereto, subjected to various processes, and then printed out. Hence, digital cameras have become increasingly popular in recent years.","In particular, images photographed with a digital camera are often applied to business purposes. For professional uses, when a high-quality photographed image is compressed once, depending on the compression rates, the image quality or the like of the compressed image may be lower than that of the originally obtained photographed image data.","Therefore, conventional technology proposes a digital camera having a raw image recording control function, in addition to the compressed image recording control function. That is, a photographed image is recorded as raw image data (hereinafter referred to as CCD-raw data) on a recording medium so that the CCD-raw data is transferable to a personal computer (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 6-90435 and 11-261933).","As disclosed in the above conventional technology, unlike normal JPEG data, CCD-raw data is not subjected to necessary processes to reproduce and display the data on the liquid-crystal monitor of the digital camera. For this reason, interpolation automatic exposure (AE), automatic white balance (AWB), gamma adjustment, and the like must be performed when reproducing the CCD-raw data. For this reason, such digital cameras must be equipped with a function that enables execution of a reproduction process of the CCD-raw data.","When a CCD-raw data reproducing process function is arranged in the digital camera in advance, the data can be reproduced and displayed on the liquid-crystal monitor.","However, the CCD-raw data is generated on the assumption that it will be transferred to an external image processing device such as a personal computer and processed therein, and then recorded onto a recording medium. In order to reproduce and display such CCD-raw data, dedicated application software (hereinafter referred to as a \u201cdedicated viewer\u201d) must be installed in the personal computer. However, since CCD-raw data is for professional and not general use, it has poor versatility and further, not all personal computers possess dedicated viewers for the CCD-raw data.","For this reason, the conventional technology is problematic in that when a photographing operation is erroneously performed in a CCD-raw mode, there are cases where the obtained CCD-raw data cannot be reproduced on a personal computer.","The present invention is made in consideration of the above circumstances, and has as its objective to provide a digital camera and an image data processing system that can reliably develop and observe images, recorded by both a compressed image recording control function and a raw image recording control function on an external image processing device, regardless of the presence or absence of a raw image reproducing function.","A first aspect of the invention provides a digital camera having an image pickup function, which performs an image pickup operation using a solid-state image pickup device and performs photoelectric conversion to obtain analog image data, and a digital image data recording function, which converts the analog image data to form digital image data and records the digital image data on a recording medium, comprising: a raw image recording control component for recording the digital image data on the recording medium as unprocessed raw image data; and a self-development execution module adding component for adding a self-development execution module for developing the raw image data to the raw image data or to the recording medium on which the raw image data is recorded.","According to the first aspect of the invention, for example, when the raw image data is transmitted to an external control device (e.g., a personal computer) through the recording medium, the self-development execution module for self-developing a raw image is added to the raw image data or the recording medium by the self-development execution module adding component and then transmitted. For this reason, the raw image data can be developed in the external control device without arranging a dedicated viewer for developing the raw image data.","In the first aspect of the invention, the self-development execution module adding component may further add an observing condition when the raw image data is observed and transmit the image.","The raw image data developed in the external control device can observe an image without changing the raw image data. However, in this case, image processing is preferably performed according to the observing condition. For example, when tone is taken as one of the observing conditions, the difference between tone expressions (for example, the tone of raw image data is 12-bit tone, and tone which can be expressed on the external control device side is 8-bit tone) forms a toneless image that seriously affects image quality.","Therefore, when a self-development execution module is added to raw image data by the self-development execution module adding component, the raw image data is added with observing conditions such as the tone and transmitted, so that an image can be appropriately expressed (reproduced) under an environment on the external control device side.","Further, the digital camera may include a self-development execution module that executes image processing for raw image data. The self-development execution module may be independent of the external control device, which develops image data.","A second aspect of the invention provides an image data processing system comprising: a digital camera having a normal image data recording mode which converts image data of an object photographed using a solid-state image pickup device from analog to digital, performs a process such as compression to the digital data, and records the resultant data on a recording medium, and a raw image data recording mode, which directly records the raw image data obtained by the analog-digital conversion on the recording medium and adds a self-development execution module for developing the raw image data when the raw image data is recorded on the recording medium; and an external process control device, which has an application programming interface for delivering an observing condition used when the raw image data is observed and delivering raw image data developed by the self-development execution module, and which is further capable of communicating with the digital camera.","According to the second aspect of the invention, data recorded in both the normal image data recording mode and the raw image data recording mode exist in the digital camera, and these data are transmitted to the external process control device without differentiating the data. In this case, since the self-development execution module is added to the raw image data, the raw image data can be developed without arranging a dedicated viewer in the external process control device.","At this time, the external control device has an application programming interface (API) to deliver an observing condition used when raw image data, represented by tone of raw image data, is observed, and to deliver raw image data developed by the self-development execution module. Therefore, even if the tone of the raw image data is different from the tone of the raw image data developed by the external process control device, the difference is interpolated to make it possible to observe the raw image data on the basis of the desired observing conditions.","The image data processing system may possess the self-development execution module, which executes image processing of raw image data. The self-development execution module may be independent of the external control device, which develops image data.","According to the third embodiment of the present invention, the external control device, which displays image data picked up with a digital camera, further comprises an application programming interface, which transfers an observing condition when raw image data is observed between the digital camera and the external control device and transfers raw image data after it has been developed by the self-development execution module between the digital camera and the external control device, wherein the raw image data is image data of an object picked up with a solid-state image pickup device of the digital camera and which has only been converted from analog to digital; and the self-development execution module is added to the raw image data for developing raw image data.","The digital camera further may add reproduction parameters to the raw image data for reproducing the raw image data and the external control device may reproduce the raw image data based on the reproduction parameters.","The self-development execution module may be independent of the external control device. Further, the self-development execution module may execute image processing of raw image data.","A fourth embodiment of the present invention provides an image recording method comprising the steps of: converting data, which was picked up with a solid-state image pickup device of a digital camera, from analog to digital; recording, to a recording medium, which does not undergo any other processing; and recording a self-development execution module for developing raw image data to at least one of the raw image data and the recording medium having the raw image data recorded thereon.","In the image recording method, the self-development execution module may be independent of the external control device, which develops raw image data. The self-development execution module may execute image processing of the raw image data.","A fifth embodiment of the present invention provides an image control method, which controls an image that is recorded by the image recording method of the fourth embodiment, the method comprising the steps of: transferring the observing condition between the digital camera and the external control device; and transferring the developed raw image data, which is developed by the self-development execution module, between the digital camera and the external control device.","As described above, the invention has the following advantage. That is, images recorded by both a compressed image recording control function and a raw image recording control function can be reliably developed and observed on an external image processing device regardless of the presence\/absence of a reproducing function of a raw image.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","18","10","18","18","18","18"]},"An electric flash  is arranged on the digital camera  to manually or automatically flash under the control of an electric flash control unit  as needed.","The control devices including the image pickup unit  and the electric flash control unit  of the digital camera  are connected to each other by a bus . The operations of the devices are controlled by a CPU . A power from a battery  is supplied to the control devices to make it possible to operate the control devices.","A system memory (RAM or ROM) , a nonvolatile memory , a timer function unit , and a calendar\/clock function unit  are connected to the bus  as control devices.","The I\/O port , which is connected to the bus , is capable of inputting and outputting signals from an operation\/display system  mounted to a housing  (see ) of the digital camera .","As shown in , a liquid-crystal monitor (LCD)  are arranged on a rear surface side (on a side opposing the side on which the image pickup unit  is arranged) of the housing  of the digital camera . A frame number display unit  serving as a part of the operation\/display system is arranged on the upper portion of the liquid-crystal monitor . For example, a photographing frame number is displayed by a 7-segment liquid-crystal display.","As the operation\/display system, on the right side of the LCD  on the rear side of the housing , a circular four-direction key  provided for frame switching of images displayed on the LCD , item selection, and the like is arranged. When the axial line of the four-direction key  is inclined upward, downward, left, or right, different contacts of the switch are switched by inclining the four-direction key . In this manner, the switching signal is input to the I\/O  (see ).","On the lower portion of the four-direction key , a menu button , an execution button , and a cancel button  are vertically arranged downward. On the upper surface of the housing , a release button  and a mode setting dial  are arranged.","When the mode setting dial  and the menu button  are operated, for example, as shown in , a setup screen  for performing various settings are displayed on the LCD .","The execution button  is operated on the setup screen  after a function is selected and determined by the four-direction key , and the cancel button  is operated when the determined function is canceled.","As shown in , a memory card slot  to which a memory card  serving as a recording medium is detachably connected is connected to the bus  through an card I\/F . Image data obtained by a photographing operation of the image pickup unit  is recorded on the memory card  loaded on the memory card slot .","In the embodiment, as a recording mode of image data on the memory card , a JPEG recording control function for recording JPEG data compressed by JPEG format and a CCD-raw recording control function for recording raw image data (CCD-raw data) which is not compressed are set.","The file structure recorded on the memory card  by the JPEG recording control function is, as shown in , classified into a Tag information region , a thumbnail region , and a main image region . Since the respective regions are the same as those of a general JPEG file structure, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.","In contrast, the file structure recorded on the memory card  by the CCD-raw recording control function is, as shown in , is classified into a header block region , a display image block region , and a CCD-raw image block region .","The header block region  is classified into a maker identifier storage section , a format identifier storage section , a format version storage section , a compatibility code storage section , a machine type identifier storage section , a machine type version storage section , a display data offset storage section , a display image data length storage section , a reproduction parameter offset storage section , a reproduction parameter set length storage section , a CCD-raw data offset storage section , and a CCD-raw data length storage section .","The JPEG file structure is directly stored in the display image block region . More specifically, when an image is to be reproduced and displayed on the LCD  of the digital camera , JPEG image data (in this case, VGA) or thumbnail image data stored in the display image block region  is read. The CCD-raw image block region  is classified into a reproduction parameter set storage section  and a CCD-raw data storage section . The image data stored in the CCD-raw data storage section  is raw image data obtained by a photographing operation.","The image data transferred to the digital camera  is, as shown in , classified into directories of plural types (001 Vacation, 002 Birthday, . . . ). For example, in the directory (001 Vacation), file serial numbers (0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, 0005, . . . ) are added to prefix \u201cDSC\u201d (DSC: digital still camera) as file names, and suffixes are added to the file serial numbers. The files are each classified by the suffixes, so that usability can be improved.","JPG and JAR are used as the suffixes. JPG represents compressed JPEG data. JAR represents CCD-raw data serving as raw image data.","In this case, the suffix JAR also expresses that the CCD-raw data is added with a self-development execution module.","In the self-development execution module, after the CCD-raw data is transmitted to a PC  (to be described later) through the memory card , a self-development execution program is started. The CCD-raw data is designed to be automatically converted into data of a general file format (in this case, bitmap data) and reproduced (displayed). An environment on the PC  for reproduction will be described later.","A signal input to the image pickup unit  is transmitted to a signal processing unit  and subjected to a noise reduction process and gain control. The resultant signal is transmitted to an A\/D converter .","The image data A\/D-converted by the A\/D converter  is designed to be transmitted to a compression\/decompression unit  when instructed to do so by the CPU , and subjected to a compression process (JPEG), or it is transmitted to the memory card slot  through the card I\/F  without changing the state of the image data.","The image data recorded on the memory card  is read on the basis of a reproduction\/display instruction from the CPU , stored in a frame memory , and displayed on the LCD  under the control of an LCD controller . At this time, on the LCD , an image display based on the image data, characters, character data, and the like controlled by an OSD (on-screen display unit)  are displayed such that they are superimposed on the image display.","An external communication I\/F  is connected to the bus , so that the digital camera can be directly connected to an external control device (to be referred to as a PC  hereinafter) such as a personal computer through a connector . Image data recorded on the memory card  can be transmitted to the PC .","In general, in the PC , an image processing application software which can expand the data compressed in a compression format (in this case, JPEG format) used for recording the data on the memory card  when the image data recorded on the memory card  is taken into the PC and processed by the PC is installed. The JPEG format generally has high compatibility. For this reason, even in the digital camera , such a compression format having high compatibility is used.","In contrast to this, in the CCD-raw data recorded on the memory card  in a state (the data is not subjected to any process) immediately after the image is obtained by a photographing operation, since high compatibility cannot be obtained, an application software which can reproduce the CCD-raw data is rarely installed on the PC .","However, according to the embodiment, when the recording control function for CCD-raw data is used in the digital camera , as the suffix JAR of the image file, a self-development execution module is added together with CCD-raw. For this reason, the data can be reproduced in the PC  regardless of the presence\/absence of application software which can reproduce CCD-raw data on the PC .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["120","120","150","152","152","154","120","152"]},"In this platform environment, a platform independent execution environment region  typified by JAVA or the like is formed.

When a predetermined field angle is determined, the release button  is operated, and a photographing operation is executed.","In this case, the data picked by the image pickup unit  is transmitted to the signal processing unit  and subjected to processes such as a noise reduction process, a gain control process, and the like. Thereafter, the data is A\/D-converted to generate digital image data.","Thereafter, the digital image data is compressed in the compression\/decompression unit , and the compressed data is recorded on the memory card .","In a reproducing mode, when an index mode is selected, a thumbnail image is read from digital image data (JPEG file format) recorded on the memory card , and a photographed image is displayed in the form of a matrix on the LCD .
