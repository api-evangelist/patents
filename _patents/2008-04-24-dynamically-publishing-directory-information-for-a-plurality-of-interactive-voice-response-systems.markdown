Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, apparatus, and products for dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of interactive voice response (\u2018IVR\u2019) systems.","2. Description of Related Art","Despite the pervasiveness of other types of devices, telephones remain the most popular devices through which people obtain information when they are on the go. As a result, more and more service providers are adding or enhancing IVR systems for their businesses to provide customers with twenty four hour automated access to information and services. To access an IVR system, however, callers first need to know the phone number to dial that allows the caller to establish a connection with the IVR system. Unfortunately, the phone numbers for many IVR systems are unknown to callers, especially new or recently deployed IVR systems. Furthermore, typical telephones only store a relatively small number of frequently dialed phone numbers and therefore may not contain the phone number for the IVR system desired by a caller.","Methods, apparatus, and products are generally disclosed for dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of interactive voice response (\u2018IVR\u2019) systems that include: providing, by an IVR directory service, a description of a web services publication interface for the IVR directory service; receiving, by the IVR directory service on behalf of one or more IVR systems requesting publication, web services publication requests through the web services publication interface for the IVR directory service; determining, by the IVR directory service in response to the web services publication requests, directory information for each IVR system requesting publication; adding, by the IVR directory service, the directory information for each IVR system to an IVR system directory; generating, by the IVR directory service, a voice mode user interface to reflect the directory information for each IVR system added to the IVR system directory; and interacting, by the IVR directory service using the voice mode user interface, with a caller to identify a particular IVR system in dependence upon the IVR system directory and query information provided by the caller and to connect the caller with the identified IVR system.","The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.","Exemplary methods, apparatus, and products for dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with .  sets forth a line drawing illustrating an exemplary system for dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems () according to embodiments of the present invention. The exemplary system of  includes IVR servers () having installed upon them IVR systems (). Specifically, IVR server () has installed upon it IVR system (), IVR server () has installed upon it IVR system (), and IVR server () has installed upon it IVR system ().","Each IVR system () of  is a set of software components that operate together to interact with a caller through a telephone using speech and touch tones. Each IVR system () has a phone number that a caller may use to establish a communications connection through the caller's telephone. Upon connecting to a caller, each IVR system () may provide the caller with certain information or prompt the caller to provide the IVR system () with information using pre-recorded or dynamically generated speech. The IVR system () may then receiving responses from the caller in the form of touch tones generated from the caller's operation of the phone's keypad or in the form of speech provided by the caller. When the caller provides speech, the IVR system () may then utilize a speech engine to recognize and interpret the caller's speech. The interaction between an IVR system and a caller is generally governed by the IVR system's call flow. Older IVR systems often utilized proprietary programming or scripting languages to generate the system's call flow, but the call flow for modern IVR systems are typically structured similar to web pages using Voice Extensible Markup Language (\u2018VoiceXML\u2019), Speech Application Language Tags (\u2018SALT\u2019), Telera's Extensible Markup Language (\u2018T-XML\u2019) language, and so on. Example applications of IVR systems may include telephone banking, televoting, credit card transactions, telephone investing, teleshopping, and so on. Such IVR systems are useful because these systems scale well to handle large call volumes and provide twenty-four hour, seven day a week access to information and services.","The exemplary system of  includes an IVR directory server () having installed upon it an IVR directory service () and a speech engine (). The IVR directory service () is a specialized IVR system that provides callers with directory information of other IVR systems registered with the IVR directory service (). The IVR directory service () of  includes a set of computer program instructions for dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to embodiments of the present invention. The IVR directory service () of  operates generally for dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to embodiments of the present invention as follows: The IVR directory service () provides a description () of a web services publication interface for the IVR directory service () that the IVR systems () may use to register with the IVR directory service (). On behalf of the IVR systems () requesting publication, the IVR directory service () receives web services publication requests through the web services publication interface for the IVR directory service (). In response to the web services publication requests, the IVR directory service () then determines directory information for each IVR system () requesting publication. The IVR directory service () adds the directory information for each IVR system () to an IVR system directory (). The IVR directory service () generates a voice mode user interface to reflect the directory information for each IVR system added to the IVR system directory. Using the voice mode user interface, the IVR directory service () interacts with a caller () to identify a particular IVR system in dependence upon the IVR system directory () and query information provided by the caller () and to connect the caller () with the identified IVR system.","The IVR directory service () of  includes an IVR browser () and an IVR directory application (). The IVR browser () of  renders voice dialogs () to provide an interface between the IVR directory service () and the caller (). In addition, the IVR browser generates speech for prompting the caller () using speech engine () and recognizing speech input from the caller () using the speech engine () and grammars (). The voice dialogs () of  are documents that specify the call flow defining the interaction between the IVR directory server () and the caller (). The voice dialogs () may be implemented using VoiceXML, SALT, T-XML, or in any other language as will occur to those of skill in the art.","In the example of , the speech engine () is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and generating or \u2018synthesizing\u2019 human speech. The speech engine implements speech recognition by use of a further module referred to in this specification as an automated speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine, and the speech engine carries out speech synthesis by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine.","The grammars () of  communicate to the speech engine () the words and sequences of words eligible for speech recognition during the interactions specified by the voice dialogs (). Grammars useful in dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to embodiments of the present invention may be expressed in any format supported by any speech engine, including, for example, the Java Speech Grammar Format (\u2018JSGF\u2019), the format of the W3C Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (\u2018SRGS\u2019), the Augmented Backus-Naur Format (\u2018ABNF\u2019) from the IETF's RFC2234, in the form of a stochastic grammar as described in the W3C's Stochastic Language Models (N-Gram) Specification, and in other grammar formats as may occur to those of skill in the art. Grammars typically operate as elements of dialogs, such as, for example, a VoiceXML <menu> or an X+V<form>. A grammar's definition may be expressed in-line in a dialog. Or the grammar may be implemented externally in a separate grammar document and referenced from with a dialog with a URI. Here is an example of a grammar expressed in JSFG:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<grammar scope=\u201cdialog\u201d ><![CDATA["},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003#JSGF V1.0;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003grammar command;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<command> = [remind me to] call | phone | telephone"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<name> <when>;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<name> = bob | martha | joe | pete | chris | john | artoush | tom;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<when> = today | this afternoon | tomorrow | next week;"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003]]>"},{"entry":"<\/grammar>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In this example, the elements named <command>, <name>, and <when> are rules of the grammar. Rules are a combination of a rule name and an expansion of a rule that advises a speech engine or a voice interpreter which words presently can be recognized. In this example, expansion includes conjunction and disjunction, and the vertical bars \u2018|\u2019 mean \u2018or.\u2019 A speech engine or a voice interpreter processes the rules in sequence, first <command>, then <name>, then <when>. The <command> rule accepts for recognition \u2018call\u2019 or \u2018phone\u2019 or \u2018telephone\u2019 plus, that is, in conjunction with, whatever is returned from the <name> rule and the <when> rule. The <name> rule accepts \u2018bob\u2019 or \u2018martha\u2019 or \u2018joe\u2019 or \u2018pete\u2019 or \u2018chris\u2019 or \u2018john\u2019 or \u2018artoush\u2019 or \u2018tom\u2019, and the <when> rule accepts \u2018today\u2019 or \u2018this afternoon\u2019 or \u2018tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018next week.\u2019 The command grammar as a whole matches utterances like these, for example:\n\n","The IVR directory application () of  is a component of the IVR directory service () that provides a web services publication interface through which other IVR systems may dynamically register their directory information with the IVR directory service (). The IVR directory application () provides the description () of the web services publication interface by publishing the web services publication interface description () in a Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (\u2018UDDI\u2019) registry hosted by the UDDI server (). A UDDI registry is a platform-independent, XML-based registry for organizations worldwide to list themselves on the Internet. UDDI is an open industry initiative promulgated by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (\u2018OASIS\u2019), enabling organizations to publish service listings, discover each other, and define how the services or software applications interact over the Internet. The UDDI registry is designed to be interrogated by SOAP messages and to provide access to Web Services Description Language (\u2018WSDL\u2019) documents describing the protocol bindings and message formats required to interact with a web service listed in the UDDI registry. In this manner, any of the IVR systems () of  may retrieve the web services publication interface description () for the IVR directory service () from the UDDI registry on the server (). The term \u2018SOAP\u2019 refers to a protocol promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium (\u2018W3C\u2019) for exchanging XML-based messages over computer networks, typically using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (\u2018HTTP\u2019) or Secure HTTP (\u2018HTTPS\u2019).","In the example of , the web services publication interface description () of  may be implemented as a Web Services Description Language (\u2018WSDL\u2019) document. The WSDL specification provides a model for describing a web service's interface as collections of network endpoints, or ports. A port is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, and a collection of ports define a service. Messages in a WSDL document are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types are abstract collections of supported operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding, where the messages and operations are then bound to a concrete network protocol and message format. In such a manner, any one of the IVR systems () may utilize the web services publication interface description () to invoke the publication service provided by the IVR directory service (), typically by exchanging SOAP messages with the IVR directory service ().","In addition to providing a web services interface through which the IVR systems () may provide directory information to the IVR directory service (), the IVR directory application () also generates the voice dialogs () and the grammar () based on the directory information stored in the IVR system directory (). Typically as the IVR system directory () is updated as IVR systems are added or removed from the IVR system directory (), the IVR directory application () creates or modifies the voice dialogs () and the grammar () that the IVR browser () processes during interactions with callers. The IVR directory application () of  may be implemented using Java, C, C++, C#, Perl, or any other programming language as will occur to those of skill in the art.","The exemplary system of , the voice dialogs (), the grammars (), the publication interface description (), and the IVR system directory () are stored in a repository () operatively coupled to the IVR directory service (). The repository () may be implemented as a database stored locally on the IVR directory server () or remotely stored and accessed through a network. The IVR directory application () may be operatively coupled to such an exemplary repository through an application programming interface (\u2018API\u2019) exposed by a database management system (\u2018DBMS\u2019) such as, for example, an API provided by the Open Database Connectivity (\u2018ODBC\u2019) specification, the Java database connectivity (\u2018JDBC\u2019) specification, and so on.","In the example of , the caller () accesses the IVR directory service () and the IVR systems () using a Time Division Multiplexing (\u2018TDM\u2019) phone () or a Voice over Internet Protocol (\u2018VoIP\u2019) phone (). The TDM phone () of  is a telephone that operates using a circuit switched network (). The circuit switched network () of  establishes a fixed communications channel between nodes before any communications between the nodes takes place. The circuit switched network () of  may be implemented as a Public Switched Telephone Network (\u2018PSTN\u2019), ISDN B-channel network, Circuit Switched Data (\u2018CSD\u2019) and High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD) network in cellular systems such as GSM, an X.21 network, or other as will occur to those of skill in the art.","The VoIP phone () is a telephone that operates using a packet switched network such as networks (, ) of . \u2018VoIP\u2019 is a generic term for routing speech over an IP-based data communications network. The speech data flows over a general-purpose packet-switched data communications network, instead of traditional dedicated, circuit-switched voice transmission lines. Protocols used to carry voice signals over the IP data communications network are commonly referred to as \u2018Voice over IP\u2019 or \u2018VoIP\u2019 protocols. VoIP traffic may be deployed on any IP data communications network, including data communications networks lacking a connection to the rest of the Internet, for instance on a private building-wide local area data communications network or \u2018LAN.\u2019","Many protocols are used to effect VoIP. The two most popular types of VoIP are effected with the IETF's Session Initiation Protocol (\u2018SIP\u2019) and the ITU's protocol known as \u2018H.323.\u2019 SIP clients use TCP and UDP port 5060 to connect to SIP servers. SIP itself is used to set up and tear down calls for speech transmission. VoIP with SIP then uses RTP for transmitting the actual encoded speech. Similarly, H.323 is an umbrella recommendation from the standards branch of the International Telecommunications Union that defines protocols to provide audio-visual communication sessions on any packet data communications network.","In the example of , all of the servers and devices are connected together through various communications networks (, , ). The IVR directory server, the IVR server (), the VoIP phone (), and the UDDI server () connect to the packet switched network () through a wireline connection. The IVR servers (, ) connect to the packet switched network () through wireline connections. The packet switched networks (, ) connect through a gateway (). The TDM phone () connects to the circuit switch network () through a wireless connection, although in many embodiments, a TDM phone may utilize a wireline connection. The circuit switch network () connects to the packet switch networks (, ) through gateways (, ), respectively, which provide translation between protocols used in the circuit switch network () such as PSTN-V5 and protocols used in the packet switch networks (, ) such as SIP.","The packet switched networks (, ) of  are composed of a plurality of computers that function as data communications routers, switches, or gateways connected for data communications with packet switching protocols. Such packet switched networks (, ) may be implemented with optical connections, wireline connections, or with wireless connections. Such a data communications network may include intranets, internets, local area data communications networks (\u2018LANs\u2019), and wide area data communications networks (\u2018WANs\u2019). Such packet switched networks (, ) may implement, for example:\n\n","The circuit switched network () of  is composed of a plurality of devices that function as exchange components, switches, antennas, base stations components, and connected for communications in a circuit switched network (). Such circuit switched networks () may be implemented with optical connections, wireline connections, or with wireless connections. Such circuit switched networks () may implement the V5.1 and V5.2 protocols along with other as will occur to those of skill in the art.","The arrangement of the devices (, , , , , , , ) and the networks (, , ) making up the exemplary system illustrated in  are for explanation, not for limitation. Data processing systems useful for dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to various embodiments of the present invention may include additional servers, routers, switches, gateways, other devices, and peer-to-peer architectures or others, not shown in , as will occur to those of skill in the art. Networks in such data processing systems may support many protocols in addition to those noted above. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware platforms in addition to those illustrated in .","Dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to embodiments of the present invention may be implemented with one or more computers, that is, automated computing machinery. For further explanation, therefore,  sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of an IVR directory server () for use in dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to embodiments of the present invention. The IVR directory server () of  includes at least one processor () or \u2018CPU\u2019 as well as random access memory () (\u2018RAM\u2019) which is connected through a high speed memory bus () and bus adapter () to processor () and to other components of the IVR directory server.","Stored in RAM () of  is an IVR directory service () that is a specialized IVR system that provides callers with directory information of other IVR systems registered with the IVR directory service (). The IVR directory service () includes an IVR browser () and an IVR directory application () that function in the manner described above. The IVR directory service () includes a set of IVR directory server program instructions capable of dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to embodiments of the present invention. The signaling module () operates generally for dynamically publishing directory information for a plurality of IVR systems according to embodiments of the present invention by: providing a description () of a web services publication interface for the IVR directory service (); receiving, on behalf of one or more IVR systems requesting publication, web services publication requests through the web services publication interface for the IVR directory service (); determining, in response to the web services publication requests, directory information for each IVR system requesting publication; adding the directory information for each IVR system to an IVR system directory (); generating a voice mode user interface to reflect the directory information for each IVR system added to the IVR system directory (); and interacting, using the voice mode user interface, with a caller to identify a particular IVR system in dependence upon the IVR system directory () and query information provided by the caller and to connect the caller with the identified IVR system. As described above, the voice mode user interface is typically implemented using voice dialogs () and grammars () specified in the voice dialogs ().","Also stored in RAM () is a speech engine (). The speech engine () of  is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and generating human speech. The speech engine () includes an ASR engine () for speech recognition and a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine () for generating speech. The speech engine also includes grammars (), lexicons (), and language-specific acoustic models ().","The acoustic models () associate speech waveform data representing recorded pronunciations of speech with textual representations of those pronunciations, which are referred to as \u2018phonemes.\u2019 The speech waveform data may be implemented as a Speech Feature Vector (\u2018SFV\u2019) that may be represented, for example, by the first twelve or thirteen Fourier or frequency domain components of a sample of digitized speech waveform. Accordingly, the acoustic models () may be implemented as data structures or tables in a database, for example, that associates these SFVs with phonemes representing, to the extent that it is practically feasible to do so, all pronunciations of all the words in various human languages, each language having a separate acoustic model (). The lexicons () are associations of words in text form with phonemes representing pronunciations of each word; the lexicon effectively identifies words that are capable of recognition by an ASR engine. Each language has a separate lexicon ().","The grammars () of  communicate to the ASR engine () the words and sequences of words that currently may be recognized. For precise understanding, readers will distinguish the purpose of the grammar and the purpose of the lexicon.","The lexicon associates with phonemes all the words that the ASR engine can recognize. The grammar communicates the words currently eligible for recognition. The set of words currently eligible for recognition and the set of words capable of recognition may or may not be the same.","Also stored in RAM () is an operating system (). Operating systems useful in voice servers according to embodiments of the present invention include UNIX\u2122, Linux\u2122, Microsoft Vista\u2122, IBM's AIX\u2122, IBM's i5\/OS\u2122, and others as will occur to those of skill in the art. Operating system (), speech engine (), grammar analysis module (), grammar reliability table (), and background noises () in the example of  are shown in RAM (), but many components of such software typically are stored in non-volatile memory also, for example, on a disk drive ().","IVR directory server () of  includes bus adapter (), a computer hardware component that contains drive electronics for high speed buses, the front side bus (), the video bus (), and the memory bus (), as well as drive electronics for the slower expansion bus (). Examples of bus adapters useful in IVR directory servers according to embodiments of the present invention include the Intel Northbridge, the Intel Memory Controller Hub, the Intel Southbridge, and the Intel I\/O Controller Hub. Examples of expansion buses useful in IVR directory servers according to embodiments of the present invention include Peripheral Component Interconnect (\u2018PCI\u2019) and PCI-Extended (\u2018PCI-X\u2019) bus, as well as PCI Express (\u2018PCIe\u2019) point to point expansion architectures and others.","IVR directory server () of  includes disk drive adapter () coupled through expansion bus () and bus adapter () to processor () and other components of the IVR directory server (). Disk drive adapter () connects non-volatile data storage to the IVR directory server () in the form of disk drive (). Disk drive adapters useful in IVR directory servers include Integrated Drive Electronics (\u2018IDE\u2019) adapters, Small Computer System Interface (\u2018SCSI\u2019) adapters, and others as will occur to those of skill in the art. In addition, non-volatile computer memory may be implemented for an IVR directory server as an optical disk drive, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (so-called \u2018EEPROM\u2019 or \u2018Flash\u2019 memory), RAM drives, and so on, as will occur to those of skill in the art.","The example IVR directory server of  includes one or more input\/output (\u2018I\/O\u2019) adapters (). I\/O adapters in IVR directory servers implement user-oriented input\/output through, for example, software drivers and computer hardware for controlling output to display devices such as computer display screens, as well as user input from user input devices () such as keyboards and mice. The example IVR directory server of  includes a video adapter (), which is an example of an I\/O adapter specially designed for graphic output to a display device () such as a display screen or computer monitor.

exemplary web services publication interface description above informs other web services that an \u2018IVR411Service,\u2019 which is an implementation of an IVR directory service according to embodiments of the present application, is provided at the URI: http:\/\/some.domain.com\/Test\/services\/IVR411. The exemplary web services publication interface description above then goes on to describe the type of messages that the IVR411Service can receive from web service components of other IVR systems that want to publish directory information using the IVR411Service. Using web services message described in the example above, a web service component of an IVR system may register that IVR system's company name, phone number, products, and keywords with the IVR411Service.","The method of  also includes receiving (), by the IVR directory service () on behalf of one or more IVR systems requesting publication, web services publication requests () through the web services publication interface for the IVR directory service (). Each web services publication request () of  represents a request to publish directory information for a particular IVR system. In the method of , the IVR directory service () may receive () web services publication requests () on behalf of one or more IVR systems from web services components of the IVR systems themselves or from third party web service components instructed by the IVR system providers to register the IVR systems with the IVR directory service (). The IVR directory service () may receive () web services publication requests () through the web services publication interface for the IVR directory service () according to the method of  by receiving a SOAP message formatted and transmitted according to the web services publication interface description ().","The method of  includes determining (), by the IVR directory service () in response to the web services publication requests (), directory information () for each IVR system requesting publication. The directory information () of  represents lookup information, connection information, description information, or any other information for an IVR system that the IVR directory service () may use to provide caller's information or access concerning the IVR system. The lookup information may include, for example, keywords or products identifiers used to lookup an organizations' IVR system. The connection information may include, for example, the telephone number to an organization's IVR system or the connection data needed to transfer the caller from the IVR directory service () directly to the desired IVR system. The description information may include, for example, the organization's name that provides the IVR system or the name of the IVR system itself.","The IVR directory service () may determine () directory information () for each IVR system according to the method of  by retrieving the directory information () for each IVR system from the web services publication requests () themselves. That is, when an IVR system requests that the IVR directory service () publish the IVR system, the IVR system may embedded all of the IVR system's directory information in the publication request () for that IVR system. In some other embodiments, the IVR system may not provide directory information () in one of the publication requests (). Rather, the IVR directory service () may determine () directory information () for each IVR system according to the method of  by performing a web services exchange with each IVR system requesting publication to obtain the directory information () for each IVR system. In such embodiments, the publication requests () may specify an interface for the IVR system, perhaps through use of a WSDL document, that the IVR directory service can use to obtain the directory information () for the IVR system. The web services exchange may be carried out using SOAP messages.","The method of  includes adding (), by the IVR directory service (), the directory information () for each IVR system to an IVR system directory (). The IVR directory service () may add () the directory information () for each IVR system to an IVR system directory () according to the method of  by associating the directory information () provided by each IVR system with the IVR system that provided the directory information () in the IVR system directory (). In the example of , the IVR system directory () is implemented using one or more tables capable of associating an IVR system with directory information () for that IVR system. Each record of the exemplary IVR system directory () includes an IVR system identifier field () and three directory information fields (, , ). The IVR system identifier field () specifies a particular IVR system published by the IVR directory service (). The three directory information fields (, , ) specify directory information () for the associated IVR system.","The method of  also includes generating (), by the IVR directory service (), a voice mode user interface to reflect the directory information () for each IVR system added to the IVR system directory (). The voice mode user interface represents a set of instructions allow the IVR directory service () to provide and receive information from a caller using speech and keypad touch tones. The IVR directory service () may generate () the voice mode user interface according to the method of  by creating one or more IVR voice dialogs () in dependence upon the directory information () in the IVR system directory (). The IVR voice dialogs () of  are documents that specify the call flow defining the interaction between the IVR directory server () and a caller. The voice dialogs () may be implemented using VoiceXML, SALT, T-XML, or in any other language as will occur to those of skill in the art. In addition, the IVR directory service () may generate () the voice mode user interface according to the method of  by creating one or more IVR grammars () in dependence upon the directory information () in the IVR system directory (). The grammars () of  communicate to a speech engine the words and sequences of words eligible for speech recognition during the interactions specified by the voice dialogs ().","The IVR directory service () may create the voice dialogs () and the grammars () by querying the IVR system directory () using some predefined queries and incorporating the query results in a one or more voice dialog templates and one or more grammar templates. The queries may be implemented using a Structured Query Language (\u2018SQL\u2019) such as, for example, SQL:2006 promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (\u2018ISO\u2019).
