{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the priority and benefit of U.S. provisional patent application 61\/475,077, filed Apr. 13, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention pertains to telecommunications, and particularly to structure and method for selecting radio parameters for use, e.g., by a wireless terminal.","In a typical cellular radio system, wireless terminals (also known as mobile stations and\/or user equipments (UEs)) communicate via a radio access network (RAN) to one or more core networks. The wireless terminals can be mobile stations or user equipments (UE) such as mobile telephones (\u201ccellular\u201d telephones) and laptops with wireless capability (e.g., mobile termination), and thus can be, for example, portable, pocket, hand-held, computer-included, or car-mounted mobile devices which communicate voice and\/or data via radio access network.","The radio access network (RAN) covers a geographical area which is divided into cell areas, with each cell area being served by a base station, e.g., a radio base station (RBS), which in some networks is also called \u201cNodeB\u201d or \u201ceNodeB\u201d. A cell is a geographical area where radio coverage is provided by the radio base station equipment at a base station site. Each cell is identified by an identity within the local radio area, which is broadcast in the cell. The base stations communicate over the air interface operating on radio frequencies with the user equipments (UE) within range of the base stations.","In some versions (particularly earlier versions) of the radio access network, several base stations are typically connected (e.g., by landlines or microwave) to a radio network controller (RNC). The radio network controller, also sometimes termed a base station controller (BSC), supervises and coordinates various activities of the plural base stations connected thereto. The radio network controllers are typically connected to one or more core networks.","The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third generation mobile communication system, which evolved from the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), and is intended to provide improved mobile communication services based on Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) access technology. UTRAN is essentially a radio access network using wideband code division multiple access for user equipments (UEs). The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has undertaken to evolve further the UTRAN and GSM based radio access network technologies.","Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a variant of a 3GPP radio access technology wherein the radio base station nodes are connected directly to a core network rather than to radio network controller (RNC) nodes. In general, in LTE the functions of a radio network controller (RNC) node are performed by the radio base station nodes. As such, the radio access network (RAN) of an LTE system has an essentially \u201cflat\u201d architecture comprising radio base station nodes without reporting to radio network controller (RNC) nodes.","In LTE the radio network configures the wireless terminal, e.g., the UE, according to the RRC protocol specification (3GPP TS 36.331), incorporated herein by reference. It is up to the network to choose suitable parameter values in order to reach the desired performance, network capacity or coverage. For many of those parameters the network is able to choose a reasonable value without additional information from the UE. For other parameters or decision the UE provides the network with explicit information such as radio measurements which allows the network to decide, e.g., on whether to perform a handover, to configure another transmission mode, or to add a secondary serving cell.","Recently it has been discussed whether the UE shall be allowed\/enabled not only to provide measurements, but also to suggest explicit parameter values. UE-provisioned\/suggested parameter configurations were supported in earlier versions of the UMTS standard, e.g., for requesting certain QoS handling. But the existing RRC protocol defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 does not allow the UE to suggest or recommend radio parameters to the network. In certain cases (e.g. for the discontinuous reception (DRX) configuration) this may result in inferior performance or too high battery consumption.","Protocols by which the UE could request certain parameter configurations did exist for earlier protocol versions, e.g., in UMTS. However, the drawback of those solutions was that a large number of parameter combinations could be requested, of which most were not supported or at least not properly tested. Even if they were tested, the network had no means to verify that they were allowed\/appropriate for this particular UE. Therefore, the concept of a UE requesting parameters to be configured did not work properly and network implementations previously ignored any such requests.","As one of the example aspects of the technology disclosed herein, a wireless terminal (e.g., user equipment (UE)) is allowed to choose a preferred parameter configuration from among a set of parameter configurations, e.g., from among plural parameter configurations, offered by a network. In other words, the network may provide the UE with multiple collections of parameter values among which the UE can choose the configuration considered most suitable for its needs. In an example embodiment and mode, the wireless terminal makes a selection or choice of a preferred parameter configuration in the area of DRX (discontinuous reception).","In one of its aspects the technology disclosed herein concerns a method of operating a telecommunications system. In its basic mode, the method comprises a radio access network node offering plural parameter configurations to a wireless terminal over a radio interface and the wireless terminal choosing a preferred parameter configuration from among the plural parameter configurations offered by the radio access network node.","In an example embodiment and mode, each of said parameter configurations comprises a collection of parameter values.","In an example embodiment and mode, each of said parameter configurations is associated with an index.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the radio access network node offering the plural parameter configurations in a radio resource control (RRC) Connection Reconfiguration message.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the radio access network node offering the plural parameter configurations as a list of discontinuous reception (DRX) configuration information elements, each discontinuous reception (DRX) configuration information element comprising one parameter value for each of the one or more corresponding discontinuous reception parameters defined for the configuration information element. Thus, the \u201cplural parameter configurations\u201d comprise a collection of DRX-Config elements, each DRX-Config element comprising one or more of parameters with one value for each parameter. Not all parameters need to be present in each DRX-Config.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the wireless terminal signaling the preferred parameter configuration to the radio access network node.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the wireless terminal signaling the preferred parameter configuration to the radio access network node in the form of a collection of parameter values.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the wireless terminal signaling the preferred parameter configuration to the radio access network node in the form of an index identifying the preferred parameter configuration among the plural parameter configurations offered by the radio access network node.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the wireless terminal providing the preferred parameter configuration in a radio resource control (RRC) Connection Reconfiguration Complete message.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the wireless terminal providing the preferred parameter configuration in a medium access control (MAC) control element.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises limiting repeated transmission of said control element by means of a timer.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the radio access network node evaluating the preferred parameter configuration chosen by the wireless terminal.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises the radio access network node evaluating the preferred parameter configuration chosen by the wireless terminal in accordance with at least one of the following: (1) whether the radio access network node is able to configure the wireless terminal with the preferred parameter configuration; and, (2) whether the preferred parameter configuration is suitable for an observed traffic pattern.","In an example embodiment and mode, the method further comprises: the wireless terminal providing a notification to the radio access network node of the preferred parameter configuration; and the radio access network node updating configuration parameters for the wireless terminal in accordance with the notification.","In another of its aspects the technology disclosed herein concerns a method of operating a radio access network node of a telecommunications system.

For example, the network  chooses a set of initial configuration parameters which it considers at least initially suitable for this particular wireless terminal . The initial configuration parameters may be used for communication by the wireless terminal  until the wireless terminal  has made its choice among the configuration options offered by the network .","In addition to the initial configuration, at some point in time the network  provides the wireless terminal (UE)  with a list of options as generally depicted in . In an example, non-limiting implementation such list of options may be provided contemporaneously with or near contemporaneously with the provision of the initial configuration, or at any later point in time That is, the list generator  of network  prepares and offers to wireless terminal  (over radio interface ) plural parameter configurations for configuring the wireless terminal .

Regarding discontinuous reception (DRX) in general, see, e.g., 3GPP TS 36.321, incorporated herein by reference). Long Term Evolution (LTE) supports Discontinuous Reception (DRX) to enable UE power savings by turning off some or all of the radio circuitry of the UE, thereby increasing the battery life time of the UE. The DRX function is configured and controlled by the network. The UE behavior is based on a set of rules that define when the UE shall monitor the PDCCH for scheduling assignments. The DRX function is characterized by a DRX cycle, an on-duration period, and an inactivity timer. The UE wakes up and monitors the PDCCH at the beginning of every DRX cycle for the entire on-duration period. If no scheduling assignment has been received, the UE falls back asleep again. Whenever the UE receives an assignment from the network, it starts (or restarts) the inactivity timer and continues to monitor the PDCCH until the timer expires. The HARQ operation overrides the DRX function. Thus, the UE wakes up for possible HARQ feedback as well as for possible retransmissions during a configurable amount of time as soon as a retransmission can be expected.","As an example of suggesting parameter values for discontinuous transmission (DTX), for example, a UE aiming to improve battery life-time could request the network to configure long sleep-intervals interrupted by only short OnDurations. In addition, some UEs may want to have a long continuous active time by having a long drx-InactivityTimer. Another UE may put focus on low latency and therefore appreciate a configuration with shorter sleep intervals.","Thus, in an example embodiment and mode, the method comprises the radio access network node offering the plural parameter configurations as a list of discontinuous reception (DRX) configuration information elements, each discontinuous reception (DRX) configuration information element comprising one parameter value for each of the one or more corresponding discontinuous reception parameters defined for the configuration information element For example, in the DRX context the configuration options presented by the network node  may be a list of \u201cDRX-Config\u201d information elements (IEs), each information element containing a value for one or more corresponding DRX parameters included in the IE (see 3GPP TS 36.331, section 6.3.2, MAC-MainConfig).","The Discontinuous Reception (DRX) context is just one example context in which the technology disclosed herein may be employed. As another example context the wireless terminal  may wish to limit or influence which subframes (also known as transmission time intervals (TTIs)) in which the network will instruct or expect the wireless terminal  to transmit or receive data. This subframe selection\/control may be useful for but is not limited to coexistence problems with other radio access technologies hosted in the same wireless terminal. In an example implementation of the subframe selection context, the network may provide the wireless terminal with a list of subframe patterns (e.g. a bitmap where each bit refers to a particular subframe). The subframe patterns may differ in the number and\/or distribution of restricted subframes. The wireless terminal, if facing coexistence problems, could choose a subframe pattern that is most appropriate to solve (for example) the above-mentioned coexistence problems and provide the wireless terminal's choice to the network, in similar manner as discussed above with reference to  and .","Yet another example context of operation for the technology disclosed herein the list of configuration options could also comprise parameters or characteristics that determine the network behavior such as state transitions from a high performance state (e.g. RRC CONNECTED) to a power saving state (e.g. IDLE).","In the particular example embodiment and mode illustrated in  the signaling or messaging between the network node  and the wireless terminal  may be in the form of or comprise a parameter list. But the technology disclosed herein is not limited to signaling of one or more parameter(s) or parameter list per se, either on the downlink from the network node  to the wireless terminal  or on the uplink from the wireless terminal  to the network node . For example, in another embodiment illustrated by , instead of providing specific parameters as defined in the specification and applied by the wireless terminal  (UE), the configuration options may be a list of descriptors for the behavior resulting from the parameter combination the network will apply if the UE chooses that option.  thus shows the offering message () as comprising a list of behavior descriptions. For example, the network could provide a descriptor such as \u201cbattery-optimized\u201d or, more simply, \u201cbattery\u201d to reflect a desired battery saving behavior. On the other hand, the network may provide a descriptor such as and \u201clatency-optimized\u201d or, more simply, \u201cperformance\u201d descriptor if the concern for performance predominates over battery saving. In the  embodiment the wireless terminal  chooses one of the descriptors and reports the chosen descriptor to the network in descriptor selection\/choice message (). Upon receiving such descriptor the network determines (e.g., by a table lookup) a suitable parameter configuration resulting in a behavior corresponding to the chosen descriptor. For example, the network could decide to provide a new DRX configuration (see \u201cDRX-Config\u201d in 3GPP TS 36.331, section 6.3.2) to the wireless terminal .","As shown by the preceding example embodiments and modes, the wireless terminal may, after applying the initial configuration, choose one of the offered configuration options and signal it to the network in a selection\/choice message such as message . As mentioned above, the wireless terminal (UE)  may comprise a parameter selector  configured to select or chose the preferred parameter configuration. The signaling (represented by the \u201cselection\/choice signal ) of the preferred parameter configuration may comprise the entire parameter list (e.g., as encompassed by the embodiment of ) or a descriptor of the preferred parameter configuration (as encompassed by the embodiment of ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10A"],"b":["54","1","1","2","22","30"]},"In another example embodiment and mode, differing collections of the set offered by the network may pertain to differing areas or contexts of technology application. For example, collection C of the set may be offered as one of one or more collections that affect the discontinuous reception (DRX) operation of wireless terminal , collection C of the set may be offered as one of one or more collections of the set that affect the subframe selection operation of wireless terminal , or the like.","Thus, differing collections of the set may pertain to differing types of areas of contexts of operation of the wireless terminal . In one such example embodiment and mode, illustrated simply in , a parameter set index having an index value of 1 may point to a collection which pertains to discontinuous reception (DRX) parameters, whereas a parameter set index having an index value of 2 may point to a collection C which pertains to subframe selection parameters. In the  example embodiment and mode, a collection may present or provide plural configuration options. To this end, another index, known herein as the configuration index, may be used to point to a particular option within a collection (the collection having been pointed to by the parameter set index). For example,  shows that a parameter set index value of 1 coupled with a configuration index value of 2 points to a second option of the configuration C (which, in the illustration of , pertains to DRX). The network node  and wireless terminal  may have stored therein tables of data for determining, based on both the parameter set index and the configuration index, what collection is intended and the values of the parameters for the intended collection.","As understood from the foregoing, the list of options may be generated by list generator  of the network node . This list may be realized as an (indexed) list of information elements as they are used today for configuring parameters. In general, an ATN.1 representation of an information element (IE) is a collection of values that enables a receiver of the information element to associate each of the values with a corresponding parameter of the IE. In an example embodiment and mode the list of configuration options may be carried in the RRC Connection Configuration or in a separate message. Such separate message could be, e.g., be part of or comprise a new RRC procedure (see 36.331, section 5.6), and as such would be a network-initiated procedure. The response (which serves as the selection\/choice signal ()) could either be part of the same procedure or perhaps more preferably could be a separate procedure so that the wireless terminal  can update its choice at a later point in time even if the network does not send the offer again.","The signaling represented by the selection\/choice signal  of the embodiments described herein may be\/comprise or result from a separate procedure which the wireless terminal  may trigger at any point in time (e.g., when the traffic pattern changes). The message may be sent in the same protocol layer (e.g. RRC protocol layer) or in a separate protocol layer (e.g. MAC protocol layer). The latter could be useful if the preferred parameter configuration is expected or allowed to change frequently. In that case a MAC control element containing only the index of the currently preferred configuration option may reduce the signaling overhead significantly. In one embodiment, the maximum frequency at which the wireless terminal  may change its preferred configuration may be limited or updates may be allowed only under certain conditions (e.g. after adding or releasing a radio bearer).","It should be understood from the foregoing that the wireless terminal  can make its selection of the preferred parameter configuration when prompted to do so by the network, e.g., in response to offering signal . In some example embodiments, the wireless terminal  must continue or \u201clive with\u201d its selection until the network permits the wireless terminal  to make another selection, e.g., by the network providing the wireless terminal  with another offering signal . The advantage of such embodiments is that such operation causes essentially no signaling overhead. In these example embodiments only the existing messages grow perhaps slightly in size, but no additional messages can be initiated by the wireless terminal . But a drawback of such embodiments is that the wireless terminal  is not able to reverse or alter its choice of preferred parameter configuration. Imagine, for example, that the wireless terminal  has chosen a \u201cbattery efficient\u201d configuration since there were maybe no active applications or since the display was turned off. Then, when some application starts or when the display is powered on or when an application indicates to the operating system that it requires optimal performance, the wireless terminal  would like to indicate such to the network.","In another example embodiment and mode the wireless terminal  may make another or further selection of the preferred parameter configuration at other times, e.g., at times other than when specifically requested to do so by the network (e.g., other than in response to an offering signal ). At such other times the wireless terminal on its own initiative may seek to renew, re-select, or revise its preferred parameter configuration without being requested to do so by the network. For example,  illustrates an example embodiment and scenario in which the wireless terminal  not only generates a selection\/choice signal () in response to the offering signal , but thereafter without intervention of another offering signal and essentially on initiative of wireless terminal  itself (although in perhaps to changed conditions such as traffic conditions) generates another selection\/choice signal () which apprises the network of a renewed or revised preferred parameter configuration (e.g., renews or reasserts or revises the preferred parameter configuration option exercised or selected by the wireless terminal ).","A potential drawback of the example embodiment and scenario of  is increased signaling. To prevent this, in an example embodiment such as that illustrated in  a feature or limitation such as a timer or other rule is included to require a time delay  between successive selection\/choice messages () and (). The time delay  may be imposed by a timer included in the entity , and particularly in parameter selector . For example, the wireless terminal  may not be permitted to provide the same choice in consecutive messages, i.e., it must not tell the network multiple consecutive times that it wants the battery efficient configuration. Either the network acts on the initial request or not, there being no need to repeat the request.","If the UE does not provide a preferred configuration option, in an example embodiment and mode the network may stick to or retain the current configuration or it may apply other means to optimize the configuration at a later point in time. The current configuration may be the initial or default configuration mentioned above.","In the above regard, the network may conclude that the wireless terminal has not provided a preferred configuration option. For example, the network may reach a conclusion of non-selection by the wireless terminal if the wireless terminal  has not include a preferred choice (if it has any) in a selection\/choice signal  (e.g., RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message) which it must send immediately (<20 ms) after receiving the offering signal  (e.g., a RRC Connection Reconfiguration message from the network). In such case the network reaches its conclusion of non-selection after a timeout. If the UE does not make a choice, the network assumes that the UE is satisfied with the current configuration.","In one example embodiment illustrated in , upon the wireless terminal  providing a preferred configuration option (e.g., the preferred parameter configuration, which may be represented as an option or index as explained above) the network may evaluate the configuration information (e.g., selection\/choice signal) as provided by the wireless terminal (UE).  shows the network node as comprising a selection evaluator .","In an example embodiment and mode selection evaluator  is configured to determine one or more of the following: (1) whether the network\/node is able to configure the UE accordingly (e.g., whether the network has the required resources available (if the chosen configuration would result in a change)), and (2) whether the suggestion or choice made by the wireless terminal  matches\/fits the observed traffic pattern (e.g. to compensate for bad UE implementations doing obviously the wrong choice and could thereby harm the network)).","Determination (1) by selector evaluator  may be appropriate, e.g., in a subframe pattern allocation situation\/context in which the network may give several wireless terminals a same set of options and, for some reasons, all wireless terminals pick the same subframe pattern, which would be undesirable since some subframes would then be extremely loaded while other subframes may be essentially idle.","To make determination (2), the selector evaluator  may, e.g., check which radio bearers are currently established. If the wireless terminal  has (for example) an active VoIP bearer, it should not have a DRX configuration (e.g. with very long DRX cycles) that prevents the network from sending VoIP packets within the given delay constraints. The eNB may also have a deep packet inspection (DPI) functionality that monitors the traffic from\/to a UE. As soon as the network discovers protocols or applications that require low latency, it could refrain from applying a very battery efficient DRX configuration. If the determination (2) occurs, the network may have to send an updated RRC Connection Reconfiguration to the UE.","Accordingly, in some example embodiments such as that of , it may be up to the network to accept or reject the preferred parameter configuration proposal of the wireless terminal . If the network accepts the proposed parameter combination option the network may perform a reconfiguration (e.g. RRC Connection Reconfiguration) of the wireless terminal in order to apply the chosen parameter values. In this regard, when an RRC connection is established with the wireless terminal  the network always provides the wireless terminal  with some initial or default parameters. Whenever the network wants to change any of the parameters, e.g. in response to a preferred parameter configuration provided by the wireless terminal, it initiates another such RRC Connection Reconfiguration procedure. The advantage of this example embodiment is that the actual configuration is under full control of the network, e.g., in line with the principle applied in the existing LTE specifications (3GPP TS 36.331).","In case that the parameters affected by the chosen parameter combination option specify only the network operation (e.g. state transitions mentioned above) the network may apply them without explicitly informing the wireless terminal.","In another embodiment illustrated by way of example in , the wireless terminal  is allowed to autonomously select among the predefined configuration options, and the selection\/choice message () to the network is merely a notification of which configuration the wireless terminal  selects to apply. When receiving from the wireless terminal  the notification of the parameter change, the network can update its parameters accordingly.  shows the network node as comprising network parameter updater functionality .","In another embodiment illustrated by way of example in , the wireless terminal (UE) may be allowed to autonomously apply one of the multitude of set parameter collections and to apply the parameters. In the  example embodiment, the network provides plural configuration options and, in response, the an autonomous parameter selector  wireless terminal  selects one of the plural configuration options and applies the parameters of the selected option (the preferred parameter configuration) without telling or asking the network. In other words, the wireless terminal  does not generate a selection\/choice signal  in response to or in conjunction with the selection of the preferred parameter configuration. The network is thus left to discern or ascertain or detect by other means which configuration the wireless terminal (UE) has chosen or when it does not require any adaptation in the network behavior. In some example implementations the network can detect the changed configuration from the actions of the wireless terminal .  shows the network node as comprising a changed behavior detector  (e.g., UE changed behavior detector).","In the DRX example, the network can detect that the wireless terminal (UE) has changed the configuration because it does not perform transmissions associated to the DRX Active state such as transmission of CQI on PUCCH or SRS.","In an example embodiment the wireless terminal  may be given the option to report radio resource management (RRM) measurements (e.g. of other frequencies) periodically, e.g., every 500 ms. If the wireless terminal  wants to reduce the risk of radio link failure and potentially improve its throughput, the wireless terminal  should perform those measurements. Many wireless terminals will not, since measurement performance consumes more battery power but a laptop connected to a power supply may go for the potentially improved performance.","The method by which the wireless terminal  selects the most appropriate parameter configuration can be chosen independently of the core concept outlined above. It may be wireless terminal\u2014implementation specific or specified in a corresponding standard. In one embodiment illustrated by way of example in , the operating system of the wireless terminal may evaluate the expected performance of any given parameter combination and associate with a human readable\/understandable characteristic (e.g. \u201cbattery saver\u201d; \u201chigh performance\u201d). With this approach it could be left to the end-user of the device to choose the preferred behavior. Upon selection the wireless terminal  either applies the configuration or notifies the network about the preferred parameter combination as outlined above.","In another embodiment the wireless terminal  could implement an internal interface  (API, Application Programming Interface) which higher layer applications could use to indicate their requirements (high performance, low delay, . . . ). Based on this input the wireless terminal  may then choose the currently most appropriate parameter combination. Alternatively, the status of the user interface of the device such as, e.g., the display status (on\/off), the status of sensors such as accelerometers or gyrometes, the type of power source (AC vs battery), the status of the battery, or any other means that can be used to infer the relative importance of latency versus battery efficiency may be used to determine the suitable configuration option.","Table 1 below shows the DRX-Config information element including all possible parameter values as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331, Rel-10. Allowing UEs to freely choose parameters for the contained variables (e.g. on Duration, drx-InactivityTimer, . . . ) would result in a very large number of possible combinations for which the network has not been tested and which it can therefore not apply without risking poor performance or even lack of network stability. According to some embodiments of the method described above, the network may therefore provide configuration options as indicated in Table 2.","Various entries in Table 2 are understood from 3GPP TS 36.331, and particularly a table therein entitled \u201cMAC-MainConfig field descriptions\u201d. For example, \u201cpsf\u201d signifies a value in number of PDCCH sub-frames; Value \u201cpsf1\u201d corresponds to 1 PDCCH sub-frame; \u201cpsf2\u201d corresponds to 2 PDCCH sub-frames; and so on; \u201csf\u201d corresponds to a value in number of sub-frames.","Among the two parameter configuration options presented in Table 2, the wireless terminal  may choose the one fitting its (current) requirements (1=performance optimized; 2=battery optimized).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 11A","b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"figref":["FIG. 11B","FIG. 11C"]},"The methods described herein or encompassed hereby allow the wireless terminal  to impact the network configuration while allowing the network to limit the possible choices (e.g., to selected and well tested parameter combinations). This allows the wireless terminal  to influence, e.g., its performance, battery consumption or latency.
