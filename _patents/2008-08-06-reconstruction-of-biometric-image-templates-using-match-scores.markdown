title: Reconstruction of biometric image templates using match scores
abstract: A method of reconstructing biometric face image templates of a face recognition system (FRS) using the match scores or distances provided by the FRS. The match scores represent the distance between a image introduced to the FRS and the unknown image template stored in the FRS. The present method uses an affine transformation approximating the unknown algorithm within the FRS and the match scores provided by the FRS to determine the coordinates of the unknown target template. The coordinates of the unknown target template are then applied to a pseudo-inversion of the affine transformation to produce a reconstructed image template of the unknown target. This reconstructed image template can then be used to ‘break-in’ to the FRS.

Homeland Security\/CIA and Unisys Corp. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to biometric recognition systems; more specifically, a method of reconstructing image templates used by biometric recognition systems.","Biometric technologies have become an integral part of many secure access systems. Biometric-based authentication systems are being deployed in both low-risk secure systems such as laptops and cell phones to relatively high-risk secure systems such as military bases and airports. The use of biometric technologies has a number of advantages over password or smartcard-based technologies, such as user convenience, high security, and less fraud. However, like many other authentication technologies, biometric-based systems are also vulnerable to security breaches. The cost of replacing a biometric token or template is higher to that of a password or a smart card, with severe security and privacy implications. The templates can be reused over digital networks or can be used to reproduce synthetic biometric templates such as fake fingers or model faces. In the case of face templates, there is an additional risk that the identity of a person using a biometric access system in a highly secure facility can be revealed. Several sources of security breaches in biometric-based authentication systems have been found. Some countermeasures have also been proposed to nullify such threats and the standardized biometric application programming interface (BioAPI) is continuously updated with countermeasure guidelines such as encrypting templates, avoiding storage and transmission of original templates, and performing quantization of match scores.","In general, most biometric authentication systems have four major modules, a biometric template acquisition sensor, a matching module to compare a new template to an enrolled template, a decision module using predefined thresholds for particular operational points, and a database for enrolled templates (template gallery). In many applications, it is not possible to integrate all these modules to one unit. In such scenarios, the information is passed from one unit to the other through digital channels and\/or stored in digital media for offline processing. Each module possesses different levels of security threats, and different countermeasures are necessary to nullify such threats. For instance, \u2018aliveness\u2019 detection at the sensor unit will detect any attempts to hack the system with synthetic templates. Similarly, a secure database or a secure digital channel will prevent any unauthorized access to templates over a network. In applications, where the matching module and decision module are not integrated together, the \u2018match scores\u2019 must be stored in a digital media or transmitted through a digital channel to a decision module. Security breaches resulting from attacks on match scores can occur in distributed network cluster biometric systems with a central decision unit. Such networks are common in wide area monitoring contexts.","The dominant approach for a match score-based attack on a biometric system is based on hill climbing. C. Soutar was the first to propose an iterative template adaptation method, popularly known as the hill climbing attack, to break into a biometric system based on match scores. , Secure, vol. 5, p. 46-49 (2002). As shown in , hill-climbing approach 1 attacks the account of a subject, referred to as the targeted subject, by starting from arbitrary face template  and iteratively refining  it. Face recognition system (FRS)  outputs match score , which is the distance between arbitrary face template  and target subject . At every iteration, if the modified template results in a better score than the previous match score , then the modified template is retained , or else, it is discarded and prior template  is modified again. The process is iterated until the template is accepted  as the targeted subject. With this method, a break-in may be achieved using a final template that does not look like any real face, as long as it deceives the system. In other words, it is not a face reconstruction method but just a break-in strategy.","One countermeasure for the first generation of hill climbing approaches is to quantize the match scores. In this approach, the FRS outputs match scores, but does not alter the match scores with small changes in input images. With appropriate quantization, it is not possible to get the incremental feedback needed by these approaches. Therefore, A. Adler developed a modified hill climbing attack for a face recognition system with quantized match scores using an additional independent set of eigenfaces. , Proc. Canadian Conf. Electrical and Computer Eng., p. 469-472 (May 2004). In Adler's modification, after initializing the process with an arbitrary face template, at every iteration, the previously updated template is multiplied with randomly selected eigenfaces having different weights. This generates templates farther away from the previous template. The face template that results in a better match score is retained as the updated image for the next iteration. The process terminates when there is no further improvement in match scores. Experimental results on a commercial face recognition algorithm show that after nearly 4,000 attempts, a high match score is achieved with 99% confidence. Later, Adler extended this idea to work with encrypted face templates. , Proc. Int'l Conf. Audio and Video-Based Biometric Person Authentication, p. 1100-1109 (July 2005).","Security breaches are possible not only in face biometrics but in other biometric applications also. U. Uludag and A. Jain extended the hill climbing approach to break into minutiae-based fingerprint recognition system. , Proc. SPIE-EI 2004, Security, Steganography and Watermarking of Multimedia Contents, p. 622-633 (January 2004).","Although hill climbing-based attacks can successfully break a particular targeted account, effective countermeasures for such attacks can also be created. One property of hill climbing-based attacks is that they require a large number of attempts before success. Therefore, one possible countermeasure for such attacks is to restrict the number of consecutive, unsuccessful attempts. However, this still leaves the system vulnerable to a spyware-based attack that interlaces its false attempts with attempts by genuine users (successful attempts) and collects information to iterate over a period of time. However, in most hill climbing-based attacks, the templates at the ith attempt (iteration) are generated from the (i\u22121)th attempts (iterations) and are similar to each other. Therefore, if all unsuccessful attempts for a particular targeted account within a fixed time interval are monitored, a pattern of similar faces with decreasing dissimilarity scores will be found. Therefore, a continuous observation of unsuccessful match scores will help to detect hill climbing-based spyware attacks.","Recently, a method of modeling of a face recognition algorithm using an affine transform was developed. P. Mohanty, S. Sarkar, and R. Kasturi, , Proc. IEEE Workshop Face Recognition Challenge (June 2005). Starting from distances computed by any face recognition algorithm, such as the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) baseline algorithm, the modeling process calculates the best affine transform that approximates it. The modeling process is a closed-form solution based on classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).","Attempts to find vulnerabilities have focused on modifications of the hill-climbing technique; however, these techniques have become identifiable by recognition systems as attacks because of their iterative nature. Discovery of vulnerabilities in recognition systems, therefore, needs to be expanded beyond variations of the hill-climbing technique, in order for countermeasures to be designed to further prevent security breaches resulting from a recognition system's vulnerabilities. Although a process of modeling a face recognition algorithm is available, the process needs modification and improvement to better model a FRS and a method is needed to utilize the improved modeling process to identify vulnerabilities in recognition systems.","The present invention includes a non-iterative method of reconstructing unknown image templates of biometric systems using match scores. The method includes providing an array of known image templates, providing a recognition algorithm, wherein the recognition algorithm computes the distance between the unknown target template and an image template selected from the array of known image templates, providing an affine transformation approximating the recognition algorithm, and providing the coordinates of the known image templates in the approximation model.","The recognition algorithm may be known or unknown. The image templates in the array of known image templates are preferably distinct from one another. The image templates may be face image templates.","The method further includes finding unknown coordinates in the approximation model such that the distance between the unknown coordinates and the coordinates of known image templates equals the distances computed by recognition algorithm, calculating the pseudo-inversion of the affine transformation, and applying the unknown coordinates of unknown target template to the pseudo-inverted affine transformation.","The application of the unknown coordinates to the pseudo-inverted affine transformation results in a reconstruction of the unknown image template. Once this template has been reconstructed, it can be used to \u2018break in\u2019 to the recognition system, thereby exposing the system's vulnerability.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.","The present invention provides a method of reconstructing biometric image templates using the match scores of distinct images from a face recognition system (FRS). When the reconstruction method of the present invention \u2018breaks in\u2019 to a FRS, it creates no obvious patterns in the match scores, preventing detection by the FRS. Known countermeasures are not effective in preventing security breaches caused by the method, and new countermeasures will be difficult to design because of the absence of an obvious pattern in the match scores.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","10","10","9","17","2","9","10","1","10","10","1"]},"A simplified diagram of reconstruction method  is shown in .

FRS  is treated as a complete black box and no reverse engineering is performed on it. Instead, an assumption is made as to the type of face recognition algorithm used by FRS . It may be possible to identify the recognition algorithm given score matrices of known algorithms, but this is not necessary for the success of the present method.","Modeling process  is an offline procedure and needs to be constructed only once for a given recognition algorithm. Once the model is built, templates are presented from break-in set  to FRS , which calculates match scores  to unknown target template . Unknown target template  represents an enrolled template in the FRS, which when reconstructed results in a successful \u2018break-in\u2019.

Finally, template construction process  manipulates the model to construct unknown target template .","Modeling Process","Modeling process , illustrated in , is used to model the face recognition algorithm of FRS  using approximating affine transformation . The inversion of this transformation is then used by embedding process  and template construction process  to reconstruct unknown target template . The inputs to FRS  are two distinct face templates xand xselected from break-in set  and the output is a match score or distance d  between the two templates.","Typically, a face recognition algorithm of an FRS transforms the given image into a point in a low-dimensional space and then performs a distance measure on this model space. This low-dimensional space is usually constructed by statistical methods such as PCA, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or independent component analysis (ICA) or constructed out of low-level features detected in the images, such as in the elastic bunch graph matching approach.","The face recognition algorithm of FRS  is unknown to modeling process . Modeling process  models a face recognition algorithm, even feature-based ones, by an affine transformation. Modeling process  finds approximating affine transformation  by combining orthogonal (or rigid) transformation  and nonrigid (shear and stretch) transformation  transformation. Nonrigid portion  of transformation  enhances performance of modeling process . Approximating affine transformation  preserves distances  among templates  generated by FRS . Any template can be embedded in space  based on its distance d  from a known set of templates, break-in set .","Modeling process  must determine approximating affine transformation A  such that when given images x's, are transformed to affine space , the euclidean distance between the transformed coordinates of the images are similar to the distances computed by FRS . In this notation, x's are N-dimensional row-scanned representations of the images, and affine transformation A  has dimensions M\u00d7N, with M<N.","To find approximating affine transformation , the given distances (or their monotonically increasing transformation) are expressed between known images (images contained in break-in set ) as a dot product distance between vectors  and then, affine transformation  is constructed between these vectors and the images.","(Herein, matrices are denoted by bold capital letters A and column vectors by bold small letters a. The identity matrix is denoted by I, a vector of ones by 1, a vector of zeros by 0, and the transpose of A by A.)","Modeling Process: Dot Product Distance","To determine dot product distances between vectors , dot product distance matrix D , must first be created .

In such cases, distance matrix D  must undergo metric distance conversion .

Two different templates with little variation always produce a nonzero dissimilarity. Therefore, it can be assumed that the reflexive and positivity properties always hold unless small scores are forcefully suppressed to zero. Even if the scores are rounded off to the nearest number or small scores are suppressed to zero, as long as there is not a sparse distance matrix with few positive entries, an embedding in the model space can be found that can approximate the distance matrix D.","Second, if the distance matrix D violates the symmetric property, then this property can be reinstated by replacing D with \u00bd(D+D).","Finally, if D violates the triangle inequality, then the triangle inequality can be enforced by adding a constant factor \u03b6 to non-diagonal entries of D, where \u03b6\u2267max|d+d\u2212d|. The value of \u03b6 is learned using break-in set  templates only. Using an offline copy of FRS , the pair-wise distance between every template of break-in set  is computed, resulting in a full distance matrix D with diagonal elements representing self-distance that is set to zero. The learned value of \u03b6 is used in computing the distance from the targeted subject to each template in break-in set . \u03b6 is added to the non-diagonal entries of D irrespective of genuine and impostor scores; therefore, the overall performance of FRS , as represented by the distance matrix, is not affected by the addition of \u03b6 to the computed distances.

In order to validate the effectiveness of the reconstruction method and break-in strategy, the selected face recognition algorithms must have high recognition rates at low FAR. Because most of the face recognition algorithms perform poorly on a data set with one or more variations in face images, the experiments were restricted to controlled frontal face images only. Similarly, current template-based algorithms require the images to be scaled to the same size with the same eye location, so a preprocessing step is inevitable for such algorithms.","However, if a face recognition system has high performance without such restriction on the variation of face images or size of the face images, then the reconstruction method can be extended naturally to such systems.","The reconstruction method was evaluated on two template-based algorithms and one feature-based face recognition system: 1) PCA approach with Mahalanobis cosine angle as the distance measure, 2) Moghaddam and Pentland's algorithm, popularly known as the Bayesian intrapersonal\/extrapersonal classifier, and 3) a commercial face recognition system based on a Local Feature Analysis of face images. Both the baseline and Bayesian algorithms were trained using the break-in set from the FRGC training set. The commercial algorithm did not require any training process and was used as a black box in all experiments. Because all of the face images are normalized with fixed eye coordinates ( ) and fixed-size (150\u00d7130) face images, the face and eye detector module embedded in the commercial face recognition system was not utilized. Using the fafb probe set of the FERET distribution, the baseline, the Bayesian, and the commercial algorithms had 97 percent, 95 percent, and 99 percent True Acceptance Rate (TAR) at 1 percent FAR, respectively.","The three algorithms have different approaches to comparing two faces and generate similarity and\/or dissimilarity scores with different distance measures. The baseline algorithm uses a Mahalanobis cosine angle and has dissimilarity scores between \u22121 and 1. Similarly, the Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier reports the similarity between two faces in terms of probability of difference image to the intrapersonal\/extrapersonal space. For this experiment, the CSU implementation of the Bayesian algorithm was used, where a negative logarithm transformation is applied to the probabilistic similarity score to convert the score into a distance measure. However, in order to have an upper bound for the dissimilarity scores, the distances to the interval [0,1] was row normalized. The similarity measure used in the feature-based commercial algorithm is not known, but the similarity scores are within a finite range of [SS]. The similarity scores were converted to distances by simply subtracting each match score Sfrom the maximum possible match score (S\u2212S). In the experiments, raw match scores from the commercial system were used without any score normalization. All three distance measures used by respective algorithms exhibit the symmetric property but violate the triangle inequality property. Therefore, the triangle inequality property was reinforced in the respective distance matrices. The values of \u03b6 learned from the break-in set were 1.297, 2.094, and 19.970 for the baseline, the Bayesian, and the commercial algorithms, respectively.","The next objective was to model the behavior of each face recognition algorithm in terms of an affine transformation. The distance between two templates computed by these algorithms should be close to the euclidean distance between the two templates in the respective affine spaces. Some of the intermediate results show the accuracy of the reconstruction method and the behavior of the constructed affine spaces.","The graphs shown in  plot the eigenvalues of the transformed distance matrices B defined in Equation (5) for the baseline algorithm (), the Bayesian algorithm (), and the commercial algorithm (). The eigenvalues of the individual algorithms reflect the nature of the affine space for each individual algorithm. The plots appear different due to different scales of eigenvalues for each algorithm.  shows that the eigenvalues drop from 9.4 to zero at 360 index of the eigenvector, which is about 60 percent of the total number of images. Therefore, the baseline algorithm uses top eigenvectors that contribute 60 percent of the total energy.  also provides estimation for the dimension of each affine space. For example, it is expected that for the baseline algorithm, any break-in set with more than 360 images will result in approximately the same probability of break-in.","However, in for the Bayesian algorithm, eigenvalues did not drop to zero even with 600 images in the break-in set. Therefore, the loss of sharp features is expected in the reconstructed images for the Bayesian algorithm with 600 or less images in the break-in set. Similarly, for the commercial algorithm, a near optimal performance with 600 images in the break-in set is expected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["h","f","a","e"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00009","num":"00009"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u025b","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"d","mo":"~"},"mi":"ij"},{"mi":["d","ij"]}],"mo":"-"},"msub":{"mi":["d","ij"]}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":["ij ","ij "]},"To demonstrate the effect of the number of images in the break-in set on the quality of reconstructed templates and break-in performance, five different break-in sets from the FRGC training set were created. Two break-in sets contained 75 and 150 images with one image per subject and the other three break-in sets contained 300, 450, and 600 images with multiple images per subject. Sample images from the break-in set and gallery set are shown in . All 1,196 images were reconstructed in the FERET gallery set using each of the five break-in sets.  shows some of the reconstructed images using a break-in set with 600 images.  shows the reconstructed templates of a particular targeted subject with all five break-in sets. The reconstruction of the targeted subject's template improves with the number of images in the break-in set. The noise in the reconstructed images is caused by the break-in set and gallery set being from two distinct databases collected in different environments.","In the case of the Bayesian algorithm, the reconstructed images appear much smoother than the original image. As discussed earlier, the Bayesian algorithm requires more than 600 numbers of images in the break-in set for better reconstruction. To quantify the performance of breaking into a system with reconstructed images, the probability of break-in, which is defined as the probability of breaking a randomly chosen targeted subject, is computed by dividing the number of successfully verified target subject using reconstructed images by the total number of enrolled subjects.","The reconstructed templates of the targeted subject are matched against the original templates of the targeted subject, and a dissimilarity matrix is generated for each of the three algorithms. From each of these dissimilarity matrices, the TAR at 1% FAR from the respective Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves is computed. The probability of breaking into any particular face recognition system is computed as the ratio between the number of accounts successfully broken at 1% FAR and the total number of accounts. This performance measure for break-in is different from that used in other related works, where the number of attempts is considered as a measure of the breaking into a security system. In this case, the number of attempts is fixed and is the same as the number of images in the break-in set.  compares the probabilities of break-in for the three algorithms with an increasing number of attempts. For the baseline algorithm, only 300 attempts are sufficient to achieve a 100% success rate to break into the system. For the feature-based commercial algorithm, 600 attempts are needed to break into the system for a 73% success rate. For the template-based Bayesian algorithm, 600 attempts are required to break into the system to achieve a 72% success rate. At 1% FAR, the probability of break-in with any random template after 600 attempts is 1%.","An FRS containing a commercial face recognition algorithm was used to compare the reconstruction method of the present invention with a hill climbing-based approach presented by Adler and Uludag and Jain. A. Adler, , Proc. Canadian Conf. Electrical and Computer Eng., pp. 469-472 (May 2004); U. Uldag and A. Jain, , Proc. SPIE-EI 2004, Security, Steganography and Watermarking of Multimedia Contents, pp. 622-633 (January 2004). The eigenfaces required to modify the previous template in a hill climbing approach were created using 600 images from the break-in set. At each iteration, a randomly selected eigenface was added or subtracted from the previous template. Due to the computational demand of the hill climbing process, the hill climbing method was restricted to the first 100 subjects of the FERET gallery set and a maximum of 600 attempts were allowed per subject. The commercial algorithm was set to operate at 1% FAR with 99% TAR, and the system decided the acceptance or rejection of a probe template based on this operational setup. The number of targeted subjects that were successfully broken by the hill climbing method were counted and compared with the number of successfully accepted reconstructed templates using the break-in set with 600 images. Upon reconstruction of a targeted subject's face template, the reconstructed template was treated as an original face template and matched with the gallery set. This comparison shows the efficiency of the approach against the hill climbing approach after 600 iterations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 15","i":"Images Can Be Regenerated from Quantized Biometric Match Score Data"},"One countermeasure to the first-generation hill climbing attack is to quantize match scores. The systems with quantized match scores do not alter the output match scores with small changes in input images, which can prevent general hill climbing attacks. In such cases, if two similar probe templates, when matched with a template of the targeted subject, have the original match scores, say, 42.56 and 43.4, in the range [0, 100] and if the system quantizes the output match scores to the nearest integer, then both the scores will be quantized to 43. For such quantized scores, a hill climbing-based approach will fail to observe the improvement in the modified template and will fail to regenerate a template for the next iteration. However, such quantization of match scores has minimal effect on the reconstruction method.","The version of the hill climbing approach used here failed with quantized match scores and, therefore, the break-in performance of the hill climbing approach was not compared with the reconstruction method. The reconstruction method compares different face templates to the targeted subject and does not need to observe any improvement in the match scores; therefore, the reconstruction method does not have the limitation of the hill climbing approach and can be used on systems with quantized match scores.","Although a comparison could not be completed, the probability of break-in using quantized match scores for the commercial face recognition system was calculated.

The probabilities of break-in do not change significantly when the original scores quantized with Qequals to 0.0001 or 0.001, and the probability of break-in drops from 0.68 to 0.45 when Qequals to 0.01. However, for Qequal to 0.1, the probability of break-in dropped from 0.45 to 0.22.  demonstrates the effect of quantization on a reconstructed template along with the acceptance\/rejection decision from the system using that particular reconstructed template. With an increasing value of Qthe quality of the reconstructed template starts to degrade and will eventually be rejected by the system. If the system outputs a very high level of quantized scores, for example, with Q=0.1, then the original match scores are highly distorted, and the affine modeling of the underlying algorithm is erroneous, and as a result, the overall break-in performance is affected. However, such quantization of match scores has a trade-off with the operational flexibility of a system. For example, if the recognition system, with the range of original scores in the interval [0, 100], quantizes the original scores at 10 different points with Qequal to 0.1, then the system is restricted to operate only at these 10 distinct operational points (thresholds) and lose the flexibility to operate at any intermediate threshold or FARs.","The reconstruction method of the present invention exposes a potential source for security breach in FRSs. An affine transformation is used to approximate the behavior of the face recognition system using an independent set of face templates termed as the break-in set. Selected subsets of templates in the break-in set are then matched only once with the enrolled templates of the targeted subject. Given the distances of the targeted subject's template, that template is embedded in the learned affine space and the modeling affine transformation is inverted to arrive at the original template.","Advantages of the reconstruction method include it is not based on a local search and it requires fewer attempts than hill-climbing-based approaches. In addition, the reconstruction method is difficult to detect automatically and cannot be neutralized by quantization of match scores, because it uses distinct templates in each break-in attempt.","It will be seen that the advantages set forth above, and those made apparent from the foregoing description, are efficiently attained and since certain changes may be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matters contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.","It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described, and all statements of the scope of the invention, which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall there between.
