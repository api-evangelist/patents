title: Wideband antenna element and array thereof
abstract: A wideband antenna element includes first and second spaced-apart, mutually parallel conductive plates. Each plate defines a through aperture and a tapered slot extending from the aperture to an edge of the plate. The apertures and the slots of the two plates are registered. A feed structure including a strip conductor extends in the region between the plates, and crosses the slot at a location remote from both the edges of the plates and the apertures. A stub terminates the strip conductor. Through vias or conductors extend from one plate to the other near the edges of the slots, and near the feed. One embodiment includes dielectric sheets lying between the conductive plates.

The United States Government has a non-exclusive, non-transferable, paid-up license in this invention.","This invention relates to antennas for electromagnetic transduction, and more particularly to broadband generally planar antennas.","The antenna for electromagnetic transduction (transmitting and or receiving) is often a critical part of sensing and communication systems. In the past, simple antennas could often meet the relatively narrowband requirements of radio communications. The increased bandwidth requirements of television placed a premium on bandwidth, both to provide cost-effective solutions for the need to cover VHF bands such as 54 to 88 megahertz (MHZ), corresponding to television channels 2 through 6 and 174 to 216 MHz (channels 7 through 13). Six-megahertz Channels within these bands were often received by simple dipole antennas, with tuning to improve the response.","The introduction of color television introduced the need for phase control over each television channel in order to avoid color distortion. Various new types of broadband antennas were introduced, such as the log-periodic monopole and the equiangular spiral antenna, which, at least in theory, could have infinite bandwidths. Physical limitations, such as the need for extremely precise fabrication of the small, high-frequency responsive portions, prevented the practical bandwidths of such antennas from exceeding about 10:1. Such antennas were, and continue to be, used for various forms of surveillance and monitoring.","Many applications for which antennas are used require scanning of the antenna beam more rapidly than physical movement of the antenna allows, and may require relatively high directivity. Those skilled in the antenna arts know that array antennas are useful for such applications. A wide variety of array antennas is known. Basically, an array antenna is a one or two-dimensional arrangement of a plurality of antenna elements. Sometimes two-dimensional arrays may be nonplanar, in which case the array has three-dimensional aspects. Each antenna element (or sometimes subgroups of antenna elements) of an array is \u201cfed\u201d with a common signal, which may be individually phase-shifted or adjusted in amplitude to accomplish beam scanning, as known in the art.","The antenna is basically a transducer which transduces electromagnetic signals between guided waves (signals flowing in a transmission line) and unguided waves (radiated signals). For this reason, the operation of an antenna in a transmission mode of operation is basically the same as its operation in a receiving mode, and has the same characteristics. Some of the terms used in the antenna arts originated at a time when the mechanisms by which antennas operate were not well understood. For example, the antenna \u201cfeed\u201d point or terminals was defined at a time when the transmitting function was of prime importance, and is the terminal(s) at which a signal to be transmitted (transduced to an unguided wave) is applied. Only later was it fully understood that the feed point of a \u201ctransmitting\u201d antenna is functionally identical to the received signal port of the same antenna when receiving signals. Thus, one general term for an antenna usable for either transmission or reception is \u201cradiator\u201d or \u201cradiating element.\u201d The \u201cbeam\u201d of an antenna is a general term representing the radiated field and its characteristics. It is now understood that a given antenna has identical transmitting and receiving beams. A description of the operation of an antenna may be couched in terms of either transmission or reception, with the other mode of operation being understood as inherent therein.","The arraying of antenna elements to form array antennas introduced a host of new problems into the field. Among these problems is the interaction or mutual coupling among the elemental antennas, which can affect the apparent performance of the elemental antenna, and the need for a \u201cbeamformer\u201d to combine the signals received by the individual antenna elements (reception mode) or divide the signal to be transmitted among the elemental antennas (transmission mode). The mutual coupling and the need for a beamformer having its own impedance characteristics makes for an intractable problem.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,782,346, issued Nov. 1, 1988 in the name of Sharma describes a horn-like finline antenna suitable for broadband operation in an array environment. The finline antenna described therein includes a dielectric plate with electrically conductive elements of the finline antenna printed or applied to each side of the dielectric. The dielectric plate(s) are fed by a rectangular waveguide.","Improved or alternative antennas are desired.","A radiating element according to an aspect of the invention comprises an electrically conductive first plate defining a through aperture and also defining a slot extending from the aperture to an edge of the plate. The slot has a transverse dimension(s) in the plane of the first plate. The transverse dimension increases monotonically with increasing distance between the aperture and the edge of the first plate. The radiating element also comprises an electrically conductive second plate defining a second through aperture identical to the through aperture of the first plate. The second plate also defines a second slot extending from the second through aperture to an edge of the second plate. The second slot has transverse dimensions in the plane of the second plate which are identical to those of the transverse dimension of the slot of the first plate. The first and second plates are spaced apart, with the through aperture and the slot of the second plate registered with the through aperture and the slot of the first plate. A feed element including a strip conductive element (lies midway between the plane of the first plate and the plane of the second plate. The feed element extends across the slots at a location removed from, or between, the through apertures and the edges of the first and second plates.","In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the radiator of the invention, the region between the first and second plates includes solid dielectric material. The shape or dimensions of the slots may be exponentially increasing with increasing distance from the apertures. In one embodiment, the slot transverse dimensions are piecewise-linear or a plurality of straight-line segments.","In one advantageous version of this aspect of the invention, the radiating element comprises a set or plurality of electrically conductive elements extending between, and connecting to, the first and second plates at least at locations adjacent the slots. In one version, a set or plurality of electrically conductive elements extends between the first and second plates at locations adjacent the feed element.","A radiating element according to another aspect of the invention comprises first and second dielectric sheets, each defining a first broad surface and a second broad surface. The radiating element also includes an electrically conductive first plate defining a through aperture, and also defining a slot extending from the aperture to an edge of the plate. The slot has a transverse dimension in the plane of the first plate which increases monotonically with increasing distance from the aperture. The electrically conductive first plate is affixed to the first broad surface of the first dielectric sheet. The radiator also includes an electrically conductive second plate defining a second through aperture identical to the through aperture of the first plate, and also defining a second slot extending from the second through aperture to an edge of the second plate. The second slot has transverse dimensions in the plane of the second plate which are identical to those of the slot of the first plate. The second plate is affixed to the first broad side of the second dielectric sheet. The second sides of the first and second dielectric sheets are juxtaposed at a juncture, with the first and second plates being spaced apart by the first and second dielectric sheets, and with the through aperture and the slot of the second plate registered with the through aperture and the slot of the first plate. A feed element including a strip conductive element lies in the juncture, with the feed element extending across the slots at a location removed from the through apertures and from the edges of the first and second plates. In a particular embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the radiating element further comprises a plurality of electrical conductors extending between, and making electrical connection with, the first and second plates, at locations lying adjacent the slots in the first and second plates.","An antenna array according to another aspect of the invention comprises a plurality of elemental radiating elements.
