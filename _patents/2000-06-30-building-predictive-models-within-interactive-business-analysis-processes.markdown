No. 09,608,595, entitled \u201cINCORPORATING PREDICTIVE MODEL WITHIN INTERACTIVE BUSINESS ANALYSIS PROCESS,\u201d filed on same date herewith, by Kenneth W. O'Flaherty.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates in general to database management systems performed by computers, and in particular, to the building of predictive models for a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that uses a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).","2. Description of Related Art","In a data warehouse environment, the function of interactive business analysis is supported by a variety of applications and tools, including RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management System) and OLAP (On-Line Analytic Processing) tools. Typically, such business analysis tools use metadata to represent business concepts, and to provide a mapping from the business concepts to data stored in the data warehouse. A business analyst can then use familiar business terms to request an analytic function, and the tool will convert the business terms to the appropriate Table\/Column names, and generate and then execute the appropriate SQL to perform the function. Thus, the analyst can request a report on \u201cSales\u201d for \u201cEastern Region,\u201d where \u201cSales\u201d is a \u201cMeasure\u201d and \u201cEastern Region\u201d is a \u201cSegment.\u201d In this example, Segments and Measures are types of metadata, wherein Measures are values or expressions that are useful in reviewing, analyzing or reporting on data elements represented by segments.","The Measures supported by current analytic tools are either simple aggregations (e.g., \u201cRevenues\u201d), or more complex derivations based on formulas (e.g., \u201cMargin\u201d=\u201cRevenues\u2014Costs,\u201d and \u201cPercent Margin\u201d=\u201cMargin\/Revenues*100\u201d). In each case, the definitions for the Measures is provided by a human, e.g., by a business analyst during a set-up process that occurs following installation but prior to execution of the tool. Usually, the definitions for the Measures comprise a manual metadata definition process.","A Measure might be predictive, e.g., rather than measure past performance or behavior, it might predict future performance or behavior, typically in the form of a propensity score. For example, it might predict the propensity of a Customer Segment to purchase a product or to terminate service. The formula for a predictive Measure might be provided by a human, based on prior experience or intuition.","A more rigorous approach would be to use a predictive modeling system, the output of which is typically a predictive model which may or may not be in some executable form. Typically, in order to use such a model as a predictive Measure in a business analysis tool, it would be necessary for a human to translate the predictive model formula into an appropriate form (e.g., as SQL statements) that can be processed by the business analysis tool.","Unfortunately, predictive modeling systems are technically complex, and require a high level of statistical and data mining skills to create successful models, including knowledge about the algorithms involved and how they operate. They also typically require expert knowledge of the data involved in the prediction, and programming skills in order to manipulate the data into a form that the predictive modeling system requires.","There is a need then to make data mining algorithms more accessible and more available to business people. There is a strong requirement for marketing campaign planners with modest technical skills (e.g., business analysts) to be able to build predictive models directly in support of their business tasks. Furthermore, once predictive models have been produced, they typically become less effective over time (\u201cmodel decay\u201d), since the behavior they model becomes outdated as time passes and conditions change. There is thus a further need for business analysts to be able to modify, update, or \u201ctune\u201d existing predictive models.","A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that dynamically builds predictive models. The system is used by business users who are unfamiliar with the art of data mining. A model-building mechanism in a data mining subsystem is presented with a training segment comprised of records with appropriate input attributes and an output attribute to be predicted; and the model-building mechanism builds a model in the form of a business measure that can subsequently be applied to make predictions against other like segments.","In the following description of the preferred embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown byway of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","In the context of this application, the following terminology is used:","Segment: A Segment is a grouping of data elements organized about one or more attributes. Segments may be subdivided into Sub-Segments based on Attributes or Filters, which may be categorical (such as \u201cType of Residence,\u201d \u201cMarital Status,\u201d or \u201cBrand\u201d), numeric (such as \u201cAge>65,\u201d or \u201cPrice>$25\u201d), etc. Sub-Segments themselves can be further subdivided into Sub-Segments.","Filter: A Filter defines one or more attribute constraints applied to a Segment or Sub-Segment, usually to create a Sub-Segment. For example, a Segment \u201cCalifornia Customers\u201d may be constrained to \u201cFemale California Customers\u201d by applying a Filter for gender.","Profile: A Profile is a collection of attributes relating to a Segment. For example, a Demographic Profile might include those attributes of a Customer Segment that contain demographic information, such as gender, zip code, marital status, household group, home ownership, vehicle ownership, etc. Pre-defined Profiles may be available, as is the ability to create ad hoc profiles from the available set of attributes for a Segment.","Measure: A Measure is a formula applied against a Segment or Sub-Segment. A Measure may involve simply aggregating values retrieved from a database, computing a formula, or executing a previously-built predictive model. Function: A Function is a control for splitting, merging, and branching. Application Template: An Application Template is a sequence of Segments, Filters, Measures and Functions linked together in a workflow, wherein arrows indicate the flow of data.","The present invention provides a mechanism for dynamically building predictive models in an interactive business analysis environment, where an analyst uses business terms to accomplish his or her tasks, and where the system translates the functions requested by the analyst into SQL statements and then executes these SQL statements against a relational database. The predictive model is generated in the form of a Measure, which characterizes an input Segment based on the Attributes presented with the Segment, and which can then be used or deployed against other Segments having similar Attributes. The present invention also exploits Application Templates to reuse expert knowledge gained from prior model-building experiences, making such knowledge available to lower-skilled business analysts such that they can successfully build predictive models. The present invention also exploits visual programming techniques for constructing and representing the steps in the Application Templates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108"]},"In the preferred embodiment, the CRM Client , CRM Server , RDBMS , and relational database  each comprise logic and\/or data tangibly embodied in and\/or accessible from a device, media, carrier, or signal, such as RAM, ROM, one or more of the data storage devices, and\/or one or more remote systems or devices communicating with the CRM system  via one or more data communications devices.","However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environment illustrated in  is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative environments may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The Segment Manager  supports user requests, such as defining Segments, applying Measures and Filters to Segments, profiling Segments, saving Segments, and displaying Segments, as well as merging Segments, removing duplicate entries from Segments, deleting Segments, etc. Users can choose from a set of pre-defined Segments or create ad hoc Segments.","Measure Manager","The Measure Manager  provides a common measurement engine for use by the other elements of the CRM Server . A Measure is a value or expression applied to a Segment.

The module  accesses or invokes the application programming interface (API) to the TeraMiner\u2122 product to invoke the analytic algorithm for rule induction. This analytic algorithm for rule induction is further described in the co-pending and commonly-assigned application Ser. No. 09\/410,530, filed on Oct. 1, 1999, by Todd M. Brye, entitled \u201cSQL-Based Analytic Algorithm for Rule Induction,\u201d attorney's docket number 8221, which application is incorporated by reference herein.","The analytic algorithm for rule induction provided by the TeraMiner\u2122 product builds a predictive model based on the Segment and related Attributes presented to it, and returns the model as the new Measure. The Measure (i.e., the model) can then be used against other Segments with matching Attribute definitions (using the \u201cApply Measures to Segment\u201d task of the \u201csegment\u201d function), for test purposes and later for deployment purposes.","The creation of the predictive model is illustrated in the workflow of , described further below, which represents an Application Template  that might be used in a customer retention campaign (i.e., for building a predictive model that will identify those customers that have a high likelihood for attrition). This workflow is a simplified subset of a standard data mining process, incorporating both modeling and evaluation phases, and some aspects of a data preparation phase. The initial business understanding and data understanding phases are assumed to have occurred prior to this workflow, and a final deployment phase would occur subsequent to this workflow (by applying the Measure to a Segment).","In order to produce the best results from the workflow illustrated below, it would be necessary for a skilled user to have previously built a predictive model for the class of problem at hand (in this example, Attrition Propensity scoring), and to have recorded the key knowledge gained from this exercise in the form of such a reusable Application Template , such that less skilled users can benefit from this knowledge.","The Application Template  records such knowledge as:\n\n","This knowledge is used as the starting point for the user, who adapts the Application Template  to the particular context of the business problem at hand. In addition to changing initial default values (e.g., the model accuracy requirement), this might include selecting a different type of customer segment as the input set, selecting a different set of input variables (Attributes and Measures), building new derived variables (Derived Measures), separating the input set into more than two subsets (e.g., to provide a hold-out validation set), and adding or deleting workflow steps.","Example Application Template","The following describes an example Application Template . Assume that a cellular phone company has been losing customers in California, due to increased competition in the state. In preparing for a retention campaign, the user develops an Attrition Propensity model that will predict which customers are most likely to terminate their service with the company. She accomplishes this by adapting a pre-built Application Template  that encapsulates the knowledge gained by a prior user in addressing the same class of problem in a similar industry. Thus, the types of customers and the data that is available about them is assumed to be similar.","The approach taken by the Application Template  is to create a Segment comprising 50% customers who recently terminated service and 50% loyal customers, and to use this data to build and then test a model to identify the characteristics that differentiate the two types of customers. Prior to separating the input Segment into a training Segment and a test Segment, a set of the appropriate input variables is generated for each record, using a Profile function that retrieves a set of Attribute values and an Apply Measures to Segment task that generates a set of Measures; the user may subset these and optionally derive some new Measures as inputs. The model is built using the training Segment, and its accuracy is tested using the test Segment. If accuracy is below a target threshold (e.g., 85%), the Application Template  repeats the variable selection functions to allow the user to make variations to improve the model.","Referring to , an example Application Template  is shown, wherein the Application Template  includes a workflow comprising a sequence of steps using icons. The sequence and data moves along the flow of the arrows linking the various icons. The logic of the Application Template  is described below in conjunction with FIG. :","Icon  represents a \u201cGet a Segment\u201d task for a Segment referred to as \u201cLost California Customers\u201d (Block ).","Icon  represents a \u201cGet a Segment\u201d task for a Segment referred to as \u201cRich California Customers,\u201d using a random sample of N, where n is the size of the \u201cLost California Customers\u201d Segment (Block ). The \u201cRich California Customers\u201d Segment is comprised of customers with a longevity of service above a certain threshold, e.g., 3 years.","Icon  represents the merging of the Segments, wherein a \u201cSegment Source\u201d ID is stored with each record, and the ID comprising \u201c1\u201d for \u201cLost California Customers,\u201d and \u201c2\u201d for \u201cRich California Customers\u201d (Block ).","Icon  represents a \u201cProfile a Segment\u201d task performed against the resulting Segment (Block ). Before running the task, the Application Template  prompts the user to optionally subset the list of Attributes to be returned in the Profile, to be later used as input variables for building the model (the initial default is \u201call,\u201d but this may be modified by the user). Thereafter, the profiling of the merged Segment returns a set of demographic, psychographic, behavioral and preference Attributes.","Icon  represents an \u201cApply Measures to Segment\u201d task performed against the Segment (Block ). The Application Template  first prompts the user to optionally subset or change the set of Measures to be applied against the Segment, and thereafter, the Application Template  computes the Measures for the merged Segment (to be later used as input variables for building the model, along with the previously selected Attributes).","Icon  represents a \u201cDefine a Derived Measure\u201d task performed against the Segment (Block ). The Application Template  prompts the user to define any derived Measures from any of the current set of Measures and Attributes. This provides an opportunity for the user of the Application Template to identify any additional input variables to be used in building the model.","Icon  represents the splitting of the Segment (Block ). The Application Template  prompts the user to specify a split value for the Segment, wherein the default is a 50:50 split. The Application Template  then creates a random split of the Segment, using the specified value, into a Test Segment  and a Training Segment , respectively.","Icon  represents a \u201cDefine a Derived Measure\u201d task being performed against the Training Segment  (Block ). This task constructs a new Measure known as \u201cAttrition Propensity\u201d by building a decision tree model for the Measure. The Application Template  builds the decision tree model by invoking a model-building algorithm (e.g., the analytic algorithm for rule induction) via the module  of the Object Manager  using the Training Segment . Specifically, the module  accesses or invokes the application programming interface (API) to the TeraMiner\u2122 product and the analytic algorithm for rule induction is described in the co-pending and commonly-assigned application Ser.

Brye, entitled \u201cSQL-Based Analytic Algorithm for Rule Induction,\u201d attorney's docket number 8221, which application is incorporated by reference herein.","The analytic algorithm for rule induction in the TeraMiner\u2122 product uses the RDBMS  to retrieve counts and order data within the database , and then extracts the information to determine the rules or splits in a rule induction tree. The rule induction tree comprises a predictive model (a formula in SQL) that predicts the likelihood for attrition. The target variable for the algorithm (i.e., the characteristic to be predicted) is identified as \u201cSegment Source,\u201d and all other current Segment Attributes and Measures are the input variables. The model that is built will thus use the input variables to predict Segment Source (i.e., whether \u201cLost California Customer\u201d or \u201cRich California Customer\u201d).","Icon  represents a \u201cGet a Segment\u201d task being performed against the Test Segment  (Block ).","Icon  represents an \u201cApply Measures to Segment\u201d task being performed against the Test Segment  (Block ). The Application Template  executes the newly built rule induction tree against the Test Segment  to compute the Measure \u201cAttrition Propensity\u201d for each record therein (\u201cAttrition Propensity\u201d is the name given to output of the model, which is a probability score of the likelihood of having a Segment Source of \u201c1\u201d).","Icon  represents a \u201cDefine a Derived Measure\u201d task being performed against the Test Segment  (Block ). This task builds a new Measure known as \u201cAttrition Accuracy\u201d by defining the percentage of test cases predicted correctly as a percentage of Test Segment , where \u201cAttrition Propensity\u201d(i.e., the predicted likelihood of attrition, in the form of a percentage score), when converted back to a \u201c1\u201d or a \u201c2,\u201d equals \u201cSegment Source.\u201d Note that conversion occurs by substituting a \u201c1\u201d for \u201cAttrition Propensity\u201d scores above 50%, and a \u201c2\u201d for scores below 50%. Also, recall that \u201c1\u201d =\u201cLost California Customers,\u201d and \u201c2\u201d =\u201cRich California Customers\u201d.","Icon  represents an \u201cApply Measures to Segment\u201d task being performed against the Test Segment  (Block ). The Application Template  applies the Measure \u201cAttrition Accuracy\u201d against the Test Segment  to analyze the results. This Measure calculates the percentage of test cases that were predicted correctly.","Icon  represents a \u201cconditional\u201d function being performed (Block ). The \u201cconditional\u201d function prompts the user for a percentage value related to the Measure \u201cAttrition Accuracy,\u201d wherein the default is 85%. A branch back to icon  occurs, if the conditional is false, i.e., the Measure \u201cAttrition Accuracy\u201d is below the specified value; otherwise, the sequence proceeds to icon  if the conditional is true, i.e., the Measure \u201cAttrition Accuracy\u201d is above the specified value.","At icon , the Measure \u201cAttrition Propensity\u201d (the predictive model) can now be saved (Block ) and subsequently applied or deployed against any Segment of customers with the same available input variables (Attributes and Measures), to predict the attrition likelihood of each customer in the Segment.","This concludes the description of the preferred embodiment of the invention. The following paragraphs describe some alternative embodiments for accomplishing the same invention.","In one alternative embodiment, any type of computer could be used to implement the present invention. In addition, any database management system, decision support system, on-line analytic processing system, or other computer program that performs similar functions could be used with the present invention.","In summary, the present invention discloses a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that dynamically builds predictive models.
