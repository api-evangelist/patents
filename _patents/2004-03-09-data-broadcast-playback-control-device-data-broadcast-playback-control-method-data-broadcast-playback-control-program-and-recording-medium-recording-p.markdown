title: Data broadcast playback control device, data broadcast playback control method data broadcast playback control program, and recording medium recording program thereon
abstract: During reception of data broadcast, the control information is created by a control information creator for storage into a first storage. During normal reproduction of the data content stored in the first storage, the data content of the data broadcast being reproduced and the control information are stored in a second storage. During special reproduction of the data content stored in the first storage or after the special reproduction is stopped, the control information stored in the second storage is compared with the control information read out from the first storage during the special reproduction or after the special reproduction is stopped. When the control information stored in the second storage and the control information read out from the first storage coincide with each other, the data broadcast continues to be reproduced using the data content stored in the second storage.

A data broadcast reproduction controller for recording and reproducing data broadcast has been developed (JP 2001-257989 A, for example).","The data broadcast reproduction controller has functions of receiving data broadcast and recording data content of the received data broadcast, and also reproducing the recorded data content of the data broadcast.","With such a data broadcast reproduction controller, the data broadcast can be special-reproduced, such as fast-forwarding or fast-rewinding. As a method for the special-reproduction of pictures, a method has been proposed, for example, in which only an I-picture is detected from a video stream for frame advance of still pictures.","In the special reproduction of data broadcast, however, the control information related to data broadcast is missing from a TS (Transport Stream) packet. For this reason, after the special reproduction of data broadcast, it is necessary to reboot the data broadcast in order to reacquire the data content thereof.","One possible approach for this is to control the reproduction of data broadcast, by utilizing the version information of data broadcast described in SIT (Selection Information Table) of a partial TS packet. The cycle of delivering SIT, however, is as long as about three seconds, so that it is insufficient to control the reproduction of the data broadcast after the special reproduction.","As stated above, in the conventional data broadcast reproduction controller, the data broadcast is rebooted for each special reproduction, so that after special reproduction, the data broadcast is reproduced again from its beginning. Therefore, in order for a user to view a continuation of the data broadcast that he or she has been viewing before the special reproduction, he or she needs to perform again, at the end of the special reproduction, operation procedures that have been done before the special reproduction. The user cannot view the data broadcast during the special reproduction of the data broadcast.","It is also necessary to reacquire the data content of data broadcast when the user switches a receiving channel to another one, and then returns the channel to the original one while receiving a particular channel of the data broadcast. Therefore, for the user to view a continuation of the data broadcast that he or she has been viewing before switching a channel, the user is required to perform again the operation procedures done before the switching of the channel.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a data broadcast reproduction controller, a method for controlling the reproduction of data broadcast, a data broadcast reproduction control program, and a recording medium recording the same enabling the data broadcast that has been viewed during first reproduction to be continuously viewed during second reproduction.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a data broadcast reproduction controller, a method for controlling the reproduction of data broadcast, a data broadcast reproduction control program, and a recording medium recording the same enabling the data broadcast that has been viewed during first reception to be continuously viewed during second reception.","A data broadcast reproduction controller according to one aspect of the present invention for controlling the reproduction of data broadcast including one or more data contents, comprises: a receiver that receives data content of data broadcast and related information attached to the data broadcast; a first storage that stores the data content of the data broadcast received by the receiver; a reproducer that reproduces the data content of the data broadcast stored in the first storage; a control information creator that creates control information for identifying the data content of the data broadcast based on given information included in the data content of the data broadcast received by the receiver or reproduced by the reproducer and\/or the related information; a second storage that stores, during first reproduction by the reproducer, the data content of the data broadcast acquired from the first storage and control information corresponding to the data content; a determiner that determines, during a second reproduction by the reproducer, whether or not the control information stored in the second storage and the control information corresponding to the data content of the data broadcast to be reproduced coincide with each other; and a controller that controls the reproducer to reproduce the data broadcast, using the data content stored in the second storage, when the determiner determines that the control information stored in the second storage and the control information corresponding to the data content of the data broadcast to be reproduced coincide with each other.","In the data broadcast reproduction controller according to the present invention, the data content of data broadcast and the related information attached to the data broadcast are received, and the data content of the received data broadcast is stored in the first storage.

The control information uniquely identifies each of one or more data contents included in the data broadcast that is being received by the data broadcast reproduction controller .","This control information is created using SI (Service Information) or PSI (Program Specific Information), i.e., the program information created by the information synthesizer . More specifically, it is created using in part or all of a value of Module ID (module identifier) or Module Version of DII (Download Info Indication Message); time information of TOT (Time Offset Table); time information created by the clock unit ; version information of PMT (Program Map Table); Service ID (service identifier); Network ID (network identifier); Transport stream ID, and the like.","Note that DII is transmission control information indicating a module structure, including Module ID, Module Version, and the like. TOT is a type of SI, indicating information on the current time and time difference when summer time is in effect. PMT is a type of PSI, indicating PID (Packet Identifier), stream type identifier and the like of components (pictures, sounds, and data) constituting a production channel. The service ID is a unique number to distinguish a production channel. The Network ID is a unique number to distinguish a network. The Transport stream ID is a unique number to distinguish a transport stream.","Alternatively, the control information may be created using in part or all of the date\/time described in the data script and timer information indicating the current time; URI (Uniform Resource Indicator); content information to which reference is made by the data broadcast, such as still pictures, motion pictures, sounds, PNG (Portable Network Graphics), MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics), and 8-unit code, constituting the screen; event information from a broadcast station notifying updates of the data broadcast being reproduced, and the like.","Note that URI indicates addressing to an object on the Internet.

In other words, the data content and the control information stored in the second storage  vary depending on the data broadcast being reproduced.","During special reproduction of the data content stored in the first storage  or after the special reproduction, the control information stored in the second storage  is compared with the control information read out from the first storage  during the special reproduction or after the special reproduction is stopped.
