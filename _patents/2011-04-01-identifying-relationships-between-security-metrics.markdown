title: Identifying relationships between security metrics
abstract: A security metrics system receives security information data for a network system of computers and metric definitions from metric sources. Each metric definition defines a heuristic for calculating a score for the network system from one or more security signal values at a time in the plurality of times, wherein the score quantifies a security metric for the network system. The system calculates each metric definition for a plurality of times and selecting metric definitions that are related to the performance of and are indicative of one or more other metric definitions as candidates to be key performance indicators.

A system of assets can be connected over one or more networks. For example, a home might have five assets, each of which are networked to each other and connected to the outside world through the Internet. As another example, a business might have three physically separate offices, each of which has many assets. The assets within each office and the assets across the offices can be connected over a network.","The security of a system of assets is derived from the risk that threats could attack different assets in the system. Each asset in the system of assets can be at risk from multiple threats at any given time. Each threat corresponds to a potential attack on the asset by a particular virus, malware, or other unauthorized entity. An attack occurs when the unauthorized entity exploits a known vulnerability of the asset in an attempt to access or control the asset. Some threats have known remediations that, if put in place for an asset, eliminate or reduce the risk that the threat will affect the asset. Some threats do not have known remediations.","The large number of threats and possible ways to remediate the threats can make it difficult for a system administrator to have a comprehensive view of the security on a given system. System administrators can use one or more of a large number of possible security metrics to quantify overall risk present in a system. However, security monitoring products often restrict which security metrics a security administrator can view. This can make it difficult for security administrators to develop a comprehensive view of system security that is tailored to the details of and requirements for their systems. Even if system administrators could use any security metric they wanted to when evaluating the security of their systems, it is difficult for system administrators to know which security metrics will provide the best overall picture of the security of their system.","In general, one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving security information data from each of a plurality of data sources for a network system of computers, the security information data from each data source comprising values of one or more security signals for the network system at each of a plurality of times in a period of time; receiving a plurality of metric definitions from each of a plurality of metric sources, wherein each metric definition defines a heuristic for calculating a score for the network system from one or more security signal values at a time in the plurality of times, wherein the score quantifies a security metric for the network system; calculating, for each metric definition, a respective score for the system for each time in the plurality of times, the calculating comprising, for each time, applying the metric definition to the security signal values at the time to calculate the respective score for the network system; comparing the scores for each metric over the period of time to identify one or more relationships between the plurality of metric definitions; and selecting metric definitions from the plurality of metric definitions according to the one or more relationships between the plurality of metric definitions, wherein the selected metric definitions are candidates to be key performance indicators for the network system, and wherein each key performance indicator is a metric definition that is related to the performance of and is indicative of one or more other metric definitions. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.","Another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in methods that include the actions of receiving security information data from each of a plurality of data sources for a network system of computers, the security information data from each data source comprising values of one or more security signals for the network system at each of a plurality of times in a period of time; receiving a plurality of metric definitions from each of a plurality of metric sources, wherein each metric definition defines a heuristic for calculating a score for the network system from one or more security signal values at a time in the plurality of times, wherein the score quantifies a security metric for the network system; calculating, for each metric definition, a respective score for the system for each time in the plurality of times, the calculating comprising, for each time, applying the metric definition to the security signal values at the time to calculate the respective score for the network system; comparing the scores for the metrics over the period of time to identify one or more relationships between the plurality of metric definitions; presenting a graphical representation of one or more of the identified relationships to a user. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs, configured to perform the actions of the methods, encoded on computer storage devices.","Particular embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. Users can identify a few key performance indicators that indicate the overall security of their system, rather than having to analyze numerous system security metrics. Key performance indicators are metrics that are identified as being important to represent the state of the environment, and help identify important data within a sea of unimportant metrics. Key performance indicators that correlate well with many system security metrics can be used. This reduces the number of security metrics a user has to follow and interpret. Key performance indicators can be selected from security metrics that are customized to the system itself, or user preferences, rather than from off-the-shelf security metrics. Users can visualize and better understand relationships between different security metrics, which facilitates interpretation of the data.","The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","100","106"]},"Each asset  can be vulnerable to one or more threats, e.g., possible attacks. These threats include, for example, viruses, malware, and other unauthorized attacks. Each asset can be protected by a variety of countermeasures including passive countermeasures and active countermeasures.","The assets are monitored by agent-based sensors  and network-based sensors . For example, agent-based sensor is installed on asset , agent-based sensor is installed on asset , and agent-based sensor is installed on asset . The agent-based sensors  run various analyses on their respective assets , for example, to identify vulnerabilities on the assets  or to identify viruses or other malware executing on the assets . The agent-based sensors  can also generate other data about the assets or the operation of the assets, for example, a number of suspicious programs operating on a user computer asset at a given time, a number of spam e-mails an e-mail server asset detects in a given day, etc. Agent based sensors can also detect additional features, states and software, such as improper configuration, missing patches, malware, asset information (OS, network connectivity), user information, weak passwords, improper file or directory permissions, etc. Example agent-based sensors include antivirus software, host intrusion prevention software, configuration management software that precludes changing of certain files, file integrity monitors, network access control software that controls access to a network, etc. These features can be implemented in separate software components or bundled into several (or even one) software component.","The network-based sensors  are hardware devices and\/or software in a data communication path between assets  protected by the sensor and the network resources that the asset is attempting to access. For example, sensor is connected to assets and , and sensor is connected to assets , , and . While  illustrates a single network-based sensor  in a communication path with each asset, other configurations are possible. For example, multiple network-based sensors  can be connected to the same asset , and some assets  may not be connected to any network-based sensors .","An example network-based sensor includes one or more processors, a memory subsystem, and an input\/output subsystem. The one or more processors are programmed according to instructions stored in the memory subsystem, and monitor the network traffic passing through the input\/output subsystem. The one or more processors are programmed to take one or more protective actions on their own, or to query a sensor control system (not shown) and take further actions as instructed by the metric system . Example network based sensors include network access control systems, firewalls, routers, switches, bridges, hubs, web proxies, application proxies, gateways, mail filters, virtual private networks, intrusion prevention systems and intrusion detection systems, etc.","When an asset  tries to send information through the network  or receive information over the network  through a network-based sensor , the sensor analyzes information about the asset  and the information being sent or received and generates data about the information. The network-based sensor also determines whether to allow the communication.","The overall security of the asset system  depends on the overall security of the individual assets in the system. However, quantitatively measuring the security of an asset system can be difficult. Different security metrics will often give different pictures of a system's security. To help system administrators (and other users) gain a manageable sense of their system's security, the metric system  evaluates relationships between various security metrics and identifies one or more key performance indicators from the metric definitions. Each key performance indicator is a metric definition that represents the security of the network system as a whole, e.g., represents a metric definition that is related to the performance of other metrics in a way that the key performance indicator is indicative of the one or more other metrics. The metric system  also allows users to visualize relationships, e.g., correlations, between different security metrics. This can help users develop an intuitive understanding of relationships between security metrics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102","102","202","204","202","206","204","208","202","204","202","204"]},"\u00a72.1.1 Security Information Data","The security information data  is data describing one or more aspects of assets in the system. The security information data  can be data specific to individual assets, groups of assets, or the system of assets as a whole. For example, the security information data  can be data describing the operation of the assets, e.g., details on the number of viruses found on assets or the number of spam e-mails received by assets. The security information data  can also be data describing vulnerabilities detected on assets in the system, or data describing countermeasures protecting assets in the system. The security information data  can also be external data describing aspects of the assets in the system that are external to the system itself, for example, how much insurance there is for particular assets in the system.","The security information data  is received from one or more security information data sources . In some implementations, the security information data sources  are one or more data aggregators. A data aggregator is one or more servers that receive security information data, aggregate the data, and format the data in a format useable by the metric system . The data aggregators can receive security information data from the assets themselves or from the sensors monitoring the assets. Example data aggregators include Mcafee ePolicy Orchestrator\u00ae, available from McAfee of Santa Clara, Calif., and Active Directory\u00ae, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Alternatively, the security information data source(s)  are the assets and\/or sensors themselves.","The security information data sources  can be internal security information data sources, external security information data sources, or both internal and external security information data sources. Internal security information data sources are sources provided by a same provider as the provider of the metric system . For example, if the metric system is a product sold by Company A, then any security information data sources also produced by Company A would be internal security information data sources. External security information data sources are sources provided by a different provider than the provider of the metric system . For example, if the metric system is a product sold by Company A, then any security information data sources not produced by Company A would be external security information data sources.","In some implementations, the system receives data from external data sources using different protocols than the protocols the system uses to receive data from internal data sources. For example, the system can automatically receive data pushed from internal data sources, whenever the internal data sources want to send the data, and can pull data from external data sources only when the monitoring system  needs additional data.","In some implementations, before the system accepts security information data received from a security information data source , the system authenticates the security information data source , for example using conventional authorization techniques, to confirm that the security information data source  is authorized to send data to the metric system .","\u00a72.1.2 Security Metric Definition Data","The metric definition data  is received from one or more metric definition sources . The metric definition data  defines one or more security metrics by use of metric definitions. Each security metric has a value that is a measurement, or a value derived from multiple measurements, that quantifies the security of the system. The security metrics are generally designed to measure the overall security provided within the system, as opposed to the security provided by any particular sensor or countermeasure active on the network. The security metrics are used to measure the overall security of the system, and can be either pre-defined, customized, or a combination of both. Example metric definitions are the number of vulnerabilities detected on a system, the number of remediations applied to assets in the system, the number of times assets in the system have been hacked, the number of times spam e-mails have been received by assets in the system, and combinations of these, for example, the number of vulnerabilities detected on a system minus the number of remediations applied to assets in the system.","The security metrics, and, in turn, their corresponding metric definitions, can be hierarchical. A security metric, as defined by its corresponding definition, can take into account security information data to generate a metric score or value (e.g., the percentage of detected spam emails for every 1,000 e-mails). Likewise, a security metric can also take into account scores for other security metrics to generate a metric score or value (e.g., an e-mail security health metric can take into account security metrics related to spam, phishing, and infected e-mail attachments).","Each security metric is a measurement that describes the state of some facet of security. A security metric, taken independently and in the absence of a hierarchal relation to other security metrics, often does not convey an overall security state. Accordingly, combining security metrics (either to generate a new combined metric value, or to visualize in combination) often convey more readily the actual security posture of an overall system. By way of another example, when phishing email levels grow past a certain threshold, then host intrusion detections also go up, firewall blocking rate increases, as do attacks on financial web services.","As will be discussed in more detail below, the analysis of various metrics results in the identification of a positive or negative correlation of the certain metrics. While correlation does not necessarily equate to causation, presentation of the metrics that are correlated can help security administrators understand the overall behavior of the security system, and help guide administers when determining where to allocate investigative and remedial resources.","The metric definitions include metadata about a metric it defines and instructions that cause a processing device to calculate a metric value (score) that measures the metric. The metric definition can be specified in various ways. For example, in some implementations, the metric definitions are executable program code that access the security information data  using an Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the metric system . The API specifies commands that the metric definition programs can invoke. In some implementations, different API commands are accessible to metric definitions received from different metric data sources. For example, the metric system  can assign a level of trust to each of the metric data sources , and only allow metric definitions from metric data sources  having a level of trust above a threshold to access particular API commands.","In other implementations, the metric definitions are specified in a script that can be executed by the metric system . In some implementations, the script is specified by a user. In other implementations, a user enters desired values and operations into a web browser, which automatically generates the script based on the user input.","In still other implementations, the metric definitions are defined using XML or an XML-like language with pre-defined operands and data sources. In some implementations, the metric definitions are specified using XML transforms.","The scripts, schemas, and other constructs for defining metric definitions take into account the security information data  available. For example, the security information data  can be defined to conform to a schema or standard (e.g., certain fields and values for representing risks, attacks, exploits, and their corresponding types), and, using the common scheme or standard, users can generate the corresponding metric definitions.","In some implementations, the system authenticates the metric definition sources  before receiving metric definitions from the metric definition sources, for example, much as the system authenticates security information data sources  before receiving security information data .","In some implementations, the system uses combinations of conventional validation and authentication and access control techniques to validate and verify metric definitions before using them. This helps protect the metric system  from malicious instructions that could be embedded in metric definitions.","As described above, the metric definitions, and corresponding metric dependencies according to a metric hierarchy, can be defined by users. Many users will often be interested in similar metrics. Accordingly, in some implementations, a metric definition source can be a security service provider that provides pre-defined metric definitions. By using pre-defined metric definitions, the system  is initially aware of which metrics correlated with other metrics based on previously performed observation (e.g., based on analysis by the security provider) or prior knowledge of the definition. In some implementations, the security provider provides definitions as content and releases the metric definitions to customers by a metric stream, e.g., a service through which a customer periodically receives predefined definitions and updates to the predefined definitions periodically.","In some implementations, the system  can report key performance indicators to the metric definition data source, e.g., a security provider. The security provider can, for example, aggregate the key performance indicator across industries and verticals, and provide the aggregated data to entity customers that use the system . Each entity can the compare its system performance against industry performance. The industry data collected from customers is anonymized to insure that no identifying information is provided with the data that can be tracked back to an individual customer.","The metric system  can help users, such as system administrators, understand the security of their system, identify the best security metrics for their system, and understand relationships between the security metrics in various ways. For example, the metric system  can identify candidate key performance indicators or can present visual representations of relationships between security metrics.","\u00a73.1 Example Process for Selecting Candidate Key Performance Indicators",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","102"]},"The process  receives security information data (), for example, as described above with reference to . The process  receives metric definitions (), for example, as described above with reference to .","The process calculates, for each metric definition, scores for the system over a period of time (). The process calculates the score for a metric definition at a given time by applying the metric definition to security signals in the security information data from the given time. For example, if the metric definition is represented by executable code, the process executes the code. If the metric definition is represented by a script, the process executes the script. If the metric definition is represented using an XML file, the process interprets the XML file.","The process compares the scores for each metric over the period of time to identify one or more relationships between the metric definitions (). In some implementations, the relationships between the metric definitions are determined by determining correlations between two or more security metrics. The correlations can be positive or negative correlations. In other implementations, other functions can be used to determine the relationships between security metrics corresponding to the metric definitions over time. For example, user-specified functions, received for example, through a user interface, can be used.","In some implementations, the system  performs phase-aware correlations in which metrics are time shifted and correlation measurements are calculated for each time shift. The phase-aware correlation can detect metrics that appear uncorrelated with respect to a same time reference, but are, in fact, correlated when one of the metrics is time shifted with respect to the other.","The system  can also take into account metric dependencies to detect false-positive correlations. For example, two metrics may be combined to define a combined metric that is explicitly dependent on the two metrics, i.e., the combined metric is explicitly defined by a function of the two metrics. The system  accounts for the metric dependencies so that false positive and false negatives are detected or avoided (e.g., a combined metric is not compared to its dependent metrics, for example). In other words, a metric definition that may be a key performance indicator is positively or negatively correlated to one or more other metric definitions, but is not explicitly dependent on the one or more other metric definitions with which it is positively or negatively correlated.","A variety of correlation techniques and correlations measurements can be used.","The process selects metric definitions that are candidates to be key performance indicators (). A key performance indicator is a metric definition that represents the security of the network system as a whole, or are indicative of representing an important state of an environment. Typically a key performance indicator is a metric (or set of metrics) that exhibit a strong positive or negative correlation. For example, the process  can identify metric definitions that are strongly correlated with many other metric definitions. The process  can also identify metric definitions that are used by other companies in the same industry as the company whose asset system is being monitored, or metric definitions that are strongly related to metric definitions that are used by other companies in the same industry.","In some implementations, the process  receives data from a user that specifies particular security metrics that are of interest to the user. The process  then identifies candidate key performance indicators by identifying security metrics that are strongly related to the security metrics specified by the user. For example, the process  can identify security metrics that are strongly correlated with the security metrics specified by the user, or that are strongly correlated but tend to change before the security metrics specified by the user. For example, if the user specifies security metric A, and security metric B always changes a day before security metric A changes, the process could identify security metric B as a candidate key performance indicator.","To illustrate a more concrete example, assume attacks on financial web services are an important security metric for a particular entity. When phishing e-mail levels grow past a certain threshold, then host intrusion detections also go up, firewall blocking rate increases, as do attacks on financial web services. Accordingly, the key performance indictors would be the metrics for phishing e-mail levels, and possibly host intrusion detection and firewall blocking rates.","In some implementations, after the process  selects metric definitions that are candidates to be key performance indicators, the system presents the candidate key performance indicators to a user. For example, the process can present a name of each candidate key performance indicator along with values of the candidate key performance indicator over time. In some implementations, the process presents a graphical representation of the values of the candidate key performance indicators over time. The system can optionally present graphical representations of the values of other security metrics, for example, other security metrics correlated with the key performance indicator, alongside the graphical representation of the value of the key performance indicator over time.","After the user is presented with the candidate key performance indicators, the process  can receive user input selecting one or more of the selected metric definitions as the key performance indicators for the asset system. Alternatively, or in addition, the process  can receive user input selecting two or more of the candidate key performance indicators and requesting that a definition of a security metric resulting from a combination of the candidate key performance indicators be used as a key performance indicator.","Returning to the phishing e-mail example, a security administration would see that the phishing e-mail levels, host intrusion detections, and firewall blocking rates are candidate key performance indicators. The administrator examines the metrics and underlying security information data in more detail, and determines that the key performance indicator is indeed the phasing e-mail level metric. He or she then selects this metric as a key performance indictor for finance services attacks.","The metric system  can continue to monitor the specified key performance indicators and present their values to the user when requested by the user. In some implementations, the user specifies particular thresholds for the different key performance indicators, and the metric system  issues alerts to the user if the value of a key performance indicator rises above, or falls below, the specified threshold for the key performance indicator.","\u00a73.2 Example Process for Identifying and Presenting Relationships Between Security Metrics to Users",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","102","400","300"]},"The process receives security information data and metric definitions (), for example, as described above with reference to . The process calculates, for each metric definition, scores for the metric definition over a period of time (), for example, as described above with reference to . The process compares the scores for the metric definitions over the period of time to identify one or more relationships between the metric definitions (), for example, as described above with reference to . In some implementations, the system compares all of the metric definitions to each other in order to identify the one or more relationships. In other implementations, the system compares only metric definitions specified by a user. For example, the system could have twenty metric definitions, but if a user specified that he or she was only interested in the relationships between three particular metric definitions, the system would only compare the three metric definitions.","The process presents one or more of the identified relationships to a user (). For example, if the system has identified a relationship between two security metrics, the system can present graphical representations of the values of the security metrics over time, and optionally include details regarding the relationship. An example detail of a relationship between two security metrics is a r-squared value for the correlation between two security metrics. Example graphical presentations are described in more detail below in Section 4.0.","Once the metric system  generates relationships between security metrics and identifies candidate key performance indicators, the metric system  can present the results of its analysis through various graphical user interfaces.","\u00a74.1 Example Presentations of Candidate Key Performance Indicators",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["500","502","504"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["550","552","550"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["550","552","550"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 5C","b":["560","562","562","562"],"i":["a ","b ","c"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 5D","FIG. 5D"],"b":["570","572","572","102"],"i":["a ","b"]},"\u00a74.2 Example Presentations of Relationships Between Security Metrics",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","602","604"]},"In some implementations, the presentation is a threat timeline presentation that illustrates how long the threat has been known, how long the remediation has been available, and how assets have had particular classifications. For example, if a threat was discovered at day zero, a patch was available at day five, an asset was categorized as patch urgently at day ten, remediations were applied to the asset and the asset was downgraded to patch later at day fifteen, the timeline could indicate each of those points in time. In some implementations, the timeline aggregates data for multiple assets, for example, to give system administrators an overview of how long it takes to fix known threats to the system.","Embodiments of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.

Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.","Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover, the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all embodiments, and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.","Particular embodiments of the subject matter have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. For example, the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. As one example, the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In certain implementations, multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
