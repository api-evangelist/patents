title: Method and apparatus for developing socially suitable applications and devices
abstract: An approach is presented for making the use of a mobile device more socially suitable. Remote control application programming interfaces and installation packages are specified to developers for designing applications that can be controlled via a main device (e.g., a mobile phone) and one or more accessory devices (e.g., a watch). Specifically, each application is required to have two installable componentsâ€”one that resides on the main device and one that is automatically installed on an associated remote accessory device. By enabling the seamless installation of these two components, a new paradigm or ecosystem for how applications are to be created and installed is introduced. In this new paradigm, application developers will not only develop the applications, but they will also design and define a way to make their applications remotely controllable and reachable from an accessory device, thus making the associated mobile devices running such applications more socially suitable.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service providers and device manufacturers (e.g., wireless, cellular, etc.) are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services such as mobile communication services (e.g., email, short message service (SMS), etc.), real-time applications (e.g., sports, stocks, weather, etc.), social networking features (e.g., FACEBOOK, TWITTER, etc.), and the like. Unfortunately, the increasing popularity of such compelling network services can also increase a mobile device (e.g., mobile phone) user's attachment to his or her mobile device, which then often leads to various forms of social disruption. Other companies have previously attempted to address this problem by pairing a mobile phone with a watch that was able to remotely control the mobile phone. However, in most cases, the watch was designed only for certain pre-programmed actions and in the cases where it was possible to create additional pre-programmed actions, there was no tight integration between the applications on the mobile phone and the options on the watch.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for making the use of a mobile device more socially suitable.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises causing, at least in part, a specification of one or more programming interfaces for enabling control of one or more applications via a main device and one or more accessory devices.

The apparatus is also caused to, at least in part, generate one or more installation packages for the one or more applications for installation at the main device and the one or more accessory devices.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carries one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to cause, at least in part, a specification of one or more programming interfaces for enabling control of one or more applications via a main device and one or more accessory devices. The apparatus also causes, at least in part, a generation of one or more installation packages for the one or more applications for installation at the main device and the one or more accessory devices.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for causing, at least in part, a specification of one or more programming interfaces for enabling control of one or more applications via a main device and one or more accessory devices.

The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for making the use of a mobile device more socially suitable are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention.

In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability of making the use of a mobile device more socially suitable. In one embodiment, the system  specifies to developers one or more remote application programming interfaces (APIs) for enabling control of one or more applications via a main device and one or more accessory devices. In addition, the system  causes a generation of one or more installation packages for the one or more applications for installation at the main device and the one or more accessory devices. In one example, both the APIs and the one or more installation packages may be contained in a software development kit (SDK). The specification of the one or more APIs and the generation of the one or more installation packages enables developers to design applications that enable a mobile device user to control the one or more applications via a main device (e.g., a mobile phone) and one or more accessory devices (e.g., a watch). Essentially, by exposing the specific APIs and installation packages to developers, the system  introduces and promotes a new paradigm or ecosystem for how applications are to be created and installed. In this new paradigm, application developers will not only develop the applications, but they will also design and define a way to make applications controlled remotely from one or more accessory devices thereby reducing the amount of time it takes a mobile device user to answer an incoming call or the amount of time a mobile device user stares at his or her mobile device. In each case, the system  enables mobile devices running such applications to be more socially suitable.","In addition to making a mobile device more socially suitable, the system  can also improve the usability of a mobile device. For example, while running or biking, it is often difficult for a runner or biker to use his or her mobile device to control the mobile device's integrated music player because the mobile device is often hard to reach during physical activity. Again, by exposing remote control APIs and installation packages to developers to design applications that enable a mobile device user to control the one or more applications via a main device and one or more accessory devices, the system  can also improve the usability of many mobiles devices.","As shown in , the system  comprises one or more developer terminals -(also collectively referred to as developer terminals ) having connectivity to an application platform  via a communication network . The application platform  may exist in whole or in part within a service platform  (e.g., an application store), or independently. The one or more developer terminals  may also have connectivity to the service platform  via the communication network . In one embodiment, the service platform  contains one or more remote application programming interfaces (APIs) -(also collectively referred to as APIs ), which are specified by the application platform  for enabling control of one or more applications -(also collectively referred to as applications ) on one or more main devices -(e.g., a mobile phone) (also collectively referred to as main devices ) and one or more accessory devices -(e.g., a watch or another similar accessory that is small in size) (also collectively referred to as accessory devices ).","In one embodiment, the application platform  also causes, at least in part, the generation of one or more software installation packages (not shown for illustrative purposes) which also may be contained within the service platform . For example, the application platform  causes, at least in part, the generation of the one or more software installation packages for one or more main devices  based, at least in part, on a main device  operating system and causes, at least in part, the generation of one or more software installation packages for one or more accessory devices  based, at least in part, on an accessory device  operating system. In one embodiment, the application platform  determines to package the one or more installation packages for the one or more main devices , the one or more installation packages for the one or more accessory devices , or a combination thereof into a combined installation package, wherein an installation of the combined package causes, at least in part, an initiation of respective installations of the one or more installation packages at the main devices , the accessory devices , or a combination thereof. For example, the application platform  may determine to combine one or more installation packages into a combined installation package based on a particular request from one or more developer terminals , the type of network connection available between the one or more developer terminals  and the application platform , the size of the one or more installation packages, etc.","In one embodiment, the application platform  determines a request from one or more developer terminals  for APIs  and one or more software packages. The application platform  then specifies the APIs  and the one or more software packages to enable the design of one or more applications  for installation at one or more main devices  and one or more accessory devices . In one example, the application platform  determines that the applications  are located within the service platform  prior to installation at the main devices  and the accessory devices . In another example, the application platform  may specify that the developer terminals  cause the applications  to be directly installed at the main devices  and the accessory devices  via the communication network .","In one embodiment, when an end-user downloads one or more applications  from the service platform , the applications  already contain two installable components\u2014one that will reside on one or more main devices  and one that will be automatically installed on one or more associated accessory devices . As previously discussed, the system  introduces a new paradigm for how applications such as applications  are created and installed. In this new paradigm, all application developers using one or more developer terminals , the application platform , APIs , and one or more software installation packages will not only develop applications , but the applications  will be remotely controllable and reachable from one or more main devices  via one or more associated accessory devices . As a result, the one or more accessory devices  can enable the remote control of one or more applications  on both the one or more accessory devices  and the one or more associated main devices .","In one embodiment, one or more main devices  and one or more associated accessory devices  have different form factors. For example, a main device  may have a form factor of a mobile phone or a mobile tablet and an associated accessory device  may have a form factor of a watch or a writing instrument. In one embodiment, it is also contemplated that one or more accessory devices  may also have connectivity to the service platform  via the communication network .","In one embodiment, by specifying the APIs , the application platform  causes, at least in part, a rendering of at least one user interface at one or more accessory devices , wherein at least one user interface includes one or more user interface elements for enabling the control of one or more applications . For example, a simple menu button can allow an end-user to move from one application  to another. In the event a notification from one or more applications  arrives at an accessory device , the application  will show-up on the at least one user interface automatically in order to allow the end-user to respond to the notification immediately. In another example, when an incoming call arrives, the end-user can immediately see the caller's name and either select the \u201csilent\u201d or \u201cloudspeaker\u201d controls on the accessory device  rather than having to reach for the main device  in a handbag or pocket. Also, when walking around, the end-user can see one or more applications  (e.g., a map) on one or more accessory devices  to know where to go without having to continually look at one or more main devices .","In one embodiment, the at least one user interface, the one or more user interface elements, or a combination thereof operate as one or more alternative controls, one or more additional controls, or a combination thereof to at least one other user interface, one or more other user interface elements, or a combination thereof rendered at one or more main devices . For example, the interface elements of one or more accessory devices  can be used as a remote interface to one or more associated main devices  for previewing various notifications (e.g., emails, SMS, incoming caller details, tasks, etc.) and controlling simple actions associated with the main devices  (e.g., selecting silence mode, selecting the next song or page, etc.). In one instance, one or more applications  may control the ringer function on one or more main devices  so that if an end-user is in a social setting and the main device  rings, the end-user can use one or more associated accessory devices  to answer the call or silence the main device  thereby reducing the delay in silencing the main device  and, therefore, making the main device  less socially disruptive. It is also contemplated, that at least one or more accessory devices  may also control one or more applications  installed on more than one main device .","In one embodiment, the application platform 's specification of the APIs  to one or more developer terminals  determines a basic layout or user interface (UI) for at least one accessory device . In one embodiment, multiple layouts could be supported based on at least one accessory device , but the layouts must all extend from a minimal layout so that the most wanted features work with all accessory devices . The application platform 's specification of the APIs  to one or more developer terminals  also determines that the one or more accessory devices  will have a ticker feature to allow the presentation of more characters of text to an end-user than would otherwise fit within the width of the UI of the one or more accessory devices . In addition, the application platform 's specification of the APIs  causes an application developer to determine whether to allow one or more notification triggers to be set per one or more applications  or some other variation. Moreover, the application platform 's specification of the APIs  also causes a developer to determine which actions for which notifications can be set using the one or more user interface controls on the one or more accessory devices . Furthermore, the application platform 's specification of the APIs  also determines that the following end-user options will be made available for the one or more accessory devices : (1) activate\/deactivate remote features; (2) activate\/deactivate specific notifications; (3) appear\/hide in remote menu; and (4) preview snapshots to enable an end-user to easily decide if a notification must be activated or not for a notification. In summary, the application platform  specifies the APIs  to developers to determine that, at a minimum, the one or more applications  must contain notifications to enable various previews and basic actions; a remote access layout for the one or more accessory devices , and timeouts that make the notifications disappear automatically. In addition, the application platform 's specification of the APIs  to developers determines that an end-user has the ability to view and turn on\/off notifications (both on a per application basis and globally); that one or more applications  can be added to a remote menu so that the applications  can be determined on-demand; and that the one or more user interface elements for enabling control of the one or more applications  can be used to switch to a menu and\/or select one or more applications  (e.g., cycling through the one or more applications ).","In one embodiment, the service platform  (e.g., an application store) supports both a presentation and a potential distribution to an end-user of one or more applications . As previously discussed, it is also contemplated that the service platform  can specify to one or more developer terminals  the required APIs  and the one or more installation packages (e.g., through an \u201cApp Wizard\u201d) to design one or more applications . In one embodiment, the application platform  can specify the APIs  so that one or more applications  contain metadata. The application platform  can later process and\/or facilitate a processing of the metadata associated with the one or more applications  to enable a presentation of the one or more applications  to the end-user by function, developer, purchase price, development date, data usage, user satisfaction rating, etc., as well as compatibility with one or more main devices  and\/or one or more accessory devices .","By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network, a wireless network, a telephony network, or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The at least one developer terminal  and at least one main device  are any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that one or more main devices  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.) and\/or at least one accessory device .","By way of example, the at least one developer terminal , the application platform , the one or more main devices , the one or more accessory devices , and the service platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","103","107"]},"In this embodiment, the application platform  includes a control module , a communication module , a data module , and an update module . The control module  oversees tasks, including tasks performed by the communication module , the data module , and the update module . The communication module  is used for communication between one or more developer terminals , the application platform , the service platform , and one or more main devices . As previously discussed, in one embodiment, the communication module  is also used for communication between one or more accessory devices  and the service platform . The communication module  may be further used to cause the loading of one or more APIs  (e.g., a Notification Service API) and one or more installation packages into the data module . In one embodiment, the control module  causes, at least in part, the loading of one or more software components into the data module  prior to receiving a request from one or more developer terminals . In another example, the control module  causes, at least in part, the generation of one or more software components (e.g., from the service platform ) in real-time upon receiving a request from one or more developer terminals . The data module  manages the organization and storage of the one or more APIs  and the one or more installation packages. The update module  may be used to determine updates to the one or more APIs , the one or more installation packages, or a combination thereof.","In one embodiment, the control module  causes, at least in part, the generation of the one or more installation packages for a main device  based, at least in part, on a main device  operating system, which comprises in addition to the software codes for the one or more applications  the following: (1) a Remote Accessory Manager further comprised of User Preferences, Remote Devices, Network Setup etc.; (2) a Package Manager; and (3) a Notification Manager. In one example, the control module , also causes, at least in part, the generation of the one or more installation packages for the one or more accessory devices  based, at least in part, on an accessory device  operating system, which comprises in addition to the software codes for the one or more applications  the following: (1) an Application Manager further comprising User preferences, User Interface (UI) actions, Network preferences etc.; (2) a Package Manager; and (3) a Notification Manager.","In one embodiment, the control module  causes, at least in part, the one or more installation packages for the main device  and one or more accessory devices  to be loaded into the data module  as a combined installation package, wherein an installation of the combined installation package causes, at least in part, an initiation of respective installation packages at the main device , the one or more accessory devices , or a combination thereof. For example, the control module  may cause, at least in part, the one or more APIs  and the one or more installation packages (combined or separate) to be loaded into the data module  as part of a SDK. In one embodiment, the one or more APIs  are part of a software development platform including, at least in part, one or more application stores.

The computer program code is a set of instructions or statements providing instructions for the operation of the processor and\/or the computer system to perform specified functions. The code, for example, may be written in a computer programming language that is compiled into a native instruction set of the processor. The code may also be written directly using the native instruction set (e.g., machine language). The set of operations include bringing information in from the bus  and placing information on the bus . The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information, shifting positions of units of information, and combining two or more units of information, such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR, exclusive OR (XOR), and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions, such as an operation code of one or more digits. A sequence of operations to be executed by the processor , such as a sequence of operation codes, constitute processor instructions, also called computer system instructions or, simply, computer instructions.

The memory , such as a random access memory (RAM) or any other dynamic storage device, stores information including processor instructions for making the use of a mobile device more socially suitable. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system . RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory  is also used by the processor  to store temporary values during execution of processor instructions.

Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Also coupled to bus  is a non-volatile (persistent) storage device , such as a magnetic disk, optical disk or flash card, for storing information, including instructions, that persists even when the computer system  is turned off or otherwise loses power.","Information, including instructions for making the use of a mobile device more socially suitable, is provided to the bus  for use by the processor from an external input device , such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user, a microphone, an Infrared (IR) remote control, a joystick, a game pad, a stylus pen, a touch screen, or a sensor. A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into physical expression compatible with the measurable phenomenon used to represent information in computer system .

Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data. For example, in wireless handheld devices, such as mobile telephones like cell phones, the communications interface  includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In certain embodiments, the communications interface  enables connection to the communication network  for making the use of a mobile device more socially suitable to the developer terminal .","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing information to processor , including instructions for execution.

The term computer-readable storage medium is used herein to refer to any computer-readable medium except transmission media.","Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer-readable storage media and special purpose hardware, such as ASIC .","Network link  typically provides information communication using transmission media through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet .","A computer called a server host  connected to the Internet hosts a process that provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server host  hosts a process that provides information representing video data for presentation at display . It is contemplated that the components of system  can be deployed in various configurations within other computer systems, e.g., host  and server .","At least some embodiments of the invention are related to the use of computer system  for implementing some or all of the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more processor instructions contained in memory .

The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, or may be stored in memory  or in storage device  or any other non-volatile storage for later execution, or both. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra-red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions.

Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) .

A main display unit  provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of making the use of a mobile device more socially suitable. The display  includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal (e.g., mobile telephone). Additionally, the display  and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry  includes a microphone  and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone  is fed to a coder\/decoder (CODEC) .","A radio section  amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station, which is included in a mobile communication system, via antenna . The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile terminal  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like, or any combination thereof.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, any other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU)  which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard .

The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet.

The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, magnetic disk storage, flash memory storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile terminal settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
