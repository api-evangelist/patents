No. 10\/052,387, filed on Jan. 23, 2002 now U.S. Pat No. 6,762,775; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/992,793, filed on Dec. 18, 1997 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,757.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a computer based browsing computer program product, system and method for browsing through documents stored in a computer. Specifically, the present invention facilitates the browsing of a document stored in a computer in such a way that it allows a rapid and holistic view of what contents are present and the organization of the material in the document, as well as rapid access to the items in the document involved. The document-browsing system in the present invention is also generalized to provide a novel human-computer interface, not just for browsing documents but also for interacting with and operating a computer to achieve the various functionalities normally carried out on the computer.","2. Description of the Related Art","Currently, the method for viewing documents stored in a computer is through a computer monitor screen. For documents that are longer\/larger than can be contained within one screen, a way is provided to scroll the document up and down or to jump to a particular point in the document (through the use of, for example, a \u201cmouse\u201d coupled with scroll bars at the edges of the document displayed on the screen or through the use of hypertext links).","However, most people do not find this a particularly convenient way to view a document, as compared with a book. That this is true is evidenced in the fact that despite the trend of increased computer usage, there is not only no corresponding reduction in paper use, but an increase in paper quantity is required to print what is conveniently stored in a computer that can be seemingly easily and flexibly manipulated for viewing. Sometimes the printed version of the information involved is necessary, like in the case of printing a picture on a sheet of paper to be pasted on some surface (e.g., a wall), or in the case of the convenience of having a relatively light, hardy paperback book for reading in almost any possible situation and location. Reading textual material on the computer screen for a prolonged period of time also leads to visual fatigue. But there are times when a reader does not need to read for a prolonged period of time and is quite happy to sit at a desk in front of a desktop computer or handle a notebook computer away from the desk, and yet the reader would still prefer a printed version of the document in a hand-held format. This is especially true in the case of looking through manuals, including software manuals, to understand how to operate a device or software application. The irony is that computer software packages (included in computer readable media, such as optical disks, magnetic disks, semiconductor memory, etc.) usually come with thick and heavy manuals containing information which can easily be stored on a light-weight CD-ROM, and even if the manuals are sometimes dispensed in the form of a CD-ROM, more often than not people would print them out into a hard-copy format in order to facilitate reading.","What is involved when one interacts with the printed material in a book is a subtle and complicated process. To start with, material in a book is presented in a sequential order, with a continuity of material from page to page, and there is also a hierarchical structure in the material presented (as the material is organized into chapters, sections, subsections, etc.) because ideas in the material are related to each other in some kind of conceptual hierarchy. The human perceptual system inputs data in a sequential manner, and after a book is read from the beginning to the end in a sequential fashion, the brain then recreates the conceptual hierarchy after viewing the material involved. However, very often one does not read a book (or input the material involved) from the beginning to the end because (a) one wants to have an overview of the material present; (b) one is searching for something of interest to him\/her; or (c) one is interested in reading only portions of the book (in the case of, say, reading the manual to understand how to operate something). In these cases, one browses through the subject book to find the material of unique interest to that reader.","Two basic things are achieved in the browsing process. First, the browser has a glimpse of what are the contents of the book document. Second, the browser has an idea of approximately where the items of interest are so that the browser can (a) return to look for them later when needed, and (b) have an understanding of the relationships between the material currently being viewed and other material (i.e., an understanding of the hierarchical structure involved). When browsing a book document, many finger-operations are required of the browser in order to flip through the pages and, together with the inherent sequential order imposed by the pages, very quickly allow the browser to have an understanding of the nature, location and organization of the material involved.","In the process of browsing through a book, one can perform the following operations:","(a) flip through the pages at varying speeds depending on the level of detail at which one wishes to view the material in the book;","(b) jump to the approximate location of the item of interest;","(c) change the direction of flipping (forward or backward) very rapidly because\n\n","(d) mark the locations of some pages of interest that one may want to later return.","All these operations are performed very rapidly with the fingers interacting with the flipping pages and with minimal unnecessary movements of the fingers and hands. Interestingly, a book\/magazine with soft and flexible pages is harder to handle because more finger and hand movements are needed to browse through it, while books with stiff pages can be browsed with almost no movement of the hand.","In currently available methods of browsing through documents stored in a computer, e.g., the use of a mouse combined with scroll bars and buttons on the computer screen, more movements of the hands are necessary to effect the various operations described above. Also, fine control of the hand or fingers (depending on whether the mouse uses hand movement to move the cursor on the screen or finger movement like in the case of a track ball) is necessary to position the cursor on the screen at the required places. The process is both lengthy and clumsy. The lengthiness of the process taxes the human short term memory's ability to remember items encountered in the recent past for the purpose of establishing the relationships between items and the clumsiness of the process creates distraction and interferes with the short term memory process, a well known effect in perceptual psychology. These destroy the ability of the reader to form an idea of the contents and structure\u2014i.e., a holistic view\u2014of the document involved.","Because material in a book is organized into pages, it allows the reader to quantify approximately the amount of coverage given to each topic\u2014e.g., three-quarters of a page, three-and-a-half pages, etc. In addition, page-oriented organization together with the fact that the pages are joined together in a sequential order with a continuity of material from page to page enhance the ability of the reader to better remember the location of various portions of the material involved (e.g., roughly how many pages from the pages currently in view). Also, unlike the process of scrolling through a document on a screen like what is normally done in a word-processor, wherein the contents become a blur and reading is impossible, when one moves through the material in a book through flipping, one is still able to read at least the approximate contents, if not the details. This, together with the page-oriented organization that enhances the user's impression of the location of material viewed, allow the user to form an impression of the organization of the material in the document.","Another method used for presenting information on the computer screen is flashing one page of information after another. This method eliminates the problem of blurred images but it also eliminates the continuity between different portions of the document. In turn, the lack of continuity eliminates the reader's ability to form impressions of the approximate absolute locations of these portions of the material involved and hence the impressions of the relationships between these portions of the material. As recognized by the present inventor, only the flipping method normally present in a book (e.g., a hardcover book) is able to provide both continuity and readable pages in view. It is due to these features that a person browsing through a book can acquire a good understanding of its contents, the location of specific items and organization of the material, and hence a holistic view of the book involved.","As recognized by the present inventor, it is because of the reasons set forth above that people still prefer to read a book in their hands rather than a document image displayed on a computer screen using currently available methods.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,467,102 (Kuno et al.) discloses a device for document viewing that consists of two display screens. One of the purposes of using two display screens is to allow the user to display two different pages from the document so that they can be read side-by-side (e.g., a diagram and its textual explanation). Another purpose is to allow a large picture to be displayed simultaneously on both pages. The Kuno et al. device allows users to change the speed of movement through the document through a pressure sensor\u2014the more pressure applied, the faster the pages in the document are moved through. The Kuno et al. device also allows the document to be viewed in the forward or backward direction by pressing on a forward sensor area or a reverse sensor area respectively. One can also select a page to jump to by pressing on an icon displayed on the screen. However the Kuno et al. device still does not provide the same convenience as browsing through a book, primarily because when switching between the operations for different controls\u2014the speed of movement through the document, the change of direction of viewing, and the jumping to different parts of the document\u2014there are a lot more hand and finger movements than is the case in manipulating a physical book. Moreover, the Kuno et al. device is a specialized, relatively costly device with sensors and hardware built onto two display screens, whereas the present inventor recognizes that a lower cost and more practical device would be one that adds modularly to the existing computer system.","Currently, there are also computer mice that can eliminate the above-mentioned problem of positioning cursor on the computer screen with a conventional mouse (i.e., fine control of the hand or fingers is needed). These mice allow the user to specify \u201chot locations\u201d on the screen on which the cursor \u201chomes onto\u201d with less fine control than conventional mice. Furthermore, a subset of these mice can generate \u201cvertical only\u201d or \u201chorizontal only\u201d movement of the cursor so that the scrolling process requires less fine control of the muscle than is required with a conventional mouse. These mice eliminate some, but not all, of the problems associated with the conventional methods of computer input as far as computer-based document browsing is concerned.","In U.S. Pat. No. 5,417,575 (1995) McTaggart discloses an electronic book that comprises laminated sheets bound together in the form of a book. On each of these sheets, printed material is arranged on the top layer and below that layer is an electronic backdrop containing thin light-emitting diodes (LED's) and pressure sensitive switches affixed onto a backing sheet. The LED's generate visual signals that can be seen through the top layer for the purpose of highlighting parts of the printed material. The pressure switches, positioned under certain items in the printed material, are for the purpose of sensing the user's selection of those items. A speaker is also provided on the book to generate audio signals for explaining the text or giving the user audio feedback. Contact or photo-sensitive switches are also embedded in the pages to allow the electronic circuits to know which pages are currently being viewed, so that the appropriate audio and visual signals can be generated. Even though this apparatus is in a form that allows a person to handle it like handling a typical book, with visual and audio enhancements of the printed material as well as facilities that accept the user's feedback, it is basically a hard-wired device that is not reprogrammable and different hardware has to be configured for books with different contents. No provision is available for downloading document files from a computer for display on the electronic book nor is the electronic book able to display any arbitrary document file. This device is hence not suitable for browsing through documents stored in a computer.","Therefore, the present inventor has identified there exists a need for a low-cost, modular device that can be connected to existing computer systems and that, through the computer executing a set of operations stored on a computer-readable medium, can effect rapidly the necessary browsing operations and together with a preferred mode of moving through a document\u2014e.g., the flipping mode\u2014that permits easy, effective computer-based document browsing that approaches that of browsing through a book. A feature of such a system is that it would exhibit functional attributes like those of a paper-book (i.e., a physical book such as a paper-back book).","The method of browsing a physical book can also benefit another aspect of human-computer interaction. In 1997, the most popular type of human-computer interface\u2014the WINDOWS interface (e.g., MICROSOFT Corporation's WINDOWS 95\u00ae or APPLE Computer's MAC operating system, OS)\u2014also suffers from many of the problems associated with reading documents on a computer. Basically, there are two situations when \u201cwindows\u201d are created on the computer screen. The first is when the user needs to look into the contents of \u201cdirectories\u201d containing either other directories or computer programs and data files. In this situation, what are displayed in a window when it is opened are the contents of a directory. This way, a user can navigate among the directories organized in a tree structure and resident on the computer hard-disks to locate programs (often called \u201capplications\u201d) and data. The other is when a user activates a program, and the program either generates some output to be displayed on the computer screen or is waiting to accept some user input (usually either a command to the program or data to be fed into the program). In the WINDOWS interface, these output and input are presented and accepted through a \u201cwindow\u201d, referred to as the working window of a program.","In the case of the use of multiple windows to display the contents of directories in the process of searching for a certain item (either a directory, a program or a data file), if one knows exactly under which directory an item of interest is placed, the tree-oriented structure present in this kind of system can greatly facilitate the search for the item. However, if one does not know where the item is placed, one would need to carry out a large number of operations opening\/entering and closing\/exiting directories, often across and up and down many levels of the directory structure, and this is carried out with a large number of, and often tiring, operations involving clicking and dragging the mouse (or other pointing device).","The situation is compounded by the fact that often the contents of a directory cannot fit entirely within a window. When that happens, a mouse-cum-scroll-bar method, much like that used for browsing through documents on a computer, is available for use to reveal the hidden parts of the directory involved. The situation is similar to viewing documents on computers, where the process of entering, exiting and scrolling up and down directory windows to search for items of interest demands a large number of finger and hand operations and movement. Also, the flashing in and out of view of these directory windows results in a discrete, non-continuous, and random sequence of images. This results in a poor idea of items' location in the entire directory structure as well as the inability to form a holistic view of the entire collection of program and data files resident on the computer's hard-disk.","In the case of computer programs using multiple windows to interact with a user, because each opened window tends to occlude other windows already present, it is often the case that in the process of accomplishing a certain task (e.g., creating a multimedia document), a large and often confusing sequence of windows has to be opened, closed or moved aside, each window representing an activation of a program to accomplish some subtasks (e.g., extracting some text from a text file, extracting a sub-part of an image from an image file, carrying out some processing on the images thus obtained, \u201cpasting\u201d all these items together in yet another program, etc.) Again a large number of finger and hand operations and movement is required to carry out these operations through the use of a mouse. Furthermore, because the various windows thus opened in this process do not have any fixed locations, and their relative locations keep changing, an excessive amount of mouse operations is often needed just to locate these opened windows or put them away for later use.","The WINDOWS interface derives from the desktop metaphor, in which the computer screen is likened to the desktop, and the windows are thus analogous to items that one normally handles on a desktop. While the desktop interface is a large improvement over the previous kind of command line interface (e.g., MICROSOFT's DOS\u00ae), primarily because of its user-friendly graphical interface and menu driven input, it suffers from the same problem of the desktop: when the items to be handled are many, the desktop tends to become very messy, and one often has to keep pushing aside many items to look for other items.","As a practical matter, when a large number of sheets of papers are handled by a person, either to collect information on various things or to scribble down ideas, one often joins (perhaps by a staple or binder clip) these sheets of paper into a temporary \u201cbook\u201d, or one uses a scrap book with blank pages on which the user may scribble-down ideas. However, the working items, once bound together, are not necessarily related to one another, and thus, are different than a paper book in which the various portions of material are often related to one another. This organization of these sheets of paper allows one to obtain the usual advantages associated with a book, namely, the items of interest acquire absolute locations, and together with the finger\/hand operations one can normally apply to a book to search for information, the items of interest can easily be located. Because the pages thus organized in a book can be quickly and easily located and viewed, the effect is tantamount to having multiple pages in view almost simultaneously, and hence it will alleviate the problems associated with the occlusion of pages by other pages or windows by other windows.","Thus, the present inventor has identified that there is a need for a higher level of organization built onto the currently available WINDOWS interface\u2014a \u201cBooks\u201d interface\u2014that can be used in conjunction with the above-mentioned low-cost, modular device that can alleviate many of the problems associated with the WINDOWS interface in order to facilitate human-computer interaction.","In view of the aforementioned short-comings of presently available schemes for browsing through documents stored in a computer, one objective of the present invention is to overcome these short-comings of conventional systems, computer-readable media, and methods.","Another object is to provide a browsing device that exploits the use of finger operations normally involved in browsing through a book, namely, the change of speed of movement through the document involved, the change of direction of movement through the document, the jumping to other portions of the document and the bookmarking of pages (e.g., when a page is bookmarked, it can be returned\/jumped to later very quickly by using the controls operated by the fingers).","Another object of the invention is that the positioning, arrangement, and operability of the controls for the above-mentioned operations performed by the fingers are such that they allow almost no movement of the hand and minimal movements of the fingers, thus maximizing the ease of browsing through the stored document by capitalizing on the dexterity of the human fingers to operate these controls.","A further object of the invention is to provide a low cost, modular browsing device that can be easily attached to existing computer systems much like how a mouse attaches to a computer system.","Still a further objective is to provide a reconfigurable construct for the browsing device so that it can be (a) configured into a hand-held controller; (b) attached to the sides of existing computer screens; (c) configured to cooperate with a mouse so that there is no need to move the user's hand(s) when switching between browser-related operations and mouse-related operations; and (d) configured to cooperate with a gyro-mouse so that the entire assembly can be used in the absence of a table top, where the particular construct is selected by the user depending on the user's preference.","Another object of the invention is to provide a computer-readable medium that holds software that when executed by a computer displays, on the computer screen, the document to be browsed by way of browsing commands generated by the user actuating the browsing device. The display is in the form of a book format image that shows the thicknesses of material in the document before and after the currently viewed material, showing of the bookmarks, and showing, on the thicknesses, of the location of the pages that would be jumped to at any given time if jumping were to be effected.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system, computer-based process, and method that permit different organizations of material in the document and corresponding display formats, including: (a) organized into pages that can be flipped through page by page from right to left or vice versa, much like what happens when one flips through a book; (b) organized into pages that can be flipped through page by page from bottom to top or vice versa, much like what happens when one flips through a notepad; (c) organized into pages that can be slid through page by page from right to left or vice versa, much like what happens when one views a microfilm; (d) organized into pages that can be flashed one after another; and (e) organized into pages that can be scrolled through, with no distinct page boundaries, much like what is normally done in a computer implemented word-processor application stored on a computer-readable medium. The first three methods when used together with the aforementioned browsing device result in a browsing process that most resembles that of browsing through a book, a notepad, or a micro-film. The last two methods do not precisely emulate the book-browsing process but can still benefit from the rapidity of finger control effected on the browsing device.","Another object of the invention is to provide a computer based mechanism that implements simultaneous multiple indexing in conjunction with the inventive browsing system. When a keyword of interest is encountered during the reading of the document, the user selects the keyword using a cursor on the screen in conjunction with a pointing device such as a mouse, like what is normally done in current computer systems, or using his\/her finger in conjunction with a touch or pressure sensing screen, or other methods. In response, the pages on which explanations or other issues related to this keyword reside are bookmarked by the inventive system, after which the user can quickly flip to one of these pages using the mechanisms provided in the browsing system.","Another object of the invention is to use the above-described browsing facility in conjunction with other software, storable on computer readable media, that is configured to reorganize the material in the document involved to facilitate browsing\/viewing\u2014for example, the positioning of material for comparison side by side on the pages currently being viewed.","Another object of the invention is to use the above-mentioned browsing facility in conjunction with software, storable on computer readable media, that can highlight selected portions of the material or annotate on the pages in the document involved to facilitate browsing\/viewing\/reading.","Yet another object of the invention is to provide the above-mentioned browsing facility to a computer configured to execute word processing software so as to facilitate the entering, processing, and viewing\/browsing of material in conjunction with the word processing software.","Another object of the invention is to provide the above-mentioned browsing facility to any software, storable in a computer-readable medium, in which information cannot be fitted within one computer screen for viewing or manipulating.","Yet another object of the invention is to add a new metaphor mechanism\u2014the \u201clibrary metaphor\u201d\u2014to the computer operating system's human interface in which information on the computer screen which is traditionally presented in the form of windows is now be presented in the form of \u201cbooks\u201d.","These and other objects are achieved by providing a processor-based browsing device, system, computer-readable media, and method for browsing through a document that includes, a top surface, a sensor surface and a bottom surface. A sensor area on the sensor surface detects the position of a finger along one direction and the force of the finger on the sensor area. The browsing device also includes four buttons\/on-off switches on the bottom surface, and four additional buttons\/on-off switches on the said top surface, each of which is operated by the fingers. An electrical circuit converts the force and position of the finger on the sensor area as detected by the force and position sensors on that area into electrical forms and outputs them. The electrical circuit also outputs the on\/off states of the four buttons\/on-off switches on the bottom surface, and four additional buttons\/on-off switches on the said top surface. The device connects to a computer configured to implement in software the control, sense, and display mechanisms consistent with the users activity with the browsing device.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to  thereof which depicts the browsing device  according to the present invention that can be used in conjunction with existing computer systems for the purpose of browsing through documents or any information stored in the computer. While certain embodiments of the browsing device (e.g., device ) are shown herein, other data input devices, such as keyboards, keypads, a computer mouse used with pull-down menus, etc., may be used as well to accomplish the browsing functions, albeit in a less convenient format. Nevertheless, in reference to the browsing device , four commands are input and detected by the browsing device . These commands include the following: (a) specifying whether a movement in a forward direction or in a backward direction through the document is to be performed; (b) specifying a speed of the movement described in (a); (c) jumping to a specified location in the document or information involved; and (d) specifying that certain portions of the document or the information involved is to be bookmarked. Based on these commands, signals are generated and output to effect the necessary operations in a computer system (e.g., computer  in ) attached to the browsing device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIGS. 1B and 1C","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1B"],"b":["100","100","120","110","100","120","122","141","144","130","122","120","121","360","122","120","121","122","121","110","120","122","120","122","121"]},"As shown in , four buttons\/switches \u2013 are placed on the bottom surface , within easy reach of the four fingers (\u2013) during those operations when these fingers (\u2013) are placed on the bottom surface . On the top surface  of the device , another four buttons\/switches (\u2013) are placed, preferably parallel to the edge adjoining the top surface  and the slanted surface , as shown in .","The force of the thumb  (or one of the other fingers) on the sensor area  dictates how fast to move through the document, and the position of the thumb  (or one of the other fingers) along the x-direction dictates the point to which the document is jumped. More particularly, the buttons (\u2013, and \u2013) on the bottom and top surfaces ( and  respectively) are for the purposes of bookmarking. The use of these buttons (\u2013, \u2013) depends on the particular configuration in which the browsing device  is used and will be described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A\u20132F","FIGS. 1B and 1C","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 2A\u20132F"],"b":["100","100","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 1C"],"b":["200","101","100","100","151","152","200","205","172","122","171","121","131","134","181","184","130","180","111","114","161","164","110","160"]},"In this configuration, the direction of movement (i.e., forward or backward) through the document (using flipping or other methods, all to be described in detail later) is effected through the force applied by the right and left thumbs ( and ) on the sensor areas  and  respectively. The right thumb  force activates a forward movement through the document and the left thumb  force activates a backward movement. The speed of movement is preferably proportional to the force applied, although other force\/speed relationships may be employed successfully. The right thumb  operating the right sensor area  activates jumping to points in the document involved that lie between the currently viewed material in the document and the end of the document and the left thumb  operating the left sensor area  activates jumping to points in the document involved that lie between the currently viewed material in the document and the beginning of the document. As shown in , the right fingers other than the thumb  operating the buttons \u2013 on the bottom surface  create bookmarks for points in the document involved that lie between the currently viewed material in the document and the end of the document and the left fingers other than the thumb  operating the corresponding buttons \u2013 on the corresponding bottom surface  create bookmarks for points in the document involved that lie between the currently viewed material in the document and the beginning of the document.","An x-direction is defined along the slanted surface for the left-hand device  that is perpendicular to the edge adjoining the top surface  and the slanted surface  of the left-hand device  and the positive x-direction is taken to be the direction away from that edge as illustrated in . The operations to be described below for the sensor areas  or  and for the buttons on the bottom surfaces \u2013 or \u2013 are similar for both the right-hand device  and the left-hand device  and unless necessary, only the operations for the right-hand device  will be described.","The position of the thumb  in the x-direction on the sensor area  (refer to ) as detected by the position sensors on the slanted surface  determines the page in the document to jump to (for the cases in which the material in the document is organized into pages to be flipped, slid or flashed on the computer screen, the details of which will be described later) or the point in the document to jump to (for the case in which material in the document is not organized into pages like in the case of the use of scrolling to move through the document). Let x=0 (the origin) be the point at which the slanted surface  meets the top surface . The thumb  will be referred to as being \u201cat\u201d position x1 when it covers the point x1 and some contiguous points to the \u201cright\u201d of x1, i.e., some of the contiguous points x such that x>x1, and \u201cright\u201d refers to the conventional positive axial direction. This is because the intersection of the thumb  and the slanted surface  (in the sensor area ) on the browsing device  has a small spatial extent and hence it will have some dimension in the x-direction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","100","300","310","300","301"]},"In the browsing of a real book, the thumb selects the page to jump to by sliding along the side until it reaches that page. In the process of accomplishing this, the thumb slides along the side of the book in a(direction perpendicular to the edge of the book the thumb is touching (similar to the x-direction in ) by an amount proportional to how far along in the document the page to be jump to is from the current page. Because in the browsing device  depicted in , the width of the slanted surface felt by the thumb does not change, even as the amount of material\/number of pages present on that \u201cside\u201d of the \u201cbook\u201d changes, the translation of the x-position of the thumb to a page in the document to jump to is slightly more complicated.","Consider initially no force is applied onto the sensor area  by the thumb  and a certain page of the document involved is being displayed. When the thumb  is placed at any position x=XT1 on the sensor area  and when a force is applied for a time longer than a user-specified pre-defined, short period, preferably, but not limited to, a range of 100 milliseconds to 1 second, the document is moved through forward (or backward if the left sensor area  is activated by the thumb ). The speed of movement is proportional to the force applied. If the force is applied only momentarily, (e.g., less than preferred 100 millisecond) no movement through the document takes place, but a starting position for any subsequent jumping process is taken to be XT1. When the thumb  is moved from x=XT1 to a position XT2 (XT2>XT1) and the thumb  is pressed momentarily, a jump is made to a page in the document that is further along. Let XS be the width of the sensor area  and let PR be the number of pages remaining from the current page to the end of the document (or to the beginning of the document, if the left device  is activated). PJ, the number of pages to skip over is equal to PR*(XT2\u2212XT1)\/(XS\u2212XT1). That is, at any given time, the distance along the slanted surface from the current thumb position XT1 to the edge, XS, is treated as being proportional to the number of pages remaining from that point to the end or beginning of the document. In the case of using the method of scrolling to display the document in which the material is not organized into pages, then PR becomes the amount of material, say the number of lines of material, remaining and PJ becomes the amount of material to be skipped over.","After the thumb  moves from the starting position XT1 in the positive x-direction, before it applies any force to effect a jump, it is at liberty to move between XT1 and XS in the positive or negative x-directions to search for a page it wishes to jump to. If in this process the thumb  moves in the negative x-direction beyond the starting position XT1, whatever new position the thumb  finds itself in and after having applied a momentary force in that position, that position will become a new starting position XT1 for the computation of any subsequent jump. If the thumb  did not apply any momentary force after having moved in the negative x-direction beyond the starting position XT1, and then it moves back past XT1 in the positive x-direction, the starting position for any subsequent jump will be XT1.","When one continues to apply force for longer than the user-defined pre-defined, short time period on the sensor area  using the thumb  after a jump is made while holding the thumb  at the same position, the movement through the document begins from that page\/point onwards, and the speed of movement is proportional to the force applied as before.","The starting position of the thumb  for the jumping process can be at x=0 or any position XT1 in the x-direction. But starting at x=0 allows the use of a larger width (from x=0 to XS) to correspond to the remaining material and thus a better resolution of control in terms of jumping\/skipping. At any given time, no matter how much remaining material there is, while one is moving through the document by having the thumb  at a given position, one can always move the thumb  back to a position of smaller x (that does NOT trigger a movement through the document in the opposite direction\u2014one has to use the other device operated by the other hand to change direction) or x=0, and apply some force momentarily to signify that the user has now repositioned the thumb . The user may then continue the process of moving through the document by applying the force longer than a pre-defined, short moment, or use this current position as a new reference\/starting point (XT1) and slide the thumb  to a new position (XT2) to skip through some material. The movement of the thumb  back to a smaller x or x=0 to define a starting position XT1 before the jumping process gives the user a better resolution for the jumping\/skipping control.","The mechanisms for jumping to some other parts of the document and movement through the document under the control of the thumb  as described above are described in the flowchart in .","Consider initially a certain page of the document is being displayed. In step , the thumb  is placed at position XT on the sensor area . The process flows to step , where a check is made to determine if a force has been applied momentarily or longer (than a predefined, short time). If not, nothing happens; the thumb  may move to a new position XT (step ) or stay in the same position XT. If an affirmative response is received in step , a check is made to see if the thumb has applied the force longer than momentarily. If so, the process flows to step  where movement through the document is initiated (with a speed proportional to the force applied and a direction depending on whether the left-hand device  or the right-hand device  in the mini-book configuration  is activated). If a negative response is received in step , the process flows to step . Similarly, after initiation of movement through the document in step , the process also flows to step . In step , the starting position XT1 is assigned the value of the current thumb  position XT. The process then flows to step  where the thumb  either stays in the current position or moves to a new position XT (< >XT1). The process then flows to step , where a check is made to find out whether XT is greater than XT1. If so, a check is made in step  to find out whether a force is applied at XT; if not, nothing happens and the thumb may move to a new position XT (< >XT1) in step . If the response to step  is affirmative, the process flows to step , where XT2 is assigned the value of the current XT. The process then flows to step  where a value PJ=PR*(XT2\u2212XT1)\/(XS\u2212XT1) is computed. (PR is the number of pages or amount of material remaining from the current page to the end of the document if the right-hand device  in the mini-book configuration  is now being activated or from the current page to the beginning of the document if the left-hand device  in the mini-book configuration  is being activated. XS is the width of the sensor area .) A jump is effected that skips over PJ pages or PJ amount of material in the document. The process then flows back to step  where the process repeats.","If in step , XT is found to be smaller than XT1, then the process flows to step  which checks if a force has been applied at XT momentarily or longer. If not, nothing happens, the process flows to step  where the thumb can move to a new position XT. If so, step  checks to see if the force applied is longer than a pre-defined, short period. If the force applied is longer than a pre-defined, short period, the process flows to step  where movement through the document is initiated (with a speed proportional to the force applied and a direction depending on whether the left-hand device  or the right-hand device  in the mini-book configuration  is activated). If a negative response is received in step , the process flows to step  where the starting position XT1 is assigned the current value of XT. After the initiation of movement through the document in step , the process also flows to step .","The above described method of jumping\/skipping through the pages through the use of the sliding of the thumb  over a certain distance (in the x-direction) is referred to as the relative distance method whereas the jumping\/skipping in the process of browsing through a physical book uses absolute distance (in the direction perpendicular to the edge of the book). Another embodiment of the browsing device  that uses absolute distance will be described later in reference to .","To provide the user with feedback of his\/her thumb movement on the sensor area  along the x-direction () before he\/she effects the jump to a different part of the document involved, an indication  of the position of the thumb  is provided on the thickness  area of the book  displayed on the screen next to the pages  currently being viewed (). This indication  is referred to as the jump cursor. Recall that the thumb  starts from one point on the sensor area  and slides on the sensor area  in the x-direction before a force is applied to effect the jump. In this process, the thumb  slides over many points on the x-position sensor  on the slanted surface . An indication is made on the computer screen of the location of the page that would be jumped to had the thumb  applied a force at any given point along the x-direction. As the thumb  slides on the sensor area  before the application of the force, the whole width of the thickness  displayed on the screen next to the currently viewed pages  is preferably divided into two parts. One part corresponds to all the pages that will be skipped if a force were applied at that point in the x-direction on the sensor area . The other part corresponds to the pages that remain from the page jumped to if a force were applied to the end of the document (if one is moving forward through the document and the right hand device  in the mini-book configuration  is being activated) or to the beginning of the document (if one is moving backward through the document and the left-hand device  in the mini-book configuration  is being activated). There are two ways to display the boundary  (a thin line) between these two parts that corresponds to the point or page in the document jumped to if a jump were to take place. Preferably within the thickness area  on the computer screen is shown by the boundary, a thin line, as being different in darkness, texture, or color (preferably darkness) from the rest of the thickness \u2014hence one would see a line oriented perpendicular to the x-direction (parallel to the y-direction, ) and whose length is confined to the thickness  region moving in the positive or negative x-direction depending on the direction of movement of the thumb  on the sensor area . Alternatively, one part, say the left part, is shown as being different in darkness, texture or color (preferably darkness) from the other part, say the right part\u2014hence one would see one part expanding and the other contracting, or vice versa, depending on the direction of movement of the thumb  on the sensor area .","The use of the four buttons  to  on the bottom surface  of the browsing device  will be described for bookmarking. During operation, each of the other four fingers  to  except the thumb  is placed near each of the four buttons  to  and each of these buttons is meant to be operated by the finger nearest to it. At any moment when one is viewing a page of the document and decides that it might be of interest to return to later, one presses one of the buttons  to  momentarily and then lets go, either once or twice, depending on whether one wishes to create a finger-bookmark or a permanent-bookmark respectively as will be described below. The page will then be bookmarked and a bookmark  is displayed on the screen as shown in FIG. \u2014sticking out from the position of the page\/point that it marks on the side of the book . One can use the same button (one of the buttons  to ) to bookmark more than one point\/page. All the bookmarks  that are created by the same button (i.e., one of buttons  to ) are clustered together (e.g., one of clusters  to ) and displayed as such as shown in .","After one has bookmarked a certain page\/point on a certain side (right, , or left, , ) of the book, if one moves through the document past that page\/point (forward or backward respectively), the bookmark will either disappear or be transferred to the other side, depending on whether the bookmark is a finger-bookmark or a permanent-bookmark respectively. The finger-bookmarks are more like the bookmarks created by the use of the fingers when browsing through a physical book\u2014they are more temporary and they \u201cdisappear\u201d after the bookmarked page\/point has been passed. In the case of a page\/point marked by a permanent-bookmark, when the page\/point is passed the bookmark will be transferred to the other side and be grouped in the cluster that corresponds to the same cluster in the other side from which it originates. (The preferred method by which this transfer is to be effected and shown on the computer screen depends on the method of movement through the document which will be described later together with the description of those methods). To remove a permanent-bookmark, one presses the corresponding button twice in quick succession (e.g., \u201cdouble click\u201d) when the bookmarked page\/point is currently in view. (The permanent bookmarks are more like the bookmarks created by inserting, say, a slip of paper when one is browsing through a physical book.) The finger-bookmarks and the permanent-bookmarks are displayed differently on the computer screen. (They are differentiated either by shape, size, color, marking, or lettering.)","For the finger-bookmark, if one wishes that the bookmark not be removed after one has moved through the document past the corresponding page\/point, one can transfer it to the other side by creating another bookmark using the fingers on the other hand, much like what one does when browsing through a physical book. The permanent-bookmarking process tends to create many bookmarks and they should be used only if necessary.","To return to a bookmarked page\/point (whether it be finger-bookmarked or permanent-bookmarked), one presses the button (one of \u2013 or one of \u2013) that corresponds to the cluster to which the page\/point belongs and uses the corresponding thumb  or  to apply force to the corresponding sensor area  or  while continuing to press the button. If there is more than one bookmarked page in each cluster, the page that is nearest the current page will be jumped to. (Note that this can obliterate some finger-bookmarks in the other clusters if in this process the document is moved through past those corresponding pages.) After having jumped to a bookmarked page, if one wishes to take some time to read that page, one has to stop applying force using the thumb  or  on the corresponding sensor area  or  or else the process of moving through the document will begin. One should also stop pressing the corresponding button (one of \u2013 or one of \u2013). (This is to relieve the finger of unnecessary tension). If this page was a finger-bookmarked page and one wishes to bookmark this page again, one has to press the button (one of \u2013 or one of \u2013) again (once or twice depending on whether now one wishes to finger-bookmark or permanent-bookmark it respectively).","To avoid confusion and speed up the browsing process, even though the facility of using one button to bookmark more than one page is provided, hence creating the cluster of bookmarks associated with that button, it is to be avoided if possible. Hence, one should try to use as many of the buttons (\u2013 and \u2013) provided as possible. That is, if there are four pages to be bookmarked on one side, one should use all four buttons (\u2013 or \u2013, depending on whether it is the right side  or left side  respectively that is involved), creating only one bookmark in each cluster. This way, a speedier jump to a desired bookmarked page is possible because one does not have to jump through those unwanted pages bookmarked in the same cluster before one arrives at the intended page.","At any given time, only one of the hands is supposed to perform operations (i.e., only one of the two browsing devices  and  is supposed to be activated). If both hands try to perform operations at exactly the same time, there will be no operation performed. If one hand performs an operation before the other hand, then that hand takes priority. One exception to this is when the device is used in conjunction with a flipping method  or  of moving through the document involved to be described in detail later (with reference to  and ), whereby the operation of both hands is used to create a \u201cfan display\u201d  or  (with reference to  and ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0125"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A"],"b":["210","210","200","210","100","101","216","215","215","216","100","101","216"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["220","220","100","101","225","100","101","225","100","101","200","220","131","134","130","100","111","114","110","131","134","101","161","164","160","181","184","180","111","114","161","164","226","227","171","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0127"},"figref":["FIG. 2E","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2E","FIG. 2E"],"b":["230","235","200","100","101","230","200","131","134","181","184","230","200","236","237","236","237","131","181","236","237","235","200","200","210","220","100","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 2F","b":["240","100","100","200","121","131","134","130","200","100","101","100","200","131","1","240","200","131"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0129"},"figref":["FIG. 2G","FIG. 2F","FIG. 2E"],"b":["250","255","100","240","256","257","230","256","257","255","131","130","100","100","256","257","131","255"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0130"},"figref":"FIGS. 2H and 2I","b":["260","200","263","264","265","266","260","261","262","261","262","121","171","200","271","278","131","134","181","184","281","288","161","164","111","114","260","262","261","260","271","278","263","264","260","261","262","261","262","281","288","265","266"]},"The browsing device  employed in the configurations , , , , , and , among others, and the browsing device  can be used in conjunction with a number of different methods for displaying the movement through the document involved on the computer screen in a computer book.

First, the contents of the text file is displayed on the computer screen (such as an IBM Color Monitor G50, part Number 96G1593) using, say a word processing software such as MICROSOFT WORD Version 7.0 from MICROSOFT Corporation, running on the computer. The image on the computer screen which is stored in the screen dump can then be put into the clipboard using the \u201cPrint Screen\u201d key on the keyboard (such as an IBM Keyboard, Part Number 06H9742). The clipboard can be imported as an image file into a graphics software such as VISONEER PAPERPORT from Visioneer Communications, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., Part Number C1132-90000 running on the computer using the \u201cPaste\u201d command provided by the software, and then exported and stored as an image file in, say, the TIFF format. Each page in the document can be captured in this way in one TIFF file. Then, using a video editing\/movie making software such as Adobe PREMIER 4.0 from Adobe Systems Incorporated of Mountain View, Calif., part Number 02970103 running on the computer, the TIFF files, each containing one page of the document, can be imported into the software and using the \u201cMotion\u201d command and superimposition facilities provided by the software a \u201cmovie\u201d of flipping pages can be generated and if necessary, exported and stored in a motion picture format such as a .AVI file.","For the purpose of the present invention, the various components\/operations described above for generating flipping pages from an existing document file are preferably integrated into a single software process that may be conveniently ported from one computer to the next in a computer readable medium, such as an optical disc (e.g., CD ROM, or digital versatile disc, DVD), magnetic media (e.g., floppy diskette), or semiconductor memory (ROM, PROM, application specific integrated circuit, ASIC, or Field Programmable Gate Array, FPGA). An alternative method reads from the existing document file directly, generates the necessary images for all the pages, and then creates a \u201cmotion picture\u201d of flipping pages from these images.

A\u2013 controlled from a browsing device  is as follows. There are two force thresholds, F (typically about 50% of the maximum force signal generated by the sensor  or ) and F (typically about 80% of the maximum force signal generated by the sensor  or ), defined for the force sensing aspect of the sensors  and  on the browsing device . When the user's finger applies a force less than F, no action is taken. If a force greater than F is applied and then removed in a short time, say in less than T (typically about 1 second or less), a single page is shown to flip across and then no further change in the book display  is made until other operations are performed. Starting from a force less than F, if a force greater than F but less then F is applied and held for longer than T, the browsing process enters a continuous flipping mode. Pages continue to flip for as long as the force is greater than F, and the speed of movement through the document (as reflected in the speed of flipping of one page or the number of pages flipped across at any given time) increases as the force on the sensor  or  of the browsing device  increases. In the continuous flipping mode, as soon as the force falls below F, the flipping actions stop.","Starting from a force less then F, if a force greater than F is applied and held for longer than T, the browsing process enters the jump exploration mode. In this mode, the user can move the jump cursor using the position sensing capabilities of the sensor  or  on the browsing device  to select the page to which to jump. The user's finger movement in the x-direction (as defined in ) on the force and position sensor  or  is translated into the movement of the jump cursor in the direction of the thickness of the book. When a desired location to jump to is selected, the user lets the force fall below F, and the jump to the selected location is effected. If in the jump exploration mode the user decides to terminate the mode and not execute any jump, he can press one of the unused finger-bookmarking buttons \u2013 and \u2013 (i.e., the button has not been used to bookmark any of the pages in the document) on the browsing device  to cancel the mode.","For finger-bookmarking, when the user desires to finger-bookmark one of the pages currently in view, he would use one of the finger-bookmarking buttons \u2013 and \u2013 on the browsing device . The buttons \u2013 on the right side of the browsing device  are for bookmarking the right-hand page and vice versa for the left side. One click of the button involved creates a finger-bookmark . The button is now associated with the bookmark  thus created. The bookmark is removed\u2014i.e., the bookmark disappears and the button becomes unused\u2014as soon as the bookmarked page is flipped. Another way a finger-bookmark can be removed is when the button associated with it is clicked one time.

For example, under software control, in conjunction with the use of a mouse cum cursor method, say, two or more pages in the document to be compared or parts of the document to be compared can all be brought together and displayed in the currently viewed page(s). This may be achieved by, say, using the mouse cum cursor to first select parts of the current viewed pages by clicking the mouse button and dragging the mouse like what is normally done or to select one of the currently viewed pages by double clicking on that page where the cursor is now positioned. And then, after moving to another part of the document, the cursor can now be positioned over a point on one of the currently viewed pages and the selected material can be brought into view by one click of the mouse button. The selected material, if it is one page full, will simply cover the page on which the cursor was placed before the one click of the mouse button to bring it into view. If the selected material is not one page full, it will be positioned, say, to the right and bottom of the cursor, and cover part of the page on which the cursor was placed before the one click of the mouse button to bring it into view. Another click of the mouse button will remove this temporarily placed material to allow one to see what was on the page originally. This temporarily placed material will also automatically disappear from the page on which it was placed after that page disappears from view after the user activates movement to other parts of the document.","The above browsing system  can also be used in conjunction with any software method that allows the highlighting of selected portions of the material or annotations of the pages in the document involved to facilitate browsing\/viewing\/reading.","The above browsing system  is suitable for use not just for browsing through or viewing documents that do not require any processing of their contents while they are being viewed, but also in conjunction with a word-processing system. Instead of creating a document and processing it on a computer screen like what is normally done, and then scroll up and down to view and browse through it using the usual mouse cum scroll bar method, the method of viewing and browsing through the document as described in the above browsing system  can be used. The process of entering\/deleting material in the document can also be made to be consonant with the method of movement through the document (i.e., one of the methods , , ,  and  described in ). If the word processing is used in conjunction with, say, the flipping method  of moving through the document, as one finishes entering material for the right-hand page, the page will flip over to reveal a new, empty page for the entering of material. As one deletes material until nothing is left on the currently viewed pages, continued deletion will effect a flipping back to the previous page. Similar mechanisms can be used in conjunction with the other three non-scrolling methods of moving through the document\u2014namely the sliding method , the flashing method , and the vertical flipping method .","The above browsing system  is adapted for use in conjunction with any software in which there is information\/icons of control \u201cbuttons\u201d to be displayed, either for viewing or manipulating, that cannot be fitted within one computer screen. In this case, scrolling in conjunction with the use of a mouse is often done, or sub-menus and sub-operations can be selected by pressing icons of \u201cbuttons\u201d on the screen. In the case of selection of sub-menus and sub-operations, the sub-menus or displays containing buttons for sub-operations are flashed on the screen once they are selected. When there is a large amount of this kind of information\/operations present in the software, it will benefit from the use of the browsing system\u2014the system can provide a good idea of what kinds of information\/operations are available, where they can be found and how they are related to each other, as well as fast access to them. To be used in conjunction with the current browsing system , these menus\/sub-menus and buttons for operations\/sub-operations can all be organized into a \u201cbook\u201d and access to them can be effected by the browsing system  described above.","In 1997, the most popular and convenient form of human-computer interface is the \u201cWindows\u201d interface that grew out of the \u201cdesktop metaphor\u201d in which manipulating items on a computer screen is likened to manipulating items on a desktop. This kind of interface, though representing a vast improvement over previous kinds of interface and user-friendly, still suffers from one of the problems of manipulating items on a desktop\u2014a person's desktop tends to get very messy and things are hard to find when there are too many of them present. In the Windows interface, when there are a lot of sub-directories\/files within a directory that cannot be fitted within one window or one screen, they are to be located by scrolling through the use of a mouse, with all the attendant problems as described above for the browsing of information using this method. Looking for items (say, a program or data file) whose names or associations with particular directories\/sub-directories are not known in advance by going up, down, and across many levels of the directory structure is also a tedious and confusing process because it suffers from a lack of a holistic view of the entire directory structure. In the Windows interface, a typical computer program communicates with the user through \u201cworking windows\u201d\u2014the computer program accepts input from and directs its output to a prescribed, often rectangular, area on the computer screen. In the process of completing a typical task, often many programs have to be activated which gives rise to many windows being opened on the computer screen. When many windows are opened, they tend to obscure each other and those that are currently not in view are hard to find because their locations (in the \u201cthird dimension\u201d\u2014the \u201cdirection perpendicular to the screen\u201d) are not fixed, much like a scattered collection of papers on a desktop. Users often have to keep closing and opening the same windows repeatedly or moving them aside by directing the mouse cursor to various locations on the computer screen in the process of completing a particular task on the computer.","The present invention improves the human-computer interface by organizing these directories\/sub-directories or temporary working windows into \u201cbooks\u201d to be manipulated by the browsing system  described above. All information contained in memory on the computer can be organized into one big book or more than one book at any given moment, hence the descriptive phrase \u201clibrary metaphor\u201d. There are at least three possible improvements over the conventional \u201cwindows\u201d interface. First, sub-directory and file icons that cannot be fitted onto one window\/screen can be browsed through and better accessed if they are organized\/implemented in a form to be used in conjunction with the browsing device\/system  described above.  depicts one embodiment of this in conjunction with the flipping method  of moving through the document: items \u2014directories\/sub-directories or files\u2014in a window  are placed in the pages of the book  which is an instance of the computer book  depicted in . Second, sub-directories  () and files  that are normally found in windows  in the current window-based systems can be organized into chapters, sections, etc. in a computer book  (an instance of the computer book  depicted in ) instead and used in conjunction with the browsing system , an embodiment of which is depicted in . Third, items that are being worked on, either collections of files and sub-directories or the current working areas in a software (such as a word-processor) which current systems present in \u201cwindows\u201d, can be organized into pages in a \u201cscrap book\u201d to be used in conjunction with the browsing system  with its attendant advantages.  depicts one embodiment of this in conjunction with the flipping method  of moving through the document. Either each window  maps onto one page or many windows  can map onto one page in a computer book  (an instance of the computer book  depicted in ).","In one embodiment, all opened windows, whether they are for the showing of directory contents or working windows of programs, can be joined together into a book as shown in . Generally, as one opens windows in the process of operating the computer, these automatically become pages in a book, or more than one book, where the pages are \u201cwindow-pages\u201d and the books are \u201cworking books\u201d. If the preferred flipping method is used to organize the pages in this book, it further enhances the ability to search for items (whether it be a file in a directory or a certain item in a program's working window)\u2014unlike the case of the current WINDOWS system, because each page now acquires an absolute location, they are easy to locate. In addition, if the browsing device is used in conjunction with this kind of computer interface, it confers two major advantages. First, the search for and access to items can benefit in the same way as in the browsing of a document. Second, one mode of the operation of the flip-browsing controller, in which the controller is placed on the table and operated by one hand as described earlier (for example, in conjunction with ), can be taken advantage of to lighten the load of the hand that operates the mouse and provide a complementary function to that of the mouse.","Often, one uses the mouse for all the operations including the opening and closing of windows and the search for icons to locate closed or occluded windows, etc. that do not involve the keyboard. Now, one can use one hand to operate the mouse and the other to operate the browsing device. The mouse is reserved for the higher precision, analytic kind of operations such as the positioning of the cursor over a small item on the computer screen while the browsing device is used for a lower precision, holistic kind of operation such as the flipping of the window-pages to access different windows. Together, these increase the bandwidth of the user's interaction with the computer and can also spread the load of hand\/finger operations onto both hands, thus lowering the possibility of repetitive strain injury.","We now describe one embodiment of this \u201cbooks\u201d interface in which the series of windows opened during the process of operating the computer become the \u201cwindow-pages\u201d in a \u201cworking book\u201d.  show an example of the sequence of operations as one opens windows on the computer. Initially, suppose the user is at the usual WINDOWS 95\u00ae desktop as shown in , which is now shown on the computer screen  as the first page  of a working book  yet to be made from subsequent window-pages. This first page  could be thought of as residing on a sheet of \u201cpaper\u201d that has two sides and currently the other side of this first page  is empty. Now, suppose the user, uses, say, a typical computer mouse and, pointing the mouse cursor at the appropriate position, \u201cdouble-clicks\u201d on the \u201cMy Computer\u201d directory icon  to open it. The contents of \u201cMy Computer\u201d  are now added to the working book  in one or more subsequent pages. Right after that the desktop window-page  will be shown to flip to, say, the left side to reveal the contents of \u201cMy Computer\u201d  at the back of this window-page , as shown in the sequence of images , , ,  in . The entire contents of the directory \u201cMy Computer\u201d  can be fitted into one page . The arrow  indicates the direction of movement of the flipping page . During this flipping action, a blank page  is also created on the right side of the working book . Next, suppose the user now opens the directory \u201cSystem C\u201d  whose icon resides on the current left page  and whose contents cannot be fitted into one page. The contents of \u201cSystem C\u201d  would fill a number of pages, starting from the initially empty right page  currently on the display as shown in . In particular, in addition to the first page of contents , two more pages, now manifested as a thickness  on the right side of the working book , are created to contain the entire contents of System C and they are all \u201cjoined\u201d to the back of the page currently on the right . The user can reveal the contents of \u201cSystem C\u201d by activating a flipping process as shown in . The sequence of images , , ,  shows the flipping process. The arrow  indicates the direction of movement of the flipping page . Two more pages of contents  and  of the directory \u201cSystem C\u201d  are revealed. The last page  of the directory \u201cSystem C\u201d  is currently the last page of the working book .","Suppose now the user chooses to open a directory named \u201cWindows\u201d  under the directory \u201cSystem C\u201d  whose icon  resides on the second page  of the directory \u201cSystem C\u201d  as shown in . The pages containing the contents of the directory \u201cWindows\u201d  are now added to the back of the right page  currently on the display.

Even though the pages containing the directory just opened\u2014\u201cWindows\u201d \u2014have been added to the working book , the first page of this directory  is not visible right away because it is \u201chidden behind\u201d the current page  on the right. Hence, right after the pages of the directory \u201cWindows\u201d  are added and the thickness  associated with them is displayed, the current right page  begins to flip to the left to reveal the first page  and the second page  of the directory \u201cWindows\u201d  as shown in the sequence of images , , ,  in . \u201cWindows\u201d  is a larger directory than \u201cSystem C\u201d  and its contents are contained in 13 pages of the current working book .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0209"},"figref":["FIG. 18G","FIGS. 9A\u20139D","FIG. 18G","FIG. 18G","FIG. 18H"],"b":["1840","1842","1844","1845","1847","1849","1830","200","10","10","12","12","1842","1844","1845","1847","1855","1842","1844","1845","1847","1842","1844","1845","1847","1847","1845","1847","1848","1850","1852","1830","1853","1852","1830"]},"Suppose now the user chooses to go to one of the pages  of the directory \u201cWindows\u201d  that contains a file named \u201cfcc962088G\u201d  which is a data file for a document as shown in the top left picture  of . Suppose the user now chooses to open \u201cfcc962088G\u201d . On the activation of that operation, the system adds the pages of \u201cfcc962088G\u201d  to the end of the working book  and jumps to the first page  that contains the contents of the file \u201cfcc962088G\u201d , as shown in the sequence of images , , , . There is an increase in the thickness  on the right side of the working book  as soon as the contents of the file \u201cfcc962088G\u201d  are added to the end of the working book . Many intervening pages between the page on the right side  just before the jump and the last page  of the directory \u201cWindows\u201d  are skipped over in this jumping process and the display shows a thickened page  flipping from right to left of the working book . The arrow  shows the direction of movement of the thickened page . Because the last page  of the directory \u201cWindows\u201d  resides on the left side of the working book , the first page  of the just opened file \u201cfcc962088G\u201d  is added to the initially empty page  on the right side. This example of the opening of a document file is an example of the activation of a program as opposed to earlier examples that were examples of the opening of directories.","The user can now flip to the other pages of the document \u201cfcc962088G\u201d  to read or carry out other operations as shown in the sequence of images , , and  in .

The window-page for this program  is added after the current last page  of the working book and a jump is automatically made to reveal the window-page , as shown in the sequence of images , ,  and . The arrow  indicates the direction of movement of the skipped over pages \u2013 (hidden).","At this point, a sizeable working book  () has been created. At any moment, when the user needs to search for some items, whether it be a file or a control button on a program's window, the user can benefit from the organization of these items in the working book thus created and the method of locating them through flipping and the use of the browsing device . What is effectively created is a kind of \u201csimultaneous multiple-screen\u201d display: because of the book-like organization including the flipping method of moving through the book, the user knows roughly where these \u201cscreens\u201d of information are located and, in conjunction with the browsing device, has rapid access to them. It is like having a much larger computer display screen to display various information simultaneously because these \u201cscreens\u201d are accessible almost simultaneously. This effectively increases by a large amount the size of the computer screen whose limited size is a vexing problem for many computer users. The conventional window-oriented system, despite the fact that it also allows users to create multiple windows of information, does not provide the structure, organization and user-input method required to achieve this \u201csimultaneous multiple-screen effect.\u201d","The method described using the example of  is only one mode of operation of the Books interface. In another mode, instead of displaying two pages side-by-side on the screen and using both sides of each \u201csheet of paper\u201d to display information like in the case of a typical book, an alternative is to display information on only one side of each \u201csheet of paper\u201d and have the entire flippable page occupy the computer screen, as shown in .","In , a page  is shown to flip to the left (direction of movement indicated by the arrow ) to reveal another page . All the flipped pages collect in a thickness  on the left side. We term this a one-sided book. This is a useful method especially for the working window-pages of a program since it would be advantageous to make full use of the screen for the purpose of interfacing with a program.","Sometimes, when the user is not interested in having the contents of a directory, say, spread over many pages, perhaps because the user wants to have quick access to the pages that come after the directory, the user can choose to activate a \u201csingle-page\u201d mode which will only generate one page to display the contents of the directory involved. Then, the traditional scrolling mechanism is used to access the parts of the contents not visible initially on that page.","There are also other modes available for the addition of pages into the current working book. Instead of adding the pages to the end of the current working book, as shown in the example in , the user can choose to have the pages added:\n\n","The user may also choose the dimensions\u2014the height and width\u2014of the newly opened pages. These pages can be set to automatically have the dimensions of the current working book, or they can appear in the dimensions in which they most recently appeared. The dimensions of each page are also changeable. Hence the resulting working book would resemble more a clipped-together collection of arbitrarily sized paper than a typical book in which the dimensions of all its pages are the same. This is to facilitate especially the operations of working window-pages of programs which normally require a wide range of window-page sizes to contain the information required for the programs to interact with the user.","Like in the conventional WINDOWS-based system, each window-page can be resized, maximized, minimized or closed. In addition to these operations, a \u201ctear-off\u201d operation is available for the user to, say, tear off a selected page and place it in a selected location in another working book that is also on display at the same time, as shown in . In , a page  of a working book  is shown being torn off to be added between the two opened pages  and  of another working book . The typical computer mouse can be used to carry out this operation\u2014that is, to \u201cdrag\u201d the torn-off page  from the source working book  to the destination working book . Instead of tearing off one page at a time, the user can also choose to tear off a selected number of contiguous or non-contiguous pages from the working book, or all the associated pages, say, from the same directory. A \u201cjoin\u201d operation is available to join selected \u201ctorn-off\u201d pages at any selected location in any selected existing working book or these selected torn-off pages can be used to form the first pages of a new working book.","The Books interface can be used in conjunction with the WINDOWS interface to take advantage of both the library and desktop metaphor as depicted in . In , a usual Windows-oriented operating system, such as MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95\u00ae, is shown displayed in the background on the computer screen  with the usual desktop icons . One directory window  and two application windows  and  are opened. Also created is a working book . Hence only when the user so desires, the opened windows would become the window-pages of a working book, or else they would behave like the windows in a typical Windows system such as MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95\u00ae.","In addition, one can also create a \u201cdirectory book\u201d, with flippable pages, that contains the entire directory contents on the computer to facilitate browsing and searching for items whose locations within the directory tree structure are unknown. The directory structure of the typical Windows system remains on the system to allow fast search when items' locations in the directory tree structure are known, thus complementing the browsing method.","The Books interface described above in , , , and  can be implemented on a personal computer system using the C++ programming language (or other programming language) to implement various browsing and other necessary operations. Preferably, similar mechanisms used in the implementation of a flipping display as described in , such as the use of the Direct X API (Application Programming Interface) and in particular the BLT (Block Transfer) function are used to generate flipping window-pages capable of responding in real-time to various browsing commands.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0222","num":"0229"},"figref":"FIG. 22","b":["2201","2202","2202","2203","2204","2205","2206","2207","2208","2202","2204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0223","num":"0230"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":"2301"},"After step , the process flows to step  where all existing finger-bookmarks are displayed in a first image format.
