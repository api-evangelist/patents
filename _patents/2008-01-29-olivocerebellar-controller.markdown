title: Olivo-cerebellar controller
abstract: Non-linear control laws are disclosed and implemented with a controller and control system for maneuvering an underwater vehicle. The control laws change the phase of one Inferior-Olive (IO) neuron with respect to another IO. One control law is global, that is, the control law works (stable and convergent) for any initial condition. The remaining three control laws are local. The control laws are obtained by applying feedback linearization, while retaining non-linear characteristics. Each control law generates a profile (time history) of the control signal to produce a desired phase difference recognizable by a controller to respond to disturbances and to maneuver an underwater vehicle.

No. 11\/901,546, filed on Sep. 14, 2007 and which is entitled \u201cAuto-catalytic Oscillators for Locomotion of Underwater Vehicles\u201d by the inventors Promode R. Bandopadhyay, Alberto Menozzi, Daniel P. Thivierge, David Beal and Anuradha Annnaswamy.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a controller and control system for an underwater vehicle; specifically, a controller and control system which utilize non-linear dynamics supported by underlying mathematics to control the propulsors of an underwater vehicle.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Future underwater platforms are expected to have numerous sensors and performance capabilities that will mimic the capabilities of aquatic animals. A key component of such platforms would be their controller. Because such platforms, and an existing U.S. Navy Biorobotic Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (BAUV) is an example, keep station in highly disturbed fields near submarines or in the littoral areas, it is essential for the platforms (vehicles) to have quick-responding controllers for their propulsor systems.","Hydrodynamic models based on conventional engineering controllers have not been able to produce the desired levels of control. Thus, a biology-inspired controller is a realistic alternative. Because the brains of animals perform complex tasks which rely on nonlinear dynamics, the underlying mathematics provide a foundation for the controller and control system of the present disclosure.","Traditional control systems are designed using linear models obtained by Jacobian linearization. This linearization allows design using frequency domain techniques (such as lag-lead compensation, PID feedback, etc.) and a state-space approach (linear optimal control, pole assignment, servo-regulation, adaptive control, etc.). However, any controller designed using linearized models of the system will fail to stabilize unless the perturbations are small.","One must use nonlinear design techniques if the control system is to operate in a larger region. For underwater vehicles, linear and nonlinear control systems based on pole placement, feedback linearization, sliding mode control, and adaptive control, etc. have been designed. However, in these designs, it is assumed that the vehicle is equipped with traditional control surfaces. As such, these vehicles have limited maneuvering capability.","For large and agile maneuvers, traditional control surfaces are inadequate and new control surfaces must be developed. Observations of marine animals provide the potential of fish-like oscillating fins for the propulsion and maneuvering of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). AUVs exist with multiple oscillating fins which impart high lift and thrust. The oscillatory motion of the fins or propulsors is obtained by inferior olives which provide robust command signals to controllers and servomotors of the fins.","Inferior olives have complex nonlinear dynamics and have robust and unique self-oscillation [(Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO)] characteristics. Efforts have been made to model the inferior olives (IO). Limited results on phase control of IOs in an open-loop sense are available using a pulse type stimulus. However, the required pulse height of the input signal which depends on the state of the IOs at the switching instant as well as the target relative phase between the IOs has not been derived. For the application of the IOs to the AUV, closed-loop control systems must be developed for the synchronization and phase control of the IOs.","It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide control laws for the synchronization and phase angle control of multiple inferior olives (IO) used in a maneuvering controller or control system of an underwater vehicle;","It is a further object of the present invention to provide non-linear control laws that the controller or control system can use to change a phase of one IO with respect to another IO; and","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a global control law for a controller to use in maneuvering an underwater vehicle; and","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a local control law for a controller to use in maneuvering an underwater vehicle.","In order to attain the objects described, the present invention provides closed-loop control of multiple inferior olives (IOs) for maneuvering a Biorobotic Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (BAUV). A model of an ith IO is described where variables are associated with sub-threshold oscillations and low threshold spiking. Higher threshold spiking is also described.","For the sake of simplicity, the synchronization of only two IOs is considered, but it is seen that the approach is extendable for the synchronization of any number of IOs.","In optimizing the controller or control system for maneuvering, the state vector for the ith IO is defined and a nonlinear vector function and constant column vector are obtained. Synchronization is defined by first considering the synchronization of two IOs having arbitrary and possibly large initial conditions. Note that if a delay time is zero, the IOs oscillate in synchronism with a relative phase zero. However, if one sets the delay time, the IOwill oscillate lagging behind the IOwith a relative phase angle. Although, the convergence of the synchronization error has been required to be only asymptotic; for practical purposes, it will be sufficient if one can design a control system for the IOwhich is sufficiently fast.","In the disclosure, four control systems are presented for the synchronization of two IOs based on an input-output feedback linearization (nonlinear inversion) approach. For the purpose of the design of the controller or control system, output variables associated with the nonlinear system. It is shown that the choice of the output variable is important in shaping the behavior of the closed-loop system; although, by following the approach presented, various input-output linearizing control systems can be obtained.","The derivation of a control law is considered for the global synchronization of the IOwith the reference IO. It is desired to design a synchronizing control system such that IOoscillates in synchronism with a delay time corresponding to a desired phase angle with respect to the reference IO. In global synchronization, the synchronization is accomplished for all values of initial conditions of the two IOs. The output function is a function of the state vectors of IOand IO. This choice of the output yields the global result.","For the nonlinear closed-loop system, the output satisfies a fourth order linear differential equation. One can choose larger gains to obtain faster convergence to zero. For the chosen output, because the system is of dimension four and the relative degree is four, the dimension of the zero dynamics is null. The zero dynamics represent the residual dynamics of the system when the output error is constrained to be zero.","The frequency of oscillation of the IOs depends on the system parameters. Signals of different frequencies can be obtained by time scaling. In the disclosure it is observed that the IOs are not initially in phase. As the controller switches, the IOs synchronize. However, as the command changes, it causes larger deviations in the tracking of trajectories due to a large control input.","The controller or the control system uses feedback of nonlinear functions of state variables and has a global synchronization property. The complexity and performance of the controller depends on the choice of the output function.","The IOs will synchronize if the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable (globally asymptotically stable). For asymptotic analysis, ignoring a decaying part, which represents the deviation of a trajectory from, a periodic signal can be represented by a Fourier series. Moreover, the amplitude of the harmonic converges to zero and for stability analysis a finite number of harmonics will suffice.","A simple control law has linear feedback terms involving only {tilde over (z)} and {tilde over (w)} variables and are independent of uand vvariables. The output {tilde over (w)} satisfies a first-order equation and in the closed-loop system {tilde over (w)} tends to zero. However, the stability in the closed-loop system will depend on the stability property of the zero dynamics. Apparently if the origin (\u0169, {tilde over (v)}, {tilde over (z)})=0 of the zero dynamics is asymptotically stable, then {tilde over (x)} converges to zero as {tilde over (w)} tends to zero.","The relative merits of the four controllers are such that the first controller has a global stabilization property and the remaining controllers have established local synchronization. It is expected that as the complexity of control law increases, the region of stability enlarges. For this reason, one expects that the control law can accomplish synchronization for relatively small perturbations at the instant when the phase command is given. Of course, the error, and therefore the synchronization of the IOs, depends on the instant of controller switching. Based on simulation results, it has been found that two control laws for the controllers have fairly large regions of stability and one control law does not necessarily have to use another control law.","Unlike the global control laws for the controller, the local control laws provide smoother responses. This is due to a fast-varying nonlinear function of large magnitude in the control law. There exists flexibility in the design, and by a proper choice of feedback gains and the reference phase command signals, one can obtain different response characteristics. This flexibility in phase control of IOs is useful in performing desirable maneuvers for the BAUV.","One must note that the profile of the control signal will depend on the states of the IOs when a pulse is applied. The derived controllers are based on the input-output feedback linearization theory, as well as stability and convergence. The control system can be switched on for phase control at any instant since the system utilizes state variable feedback and one can command the IO to follow a sequence of phase change when needed.","Referring now to the present disclosure, a subsection on inferior-olives and a practical application of control laws affecting inferior-olives are presented.","Inferior Olives Model and Synchronization","This disclosure focuses on closed-loop control of multiple inferior olives (IOs) for maneuvering Biorobotic Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (BAUVs).

The parameters of the IOs selected are: E=0.001, E=0.02, k=0.1, I=0.018, I=\u22120.61, and a=0.015. One can use another set of parameters as well. The input to IOis kept to zero. The feedback gains chosen are such that the poles of Equation (17) are at 25(\u22120.424\u00b1j 1.263) and 25(\u22126.26\u00b1j 0.4141). These poles have been selected to obtain good transient responses by observing the simulated responses, however one could choose other pole locations as well for synchronization. The initial conditions are x=(0.4, 0.6, 0.4, 0.5)and x=(0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3). Thus the initial condition of the IOs differs. The frequency of oscillation of the IOs depends on the system parameters. Signals of different frequencies can be obtained by time scaling. For illustration, a time scaling is introduced by multiplying the derivatives of the variables by a scaling factor of sixty.","It is desired to have the delay time tas 0.125 for t \u03b5 [0,4), 0.25 for t \u03b5 [4, 6), 0.5 for t \u03b5 [6, 8) and 0.75 for t \u03b5 [8, 10), respectively. The controller is switched on at t=2 (sec), that is I=0 for t<2 and the delay command changes every two seconds. Referring now to the drawings, responses are shown in )-(), )-() and )-(). In the figures, the variables with a subscript \u201cd\u201d indicate delayed values (such as u2denoting u(t\u2212t)). It is observed that the IOs are not initially in phase. As the controller switches at two seconds, the IOs synchronize having a delay time of 0.125 seconds. The command changes at four, six, and eight seconds to delay times of 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 seconds. Following each command, x(t) tracks x(t\u2212t) and it is seen that u(t)\u2212u(t\u2212t) and v(t)\u2212v(t\u2212t) remain close to zero after two seconds. However, as the command changes, it causes larger deviations in the tracking of z- and w-trajectories due to large control input acting on the system. Note that a comparatively large spike appears in the control input at two seconds and subsequently smaller magnitudes of control input are required each time that the command changes. Simulation has been done for other initial conditions and a parameter value of a. It is found that frequency changes with a, but for a low value of a=0.01, u-response has a sharper spike.","The controller Cuses feedback of nonlinear functions of the state variables and has a global synchronization property. A controller using fewer state components and\/or nonlinear feedback functions will be notable for implementation. The complexity and performance of the controller depends on the choice of the output function e.

In this case, in view of the functions gand gin Equation (47), one finds that the center manifold is (\u0169,{tilde over (v)},{tilde over (z)})=(\u0168,{tilde over (V)},{tilde over (Z)})=0. Similar to the arguments used on either the Jacobian linearization or the center manifold theorem, it can be concluded that for small (u(t\u2212t),z(t\u2212t)), the origin of the zero dynamics is exponentially stable (in a local sense), and thereby local synchronization is accomplished.","Simulation results are now presented for the closed-loop system of Equation (5) and Equation (45). The parameter values, command input sequence, and the initial conditions of FIG. (A)-(D) are retained. The feedback gain chosen is p=8. The responses are shown in FIG. (A)-(D) and FIG. (A)-(D). It is observed that synchronization has been accomplished following each change in the phase command signal, but convergence time is larger. The plots of ushow high frequency oscillation at certain instances, but it has not caused any problems. Only a small control magnitude has been used.","Simulation results are obtained for a different value of the parameter a=0.01 and the time scaling factor is set to 100 giving the frequency of oscillation close to one Hz. The closed-loop control system using each of the control laws C, Cand Cand Cis simulated. The command input, the feedback gains, and initial conditions of FIG. (A)-(D) are retained for simulation. Results are presented only for the closed-loop system including the simplest control law C. The responses are shown in FIG. (A)-(D) through FIG. (A)-(D).","It is of interest to discuss the relative merits of the four controllers. As indicated earlier, the first controller has a global stabilization property and for the remaining controllers only local synchronization has been established. It is important to note that only a finite region of stability in the {tilde over (x)}-space exists because the local stability of the closed-loop system including the controllers C, C, and Chas been proven. But it is expected that as the complexity of control law increases, the region of stability enlarges. For this reason, one expects that the control law Chas been proven. But it is expected that as the complexity of control law increases, the region of stability enlarges. For this reason, one expects that the control law Ccan accomplish synchronization only for relatively small perturbations in {tilde over (x)} at the instant when the phase command is given. Of course, the error {tilde over (x)}, and therefore the synchronization of the IOs, depends on the instant of controller switching. Based on the simulation results, it has been found that the controllers Cand Chave fairly large regions of stability and one does not necessarily have to use the controller C, which has the highest degree of complexity among the derived controllers. Unlike the global controller, the controllers C, C, and Cprovide smoother (z,w)-responses. This is due to the fast-varying nonlinear function of large magnitude in the control law C. It may be pointed out that there exists flexibility in the design, and by a proper choice of feedback gains and the reference phase command signals, one can obtain different response characteristics. This flexibility in phase control of IOs is useful in performing desirable maneuvers of the BAUV.","In the derivation of the control laws, it is assumed that the IOs are identical. While for the BAUV application, it is appropriate to have similar parameters, it is pointed out that the design approach is quite general, and it is applicable to nonidentical IOs having different parameters. The design has been presented only for two IOs, but it is straightforward to extend the derivation for the synchronization of any number of IOs.","Advantages and Disadvantages","The IOs have complex nonlinear dynamics. As such, controllers (PID, optimal, lead-lag compensation, etc.) designed using linearized models cannot guarantee global synchronization. One must note that the profile of the control signal will depend on the states of the IOs when the pulse is applied. The derived controllers are based on the input-output feedback linearization theory, and stability and convergence. The designed global controller accomplishes synchronization for all initial conditions. Moreover, design parameters provide flexibility in shaping response characteristics. The controller can be switched on for phase control at any instant since the controller utilizes state variable feedback and one can command the IO to follow a sequence of phase changed when needed for the control of the BAUV. This is especially important if operating fins of the BAUV operate at low frequencies. The control laws are explicit functions of the state variables of the IOs and can be easily implemented.","The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only.
