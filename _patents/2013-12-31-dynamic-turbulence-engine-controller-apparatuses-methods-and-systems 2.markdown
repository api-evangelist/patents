title: Dynamic turbulence engine controller apparatuses, methods and systems
abstract: The DYNAMIC TURBULENCE ENGINE CONTROLLER APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS (“DTEC”) transform weather, terrain, and flight parameter data via DTEC components into turbulence avoidance optimized flight plans. In one implementation, the DTEC comprises a processor and a memory disposed in communication with the processor and storing processor-issuable instructions to receive anticipated flight plan parameter data, obtain terrain data based on the flight plan parameter data, obtain atmospheric data based on the flight plan parameter data, and determine a plurality of four-dimensional grid points based on the flight plan parameter data. The DTEC may then determine a non-dimensional mountain wave amplitude and mountain top wave drag, an upper level non-dimensional gravity wave amplitude, and a buoyant turbulent kinetic energy. The DTEC determines a boundary layer eddy dissipation rate, storm velocity, and eddy dissipation rate from updrafts, maximum updraft speed at grid point equilibrium level and storm divergence while the updraft speed is above the equilibrium level and identify storm top. The DTEC determines storm overshoot and storm drag, Doppler speed, eddy dissipation rate above the storm top, and determine eddy dissipation rate from downdrafts. The DTEC then determines the turbulent kinetic energy for each grid point and identifies an at least one flight plan based on the flight plan parameter data and the determined turbulent kinetic energy.

The entire contents of the aforementioned applications are expressly incorporated by reference herein.","A variety of weather monitoring systems, including ground-based and satellite-based observations, are used to provide weather reports and forecasts.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in . Reference number  is introduced in , etc.","In some embodiments, the DYNAMIC TURBULENCE ENGINE CONTROLLER (\u201cDTEC\u201d) as disclosed herein transforms weather, terrain, and flight parameter data via DTEC components into turbulence avoidance optimized flight plans. In one implementation, the DTEC comprises a processor and a memory disposed in communication with the processor and storing processor-issuable instructions to receive anticipated flight plan parameter data, obtain terrain data based on the flight plan parameter data, obtain atmospheric data based on the flight plan parameter data, and determine a plurality of four-dimensional grid points based on the flight plan parameter data. The DTEC may then determine a non-dimensional mountain wave amplitude and mountain top wave drag, an upper level non-dimensional gravity wave amplitude, and a buoyant turbulent kinetic energy. The DTEC determines a boundary layer eddy dissipation rate, storm velocity, and eddy dissipation rate from updrafts, maximum updraft speed at grid point equilibrium level and storm divergence while the updraft speed is above the equilibrium level and identify storm top. The DTEC determines storm overshoot and storm drag, Doppler speed, eddy dissipation rate above the storm top, and determine eddy dissipation rate from downdrafts. The DTEC then determines the turbulent kinetic energy for each grid point and, as illustrated in , identifies an at least one enhanced flight plan based on the flight plan parameter data and the determined turbulent kinetic energy.","Turbulence forecasting methods may focus on discrete areas of turbulence, such as clear air turbulence (CAT) or thunderstorm regions, and rely primarily on pilot reports (PIREPS) and other subjective\/observational data for determining turbulent airspace regions. The DTEC as disclosed herein utilizes unique predictive components and determinations of turbulence in four-dimensional space-time and utilizes these predictive models to generate a comprehensive forecasting map display and\/or overlay that is not merely the visual combination of disparate turbulence projections, but is a multi-hazard calculated integration of enhanced turbulent regions, providing an accurate, multi-dimensional model of turbulence over a specified spatial\/temporal area.","The term \u201cturbulence\u201d as a haphazard secondary motion caused by the eddies of a fluid system has often been treated as a singular event in casual connotation, caused by passage through an entropic weather system or by proximity to shifting air flow patterns. This definition is commonly perpetuated by many turbulence forecast platforms that focus on a specific type of turbulence, such as CAT, without accounting for additional turbulence factors, nor how multi-hazards conflagrate into not just a series of turbulence events, but an enhanced system which continues to flux. In , wind , thunderstorms , and gravity waves  (the interaction of media, such as the ocean and the atmosphere caused by energy transfer, on which gravity acts as a restoring force) can all be turbulence contributors to a region of three-dimensional space over a specified time. An aircraft  traveling through this region may experience multiple turbulence hazards . A turbulence forecast display that indicates only CAT with gravity wave interference may display a low hazard area into which an aircraft may be moving. Similarly a weather prediction display may also fail to factor in the additional risk of CAT. In one embodiment of the disclosed DTEC, a CAT component producing color-coded terminal display of turbulence hazard over a specified area (where clear may indicate no turbulence, green may indicate low turbulence hazard, yellow may indicate medium turbulence hazard, and red may indicate high turbulence hazard)  may be integrated with a mountain wave forecasting component which produces a similar color-coded terminal display , resulting in an integrated display where the resulting hazard matrix  may not be an overlay of the individual turbulence predictions, but an enhanced turbulence forecast where individual areas of low or no hazard turbulence may now indicated high hazard turbulence . In some embodiments, multiple turbulence overlay displays may be available showing individuated turbulence forecasts without enhancement. In some embodiments of the disclosure, only enhanced turbulence forecast displays may be available. In some embodiments of the disclosure, users may be able to switch between individuated turbulence forecasts and enhanced turbulence forecasts.","In some embodiments of the disclosure, the DTEC  may be available to aircraft , air traffic controllers , flight planning tools and software , third party applications  where turbulence feed incorporation is contributing, and the like.  shows that in some embodiments of the disclosure, PIREPS and sensor data of aircraft in real-time turbulence conditions may send data to the DTEC to be incorporated into the DTEC aggregate data analysis. Similarly in some embodiments of the disclosure, additional\/other sources of input may be weather stations  and satellites  which may provide numerical weather forecast model data  to the DTEC. In one embodiment, an array of sensors both local and remote may be periodically polled by the aircraft itself, directly by the DTEC, and\/or the like. The polled array of sensors may include, for example, sensors for measuring altitude, heading, speed, pitch, temperature, barometric pressure, fuel consumption, fuel remaining for flight, number of passengers, aircraft weight, and\/or the like. In some embodiments of the DTEC, additional\/other sources of input may be topological data which may provide terrain characteristic data  to the DTEC. In some embodiments of the DTEC, the receipt of this input may occur prior to requests to the DTEC for turbulence forecasting. In some embodiments of the DTEC, the receipt of this input may be ongoing during requests to the DTEC for turbulence forecasting. In some embodiments of the DTEC, receipts of input may be both before requests to the DTEC for turbulence forecasting and ongoing during forecasting requests. In some embodiments, an aircraft  may request (near) real-time localized turbulence data , an air traffic control system  may request predictive regional turbulence data as an updating feed  and\/or a (near) real-time regional turbulence data request , a flight-planning tool or software may request predictive turbulence within a flight path region or along a flight path course . In some embodiments, the DTEC may direct such requests through a turbulence integration component, e.g., , where DTEC components such as MWAVE component, INTTURB component, and VVTURB2 component process input into eddy dissipation rate (EDR) values and render them for terminal , standard\/high-definition , and\/or displays of the like.

The DTEC then determines real-time turbulence for the planned route  and compares the predicted turbulence to the real-time turbulence . If the newly determined real-time turbulence does not deviate notably  from the previously predicted\/anticipated turbulence, then the process cycles, e.g., for a certain period (1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, etc.) or for some other measure such as location of one or more aircraft, weather events, and\/or the like. If the newly determined real-time turbulence is a notable deviation or significant difference from the previously predicted turbulence , then the turbulence is updated  and the process continues. Note that the threshold difference or deviation may be set by the DTEC or DTEC user\/subscriber, and in some embodiments may be any numerical change, while in other embodiments may be a change or certain magnitude or percentage.","When the turbulence is updated, the DTEC determines if there is a known or determinable turbulence threshold  for the flight\/aircraft. For example, a commercial passenger aircraft that subscribes to the DTEC may have set a particular turbulence threshold in the profile, reflecting that passenger aircraft may wish to avoid significant turbulence for safety and comfort reasons, while a cargo aircraft may have a much higher threshold and be willing to undertake more turbulence to save time and\/or money. The threshold may also be predicted\/determined based on the airframe and\/or airfoil type, the user, the flight plan, fuel resources, alternative routes, etc. For flights\/aircraft that the turbulence threshold either is not known or is not determinable , the DTEC may have a default (i.e., safety) threshold , and if that default threshold is exceeded , may issue an alert or notification  to the aircraft (and\/or ground control).","If the flight turbulence threshold is known  (i.e., the flight has a subscription or is otherwise registered with the DTEC), the DTEC determines whether the turbulence exceeds the specified threshold , and if so, determines if the flight's route can be adjusted or updated  by the DTEC (e.g., using the flight path component discussed in  and ) to find the optimal path based on the desired turbulence profile\/threshold and various flight parameters, such as fuel reserves, destination, aircraft type, etc. If the DTEC is unable or is not configured to provide an alternative or adjusted flight plan , an alert or notification  is generated\/issued.

The integrated, unified turbulence system provided by the DTEC may be used in flight equipment and\/or ground equipment. The DTEC may provide weather\/aviation decision support (e.g., via graphical displays) and\/or provide alerts\/triggers. Although it is discussed in terms of re-routing in time of increased turbulence, in some embodiments, the DTEC may identify more efficient paths based on real-time updates where there is decreased turbulence over a shorter physical distance, and may update a flight plan accordingly. The DTEC identifies 4D areas for flight hazards, and a user may choose or set their profile based on particular hazards (e.g., a passenger airline would have a different hazard\/turbulence profile than an air freight company, and a large airliner would have a different profile from a small plane or helicopter). Various cost calculations and risk calculations may also be used in determining alerts and\/or flight paths. In some embodiments, real-time feedback may come from plane-mounted instrument sensors and provide updates to predicted turbulence. Such information may be used to refine component configurations for turbulence determination. Although examples were discussed in the context of jet airliners, it is to be understood that the DTEC may be utilized for low-level services, such as helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as high speed and\/or military aircraft, and may even have potential ground applications, especially in mountainous terrain. The DTEC may work with air traffic control, particularly in management of routing. In some embodiments, the DTEC may input directly in avionics systems to guide planes.","Prior to the DTEC, forecasts of turbulence, if even available, were generally qualitative (e.g., light\/heavy), independent of aircraft type, and did not include all sources of turbulence (e.g., they specifically exclude thunderstorms) or interactions of turbulence, thus making them unusable for most practical applications such as flight planning. The integrated turbulence forecast of the DTEC is unique because it dynamically determines the location and level at which each comprehensive turbulence determination is made, based on the meteorological conditions at that point in space and time. In some embodiments, the result is a single, integrated forecast that includes all sources of turbulence, and is produced in quantitative units, such as Eddy Dissipation Rate (EDR), thus making it suitable for practical uses, such as flight planning applications, and allows for categorical flexibility specific to an aircraft.","In some embodiments, the DTEC integrates three DTEC turbulence components, ULTURB, BLTURB, and MWAVE into one component\/program called INTTURB. In some additional or alternative embodiments, the DTEC integrates VVTURB with ULTURB and BLTURB into a component\/program called VVINTTURB. Output from all components may in EDR, an aircraft-independent metric of turbulence intensity. The DTEC may assign an EDR value at each model grid point and at each flight level. Observations of turbulence may also be used for further tuning of the forecast where and when they are available.","Various embodiments of the DTEC are contemplated by this disclosure, with the below exemplary, non-limiting embodiments A1-C84 provided to illustrate aspects of some implementations of embodiments of the DTEC.","A1.

Servers serve their information to requesting \u201cclients.\u201d The term \u201cclient\u201d as used herein refers generally to a computer, program, other device, user and\/or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that facilitates, processes information and requests, and\/or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a \u201cnode.\u201d Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a \u201crouter.\u201d There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs), Pico networks, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Networks (WLANs), etc. For example, the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.","The DTEC controller  may be based on computer systems that may comprise, but are not limited to, components such as: a computer systemization  connected to memory .","A computer systemization  may comprise a clock , central processing unit (\u201cCPU(s)\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor(s)\u201d (these terms are used interchangeable throughout the disclosure unless noted to the contrary)) , a memory  (e.g., a read only memory (ROM) , a random access memory (RAM) , etc.), and\/or an interface bus , and most frequently, although not necessarily, are all interconnected and\/or communicating through a system bus  on one or more (mother)board(s)  having conductive and\/or otherwise transportive circuit pathways through which instructions (e.g., binary encoded signals) may travel to effectuate communications, operations, storage, etc. The computer systemization may be connected to a power source ; e.g., optionally the power source may be internal. Optionally, a cryptographic processor  and\/or transceivers (e.g., ICs)  may be connected to the system bus. In another embodiment, the cryptographic processor and\/or transceivers may be connected as either internal and\/or external peripheral devices  via the interface bus I\/O. In turn, the transceivers may be connected to antenna(s) , thereby effectuating wireless transmission and reception of various communication and\/or sensor protocols; for example the antenna(s) may connect to: a Texas Instruments WiLink WL1283 transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 3.0, FM, global positioning system (GPS) (thereby allowing DTEC controller to determine its location)); Broadcom BCM4329 FKUBG transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, FM, etc.); a Broadcom BCM4750IUB8 receiver chip (e.g., GPS); an Infineon Technologies X-Gold 618-PMB9800 (e.g., providing 2G\/3G HSDPA\/HSUPA communications); and\/or the like.

The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. It should be understood that in alternative embodiments, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests. Often, the processors themselves will incorporate various specialized processing units, such as, but not limited to: integrated system (bus) controllers, memory management control units, floating point units, and even specialized processing sub-units like graphics processing units, digital signal processing units, and\/or the like.

Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the DTEC features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the DTEC system designer\/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or simple mathematical operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the DTEC may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations.

After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the DTEC controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like.

Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the DTEC. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the DTEC as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism.

Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The DTEC database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the DTEC database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the DTEC database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the DTEC database  may be integrated into another component such as the DTEC component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A User table may include fields such as, but not limited to: user_id, ssn, dob, first_name, last_name, age, state, address_firstline, address_secondline, zipcode, devices_list, contact_info, contact_type, alt_contact_info, alt_contact_type, user_equipment, user_plane, user_profile, and\/or the like. An Account table may include fields such as, but not limited to: acct_id, acct_user, acct_history, acct_access, acct_status, acct_subscription, acct_profile, and\/or the like.","A Profile table may include fields such as, but not limited to: prof_id, prof_assets, prof_history, prof_details, profile_aircraft, and\/or the like. A Terrain table may include fields such as, but not limited to: terrain_id, terrain_details, terrain_parameters, terrain_var, and\/or the like. A Resource table may include fields such as, but not limited to: resource_id, resource_location, resource_acct, and\/or the like. An Equipment table may include fields such as, but not limited to: equip_id, equip_location, equip_acct, equip_contact, equip_type, and\/or the like. A Model table may include fields such as, but not limited to: model_id, model_assc, model_feedback, model_param, model_var, and\/or the like. A Weather data table may include fields such as, but not limited to: weather_data_id, weather_source, weather_location, weather_data_type, weather_acct, weather, var, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the weather data table is populated through one or more weather data feeds. A Feedback table may include fields such as, but not limited to: feedback_id, feedback_source, source_location, feedback_time, feedback_acct, and\/or the like.","An Aircraft table may include fields such as, but not limited to: aircraft_id, aircraft_type, aircraft_profile, aircraft_fuel_capacity, aircraft_route, aircraft_use, aircraft_owner, aircraft_location, aircraft_acct, aircraft_flightplan, aircraft_parameters, aircraft_airfoil, aircraft_alerts, and\/or the like. A Flight Plan table may include fields such as, but not limited to: flightplan_id, flightplan_source, flightplan_start_location, flightplan_start_time, flightplan_end_location, flightplan_end_time, flightplan_acct, flightplan_aircraft, flightplan_profile, flightplan_type, flightplan_alerts, flightplan_parameters, and\/or the like. An Airfoil table may include fields such as, but not limited to: airfoil_id, airfoil_source, airfoil_aircraft, airfoil_icing_profile, airfoil_icing_determination, airfoil_profile, airfoil_type, airfoil_pi, airfoil_alerts, airfoil_parameters, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the DTEC database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search DTEC component may treat the combination of the DTEC database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the DTEC. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the DTEC may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The DTEC may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The DTEC database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the DTEC database communicates with the DTEC component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The DTEC component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the DTEC component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the DTEC discussed in the previous figures. As such, the DTEC affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The DTEC component may transform weather data input via DTEC components into real-time and\/or predictive turbulence feeds and displays, and\/or the like and use of the DTEC. In one embodiment, the DTEC component  takes inputs (e.g., weather forecast data, models, terrain, sensor data, and\/or the like) etc., and transforms the inputs via various components (e.g., MWAVE component ; INTTURB component ; VVTURB2 component ; a Tracking component ; a Pathing component ; a Display component ; an Alerting component ; a Planning component ; and\/or the like), into outputs (e.g., predictive flight path turbulence, real-time turbulence data feed, flight path modifications\/optimizations, turbulence alerts, and\/or the like).","The DTEC component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D) HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the DTEC server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The DTEC component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the DTEC component communicates with the DTEC database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The DTEC may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the DTEC node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the DTEC controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.","For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and\/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like. Again, the desired configuration will depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment.","For example, in some implementations, the DTEC controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) socket server via the information server, which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data, e.g., data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication, the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device, parse the received JSON-encoded text data to extract information from the JSON-encoded text data into PHP script variables, and store the data (e.g., client identifying information, etc.) and\/or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language (\u201cSQL\u201d).
