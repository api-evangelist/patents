{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART","AIMS AND SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a national phase application based on PCT\/IT2003\/000743, filed Nov. 17, 2003, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to techniques for monitoring Quality of Services (QoS) in telecommunication networks. The invention was developed with particular attention to its possible application to mobile communication network. However, reference to this particular field of possible application must not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.","With the emergence and development of mobile networks, from GSM to GPRS and, more recently, to UMTS, the variety and the number of voice, data, multimedia services available or emerging in this field is growing both in terms of functional characteristics, and in regard to performance requirements, to meet needs expressed by the user or deriving from an ever more competitive market.","For a provider of mobile services, being able to obtain a qualitative benchmark on its services is increasingly becoming a factor for success and market penetration, as well as for containing \u201cchurn\u201d phenomena, with important repercussions on revenues.","The fundamental needs of the service provider, to achieve qualitative benchmarking, are essentially linked to the ability to:\n\n","All this with the additional requirement of being able to perform the measurements at low cost. The service provider must therefore have available QoS and performance data that are:\n\n","For a user of mobile services, being able to achieve high quality levels during a communication, having objective documentation of the quality and operational levels in relation to the underwritten agreements (SLA), is not just a requirement, but is a guarantee of transparency and an image factor of the service provider which increases his\/her satisfaction and hence his\/her loyalty to the service provider.","The complexity and heterogeneity of the mobile radio network environment (limited capacity of radio resources, mobility, integration with fixed networks, limited dimensions of the screen and keyboard of the terminal, etc.) and of the services offered therein (e.g. localisation, MMS, video streaming, multimedia) make it difficult to obtain an accurate and punctual measurement of the dynamically variable quality levels experienced during a communication. This is also true because, in addition to being referred to reference agreement underwritten with the user, said quality levels depend on an ever more complex management based on differentiated service and traffic classes (conversational, streaming, interactive, background see for instance 3GPP TS 23.107) with dynamic control and differentiated and sophisticated stream management (3GPP TS 23.207), in terms of guaranteed quality (requested) and of priority (RSVP, DiffServ, etc.).","An objective, systematic and punctual evaluation of the quality of service provided, adhering as closely as possible to the quality perceived by the user and which can be used not just by the service provider\/operator, but also by the user him\/herself, increasingly leads to decentralise the measuring and performance monitoring points in the points of access at the ends of the link (user terminal and application servers) and in the user-terminal application interaction (application level or highest possible protocol layer).","Heretofore, the methodologies and techniques in use have fundamentally been based:\n\n","Examining in detail some recent contributions on this subject, the U.S. Pat. No. 6,434,364 describes a communication system that supports mobile test software agents (MTSA). The applicant observes that this system, in addition to being based only on the GSM network, has several limitations linked to measurement types and to measurable parameters. In particular, it is impossible to obtain qualitative parameters of the application session (delays, jitter, losses . . . ), or performance parameters referred to the operating conditions of the session (link throughput, CPU and memory utilisation level, terminal buffer congestion). The system does not provide for quality measurements on the application session, but only performance measurements on the radio channel at the low transport layers. The whole operation of the monitoring system is integrated in the functionalities of the network, i.e. it uses all normal functionalities of mobile radio networks. This entails problems with using the platform in multi-standard environments. Moreover, this system is incapable of adapting to the load conditions of the network and of the terminal.","One can also mention the commercial product QualiPoc of the company SwissQual AG, Zuchwill CH: this is a system that operates only in artificial traffic in which terminal configuration is done manually, loading the monitoring software; it does not allow to configure the measurements made, or to configure measurement procedures. It does not monitor the terminal and\/or network resources in use; the measurements are downloaded locally, with no chance to integrate the system with other monitoring platforms; it is only available for the MMS service.","The object of the present invention is to solve the critical aspects of the solutions identified above.","According to the present invention, said object is achieved thanks to an architecture for monitoring quality of service having the characteristics specifically described in the claims that follow. The invention also pertains to the related network, a corresponding method and a computer product able to be loaded into the memory of at least an electronic computer and comprising portions of software code for implementing the architecture and\/or the method according to the invention when the product is executed on an electronic computer. Reference to an electronic computer is clearly destined to highlight the possibility of implementing the solution according to the invention at a decentralised level.","The currently preferred embodiment of the invention thus allows to obtain an architecture for monitoring Quality of Service (QoS) in a telecommunication network comprising a set of terminals. The terminals of the aforesaid set house measuring agents which can be configured to interface with processes selected among processes for managing the application sessions of said network and processes for measuring the operating conditions of the network itself. Also provided is a management and configuration sub-system comprising a module for scheduling Quality of Service measuring campaigns, capable of involving respective sub-sets of terminals according to a set of characteristics identifying the measuring campaign. The scheduling module is able to configure, for the purposes of the execution of the aforesaid measuring campaigns, the measuring agents housed by the terminals included in said related sub-sets according to said set of identifying characteristics.","Advantageously, an additional subsystem for managing the collection of the measurement data is also provided, preferably comprising a database for storing the measurement data and a processing centre for processing the data itself.","In the currently preferred embodiment, the solution described herein overcomes the critical issues intrinsically linked to the solutions identified above with particular reference to one or more of the following operating aspects:\n\n","The system described herein can be configured in such a way as to assure the functionalities described above in simultaneous and co-ordinated fashion, although a subset of such functionalities can be implemented, without thereby departing from the scope of the invention described herein.","In general, the invention, in addition to allowing an integrated, detailed and accurate vision of the quality levels, can allow both to relate the quality levels to the operating conditions in which said quality levels have been reached, and to correlate quality and performance parameters (e.g. between levels of quality\/power of the radio channel and dropped communications).","The system, which is scaleable and modular, excellently meets the requirements of security and reliability of the measured data, functional and performance transparency (i.e., non intrusive nature) with respect to the terminal and the user and economic transparency with respect to the service to be measured.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Briefly, referring to the (preferred, but not imperative) application to a mobile communication network\u2014according to any standard\u2014at the mobile terminal MT level the following are provided:\n\n","At the level of the management and configuration system, overseeing the measurements (indicated herein as TQMS, with reference to the typical role of the Terminal Quality Measurement Scheduler) are instead present:\n\n","At the subsystem level having the function of managing data collection (Terminal Data Collector Manager or TDCM), are present:\n\n","The dialogue between the various architecture components described (it will be noted that the structure illustrated with reference to the mobile terminal TM is usually reproduced at the level of multiple mobile terminals\u2014and virtually at the level of all the mobile terminals of the network) is assured by the communication agents CA, CA and CA.","The agent CA associated to the management and configuration subsystem TQMS usually performs the role of co-ordination node, although\u2014especially for the exchange of measurement data\u2014direct communication is provided between mobile terminals TM and the manager module TDCM (and, possibly, between mobile terminal and mobile terminal). In particular, in the diagram of  the data lines and the signalling lines are respectively represented with solid lines and with dashed lines.","The user is able to co-ordinate with the TQMS subsystem to obtain joint simultaneous measurements.","Although it is not explicitly indicated in the figure, the measurement functionalities implemented on the terminal are also usable on the application servers. The TQMS and TDCM subsystems are thus able to interact with the agents located on the servers.","The architecture described herein defines and implements a system for monitoring the end-to-end QoS at the application layer in which the elementary measurements are effected by means of agents located directly on the TM terminal (and on the application server), in a manner that is transparent to the user.","The present description is centred on wireless networks\/services, simply because it is the most stringent environment in terms of requirements and resource availability, especially at the terminal level (in terms of CPU and memories) and at the link level, where channel throughput is limited by radio access. The system can easily be extended to services (fundamentally, data) which employ wireline networks or to services on mixed wireless and wireline links, with terminals, be they cellular phones or PCs, connected both in wireless and wireline fashion to the network.","The basic system can be developed to cover diversified uses of considerable interest both for the service provider and for the user.","The service provider can use the system to perform systematic measurements, to activate focused or troubleshooting measurements or measurements for verifying SLAs stipulated with the user. The system enables the service provider, above all by means of simultaneous measurements on the same samples of calls, to conduct both segmented analyses of contributors to degradation on the link (to ascribe the causes, for example, to the terminal rather than to the application server or to the network), and analyses of correlation between homogeneous parameters measured between different protocol levels (e.g. between transport level and application level).","If the user is enabled and authorised, (s)he is able to activate the measurements and to display, directly on the screen of the terminal of the management and configuration subsystem TQMS (through a GUI graphic interface) the quality levels obtained for the communication, or to conduct SLA verifications by a highlighted comparison with stipulated levels.","If the degradation contribution is located in the terminal (or in the application server), local diagnostic investigations are possible with ad hoc measurements which can be obtained through the system itself. All these measurements, together with others on the radio channel and location on the terminal, allow optimisation\/reconfiguration operations, especially on the radio access system, or short\/medium term cell re-planning.","The measurements can be performed both in real traffic on the communications activated by the user, and in artificial traffic driven from the network when the cell phone is in the idle state or the mobile radio terminal is not already performing the same type of service to be activated for the measurement. Measurements in real traffic can be activated also by the user for the ongoing communication. All measurements are configurable (among possible ones) by the network (remotely through the scheduler) or by the user (on the terminal).","The measuring agent MEA on the terminal TM interacts with the application process for carrying out the service, as well as with the processes for measuring the mobile radio channel used, and with the operating processes within the terminal itself. In this way, the following measurements can be performed:\n\n","The agents on the terminal, in addition to performing measurement interactions, also perform processing and storing functions (MEM agent) and communication functions (CA agent). These activities are performing minimising their impact both on the resources of the mobile terminal and of the network, in order to meet the non-intrusion requirement of the platform described herein.","Preferably, for the management\/configuration of the services provided by the agents and communication between agents, Jade technology is used (Jade is JAVA Agent Development Framework, as described for example in \u201cA communication Protocol for agent on hand held devices\u201d AAMAS Jul. 15-16, 2002, Bologna, Italy), which allows the development of distributed peer-to-peer application developed in JAVA and compliant with the FIPA standard. The technology, usable both in fixed networks (JAVA J2EE and J2SE) and mobile networks (Personal Java and J2ME) and the related features (white pages, yellow pages) are used in agent management.","This choice is not binding for the operation of the platform described herein because Jade could be replaced by other agent communication middleware. Communication between the agents can use different transport techniques selectable according to the operating conditions noted (for example if it is not possible to set up a TCP\/IP link on GPRS because it is unavailable, the platform can decide to use transport on SMS). Preferably, for the exchange of messages between agents, the TCP\/IP or UDP\/IP transports will be used. This capability can enable interactions between the modules of the platform even if, though electromagnetic coverage is present, the user is unable to access the service (for example in the case of UMTS network a user may not be able to access a high bit rate video streaming services and, simultaneously, the agents on the terminal can, selecting an appropriate transport, send and receive data to and from the other modules of the platform).","The scheduling and overall management policies of distributed Jade agents (anomaly detection and management, configurations and reconfigurations, measurement scheduling, etc. . . . ) are implemented by a central unit developed according to the work-flow paradigm. The general architecture of the platform described herein highlights the functional modules and the interactions between them. Hereinafter reference shall be made to an \u201cabstract\u201d entity called User which can be either a human operator or an external program, able to interact with the platform.","The functionalities of the function modules identified above are described in greater detail below.","Scheduler (TQMS)","The measurement campaign scheduler designated as S is tasked with defining measurement campaigns. For this purpose the user interacts with the scheduler (through the interface A) defining the characteristics of the measurement campaign (the reference universe).","This operation comprises multiple steps:\n\n","To identify the involved terminals and activate the measurements the scheduler identifies potential terminals involved in the defined measurement campaign, proceeding to activate them. During the initial step, mechanism preferably intervenes to optimise the final transmission of the information to the TDCM in \u201ca single shot\u201d: a method which can be used to optimise communications is DB sharing, where the scheduler stores the information about the involved terminals, their status and the measurement profiles loaded on the terminal.","The operation of identifying the terminals and activating the measurements comprises the following steps:\n\n","To identify the end of a measurement campaign, the scheduler S identifies for instance the expiration of a time-out). When this event takes place, for each terminal that was involved in the campaign, the scheduler S:\n\n","The A interface represents the communication element towards the other external systems for the configuration and synchronisation of the measurement campaign, in particular to detect configuration commands from the exterior and communicate the updated information on the status of the campaign.","The interface preferably has available the functionalities to:\n\n","The main functionalities of the communication agent CA associated with the terminals TM are:\n\n","The main functionalities of the subsystem constituting the MEM agent are:\n\n","The subsystems constituting the measuring agent MEA carries out the measurements and therefore must be configured, on each occasion, according to the requirements of the campaign. To maximise flexibility, this portion of code can be completely or partially transferred, from the scheduler, to the terminal.","The main functionalities of this subsystem, once it is configured, are:\n\n","etc. . . .","Note that the peripheral measurement agents MEA, to conduct service measurements, must detect events of the service of interest (e.g. opening a session, requesting and receiving data, etc.).","In alternative embodiments, the peripheral agents MEA and MEM can also be located on the application servers (servers involved in the provision of the service) for the various types of services.","They can also be located on a certain number of terminals having different performance characteristics and\/or they can interact directly with each other to implement functions to be analysed (e.g. the terminals which are within the same cell could co-ordinate with each other to transmit the measurements to the collection centre, avoiding the simultaneous use of the radio resources).","Preferably, each peripheral agent interfaces with:\n\n","Typically, a peripheral agent of the platform interacts with other processes through API interfaces (Application Programming Interface) which can be:\n\n","The API interfaces for interfacing with the applications (for example for interfacing with other environments such as JavaPhone, JavaCard etc.) are preferably accessible by the peripheral agents through a general API which uncouples the development of the peripheral agents from the operating and development environment.","The functionalities of the TDCM subsystem result from those of its constituting elements, as described below.","In particular, the collecting centre CCC:\n\n","The latter, when preparing the start of the measurement campaign, receives the configuration commands from the scheduler S. In this way the manager TDCM knows:\n\n","During the processing step, the centre EC reads the context data of each measurement arriving from the collection centre in order to:\n\n","At the conclusion of a measurement campaign the TDCM manager subsystem applies a criteria to accept or reject the received measurements (for example those received after the logic conclusion of the campaign and pertaining to events started before the conclusion, or those that are still incomplete, . . . ), processing the correct records with the procedures prescribed by the campaign itself and storing them in the database DB.","Moreover, the manager TDCM stores the results and the reports on a database that is logically different from the one used to store the elementary measurements because time persistence may be different.","The types of interaction between the modules of the platform described above can be classified according to at least two different criteria:\n\n","For the interactions that pertain to the processes of the platform described herein, two other types of interactions should also be specified:\n\n","In this regard, the functional diagram of  highlights the following types of interaction:\n\n","A more detailed description follows of the fundamental operative steps for the use of the platform described herein which involve the normal functionalities of the various elements constituting the platform itself; specifically, a description will be provided of all possible cases of interaction between the platform elements referred to the design and development specifications of a practical implementation by the Applicant.","The description of the steps refers to the diagram of  and applies to a context of measurement campaign performed by the platform itself through the interaction with an abstract entity called user. The user may be a person, an external process, an organisational entity or another element. It is evident that when the subject changes the implementations of the interface will change, but not the semantic aspects of the inter-relationships.","In the example reproduced herein, it is assumed that the platform is interested in the following operations:\n\n","The diagram of  exemplifies some possible cases of use of the described platform.","The QoS measurements thus obtained can be used by a mobile radio operator for different goals, for purposes of improvement in relation to internal processes and support systems, e.g. use of the system can be focused on the performance of the terminal under load to optimise its configuration or on communication quality or to perform troubleshooting analysis, and the user can be given the ability to control the functional and operational processes of the service of interest to him, e.g. to verify stipulated SLAs.","The platform usage scenarios specifically identified herein relate firstly to Quality of Service monitoring, designated  in the diagram of . This set of functions typically comprises:\n\n","The platform can also be used for troubleshooting functions, i.e. to identify possible causes of QoS degradation within the terminal.","This set of function, globally designated as , essentially comprises diagnostics and malfunction notification (terminal side, application server side) and real time configuration and management of resources (also terminal side and application server side).","The diagram of  expressly indicates that said functions can be decided both by the operator (block ) and by the user (block ).","In the diagram of , the blocks  and  indicate the possible application of the platform to diagnose the internal resources and functionalities of the terminal and the optimised configuration and management of resources (e.g. in real time) in a Quality of Service (QoS) perspective.","Briefly, the platform architecture described herein provides the ability to:\n\n","The platform described herein is suitable to monitor QoS also in advanced multi-standard environments (for example UMTS\/W-LAN) in which a multi-mode intelligent terminal is able simultaneously to use multiple access systems for transporting information (communication formed by multiple parallel links on multiple radio systems).","The platform described herein for monitoring end-to-end QoS for services supported by mobile radio terminals can also be used by means of an ad-hoc development of the APIs (Application Program Interface) interfacing with the operating and development environment to fixed networks (LAN, MAN and WAN) and to wireless networks (W-LAN). Moreover, the platform can operate in multi-standard environments on multi-mode terminals.","In the currently preferred embodiment, the solution described herein provides a platform for monitoring QoS (both in real traffic and in artificial traffic) that is applicable to all services, to all mobile radio networks (GSM\/GPRS\/UMTS\/EDGE) and to all mobile radio terminals (characterised by different operating environments, performance and interfaces): the architecture is based on measuring agents located on the mobile terminals, able to interface, with appropriate APIs, with the processes for managing the application session, measuring radio reception conditions, status and operating condition (load, terminal location, etc.) and to dialogue with other measuring or management agents. These agents can be remotely and flexibly managed on the terminals according to measurement scheduling (they can be loaded, activated, configured dynamically on a predetermined set of mobile radio terminals).","They are also able:\n\n","Through this architecture it is possible to carry out conventional operations (on the user terminal), such as:\n\n","Naturally, without altering the principle of the invention, the construction details and the embodiments may vary widely from what is described and illustrated herein, without thereby departing from the scope of the present invention, as defined in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS","p":["The invention shall now be described, purely by way of non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
