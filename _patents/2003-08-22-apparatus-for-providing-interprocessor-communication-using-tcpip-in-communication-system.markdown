No.2002-55171, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for providing inter-processor communication (IPC) between processors and systems in a communication system and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for providing inter-processor communication using transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP).","2. Related Art","An exemplary communication system uses an RS-422 or asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) method for inter-processor communication (IPC). The reason why the RS-422 or asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) method is used is because they are verified and stable methods. RS-422 is an Electronics Industry Association (EIA) serial line standard.","For example, a code division multiple access (CDMA) second generation (2G) system performs message communications between processors and systems using a RS-422 method based on communication inter networking (CIN), and a third generation (3G) system performs cell communication using an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch and a multiplexer\/demultiplexer (MUX\/DEMUX). Further, a physical medium such as E1\/T1 or an optical fiber is used between a base station controller (BSC) and a base station transceiver system (BTS). Message communication between processors or boards uses a bus structure. This method can be used in a system having a backboard structure and can be readily implemented. Further, the method enables relatively faster communication and its control operation is simple.","However, as described above, the exemplary communication inter networking (CIN) (2G) or asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) (3G) methods need separate control boards for the interprocessor communication (IPC). The second generation (2G) system needs high speed interconnect processor assembly (HIPA) and high capacity IPC node assembly (HINA) boards for interprocessor communication (IPC) control, and the third generation (3G) system should include asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch boards being ATM Switch and Fabric Board Assembly (ASFA) boards, and ATM Cell MUX\/DEMUX Assembly (ACMA) boards for a multiplexer\/demultiplexer (MUX\/DEMUX) added to each of the predetermined number of processor boards. In these structures, flexibility and expandability of the system are degraded, and there are difficulties at the time of performing an interface with an external device. Because these high-priced boards are needed, a product price is increased, thereby degrading market competitiveness. Where a partial bus structure is used, a design of a backboard is complicated and many signals should be routed.","On the other hand, an exemplary communication method between high-speed processors or systems is configured using the bus structure or asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) method. Where the bus structure is used, because the number of signal lines between two communication nodes is increased, a design of hardware (H\/W) is complicated, a system is weakened by external noise, and the probability of error occurrence is higher. Moreover, when communication between buses is performed, a board and a processor and device for separate bus control are needed because an arbiter for occupying a corresponding bus is needed. When the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) method is used, a high-priced asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch and a high-priced multiplexer\/demultiplexer (MUX\/DEMUX) device are needed. A period of time needed for development becomes relatively longer. Also, the exemplary method is not appropriate for a compact communication system.","Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and the present invention provides an apparatus and method for providing interprocessor communication (IPC), which can reduce difficulties at the time of performing an external interface and increase flexibility and expandability of a system.","The present invention provides an apparatus and method for providing interprocessor communication (IPC) in a communication system, which can improve market competitiveness of an IPC-related product according to its cost-effective configuration.","The present invention provides an apparatus for providing interprocessor communication (IPC) using transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) in a communication system, comprising: an Ethernet interface module for providing an interface between an Ethernet device driver and an interprocessor communication (IPC) module, determining a type of a received message, transmitting the received message to a message process module if the type of the received message is non-frame data, and queuing the received message in a corresponding mailbox corresponding to frame data if the type of the received message is the frame data;

In particular, communication between boards uses the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP), so that a backboard can be simply designed. On the other hand, with the development of hardware and software technologies, the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) enables high-speed and high-reliability communication in local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) environments. For this reason, the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) is widely used and rapidly advanced in the networks.","Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described.

As shown in , components of the present invention are as follows.","First, 1xEV-DO software (S\/W) and a 1xEV-DO channel card are mounted in the IP-based EV-DO network, and the IP-based EV-DO network uses an Internet protocol (IP) interface between an access network controller (ANC) and the IP-based EV-DO system.

The 1xEV-DO software is mounted in access network controllers (ANCs) , and the Internet protocol (IP) interface is used between the access network controller (ANC) and the IP-based EV-DO system. The software includes 1xEV-DO instructions. Moreover, the access network controllers (ANCs)  are based on a standard InterOperability Specification (IOS).","In this case, interprocessor communication (IPC) is changed to the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP).

The access network controller (ANC)  performs call processing for 1xEV-DO, a selector function, an radio link protocol (RLP), a packet control function (PCF), etc. Further, the access network controller (ANC)  performs an operation\/maintenance function through a connection with the wide area switching module (WSM) , a mobility management function through a connection with the data location register (DLR) , and a terminal authentication function for 1xEV-DO through a connection with a server  known as an access network-authorization, authentication and accounting (AN-AAA) server .","The access network controller (ANC)  is functionally configured by various types of boards.

The DIAMETER protocol is an enhancement to the RADIUS protocol.","The access network-authorization, authentication and accounting (AN-AAA) server  provides system management, an operator interface, and a graphic user interface (GUI) for maintenance. The access network-authorization, authentication and accounting (AN-AAA) server  uses the remote authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS) protocol to identify a terminal's authorization, and manages a subscriber database for identifying a corresponding subscriber's authorization and other profile information. The access network-authorization, authentication and accounting (AN-AAA) server  is based on A12 protocol of IOS4. x.","The wide area switching module (WSM)  is connected to the access network controller (ANC)  and the fast Ethernet to output various operator matching and operation messages associated with the access network controller (ANC)  and IP-based EV-DO.

The wide area switching module (WSM)  performs Program Loading Data (PLD) generation and increase\/decrease and system loading to manage a configuration of the IP-based EVDO system when capacity of the wide area switching module (WSM)  is extended.","In the network configured as described above, the interprocessor communication (IPC) using the transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) in accordance with the present invention is as follows.  is a view illustrating a configuration of an interprocessor communication (IPC) module, in accordance with the principles of the present invention.  is a view illustrating interprocessor communication (IPC) based on transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP), in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Referring to , the interprocessor communication (IPC) in accordance with the principles of the present invention will be described.","The interprocessor communication (IPC) module of  is a communication sub-system in the IP-based EV-DO system, and software for transmitting and receiving a message between application tasks in a node or different nodes based on the Ethernet. The interprocessor communication (IPC) module includes application tasks (application programs) , a common application programming interface (API) module , a message process module , an Ethernet Interface module , and Ethernet device driver , etc.","The common application programming interface (API) module  is a module for performing the interprocessor communication (IPC) and an interface with higher-order application programs, and provides interfaces for non-frame data communication, frame data communication, mailbox open\/close, interprocessor communication (IPC) buffer allocation and return, a interprocessor communication (IPC) control function, etc. The common application programming interface (API) module  is arranged on a highest-order layer in the interprocessor communication (IPC), has an interface with the application programs above the module , and has an interface with the message process module  and the Ethernet Interface module  below the module .","The message process module  arranged below the common application programming interface (API) module  reads a mailbox field of non-frame data incoming through the Ethernet interface module  and then queues received messages in a corresponding mailbox. At this time, the message process module  determines the number of messages queued in the mailbox, deletes oldest messages from the mailbox and queues latest messages in the mailbox if the number of messages is greater than a predetermined number of messages. The message process module  queues a message and then determines whether a task of waiting for a message incoming into the mailbox exists. If the task exists, the message process module  wakes up a corresponding task. Otherwise, the message process module  performs a corresponding process.","In the interprocessor communication (IPC), the message process module  has an interface with the common application programming interface (API) module  above the module , and has an interface with the Ethernet interface module  below the module .","The Ethernet interface module  arranged below the message process module  in the interprocessor communication (IPC) provides an interface between the Ethernet device driver  and the interprocessor communication (IPC) module when an application program transmits a message to another node or receives a message from another node. The Ethernet interface module  determines a type of the message received. If the type of the received message is non-frame data, the Ethernet interface module  transfers the received message to the message process module . On the other hand, if the type of the received message is frame data, the Ethernet interface module  queues the received message in a specific mailbox corresponding to the frame data. The Ethernet interface module  belongs to a lowest-order layer in the interprocessor communication (IPC), and has an interface with the common application programming interface (API) module  and the message process module  above the module , and has an interface with an Ethernet device driver below the module .","The interprocessor communication (IPC) module performs data communication with other nodes using three basic interfaces to be described.","When data is transmitted to the Ethernet in the interprocessor communication (IPC), a function of \u201cip_sigsend (unsigned int ip_addr1, unsigned int ip_addr2, int peer_port1, int peer_port2, MSGPtr_t tx_ptr, unsigned char *tx_data, unsigned long pkt_size, int flag, unsigned char drup)\u201d is used. If an interprocessor communication (IPC) send application programming interface (API) is called so that an application task (application program)  transmits the data, the interprocessor communication (IPC) module inputs an inputted destination address as a parameter, calls \u201cipc_get_ip ( )\u201d, and obtains a corresponding target value of \u201cip_address\u201d. If a structure pointer of \u201cmsgptr\u201d, a flag indicating a free message and a data type of \u201csig_jype\u201d are inputted and \u201cip_sigsend\u201d is called, the data is externally transmitted through the Ethernet device driver .","When a packet is transmitted to the Ethernet in the interprocessor communication (IPC), a function of \u201cip_pktsend (unsigned int ip_addr1, int peer_port1, MSGPtr_t tx_ptr, unsigned char *tx_data, unsigned long pkt_size, int flag)\u201d is used. If the interprocessor communication (IPC) send application programming interface (API) is called so that an application task (application program)  transmits the packet, the interprocessor communication (IPC) module identifies a data type from a traffic type and calls the above-described \u201cip_sigsend ( )\u201d if the data type is not frame data. The interprocessor communication (IPC) module inputs an inputted destination address as a parameter if the data type is frame data, calls \u201cipc_get_ip ( )\u201d, and obtains a corresponding target value of \u201cip_address\u201d. If a structure pointer of \u201cmsgptr\u201d, a flag indicating a free message and a data type of \u201csig_type\u201d are inputted and \u201cip_pktsend\u201d is called, the packet is externally transmitted through the Ethernet device driver.","When the Ethernet transmits data to the interprocessor communication (IPC) module, a function of \u201cip_pktrcv (NodeAddress_t node_addr, MSGPtr_t msgp, void *bufp, unsigned long pktlen, Traffic_t tr)\u201d is used. When the Ethernet device driver  receives data, the function is called to transfer the data to the interprocessor communication (IPC) and a body part of the function is provided from the interprocessor communication (IPC) module. If the function of \u201cip_pktrcv\u201d is called, the interprocessor communication (IPC) module determines, from a traffic type of \u201ctraffic_t\u201d, whether the received data is frame data or non-frame data. If the received data is the non-frame data, the data is queued in a structure provided from the interprocessor communication (IPC) module so that an interprocessor communication (IPC) receiver task can process the data. On the other hand, if the received data is the frame data, the received data is queued in a specific mailbox in the interprocessor communication (IPC) module.","In this embodiment, the interprocessor communication (IPC) module can have a data processing rate of a maximum 100 megabits per second (Mbps) using the Ethernet device driver . Further, when a node or a processor board is added, the node or the processor board can be added and connected to the network without separate equipment.","Hereinafter, a description will be given of Internet protocol (IP) table management for communication between processors or systems.","First, the case where a processor obtains its own Internet protocol (IP) address and an Internet protocol (IP) address of a software-loading server (wide area switching module ) at the time of initially setting the processor, will be described. A dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server daemon is driven in the loading server. If an Internet protocol (IP) address assignment request is received from a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) client, the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server daemon selects an Internet protocol (IP) address from a corresponding Internet protocol (IP) pool and assigns the selected Internet protocol (IP) address to the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) client. At this time, the loading server notifies the client of its own address. When the processor is initially set, the processor drives the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) client and transmits a loading request message using the Internet protocol (IP) address of the server if the processor receives the Internet protocol (IP) address of the server and its own Internet protocol (IP) address assigned from the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server. Thus, the server transmits software appropriate for the processor in response to the loading request message. At this time, an Internet protocol (IP) table having Internet protocol (IP) address information of all processors contained in the system is simultaneously transmitted.","A corresponding processor receives the software and runs the received software to be operated. At this time, the processor stores the Internet protocol (IP) table having Internet protocol (IP) address information of all processors contained in the system, searches for an Internet protocol (IP) address in the Internet protocol (IP) table when a message is transmitted from corresponding software, and transmits the message to a corresponding processor of the searched Internet protocol (IP) address.","On the other hand, where a processor is added or deleted, the server identifies the fact that a processor is added or deleted, and transmits, to all processors, an updated Internet protocol (IP) table having updated Internet protocol (IP) address information based on the addition or deletion in the form of a message. A processor receiving the updated Internet protocol (IP) table updates its own Internet protocol (IP) table.","As described above, the present invention provides an apparatus and method for providing inter-processor communication (IPC), which can ensure flexibility of a system at the time of performing an external interface, improve market competitiveness of an IPC-related product according to its cost-effective configuration, and implement interprocessor communication (IPC) having various transmission rates according to media, by implementing the interprocessor communication (IPC) in an Ethernet environment using transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP).","While the present invention has been illustrated by the description of embodiments thereof, and while the embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail.
