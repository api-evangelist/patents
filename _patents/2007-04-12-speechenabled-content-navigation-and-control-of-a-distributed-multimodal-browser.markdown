Field of the Invention","The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, systems, and products for speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser.","2. Description of Related Art","User interaction with applications running on small devices through a keyboard or stylus has become increasingly limited and cumbersome as those devices have become increasingly smaller. In particular, small handheld devices like mobile phones and PDAs serve many functions and contain sufficient processing power to support user interaction through multimodal access, that is, by interaction in non-voice modes as well as voice mode. Devices which support multimodal access combine multiple user input modes or channels in the same interaction allowing a user to interact with the applications on the device simultaneously through multiple input modes or channels. The methods of input include speech recognition, keyboard, touch screen, stylus, mouse, handwriting, and others. Multimodal input often makes using a small device easier.","Multimodal applications are often formed by sets of markup documents served up by web servers for display on multimodal browsers. A \u2018multimodal browser,\u2019 as the term is used in this specification, generally means a web browser capable of receiving multimodal input and interacting with users with multimodal output, where modes of the multimodal input and output include at least a speech mode. A multimodal browser typically includes a user agent for each mode of user interaction provided by the multimodal browser. Each user agent provides the functionality for interacting with a user in a particular modality. For example, a graphical user agent of a multimodal browser may provide the functionality for interacting with a user through a graphical user interface (\u2018GUI\u2019) by processing user input through GUI elements and displaying output on the GUI. A voice user agent of a multimodal browser may provide the functionality for interacting with a user through a voice user interface by recognizing speech input and synthesizing speech output. Because the visual mode of user interaction has historically been the dominate mode of user interaction, the graphical user agent of a multimodal browser typically coordinates the user interaction among all the user agent providing a multimodal experience to a user.","Multimodal browsers typically render web pages written in XHTML+Voice (\u2018X+V\u2019). X+V provides a markup language that enables users to interact with an multimodal application often running on a server through spoken dialog in addition to traditional means of input such as keyboard strokes and mouse pointer action. Visual markup tells a multimodal browser what the user interface is look like and how it is to behave when the user types, points, or clicks. Similarly, voice markup tells a multimodal browser what to do when the user speaks to it. The multimodal browser processes visual markup with a graphical user agent and processes voice markup with a voice user agent. X+V adds spoken interaction to standard web content by integrating XHTML (eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language) and speech recognition vocabularies supported by VoiceXML. For visual markup, X+V includes the XHTML standard. For voice markup, X+V includes a subset of VoiceXML. For synchronizing the VoiceXML elements with corresponding visual interface elements, X+V uses events. XHTML includes voice modules that support speech synthesis, speech dialogs, command and control, and speech grammars. Voice handlers can be attached to XHTML elements and respond to specific events. Voice interaction features are integrated with XHTML and can consequently be used directly within XHTML content.","In addition to X+V, multimodal applications also may be implemented with Speech Application Tags (\u2018SALT\u2019). SALT is a markup language developed by the Salt Forum. Both X+V and SALT are markup languages for creating applications that use voice input\/speech recognition and voice output\/speech synthesis. Both SALT applications and X+V applications use underlying speech recognition and synthesis technologies or \u2018speech engines\u2019 to do the work of recognizing and generating human speech. As markup languages, both X+V and SALT provide markup-based programming environments for using speech engines in an application's user interface. Both languages have language elements, markup tags, that specify what the speech-recognition engine should listen for and what the synthesis engine should \u2018say.\u2019 Whereas X+V combines XHTML, VoiceXML, and the XML Events standard to create multimodal applications, SALT does not provide a standard visual markup language or eventing model. Rather, it is a low-level set of tags for specifying voice interaction that can be embedded into other environments. In addition to X+V and SALT, multimodal applications may be implemented in Java with a Java speech framework, in C++, for example, and with other technologies and in other environments as well.","Multimodal browsers may be categorized generally as local browsers or distributed browsers. A local multimodal browser is a multimodal browser for which all user agents operate on the same computer. For example, in a local multimodal browser having a graphical user agent and a voice user agent, the functionality for processing both visual markup and voice markup of a multimodal application is provided by same computing device. A distributed multimodal browser is a multimodal browser for which the user agents operate on at least two computers. For example, in a distributed multimodal browser having a graphical user agent and a voice user agent, the functionality for processing both visual markup and voice markup of a multimodal application is provided by two separate computing devices. Distributed multimodal browsers are often utilized on small multimodal devices because such devices typically do not have the computer resources needed to run both a graphical user agent and a visual user agent simultaneously.","As mentioned above, a multimodal browser typically provides speech-enabled user interaction. Such speech enablement is typically organized into two categories. The first category is speech-enabling the content of a multimodal application. Speech-enabling the content of a multimodal application may include, for example, synthesizing the text of an X+V page for playback through a speaker of a multimodal device. The second category is speech-enabling content navigation and control of a multimodal browser. Speech-enabling content navigation and control of a multimodal browser may include, for example, allowing a user to navigate the links of an X+V page using voice commands. Speech-enabling content navigation and control of a multimodal browser may also include, for example, allowing a user to open a new window or tab in a multimodal browser using voice commands.","Local multimodal browsers are routinely able to perform both categories of speech-enablement because the voice user agent is available locally to provide voice services such as speech recognition and speech synthesis to the graphical user agent. The ability to perform both categories of speech-enablement is not, however, provided by current distributed multimodal browsers. Distributed multimodal browsers may speech-enable the content of a multimodal application using standard protocols developed for the operation of a distributed multimodal browser across a network such as, for example, the protocols specified by the Open Mobile Alliance and by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Distributed multimodal browsers, however, typically cannot perform speech-enabled content navigation and control because the information needed to speech-enable the interface provided by a graphical user agent is not known, a priori, by a voice user agent. Because current protocols and distributed multimodal browsers do not address this aspect of speech-enablement, readers will appreciate that room for improvement exists to speech-enable content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser.","Methods, systems, and products are disclosed for speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser, the distributed multimodal browser providing an execution environment for a multimodal application, the distributed multimodal browser including a graphical user agent and a voice user agent operatively coupled to the graphical user agent, the graphical user agent operating on a multimodal device supporting multiple modes of user interaction including a voice mode and one or more non-voice modes, the voice user agent operating on a voice server, including: transmitting, by the graphical user agent, a link message to the voice user agent, the link message specifying voice commands that control the distributed multimodal browser, the link message also specifying an event corresponding to each voice command; receiving, by the graphical user agent, a voice utterance from a user, the voice utterance specifying a particular voice command; transmitting, by the graphical user agent, the voice utterance to the voice user agent for speech recognition by the voice user agent; receiving, by the graphical user agent, an event message from the voice user agent, the event message specifying a particular event corresponding to the particular voice command specified by the voice utterance; and controlling, by the graphical user agent, the distributed multimodal browser in dependence upon the particular event.","The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.","Exemplary methods, apparatus, and products for speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser according to embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with .  sets forth a network diagram illustrating an exemplary system for speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser () according to embodiments of the present invention. Speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser () in this example is implemented with a multimodal application () operating on a multimodal device (). The multimodal application () of  is composed of at least one X+V page () that specifies instructions for rendering content to a user through various modes of user interaction. The multimodal device () supports multiple modes of interaction including a voice mode and one or more non-voice modes of user interaction with the multimodal application (). The voice mode is represented here with audio output of voice prompts and responses () from the multimodal devices and audio input of speech for recognition () from a user (). Non-voice modes are represented by input\/output devices such as keyboards and display screens on the multimodal devices ().","The distributed multimodal browser () in the example of  is a set of software modules that together provide an execution environment for the multimodal application (). The distributed multimodal browser () of  includes a graphical user agent () that provides functionality for interaction between the user () and the multimodal application () through a visual mode. The distributed multimodal browser () of  also includes a voice user agent () that provides functionality for interaction between the user (), the multimodal application (), and the graphical user agent () through a voice mode. In the example of , the graphical user agent () operates on the multimodal device (), and the voice user agent () operates on a voice server (). Although the user agents operate on separate computers, the graphical agent () is operatively coupled to the voice user agent (). The operative coupling may be implemented with an application programming interface (\u2018API\u2019), a voice service module, or a VoIP connection as explained more detail below.","The distributed multimodal browser () in the example of  is improved for speech-enabled content navigation and control according to embodiments of the present invention. The distributed multimodal browser () of  provides speech-enabled content navigation and control according to embodiments of the present invention as follows: The graphical user agent () transmits a link message to the voice user agent (). The link message specifies voice commands that control the distributed multimodal browser () and specifies an event corresponding to each voice command. The graphical user agent () receives a voice utterance from a user that specifies a particular voice command. The graphical user agent () transmits the voice utterance to the voice user agent () for speech recognition by the voice user agent (). The graphical user agent () then receives an event message from the voice user agent () that specifies a particular event corresponding to the particular voice command specified by the voice utterance. In dependence upon the particular event specified in the event message, the graphical user agent () controls the distributed multimodal browser () such as, for example, by navigating content of the multimodal application () or by administering a graphical user interface provided by the graphical user agent ().","Readers will note that the voice user agent () receives a voice utterance and a link message from the graphical user agent () and, in return, provides the graphical user agent () with an event message specifying a particular event. According to embodiments of the present invention, the distributed multimodal browser () of  also provides speech-enabled content navigation and control as follows: The voice user agent () receives the link message from the graphical user agent (). The voice user agent () receives the voice utterance from the graphical user agent (). The voice user agent () determines the particular event in dependence upon the link message and the voice utterance. The voice user agent () transmits the event message to the graphical user agent (). The event message specifies the particular event specified by the voice utterance.","To support the voice user agent () in providing voice services to the graphical user agent () and the multimodal application (), the voice user agent () of  includes a VoiceXML interpreter (). The VoiceXML interpreter () is a software module of computer program instructions that accepts voice dialog instructions and other data from a multimodal application, typically in the form of a VoiceXML <form> element, and accepts link messages, default voice dialogs, and other data from a graphical user agent. The voice dialog instructions include one or more grammars, data input elements, event handlers, and so on, that advise the VoiceXML interpreter () how to administer voice input from a user and voice prompts and responses to be presented to a user. The link messages typically include a VoiceXML <link> element that specifies one or more voice commands along with events corresponding to each voice command using <link> element attributes, grammars, and semantic interpretation scripts that advise the VoiceXML interpreter () which events to activate based on a particular voice utterance specifying a voice command. The VoiceXML interpreter () administers such dialogs and link elements by processing the dialog and link instructions sequentially in accordance with a VoiceXML Form Interpretation Algorithm (\u2018FIA\u2019). Because the VoiceXML interpreter () typically only processes VoiceXML <link> elements within a FIA and a VoiceXML interpreter () typically only initiates a FIA when the VoiceXML interpreter () receives a voice dialog, the graphical user agent () may provide the default VoiceXML dialog to the VoiceXML interpreter () to activate a FIA for processing <link> elements in link messages.","As mentioned above, VoiceXML dialogs and link elements typically include grammars. A grammar communicates to the ASR engine () the words and sequences of words that currently may be recognized. In the example of , a grammar includes grammar rules that advise an ASR engine or a voice interpreter which words and word sequences presently can be recognized. Grammars for use according to embodiments of the present invention may be expressed in any format supported by an ASR engine, including, for example, the Java Speech Grammar Format (\u2018JSGF\u2019), the format of the W3C Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (\u2018SRGS\u2019), the Augmented Backus-Naur Format (\u2018ABNF\u2019) from the IETF's RFC2234, in the form of a stochastic grammar as described in the W3C's Stochastic Language Models (N-Gram) Specification, and in other grammar formats as may occur to those of skill in the art. Grammars typically operate as elements of dialogs, such as, for example, a VoiceXML <menu> or an X+V<form>. A grammar's definition may be expressed in-line in a dialog. Or the grammar may be implemented externally in a separate grammar document and referenced from with a dialog with a URI. Here is an example of a grammar expressed in JSFG:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<grammar scope=\u201cdialog\u201d ><![CDATA["]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003#JSGF V1.0;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003grammar command;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<command> = [remind me to] call | phone |"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003telephone <name> <when>;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<name> = bob | martha | joe | pete | chris | john | artoush | tom;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<when> = today | this afternoon | tomorrow | next week;"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003]]>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/grammar>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In this example, the elements named <command>, <name>, and <when> are rules of the grammar. Rules are a combination of a rulename and an expansion of a rule that advises an ASR engine or a VoiceXML interpreter which words presently can be recognized. In the example above, rule expansions includes conjunction and disjunction, and the vertical bars \u2018|\u2019 mean \u2018or.\u2019 An ASR engine or a VoiceXML interpreter processes the rules in sequence, first <command>, then <name>, then <when>. The <command> rule accepts for recognition \u2018call\u2019 or \u2018phone\u2019 or \u2018telephone\u2019 plus, that is, in conjunction with, whatever is returned from the <name> rule and the <when> rule. The <name> rule accepts \u2018bob\u2019 or \u2018martha\u2019 or \u2018joe\u2019 or \u2018pete\u2019 or \u2018chris\u2019 or \u2018john\u2019 or \u2018artoush\u2019 or \u2018tom,\u2019 and the <when> rule accepts \u2018today\u2019 or \u2018this afternoon\u2019 or \u2018tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018next week.\u2019 The command grammar as a whole matches utterances like these, for example:\n\n","A multimodal device on which a multimodal application operates is an automated device, that is, automated computing machinery or a computer program running on an automated device, that is capable of accepting from users more than one mode of input, keyboard, mouse, stylus, and so on, including speech input\u2014and also providing more than one mode of output such as, graphic, speech, and so on. A multimodal device is generally capable of accepting speech input from a user, digitizing the speech, and providing digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. A multimodal device may be implemented, for example, as a voice-enabled browser on a laptop, a voice browser on a telephone handset, an online game implemented with Java on a personal computer, and with other combinations of hardware and software as may occur to those of skill in the art. Because multimodal applications may be implemented in markup languages (X+V, SALT), object-oriented languages (Java, C++), procedural languages (the C programming language), and in other kinds of computer languages as may occur to those of skill in the art, a multimodal application may refer to any software application, server-oriented or client-oriented, thin client or thick client, that administers more than one mode of input and more than one mode of output, typically including visual and speech modes.","The system of  includes several example multimodal devices:\n\n","Each of the example multimodal devices () in the system of  includes a microphone, an audio amplifier, a digital-to-analog converter, and a multimodal application capable of accepting from a user () speech for recognition (), digitizing the speech, and providing the digitized speech to a speech engine for recognition. The speech may be digitized according to industry standard codecs, including but not limited to those used for Distributed Speech Recognition as such. Methods for \u2018COding\/DECoding\u2019 speech are referred to as \u2018codecs.\u2019 The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (\u2018ETSI\u2019) provides several codecs for encoding speech for use in DSR, including, for example, the ETSI ES 201 108 DSR Front-end Codec, the ETSI ES 202 050 Advanced DSR Front-end Codec, the ETSI ES 202 211 Extended DSR Front-end Codec, and the ETSI ES 202 212 Extended Advanced DSR Front-end Codec. In standards such as RFC3557 entitled\n\n","As mentioned, a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention is capable of providing speech to a speech engine for recognition. The voice user agent () of  includes a speech engine (). The speech engine () of  is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and generating or \u2018synthesizing\u2019 human speech. The speech engine () implements speech recognition by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a ASR engine, and the speech engine carries out speech synthesis by use of a further module referred to in this specification as a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine.","The voice user agent () of  also includes a voice server application (). The voice server application () of  is a set of computer program instructions capable of operating a voice server in a system that is configured for speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser according to embodiments of the present invention. The voice server application () of  provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and VoiceXML processing from the graphical user agent () for the graphical user agent itself or on behalf of the multimodal application (). The voice server application () returns to the graphical user agent () speech recognition and VoiceXML processing results, including text representing recognized speech, text for use as variable values in dialogs, and text as string representations of scripts for semantic interpretation, and so on. The voice server application () typically acts as an intermediary between the graphical user agent () and the other components of the voice user agent () by accepting requests from the graphical user agent () encapsulated in messages and returning to the graphical user agent () messages into which voice service responses are packaged.","As shown in , the speech engine (), the VoiceXML interpreter (), and voice server application () of the voice user agent () is installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device, across a data communications network () in a voice server (). A multimodal device that contains only a graphical user agent and does not contain its own voice user agent is said to implement a \u2018thin multimodal client\u2019 or simply a \u2018thin client,\u2019 because the thin multimodal client itself contains only a relatively thin layer of multimodal application software that obtains speech recognition and speech synthesis services from a voice user agent operating on a voice server located remotely across a network from the thin client. In contrast, a multimodal device that contains all the user agents of a multimodal browser is said to implement a \u2018thick multimodal client\u2019 or \u2018thick client,\u2019 because the thick multimodal client device itself contains all the functionality needed to carry out speech recognition and speech synthesis\u2014through API calls to speech recognition and speech synthesis modules in the multimodal device itself with no need to send requests for voice services across a network from a remote voice server.","A multimodal application () in this example provides speech for recognition and text for speech synthesis to the speech engine () of the voice user agent () through the VoiceXML interpreter () of the voice user agent (). The VoiceXML interpreter () of  is installed remotely with respect to the multimodal device, across a data communications network () in a voice user agent operating on a voice server (). The multimodal application () provides dialog instructions, VoiceXML <form> elements, grammars, input elements, event handlers, and so on, through the API to the VoiceXML interpreter of the voice user agent (), and the VoiceXML interpreter administers the speech engine on behalf of the multimodal application.","The VoiceXML interpreter () provides grammars, speech for recognition, and text prompts for speech synthesis to the speech engine (), and the VoiceXML interpreter () returns to the multimodal application speech engine () output in the form of recognized speech, semantic interpretation results, and digitized speech for voice prompts. In a thin client architecture, the VoiceXML interpreter () is located remotely from the multimodal client device in a voice server (). An API for the VoiceXML interpreter, however, is still implemented in the multimodal device (), with the API modified to communicate voice dialog instructions, speech for recognition, semantic interpretation results, and text and voice prompts to and from the VoiceXML interpreter on the voice server ().","The use of these four example multimodal devices () is for explanation only, not for limitation of the invention. Any automated computing machinery capable of accepting speech from a user, providing the speech digitized to a remote voice user agent, which includes an ASR engine and a VoiceXML interpreter, and receiving and playing speech prompts and responses from the voice user agent may be improved to function as a multimodal device according to embodiments of the present invention.","The system of  also includes a voice server (), which is connected to data communications network () through wireline connection (). The voice server () is a computer that runs a voice user agent to provide voice services to other user agents of a distributed multimodal browser (). The voice user agent () of  that operates on the voice server () includes a speech engine () that provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and returning text representing recognized speech. Voice server () also provides speech synthesis, text to speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) conversion, for voice prompts and voice responses () to user input in multimodal applications such as, for example, X+V applications, SALT applications, or Java voice applications.","The system of  includes a data communications network () that connects the multimodal devices () and the voice server () for data communications. A data communications network for speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser according to embodiments of the present invention is a data communications data communications network composed of a plurality of computers that function as data communications routers connected for data communications with packet switching protocols. Such a data communications network may be implemented with optical connections, wireline connections, or with wireless connections. Such a data communications network may include intranets, internets, local area data communications networks (\u2018LANs\u2019), and wide area data communications networks (\u2018WANs\u2019). Such a data communications network may implement, for example:\n\n","The system of  also includes a web server () connected for data communications through wireline connection () to network () and therefore to the multimodal devices (). The web server () may be any server that provides to client devices X+V markup documents () that compose multimodal applications. The web server () typically provides such markup documents via a data communications protocol, HTTP, HDTP, WAP, or the like. That is, although the term \u2018web\u2019 is used to described the web server generally in this specification, there is no limitation of data communications between multimodal devices and the web server to HTTP alone. A multimodal application in a multimodal device then, upon receiving from the web sever () an X+V markup document as part of a multimodal application, may execute speech elements by use of a VoiceXML interpreter () and speech engine () of the voice user agent () located remotely from the multimodal device in a voice server ().","The arrangement of the multimodal devices (), the web server (), the voice server (), and the data communications network () making up the exemplary system illustrated in  are for explanation, not for limitation. Data processing systems useful for speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser according to various embodiments of the present invention may include additional servers, routers, other devices, and peer-to-peer architectures, not shown in , as will occur to those of skill in the art. Data communications networks in such data processing systems may support many data communications protocols in addition to those noted above. Various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware platforms in addition to those illustrated in .","Speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser according to embodiments of the present invention in a thin client architecture may be implemented with one or more voice servers, which are computers, that is, automated computing machinery, that provide speech recognition, speech synthesis, and other voice services. For further explanation, therefore,  sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising an example of a computer useful as a voice server () in speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser according to embodiments of the present invention. The voice server () of  includes at least one computer processor () or \u2018CPU\u2019 as well as random access memory () (\u2018RAM\u2019) which is connected through a high speed memory bus () and bus adapter () to processor () and to other components of the voice server ().","Stored in RAM () is voice user agent (), which is a set of modules of computer program instructions capable of providing functionality for interaction between a user, a multimodal application, and a graphical user agent through a voice mode. The voice user agent () includes a voice server application (), a module of computer program instructions capable of operating a voice server in a system that is configured for speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser according to embodiments of the present invention. The voice server application () of  provides voice recognition services for multimodal devices by accepting requests for speech recognition and VoiceXML processing from the graphical user agent for the graphical user agent itself or on behalf of a multimodal application. The voice server application () returns to the graphical user agent speech recognition and VoiceXML processing results, including text representing recognized speech, text for use as variable values in dialogs, and text as string representations of scripts for semantic interpretation, and so on. The voice server application () typically acts as an intermediary between the graphical user agent and the other components of the voice user agent () by accepting requests from the graphical user agent encapsulated in messages and returning to the graphical user agent messages into which voice service responses are packaged.","As an intermediary, the voice server application () provides text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) conversion for voice prompts and voice responses to user input in multimodal applications such as, for example, X+V applications, SALT applications, or Java Speech applications. Voice server application () also provides speech-enabled content navigation and control of the multimodal browser by accepting link messages and voice utterances that specify voice commands and events from a graphical user agent and returning particular events, each event corresponding to a voice command, to the graphical user agent for controlling the distributed multimodal browser. Voice server application () may be implemented as a web server, implemented in Java, C++, or another language, that supports speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser according embodiments of the present invention.","The voice user agent () in this example includes a speech engine (). The speech engine is a functional module, typically a software module, although it may include specialized hardware also, that does the work of recognizing and synthesizing human speech. The speech engine () includes an automated speech recognition (\u2018ASR\u2019) engine () for speech recognition and a text-to-speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) engine () for generating speech. The speech engine () also includes a grammar () created by a VoiceXML interpreter () in dependence upon predictive texts for a predictive text event. The speech engine () also includes a lexicon () and a language-specific acoustic model (). The language-specific acoustic model () is a data structure, a table or database, for example, that associates Speech Feature Vectors with phonemes representing, to the extent that it is practically feasible to do so, all pronunciations of all the words in a human language. The lexicon () is an association of words in text form with phonemes representing pronunciations of each word; the lexicon effectively identifies words that are capable of recognition by an ASR engine. Also stored in RAM () is a Text To Speech (\u2018TTS\u2019) Engine (), a module of computer program instructions that accepts text as input and returns the same text in the form of digitally encoded speech, for use in providing speech as prompts for and responses to users of multimodal systems.","The voice server application () in this example is configured to receive, from a multimodal device located remotely across a network from the voice server, digitized speech for recognition from a user and pass the speech along to the ASR engine () for recognition. ASR engine () is a module of computer program instructions, also stored in RAM in this example. In carrying out speech-enabled content navigation and control of a distributed multimodal browser, the ASR engine () receives speech for recognition in the form of at least one digitized word and uses frequency components of the digitized word to derive a Speech Feature Vector (\u2018SFV\u2019). An SFV may be defined, for example, by the first twelve or thirteen Fourier or frequency domain components of a sample of digitized speech. The ASR engine can use the SFV to infer phonemes for the word from the language-specific acoustic model (). The ASR engine then uses the phonemes to find the word in the lexicon ().","In the example of , the voice user agent () also includes a VoiceXML interpreter (). The voice server application () passes speech along to the ASR engine () for recognition through a VoiceXML interpreter ()). The VoiceXML interpreter () is a software module of computer program instructions that accepts voice dialog instructions and other data from a multimodal application, typically in the form of a VoiceXML <form> element, and accepts link messages, default voice dialogs, and other data from a graphical user agent.
