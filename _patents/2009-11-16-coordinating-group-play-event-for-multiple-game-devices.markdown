No. 12\/112,389 filed Apr. 30, 2008, entitled COORDINATING GROUP PLAY EVENT FOR MULTIPLE GAME DEVICES, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to wagering games, gaming machines, networked gaming systems and methods, in particular to wagering games, gaming machines, networked gaming systems and methods having group play feature games.","2. Description of the Related Art","In the prior art, various types of gaming machines have been developed with different features to captivate and maintain player interest. In general, a gaming machine allows a player to play a game in exchange for a wager. Depending on the outcome of the game, the player may be entitled to an award which is paid to the player by the gaming machine, normally in the form of currency or game credits. Gaming machines may include flashing displays, lighted displays, or sound effects to capture a player's interest in a gaming device.","Another important feature of maintaining player interest in a gaming machine includes providing the player with many opportunities to win awards, such as cash or prizes. For example, in some slot machines, the display windows show more than one adjacent symbol on each reel, thereby allowing for multiple-line betting.","Some gaming machine games today include one or more progressive prize awards. In some configurations, the progressive prize may have a small probability of a player winning it; thus making it possible to have a larger progressive prize. In other game configurations, the progressive prize may be a small amount; thus allowing the player to win the progressive prize more frequently. In most typical game configurations, the player wins the progressive prize as a result of a specific game outcome within the primary or main game.","Feature games of various types have been employed to reward players above the amounts normally awarded on a standard game pay schedule. Generally, such feature games are triggered by predetermined events such as one or more appearances of certain combinations of indicia in a primary game. In order to stimulate interest, feature games are typically set to occur at a gaming machine on a statistical cycle based upon the number of primary game plays. To further stimulate excitement during feature game play, some feature games allow for group play of the feature game, that is, simultaneous play of a game common to more than one gaming machine in which multiple players either compete for a feature award or awards or a share of a common award. A common problem with these types of games is that the individual players often have different playing styles and habits, including how much each typically wagers and how fast they play. This can lead to an unfair advantage in cases where the group play feature game prize structure may favor those who have contributed the most to the potential award by wagering more, wagering more often, or both.","While gaming machines including group play feature games have been successful, there remains a need for group play feature games that provide all participating players with enhanced excitement and an increased opportunity of winning.","Briefly, and in general terms, various embodiments are directed to a system for managing gaming devices in a network environment during a normal play mode and a group-play bonus feature. This system includes a group of gaming machines connected to each other over a network in a peer-to-peer environment. In one embodiment, the gaming machines are instead connected through a network controller. Each gaming machine may include an associated control program that maintains an eligibility score during normal play. The eligibility score indicates if a gaming machine is eligibility to participate in the group-play bonus feature. During the normal play mode, each gaming machine sends its eligibility score to all other gaming machines in the group of gaming machines and continuously updates the eligibility score to each gaming machine. If a triggering event is detected on one gaming machine during normal play, the triggered gaming machine sends a message to all eligible gaming machines and coordinates the start of the group-play bonus feature. Each gaming machine participating in the group-play bonus feature sends intermediate results during the group-play bonus feature to the eligible or participating gaming machines, and each gaming machine participating in the group-play bonus feature sends final results from the group-play bonus feature to the eligible gaming machines. Further, each participating gaming machine determines the amount of an award for the group-play bonus feature based on the final results from all participating gaming machines.","Various methods in a networked system to provide group play features for respective end users of a plurality of game machines are also provided. The gaming machines may be connected together through a peer-to-peer environment or through a network controller or other device. In one method, an eligibility score is maintained by each gaming machine, and the eligibility score is based on a wager amount and a rate of play for the player at the gaming machine. Also, the eligibility score indicates eligibility to participate in the group-play bonus feature. During normal play, the eligibility score of each gaming machine is sent to all other gaming machines in the group of gaming machines. In one embodiment, the eligibility score is continuously updated by the gaming machines.","The group-play bonus feature is initiated when a triggering event is detected by one or more gaming machine. The triggered gaming machine sends a message to all eligible gaming machines and coordinates the start of the group-play bonus feature. Intermediate results during the group-play bonus feature are provided by the eligible gaming machines to all other eligible gaming machines. At the conclusion of the group-play bonus feature, final results from the group-play feature are sent from each eligible gaming machine to all other eligible gaming machines in the group. Each gaming machine apportions a bonus award from a bonus pool associated with the group-play bonus feature to each player. In one embodiment, the bonus pool for the group-play bonus feature is funded may be funded by the triggered gaming machine.","During normal play of the gaming machines, a percentage of each wager is contributed to one or more bonus pools. In one embodiment, the one or more bonus pools are maintained by each gaming machine. However, the one or more bonus pools may also be maintained by a network controller through which the group of gaming machines are connected together. Still further, certain bonus pools may be maintained by the gaming machines and certain bonus pools may be maintained by the network controller.","In one embodiment, the eligibility score may be maintained by an associated control program of the gaming machines. The eligibility score may represent the amount of an award available to a player if the group-play bonus feature is triggered. However, the eligibility score may be a Boolean value indicating if the gaming machine is eligible to participate in the group-play bonus feature or not eligible to participate in the group-play bonus feature. The eligibility score may be displayed to the player on the gaming machine in real time on the main display or a secondary display of the gaming machine.","During the group-play bonus feature, each eligible or participating gaming machine may provide all other eligible or participating gaming machines with intermediate results. These intermediate results may also be displayed to the player or other casino patrons and employees to generate excitement for the group-play bonus feature. At the end of the group-play bonus feature, the bonus award issued to the players may be apportioned to the eligible or participating gaming machines based on the final results of each gaming machine. Further, each eligible gaming machine may determine the bonus award by comparing its final result with the final results of all other participating gaming machines.","Each gaming machine may maintain an expected value of the bonus pool associated with the group-play feature on each gaming machine based on the eligibility score of all networked gaming machines. The expected value of the bonus pool is the value of the total payout expected if the bonus pool is triggered. Each gaming machine or network controller may update the expected value periodically or in real time.","In one embodiment, the method of managing the group-play bonus feature may include creating or generating a unique sequence ID when the group-play bonus feature is initiated. The unique sequence ID is used by the network and gaming machines to coordinate messages sent between eligible gaming machines during the group-play bonus feature.","Other features and advantages of the claimed invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate by way of example, the features of the claimed invention.","Various embodiments are directed to a game, gaming machine, gaming networks and method for playing a game, wherein the game includes a group play feature game. The embodiments are illustrated and described herein, by way of example only, and not by way of limitation. Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like or corresponding parts throughout the drawings, and more particularly to , there are shown illustrative examples of games, gaming machines, gaming networks and methods for playing a game in accordance with various aspects of the invention.","An example game in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention is shown in . Referring to , game  is implemented using five spinning reels -. Each of 20 pay line patterns (all not shown) passes through one indicium on each of the five reels. For example, a pay line  extends horizontally through the top row of each of the five reels -. The number of pay lines and their patterns are by way of example only and may vary. The player selects the number of played pay lines and the number of credits or coins wagered on each line using touch screen controls or gaming device control buttons. CREDITS meter  provide the player with information about the amount paid by the last game played and the total number of credits available for play. BET meter  displays the size of the currently selected wager. The player may collect the balance of his credits by pressing a COLLECT button (not shown).","The player initiates game play by pressing a SPIN button (not shown). In some embodiments, the player may simultaneously select all pay lines at the maximum number of coins or credits allowed per line by pressing a MAX BET button (not shown). Various controls\/buttons (see , ) on gaming machine  () or touch screen buttons may be used to perform the actions described here without deviating from the scope of the invention. Reels - are made to spin and stop in predetermined stop positions. A determination is made whether the stop positions of the reels represents a winning game outcome.","Referring to , in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the player may view pay table displays , , , ,  and  on the primary game display by way of a GAME INFO  () or similar button. In alternate embodiments, pay table displays , , , ,  and  may be presented on a second video or printed display attached to the gaming device (i.e. display  or \u201cpay glass\u201d , ). A winning combination, for example, could be three or more symbols adjacent to one another on an active pay line. For each winning combination, the game device awards the player the award in the pay table, adjusted as necessary based on the number of credits wagered on the pay line on which the win occurred. For example, four \u201cBlazing Seven\u201d symbols  adjacent to one another from left-to-right on an active pay line might pay 100 times the player's wager.","In some embodiments, various primary game outcomes may be utilized to trigger the play of a feature game, including, but not limited to, awarding feature play when certain symbols appear on a pay line, when certain symbols are scattered, when no symbols of a certain type appear, when a certain winning combination occurs or, regardless of the visible symbols, at random or fixed intervals. Pay table display  of  displays rules  related to feature game wagering.","As shown in the bonus betting rules , the availability of the feature game may be restricted based on the size of the wager or a percentage of each wager, in this case 20 credits out of each 60 credits wagered, may be explicitly allocated to the funding of the feature games. In one or more embodiments, each gaming machine contributes the feature percentage of each wager to one or more award pools maintained by the individual gaming machine. Each gaming machine may be part of a collection of two or more gaming machines connected to each other either through a network controller or in a peer-to-peer environment. In some embodiments with a network controller, the gaming machine communicates each wager amount to the network controller, which contributes a percentage of the wager to one or more award pools maintained by the network controller. In additional embodiments, one or more award pools may be maintained by the individual gaming machines with one or more additional pools maintained by the network controller.","As shown, the example game provides two feature games, a CashWheel Bonus, local to the individual player, and a Tournament Round, which is a group play feature game. In the example of , three scattered WHEEL symbols on reels ,  and  may trigger the CashWheel feature.  depicts a screen shot  of the CashWheel feature.","As each gaming machine potentially participating in the group play feature is played, its associated control program maintains an eligibility score (ES). This score reflects the player's style of play and is based on bet amount and rate of play. Other factors that may affect the eligibility score include, but are not limited to gaming machine tilts, money on the credit meter, the current state of play, player's club status, and combinations thereof. The eligibility score is not only an indication of eligibility to participate in a group-play bonus, but also provides a basis to apportion a bonus award. In one embodiment, the eligibility score may be, in its simplest form, a Boolean value indicating eligible or not eligible.","As an example, one possible formula for determining an eligibility score could be as follows. The ES should be set to zero whenever: 1) the credit meter drops to zero, 2) the player is involved in a group-play bonus, and 3) a specific length of time has elapsed since the end of the last game, for example, 10 seconds, although any length of time can be set by the system before resetting the ES to zero. When the gaming machine is eligible, the ES should be a measurement of the rate with which the player is betting. In one embodiment, whenever the player makes a bet, the ES may be set to:\n\n(B+(ES\u00b7(L\u2212t)))\/L\n","In the above formula, B equals the amount of the bet, ES equals the ES immediately before the bet was placed, and L equals the expected length of eligibility. For example, L is typically about 15 seconds, which is the length of an average spin plus a 10 second grace period. Further, t equals the time since the start of the previous spin, but does not include any time spent in a bonus game or during a tilt.","In some embodiments, the eligibility score may decay at either a fixed rate or a variable rate based on factors such as game state, reel spin roll-up time, tilts, reel spin duration, or other lengthy feature game play, for example, play of the CashWheel feature. In one embodiment, the gaming machine will display a representation of the current eligibility score. For example, the display might show a monetary value that the player is currently eligible to win should a bonus occur now. Pay table display  on  displays a description of Tournament Prize Meter  which indicates the maximum amount  the player is eligible to win in the event a tournament round is triggered by one of the participating gaming machines. In the example of , Tournament Prize Meter  indicates the player is currently eligible to win as much as $90 in a group play tournament.","Pay table display  of  further displays rules  related to the triggering of a Tournament Round. Also,  depicts pay table display  that displays rules  relating to the triggering of a Tournament Round when only one player or gaming machine participates in the Tournament Round or group-play bonus feature. An example screen shot of the Tournament Round  is shown in . As shown, the player's score  is displayed along with the leader's score  to enhance excitement during the Tournament Round.","In one embodiment, when a bonus triggering event occurs and the gaming machine begins a new series of messages with the other gaming machines or network controller, a unique sequence ID is generated to coordinate, organize, and synchronize the subsequent message traffic between the network controller and all connected gaming machines. This sequence ID may be a timestamp, an alphanumeric or other such value, or a combination thereof generated by the network controller or by the initiating gaming machine. This unique sequence ID is included in each message and may be used by the network controller and the connected gaming machines to resolve issues such as multiple or simultaneous bonus triggers, power fail recovery, communication failure recovery, or any other anomalous condition. In a typical embodiment, should a gaming machine lose power during a series of messages; upon recovery, the sequence ID is used to determine whether or not the recovered gaming machine is synchronized with the other connected gaming machines. Corrective action can then be taken including, but not limited to, the recovered gaming machine abandoning the interrupted series of messages or the recovered gaming machine completing the actions of an interrupted bonus.","In one or more embodiments, each gaming machine communicates its current eligibility score to all other gaming machines connected to the network and continually updates this data. Based on the eligibility scores of all the gaming machines connected to the network, each gaming machine maintains a value of the expected total payout should the bonus be triggered at the current time. This is the current expected value (EV) of the bonus feature. Each gaming machine maintains multiple bonus pools, and each bonus pool corresponds with a range of expected values. Essentially, the gaming machines connected to the network use the eligibility scores from all connected gaming machines to determine which bonus pool(s) will be used for a group-play bonus feature. In one embodiment, the group-play bonus feature does not have a set pool.","When a player places a wager, the gaming machine determines which bonus pool to use for the upcoming game based on the current expected value. The gaming machine calculates the probability of a bonus trigger using the following formula:\n\n=(Return % of bonus*Bet)\/(Pool Limit\u2212Pool Value)\n","In this above equation, P equals the probability of a bonus triggering event occurring. The \u201cReturn % of bonus\u201d variable is the average return of the bonus game and the \u201cBet\u201d variable is the current bet amount on the gaming machine. Further, the \u201cPool Limit\u201d variable is the maximum value the bonus pool may have and the \u201cPool Value\u201d variable is the current value of the bonus pool.","Based on the probability of triggering the bonus feature, the gaming machine may randomly initiate a bonus triggering event for all eligible gaming machines connected to the network. The triggering gaming machine deducts the expected value from the bonus pool. No one knows which machine triggered the feature. In some embodiments, each gaming machine averages its trigger frequency by incorporating average awards previously generated on the given machine. When a machine triggers and funds the bonus, that machine has a reduced chance of triggering again at that particular bonus level (for a while), but the other machines in the group are unaffected. Since no one knows which machine triggered the bonus and exactly how the other machines have been played or their results over time, no one can effectively predict the next trigger. This provides a novel way of providing \u201cmystery\u201d feature triggers in a group play environment.","Feature triggering events may also occur from other methods such as random selection independent of the game outcome, contribution amounts reaching specific levels, messages received from an external controller, a predefined number of games played, a predefined amount wagered, or other such methods and combinations of the above.","A triggering gaming machine or the network controller sends a message to each eligible gaming machine to coordinate the start of the group play feature. Each participating gaming machine periodically sends messages to the other participating gaming machines or the network controller with intermediate results during the course of the group play feature. These intermediate results may be used by the other participating gaming machines or the network controller to update connected displays for viewing by players, other casino patrons, and casino personnel to enhance the excitement of the game. Each participating gaming machine sends a message to the other participating gaming machines or the network controller with final results from the group play feature.","Each connected gaming machine that participated in the group play feature determines how well it performed relative to the other gaming machines, based on the final results. The gaming machines that had the best results from the group play feature may award the player with a feature award amount.","In one embodiment, there are a number of gaming machines connected to each other to form a peer-to-peer network. As casino patrons play at the networked gaming machines, portions of each wager are contributed to one or more bonus pools. During normal play on the gaming machines, each gaming machine maintains an eligibility score based on the casino patron's play and informs all other gaming machines connected to the network. When a gaming machine detects that a bonus triggering event has occurred, the triggering gaming machine sends a message to the other gaming machines connected to the network indicating that the bonus triggering event occurred, and then sends another message that the group play feature was triggered. The triggering gaming machine and all non-triggering gaming machines all send a message to the network that each gaming machine is ready to start the group play feature. The triggering gaming machine then sends another message or signal to each eligible gaming machine to begin the group-play bonus feature. After a synchronized start, each eligible or participating gaming machine begins the group-play bonus feature and intermediately sends results over the network to all other gaming machines. At the completion of the group-play bonus feature, each gaming machines sends a message that the group-play bonus feature has been completed and then sends its final result to all of the participating gaming machines. All eligible gaming machines send a message to the network that the group-play bonus feature is complete and terminates the current messaging series. Finally, each gaming machine awards its player with an appropriate bonus amount or other award.","In accordance with one or more embodiments,  illustrates a gaming machine  including cabinet housing , primary game display  upon which a primary game and feature game may be displayed, top box  which may display multiple progressives that may be won during play of the primary or feature game, player-activated buttons , player tracking panel , bill\/voucher acceptor  and one or more speakers .

Cabinet housing  houses a processor, circuitry, and software (not shown) for receiving signals from the player-activated buttons , operating the games, and transmitting signals to the respective displays and speakers. Any shaped cabinet may be implemented with any embodiment of gaming machine  so long as it provides access to a player for playing a game. For example, cabinet  may comprise a slant-top, bar-top, or table-top style cabinet. The operation of gaming machine  is described more fully below.","The plurality of player-activated buttons  may be used for various functions such as, but not limited to, selecting a wager denomination, selecting a game to be played, selecting a wager amount per game, initiating a game, or cashing out money from gaming machine . Buttons  function as input mechanisms and may include mechanical buttons, electromechanical buttons or touch screen buttons. Optionally, a handle  may be rotated by a player to initiate a game.","In other embodiments, buttons  may be replaced with various other input mechanisms known in the art such as, but not limited to, a touch screen system, touch pad, track ball, mouse, switches, toggle switches, or other input means used to accept player input. For example, one input means is a universal button module as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/106,212, entitled \u201cUniversal Button Module,\u201d filed on Apr. 14, 2005, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. Generally, the universal button module provides a dynamic button system adaptable for use with various games and capable of adjusting to gaming systems having frequent game changes. More particularly, the universal button module may be used in connection with playing a game on a gaming machine and may be used for such functions as selecting the number of credits to bet per hand. In other embodiments, a virtual button deck may be used to provide similar capabilities. An example of a virtual button deck is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/938,203, entitled, \u201cGame Related Systems, Methods, and Articles That Combine Virtual and Physical Elements,\u201d filed on Nov. 9, 2007, hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.","Cabinet housing  may optionally include top box  which contains \u201ctop glass\u201d  comprising advertising or payout information related to the game or games available on gaming machine . Player tracking panel  includes player tracking card reader  and player tracking display . Voucher printer  may be integrated into player tracking panel  or installed elsewhere in cabinet housing  or top box .","Game display  presents a game of chance wherein a player receives one or more outcomes from a set of potential outcomes. For example, one such game of chance is a video slot machine game. In other aspects of the invention, gaming machine  may present a video or mechanical reel slot machine, a video keno game, a lottery game, a bingo game, a Class II bingo game, a roulette game, a craps game, a blackjack game, a mechanical or video representation of a wheel game or the like.","Mechanical or video\/mechanical embodiments may include game displays such as mechanical reels, wheels, or dice as required to present the game to the player. In video\/mechanical or pure video embodiments, game display  is, typically, a CRT or a flat-panel display in the form of, but not limited to, liquid crystal, plasma, electroluminescent, vacuum fluorescent, field emission, or any other type of panel display known or developed in the art. Game display  may be mounted in either a \u201cportrait\u201d or \u201clandscape\u201d orientation and be of standard or \u201cwidescreen\u201d dimensions (i.e., a ratio of one dimension to another of at least 16\u00d79).

The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and\/or commercially available components, devices, and circuitry into a conventional and\/or commercially available gaming machine cabinet, examples of which are described above.","When a player has inserted a form of currency such as, for example and without limitation, paper currency, coins or tokens, cashless tickets or vouchers, electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor, a signal is sent by way of I\/O board  to processor board  which, in turn, assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals , for example, to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments, the random generator may be physically separate from gaming machine ; for example, it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter, the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally, processor board  under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset, processor board , under control of the game program and by way of I\/O Board , may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.","Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes, including feature game outcomes, are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are, in response to instructions from processor board , provided to the player in the form of coins, credits or currency via I\/O board  and a pay mechanism, which may be one or more of a credit meter, a coin hopper, a voucher printer, an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.","In various embodiments, the game program is stored in a memory device (not shown) connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard.

As shown, GMU  may connect to card reader  through bus  and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board  to GMU  where the information may be translated into a network protocol, such as SS, for transmission to a server, such as a player tracking server, where information about a player's playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.","PID  includes an integrated circuit board, PID processor, and memory which includes an operating system, such as Windows CE, a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input\/output (I\/O) drivers for respective devices which connect to PID , such as player interface devices , and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID  or playable on a connected network server and PID  is operable as the player interface. PID  connects to card reader  through bus , display  through video decoder  and bus , such as an LVDS or VGA bus.","As part of its programming, the PID processor executes coding to drive display  and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display  and video decoder  to PID , such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID  either on the player's initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys  connect through bus  to PID  and operate together with display  to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID , in turn, communicates over the CMS\/SMS network through Ethernet switch  and busses ,  and with respective servers, such as a player tracking server.","Player interface devices  are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit (GMU) processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system (such as a commercially available Bally SDS\/SMS) and\/or casino management system (such as a commercially available Bally CMP\/CMS).","The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using, for example, HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection, firmware, media, operating system software, gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.","The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit (GMU) processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor's video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.","In accordance with one or more embodiments,  is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel  of a game program under control of processor board , uses gaming kernel  by calling into application programming interface (API) , which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel  as shown in  are only illustrative, and should not be considered limiting. For example, the number of managers may be changed, additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.","As shown in the example, there are three layers: a hardware layer ; an operating system layer , such as, but not limited to, Linux; and a game kernel layer  having game manager  therein. In one or more embodiments, the use of a standard operating system , such a UNIX-based or Windows-based operating system, allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary, low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade, hardware upgrade, or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer  executes at the user level of the operating system , and itself contains a major component called the I\/O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software (making integrity checking easier), all game applications interact with gaming kernel  using a single API  in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well-defined, consistent interface, as well as making access points to gaming kernel  controlled, where overall access is controlled using separate processes.","For example, game manager  parses an incoming command stream and, when a command dealing with I\/O comes in (arrow ), the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine  decides what it needs from a device, and sends commands to I\/O Board Server  (see arrow ). A few specific drivers remain in operating system 's kernel, shown as those below line . These are built-in, primitive, or privileged drivers that are (i) general (ii) kept to a minimum and (iii) are easier to leave than extract. In such cases, the low-level communications is handled within operating system  and the contents passed to library routines .","Thus, in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system , which is why arrow  is shown as having three directions (between library utilities  and I\/O Board Server , or between library utilities  and certain drivers in operating system ). No matter which path is taken, the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system  is kept as simple, stripped down, and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user-level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus, each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board  connected to a unique, relatively dumb, and as inexpensive as possible I\/O adapter board , plus a gaming kernel  which will have the game-machine-unique library routines and I\/O Board Server  components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences (i.e., if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound, the game application will be able make use of API  to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound).","Game manager  provides an interface into game kernel , providing consistent, predictable, and backwards compatible calling methods, syntax, and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware, including the freedom to not have to deal with low-level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers , although lower level managers  may be accessible through game manager 's interface  if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent, callable, object-oriented interfaces to software managers of those components (drivers), game manager  provides access to a set of upper level managers  also having the advantages of consistent callable, object-oriented interfaces, and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino-type games. Game manager , providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface  as supported by the rest of game kernel , thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.","Game manager  may have several objects within itself, including an initialization object (not shown). The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine, including other objects, after game manager  has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function, the kernel's configuration manager  is among the first objects to be started; configuration manager  has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.","The upper level managers  of game kernel  may include game event log manager  which provides, at the least, a logging or logger base class, enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger; that is, it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager's () job is to log events in non-volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed, although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up, one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event (each logged event will have a time\/date stamp, as well as other needed information such as length), providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment, the most recent events will thus be found in the log space, regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.","In accordance with one embodiment, meter manager  manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters (counters) and soft meters; the soft meters may be stored in non-volatile storage such as non-volatile battery-backed RAM to prevent loss. Further, a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non-volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment, meter manager  receives its initialization data for the meters, during startup, from configuration manager . While running, the cash in () and cash out () managers call the meter manager's () update functions to update the meters. Meter manager  will, on occasion, create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters' readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .","In accordance with still other embodiments, progressive manager  manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager  is generic, like log manager , and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager  correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager  is an object that receives a list of errors (if any) from configuration manager  at initialization, and during game play from processes, managers, drivers, etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager  is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator (RNG), as a RNG is required in virtually all casino-style (gambling) games. RNG manager  includes the capability of using multiple seeds.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, a credit manager object (not shown) manages the current state of credits (cash value or cash equivalent) in the game machine, including any available winnings, and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager  has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization, cash out manager , using data from configuration manager , sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play, a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager  (the same way all events are handled), and using a callback posted by cash out manager , cash out manager  is informed of the event. Cash out manager  updates the credit object, updates its state in non-volatile memory, and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media, there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager  until the dispensing finishes, after which cash out manager , having updated the credit manager and any other game state (such as some associated with meter manager ) that needs to be updated for this set of actions, sends a cash out completion event to event manager  and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager  functions similarly to cash out manager , only controlling, interfacing with, and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events, cash in devices, and associated meters and crediting.","In a further example, in accordance with one or more embodiments, I\/O server  may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory, which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager  calls the I\/O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I\/O server  receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread  within I\/O server  to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.","In accordance with one embodiment, button module  within I\/O server , polls (or is sent) the state of buttons every two milliseconds. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed, in which case the I\/O server  sends an inter-process communication event to game manager  that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments, the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I\/O which debounces the buttons, in which case button module  may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager  via IPC messages. In still another embodiment, the I\/O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example, hopper module  must start the hopper motor, constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper, debounce them, and send an IPC message to the game manager  when each coin is paid.","Further details, including disclosure of lower level fault handling and\/or processing, are included in U.S. Pat. No. 7,351,151 entitled \u201cGaming Board Set and Gaming Kemal for Game Cabinets\u201d and provisional U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60\/313,743, entitled \u201cForm Fitting Upgrade Board Set For Existing Game Cabinets,\u201d filed Aug. 20, 2001; said patent and provisional are both fully incorporated herein by explicit reference.","A logical flow diagram generally depicting the steps associated with a method  for carrying out a game having a group play feature, in accordance with one embodiment, is presented in . The order of actions as shown in  is only illustrative, and should not be considered limiting. For example, the order of the actions may be changed, additional steps may be added or some steps may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.","First at block , each of a group of gaming machines present normal game play. As described above, the gaming machines may accept various wagers and present games of chance such as, but not limited to, a video or mechanical reel slot machine, a video keno game, a video poker game, a lottery game, a bingo game, a Class II bingo game, a roulette game, a craps game, a blackjack game, a mechanical or video representation of a wheel game or the like.","At block , each participating gaming machine calculates an eligibility score for group feature play. In the example above, one possible formula for determining an eligibility score could be as follows. The ES should be set to zero whenever: 1) the credit meter drops to zero, 2) the player is involved in a group-play bonus, and 3) a specific length of time has elapsed since the end of the last game, for example, 10 seconds, although any length of time can be set by the system before resetting the ES to zero. When the gaming machine is eligible, the ES should be a measurement of the rate with which the player is betting. In one embodiment, whenever the player makes a bet, the ES may be set to:\n\n(B+(ES(L\u2212t)))\/L\n","In the above formula, B equals the amount of the bet, ES equals the ES immediately before the bet was placed, and L equals the expected length of eligibility. For example, L is typically about 15 seconds, which is the length of an average spin plus a 10 second grace period. Further, t equals the time since the start of the previous spin, but does not include any time spent in a bonus game or during a tilt. Variations of this or other formulas may be used to calculate eligibility.","At block , each gaming machine determines its probability for initiating group play. For example, when a player places a wager, the gaming machine determines which bonus pool to use for the upcoming game based on the current expected value. The gaming machine calculates the probability of a bonus trigger using, by way of example, the following formula:\n\n=(Return % of bonus*Bet)\/(Pool Limit\u2212Pool Value)\n","In this above equation, P equals the probability of a bonus triggering event occurring. The \u201cReturn % of bonus\u201d variable is the average return of the bonus game and the \u201cBet\u201d variable is the current bet amount on the gaming machine. Further, the \u201cPool Limit\u201d variable is the maximum value the bonus pool may have and the \u201cPool Value\u201d variable is the current value of the bonus pool. The gaming machine then contributes an appropriate amount to the bonus pool.","A triggering gaming machine sends a message to each eligible gaming machine that group play is about to begin at block  and sends subsequent messages to further coordinate the start of the group play feature at block . The eligible gaming machines then each play the group play feature at block . At block , each participating gaming machine periodically sends messages to the other participating gaming machines (or the network controller) with intermediate results during the course of the group play feature. These intermediate results may be used by the other participating gaming machines or the network controller to update connected displays for viewing by players, other casino patrons, and casino personnel to enhance the excitement of the game, block . The cycle between blocks  and block  iterates until group play is complete, after which each participating gaming machine sends a message to the other participating gaming machines or the network controller with final results from the group play feature at block . The final results are posted on connected displays at block .","Each connected gaming machine that participated in the group play feature determines how well it performed relative to the other gaming machines, based on the final results. The gaming machines that had the best results from the group play feature may award the player with a feature award amount at block , after which normal game pay resumes at each gaming machine at block .","Referring to and , enterprise gaming system  is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Enterprise gaming system  may include one casino or multiple locations and generally includes a network of gaming machines , floor management system (SMS) , and casino management system (CMS) . SMS  may include load balancer , network services servers , player interface (iVIEW) content servers , certificate services server , floor radio dispatch receiver\/transmitters (RDC) , floor transaction servers  and game engines , each of which may connect over network bus  to gaming machines .

The various CMS and SMS servers are descriptively entitled to reflect the functional executable programming stored thereon and the nature of databases maintained and utilized in performing their respective functions.","Gaming machines  include various peripheral components that may be connected with USB, serial, parallel, RS- or Ethernet devices\/architectures to the system components within the respective gaming machine. The GMU has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection. The system components in the gaming cabinet may be connected to the servers using HTTPs or GS over Ethernet. Using CMS  and\/or SMS  servers and devices, firmware, media, operating systems, and configurations may be downloaded to the system components of respective gaming machines for upgrading or managing floor content and offerings in accordance with operator selections or automatically depending upon CMS  and SMS  master programming. The data and programming updates to gaming machines  are authenticated using conventional techniques prior to install on the system components.","In various embodiments, any of the gaming machines  may be a mechanical reel spinning slot machine, video slot machine, video poker machine, video bingo machine, keno machine, or a gaming machine offering one or more of the above described games including a group play game. Alternately, gaming machines  may provide a game with a group play feature game as one of a set of multiple primary games selected for play by a random number generator, as described above.
