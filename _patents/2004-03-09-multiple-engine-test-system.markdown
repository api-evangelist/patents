{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to a multiple engine test system. More specifically, but without limitation, the present invention relates to a test bed system that tests different types of engines.","Testing of engines, specifically, but without limitation, military aircraft engines require different test components and test cells for different engines. Currently there are designated test cells and testing areas for each type of engine. This utilizes excess space and limits the type of engine that can be tested. Historically, engine test cells, specifically turboshaft engine test cells, were built exclusively to meet the requirements of a single engine type. This required significant manpower and incurred significant costs, as well as requiring different engine test sites for each type of engine. Thus there is a need for a universal test bed and testing system.","Thus, there is a need in the art to provide a multiple engine test system that incorporates the listed benefits without the limitations inherent in present methods. For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a multiple engine test system.","The present invention is directed to a multiple engine test system that includes an engine test bed system for holding a specific engine type, a mounting frame, and a handling system for transporting the engine test bed system from storage to the mounting frame. The engine test bed system has all the peculiar testing components required for the specific engine type, and the mounting frame is able to hold the engine test bed system securely.","It is an object of the invention to provide a multiple engine test system that can test any type of engine, particularly any type of aircraft engine.","It is an object of the invention to provide a multiple engine test system that is a universal test bed and engine testing system.","It is an object of the invention to provide a multiple engine test system that is highly configurable and is able to meet different engine requirements.","It is an object of the invention to provide a multiple engine test system that reduces manpower and set-up costs.","It is an object of the invention to provide a multiple engine test system that allows use of different engine test bed systems for each particular engine type.","The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example in , , and . As seen in , the multiple engine test system  includes an engine test bed system  for holding a specific engine type, a mounting frame  and a handling system  for transporting the engine test bed system  from storage to the mounting frame . The engine test bed system  includes all peculiar testing components required for testing the specific engine type , and the mounting frame  is able to hold the engine test bed system  securely.","In the discussion of the present invention, the system will be discussed in an aircraft engine environment, specifically a military turboshaft aircraft engine environment, however, the system can also be utilized for any other type of engine. In addition, this system will also be discussed in an indoor testing facility environment; however, it may be utilized anywhere practicable.","The mounting frame  may be, but without limitation, a common platform used to hold unique engine test bed systems  securely. As seen in , the mounting frame  may include a platform  or base with a pedestal . In the preferred embodiment, the platform  may be substantially rectangular and contain at least two pedestals . Each pedestal  may be substantially rectangular, smaller in size than the platform , and the pedestals  may be substantially similar in size and shape and substantially parallel. In the preferred embodiment, the engine test bed system  is mounted or placed on the mounting frame .","The engine test bed system  may be defined, but without limitation, as a removable engine test bed. It can also be defined as, but without limitation, a transportable turboshaft engine test bed that houses all of the detailed hardware required to perform operational and test procedures on a specific aircraft turboshaft engine . The engine test bed system  may communicate with or rest on the pedestal(s) . The engine test bed system  may contain all of the peculiar testing components  required for the testing of a specific engine type . For instance, a particular engine test bed system  may include, but without limitation, a dynamometer, a flywheel, and the like. The engine test bed system  may be customized to each particular engine .","The engine test bed system  may be a support with support beams , support columns , top beam members , and top member connecting beams . As seen in , the preferred embodiment of the engine test bed system  has two support beams  and two top beam members . Each support beam  may communicate with or rest on a pedestal . The support beam  may have a substantially rectangular cross section with the longer side resting on the pedestal . The support columns  are perpendicularly attached to the support beams . The top beam members  are perpendicularly attached to the support columns . The top member connecting beams  are perpendicularly attached to both top beam members . As seen in , the top member connecting beam  may have a first end  and a second end  wherein each respective end is perpendicularly attached to a top beam member . On the top beam members  the testing components  may be disposed.","As seen in , the preferred embodiment of the handling system  for transporting the engine test bed system  from storage to the mounting frame  includes an overhead hoist  which can transport the engine test bed system , and an overhead rail system . The overhead hoist  may ride on the overhead rail system . As seen in , the overhead hoist  may include a hook system  and a cord system  for holding and supporting the engine test bed system . However, any other type of holding and supporting system may be utilized, such as, but without limitation, a magnet system, a cord system only, or a suction system. The overhead rail system  leads from the test area to a storage area where all the unique engine test bed systems  are stored. The overhead hoist  may also be used to move and install any engine  being tested. The overhead rail system  may also lead to an area where engines  are placed or stored prior to testing. The handling system  may take any other form that is practicable, such as, but without limitation, wheel rail system, caster rail system, standard warehouse handling system, electromagnetic type system, etc.","The multiple engine test system  may also include an exhaust duct . The exhaust duct  intakes air and discharge from the engines  when they are being tested, and transports this air and discharge either outside or to another area. Engines  typically have an engine exhaust which discharges engine fumes and exhaust. The exhaust duct  may intake these fumes and exhaust away from the test area. The exhaust duct  may be an adjustable exhaust duct  that can change sizes in order to accommodate different types of engines . The exhaust duct  may be telescopic and extend as seen in .","The multiple engine test system  may also include an engine interface harness . An engine interface harness  may be defined, but without limitation, as an apparatus that adapts specific connection requirements to the universal test cell connections . The engine interface harness  may adapt specific engines  to universal testing connections and components. The universal testing connections and components and specific testing components  may be attachable to standardized connectors and adapters  to obtain facilities requirements such as, but without limitation, water, hydraulics, power, etc.","The multiple engine test system  is shown in use in . The engine  is attached to the peculiar testing components , the universal test cell connections  and to the adjustable exhaust duct . After testing is complete, the engine  may be removed from the engine test bed system  and the engine test bed system  may be removed and replaced with a different engine test bed system  to test another type of engine .","When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment(s) thereof, the articles \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements.
