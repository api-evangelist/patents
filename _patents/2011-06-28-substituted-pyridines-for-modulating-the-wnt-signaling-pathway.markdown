The full disclosure of this application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.","The present invention relates to compositions and methods for modulating the Wnt signaling pathway.","The Wnt gene family encodes a large class of secreted proteins related to the Int1\/Wnt1 proto-oncogene and wingless (\u201cWg\u201d), a Wnt1 homologue. (Cadigan et al. (1997) Genes & Development 11:3286-3305). Wnts are expressed in a variety of tissues and organs and play a major role in many developmental processes, including segmentation in ; endoderm development in ; and establishment of limb polarity, neural crest differentiation, kidney morphogenesis, sex determination, and brain development in mammals. (Parr, et al. (1994) Curr. Opinion Genetics & Devel. 4:523-528). The Wnt pathway is a master regulator in animal development, both during embryogenesis and in the mature organism. (Eastman, et al. (1999) Curr Opin Cell Biol 11: 233-240; Peifer, et al. (2000) Science 287: 1606-1609).","Wnt signals are transduced by the Frizzled (\u201cFz\u201d) family of seven transmembrane domain receptors. (Bhanot et al. (1996) Nature 382:225-230). Wnt ligands bind to Fzd, and in so doing, activate the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dvl-1, 2 and 3 in humans and mice) (Boutros, et al. (1999) Mech Dev 83: 27-37) and phosphorylate LRP5\/6. A signal is thereby generated which prevents the phosphorylation and degradation of Armadillo\/\u03b2(beta)-catenin, in turn leading to the stabilization of \u03b2-catenin (Perrimon (1994) Cell 76:781-784). This stabilization is occasioned by Dvl's association with axin (Zeng et al. (1997) Cell 90:181-192), a scaffolding protein that brings various proteins together, including GSK3, APC, CK1, and \u03b2-catenin, to form the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex.","The Wingless-type (Wnt) Frizzled protein receptor pathway involves important regulatory genes that carry polymorphisms associated with primary carcinomas. In the course of downstream signaling, cytosolic \u03b2-catenin accumulates, translocates into the nucleus, and then enhances gene expression by complexing with other transcription factors. (Uthoff et al., 31:56-62 (2001)). In the absence of Wnt signals, free cytosolic \u03b2-catenin is incorporated into a complex consisting of Axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2. Conjunctional phosphorylation of Axin, APC, and \u03b2-catenin by GSK-3\u03b2 designates \u03b2-catenin for the ubiquitin pathway and degradation by proteasomes. (Uthoff et al., 31:56-62 (2001); Matsuzawa et al., 7:915-926 (2001)).","Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling promotes cell survival in various cell types. (Orford et al., J Cell Biol, 146:855-868 (1999); Cox et al., Genetics, 155:1725-1740 (2000); Reya et al., Immunity, 13:15-24 (2000); Satoh et al., Nat Genet, 24:245-250 (2000); Shin et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 274:2780-2785 (1999); Chen et al., J Cell Biol, 152:87-96 (2001); Ioannidis et al., Nat Immunol, 2:691-697 (2001)). Wnt signaling pathway is also thought to be associated with tumor development and\/or progression. (Polakis et al., Genes Dev, 14:1837-1851 (2000); Cox et al., Genetics, 155:1725-1740 (2000); Bienz et al., Cell, 103:311-320 (2000); You et al., J Cell Biol, 157:429-440 (2002)). Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is associated with a variety of human cancers, correlating with the over-expression or amplification of c-Myc. (Polakis et al., Genes Dev, 14:1837-1851 (2000); Bienz et al., Cell, 103:311-320 (2000); Brown et al., Breast Cancer Res, 3:351-355 (2001); He et al., Science, 281:1509-1512 (1998); Miller et al., Oncogene, 18:7860-7872 (1999)). In addition, c-Myc was identified as one of the transcriptional targets of the \u03b2-catenin\/Tcf in colorectal cancer cells. (He et al., Science, 281:1509-1512 (1998); de La Coste et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95:8847-8851 (1998); Miller et al., Oncogene, 18:7860-7872 (1999); You et al., J Cell Biol, 157:429-440 (2002)).","International Application Number PCT\/US2010\/025813 describes N-(hetero)aryl, 2-(hetero)aryl-substituted acetamides for use as Wnt signaling modulators.","A need exists for agents and methods that modulate the Wnt signaling pathway, for example, agents having functional activity as Wnt inhibitors, thereby treating, diagnosing, preventing, and\/or ameliorating Wnt signaling-related disorders.

If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted deuterium, such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation).","Isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula (1), (2), (2A), (3), (3\u2032) and (4) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Processes using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagents in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.","Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. DO, d-acetone, d-DMSO.","Compounds of the invention, i.e. compounds of Formula (1), (2), (2A), (3) and (4) that contain groups capable of acting as donors and\/or acceptors for hydrogen bonds may be capable of forming co-crystals with suitable co-crystal formers. These co-crystals may be prepared from compounds of Formula (1), (2), (2A), (3), (3\u2032) and (4) by known co-crystal forming procedures. Such procedures include grinding, heating, co-subliming, co-melting, or contacting in solution compounds of Formula (1), (2), (2A), (3), (3\u2032) and (4) with the co-crystal former under crystallization conditions and isolating co-crystals thereby formed. Suitable co-crystal formers include those described in WO 2004\/078163. Hence the invention further provides co-crystals comprising a compound of Formula (1), (2), (2A), (3), (3\u2032) or (4).","Any asymmetric atom (e.g., carbon or the like) of the compound(s) of the present invention can be present in racemic or enantiomerically enriched, for example the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)-configuration. In certain embodiments, each asymmetric atom has at least 50% enantiomeric excess, at least 60% enantiomeric excess, at least 70% enantiomeric excess, at least 80% enantiomeric excess, at least 90% enantiomeric excess, at least 95% enantiomeric excess, or at least 99% enantiomeric excess in the (R)- or (S)-configuration. Substituents at atoms with unsaturated bonds may, if possible, be present in cis-(Z)- or trans-(E)-form.","Accordingly, as used herein a compound of the present invention can be in the form of one of the possible isomers, rotamers, atropisomers, tautomers or mixtures thereof, for example, as substantially pure geometric (cis or trans) isomers, diastereomers, optical isomers (antipodes), racemates or mixtures thereof.

Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g., by separation of the diastereomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. In particular, a basic moiety may thus be employed to resolve the compounds of the present invention into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of a salt formed with an optically active acid, e.g., tartaric acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, diacetyl tartaric acid, di-O,O\u2032-p-toluoyl tartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid or camphor-10-sulfonic acid. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g., high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral adsorbent.","The invention also provides for a method of inhibiting Wnt-signaling in a cell comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount of a Wnt antagonist. In one embodiment, the administered amount is a therapeutically effective amount and the inhibition of Wnt signaling further results in the inhibition of the growth of the cell. In a further embodiment, the cell is a cancer cell.","Inhibition of cell proliferation is measured using methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, a convenient assay for measuring cell proliferation is the CellTiter-Glo\u2122 Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, which is commercially available from Promega (Madison, Wis.). That assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP present, which is an indication of metabolically active cells. See Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88, U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677. The assay may be conducted in 96- or 384-well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS). See Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404. The assay procedure involves adding a single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cultured cells. This results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal produced by a luciferase reaction. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present, which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells present in culture. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is expressed as relative light units (RLU). Inhibition of cell proliferation may also be measured using colony formation assays known in the art.","Furthermore, the invention provides for methods of treating a Wnt-mediated disorder in a subject suffering therefrom, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a Wnt antagonist. In one embodiment, the disorder is a cell proliferative disorder associated with aberrant, e.g., increased, expression of activity of Wnt signaling. In another embodiment, the disorder results from increased expression of a Wnt protein. In yet another embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer, such as for example, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, cancer associated with various disorders relating to HSC's, such as leukemias and various other blood related cancers, and cancer related to neuronal proliferative disorders, including brain tumors, such as gliomas, astrocytomas, meningiomas, Schwannomas, pituitary tumors, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), medulloblastomas, craniopharyngioma, pineal region tumors, and skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.","Treatment of the cell proliferative disorder by administration of a Wnt antagonist results in an observable and\/or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more of the following: reduction in the number of cancer cells or absence of the cancer cells; reduction in the tumor size; inhibition of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including the spread of cancer into soft tissue and bone; inhibition of tumor metastasis; inhibition, to some extent, of tumor growth; and\/or relief to some extent, one or more of the symptoms associated with the specific cancer; reduced morbidity and mortality, and improvement in quality of life issues. To the extent the Wnt antagonist may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. Reduction of these signs or symptoms may also be felt by the patient.","The above parameters for assessing successful treatment and improvement in the disease are readily measurable by routine procedures familiar to a physician. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to disease progression (TDP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR). Metastasis can be determined by staging tests and by bone scan and tests for calcium level and other enzymes to determine spread to the bone. CT scans can also be done to look for spread to the pelvis and lymph nodes in the area. Chest X-rays and measurement of liver enzyme levels by known methods are used to look for metastasis to the lungs and liver, respectively. Other routine methods for monitoring the disease include transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and transrectal needle biopsy (TRNB). In a specific embodiment, the administration of Wnt antagonist decreases tumor burden (e.g., reduces size or severity of the cancer). In yet another specific embodiment, the administration of Wnt antagonist kills the cancer.","Pharmacology and Utility","The compounds of Formula (1), (2), (2A), (3), (3\u2032) and (4) in free form or in salt form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. Wnt modulating properties, e.g. as indicated in in vitro and\/or in vivo tests as provided in the next sections, and are therefore indicated for therapy in treating a disorder which may be treated by modulating Wnt, such as those described below.","The current paradigm for developing therapies for Wnt signaling-related disorders relies on targeting \u03b2-cat or Wnt pathway components downstream of \u03b2-cat. Recent studies, however, suggest that inhibition of the extracellular ligand-receptor interaction component is effective in reducing the tumorigenicity, even though the event initiating the Wnt signaling may have occurred downstream. Moreover, the transfection of inoperative frizzled receptor (Frz7 ectodomain) into carcinoma cell line (SK-CO-1) restored a normal \u03b2-catenin phenotype. This cell line has active Wnt signaling due to a homozygous APC\u2212\/\u2212 mutation. Such cells also did not demonstrate tumor formation when transferred in vivo. Vincan et al., Differentiation 2005; 73: 142-153. This demonstrates that the inhibition of Wnt signaling at the extracellular level can downregulate Wnt signaling resulting from activation of a downstream intracellular Wnt signaling pathway component. This further suggests that inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway may be used in the treatment of a Wnt-mediated disorder, regardless of the particular manner in which Wnt signaling has been activated, and all forms of Wnt-mediated disorders, such as those described below, are potentially treatable with the compounds of the present invention.","Disorders Associated with Wnt Signaling Activity","Deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway may be caused by somatic mutations in genes encoding various Wnt signaling pathway components. For example, aberrant Wnt signaling activity has been associated with Wnt ligand overexpression in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [You et al., Oncogene 2004; 23: 6170-6174], chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [Lu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2004; 101: 3118-3123], gastric cancer [Kim et al., Exp. Oncol. 2003; 25: 211-215; Saitoh et al., Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 515-519], head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [Rhee et al., Oncogene 2002; 21: 6598-6605], colorectal cancer [Holcombe et al., Mol.

Moreover, the reduction of various Wnt ligand regulatory molecules such as sFRP and WIF-1 have been associated with breast cancer [Klopocki et al., Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 641-649; Ugolini et al., Oncogene 2001; 20: 5810-5817; Wissmann et al., J. Pathol 2003; 201: 204-212], bladder cancer [Stoehr et al., Lab Invest. 2004; 84: 465-478; Wissmann et al., supra], mesothelioma [Lee et al., Oncogene 2004; 23: 6672-6676], colorectal cancer [Suzuki et al., Nature Genet. 2004; 36: 417-422; Kim et al., Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1355-1359; Caldwell et al., Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 883-888], prostate cancer [Wissman et al., supra], NSCLC [Mazieres et al., Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4717-4720], and lung cancer [Wissman et al., supra].","Aberrant Wnt signaling resulting from overexpression of various components of the Frz-LRP receptor complex have also been associated with certain cancers. For example, LRP5 overexpression has been associated with osteosarcoma [Hoang et al., Int. J. Cancer 2004; 109: 106-111], while Frz overexpression has been associated with cancers such as prostate [Wissmann et al., supra], HNSCC [Rhee et al., Oncogene 2002; 21: 6598-6605], colorectal [Holcombe et al., supra], ovarian cancer [Wissman et al., supra], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [Tanaka et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1998; 95: 10164-10169] and gastric [Kirikoshi et al., Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 111-115]. Additionally, overexpression of Wnt signaling pathway components such as Dishevelled have been associated with cancers such as prostate [Wissman et al, supra], breast [Nagahata et al., Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 515-518], mesothelioma [Uematsu et al., Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4547-4551] and cervical [Okino et al, Oncol Rep. 2003; 10: 1219-1223]. Frat-1 overexpression has been associated with cancers such as pancreatic, esophageal, cervical, breast and gastric. [Saitoh et al., Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 20: 785-789; Saitoh et al., Int. J. Oncol 2001; 19: 311-315]. Axin loss of function (LOF) mutations have been associated with hepatocellular cancer [Satoh et al., Nature Genet. 2000; 24: 245-250; Taniguchi et al., Oncogene 2002; 21: 4863-4871] and medulloblastoma [Dahmen et al., Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7039-7043; Yokota et al., Int. J. Cancer 2002; 101: 198-201].","Furthermore, a multitude of cancers has been associated with activating \u03b2-catenin through disruption of the \u201cdegradation complex\u201d such as gain-of-function mutations in \u03b2-catenin or loss-of-function mutations in APC. A reduction in the degradation of \u03b2-catenin results in greater amounts of functional \u03b2-catenin in the cell, which then causes increased transcription of the target genes, resulting in aberrant cell proliferation. For example, mutations in the gene encoding \u03b2-catenin (i.e., CTNNB1) have been associated with cancers such as gastric [Clements et al., Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3503-3506; Park et al., Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4257-4260], colorectal [Morin et al., Science 1997; 275: 1787-1790; Ilyas et al., Proc.

While loss-of-function mutations have been associated with cancers such as colorectal [Fearon et al., Cell 1990; 61: 759-767; Rowan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2000; 97: 3352-3357], melanoma [Reifenberger et al., Int. J. Cancer 2002; 100: 549-556; Rubinfeld et al., Science 1997; 275: 1790-1792], medulloblastoma [Koch et al., Int. J.

Pathol. 1997; 151: 329-334].","Other disorders associated with aberrant Wnt signaling, include but are not limited to osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, polycystic kidney disease, diabetes, schizophrenia, vascular disease, cardiac disease, non-oncogenic proliferative diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.","Aberrant Wnt Signaling in Cancers and Leukemia","Aberrant Wnt pathway activation, through the stabilization of \u03b2-catenin, plays a central role in tumorigenesis for many colorectal carcinomas. It is estimated that 80% of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) harbor inactivating mutations in the tumor repressor APC, which allows for uninterrupted Wnt signaling. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that the Wnt-pathway activation may be involved in melanoma, breast, liver, lung, gastric cancer, and other cancers.","Unregulated activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is also a precursor to the development of leukemia. Experimental evidence exists supporting the oncogenic growth of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages as dependent on Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling has been implicated in regulating both the chronic and acute forms of myeloid leukemia. Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients and blast crisis cells from patients resistant to therapy display activated Wnt signaling. Moreover, inhibition of \u03b2-catenin through ectopic expression of Axin decreases the replating capacity of leukemic cells in vitro, suggesting that chronic myelogenous leukemia precursors are dependent on Wnt signaling for growth and renewal. Wnt overexpression also caused GMPs to acquire stem-cell-like properties of long-term self renewal, supporting the hypothesis that Wnt signaling is important for the normal development of blood lineages, but that aberrant Wnt signaling results in the transformation of progenitor cells.","Recent studies also suggest that lymphoid neoplasias may also be influenced by Wnt signaling. Wnt-16 is overexpressed in pre-B-cell leukemia cell lines carrying the E2A-PbX translocation, suggesting that autocrine Wnt activity may contribute to oncogenesis. McWhirter, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96: 11464-11469 (1999). The role of Wnt signaling in the growth and survival of normal B-cell progenitors further supports this notion. Reya et al., Immunity 13: 15-24 (2000); Ranheim et al., Blood 105: 2487-2494 (2005). Autocrine dependence on Wnt has also been proposed for regulating the growth of multiple myeloma, a cancer of terminally differentiated B-cells. Derksen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101: 6122-6127 (2004). Primary myelomas and myeloma cell lines were also found to express stabilized (i.e., independent of degradation complex). Although no mutations in Wnt signaling components was present, the overexpression of several components, including Wnt-5A and Wnt-10B suggest that tumor dependency and cancer self-renewal is not necessarily dependent on mutations appearing in Wnt signaling pathway components, but rather only upon constitutive activation of the pathway itself.","The transition of self-renewing, pluripotent stem cells to myeloid progenitors is accompanied by the downregulation of Wnt signaling. Reya et al, Nature 423: 409-414 (2003). Similarly, the stable expression of \u03b2-catenin in lymphoid progenitors restored multiple differentiation options, albeit such cells lacked markers typically associated with either cell type. Baba et al, Immunity 23: 599-609 (2005).","Aberrant Wnt Signaling in Neural Disorders","It has also been observed that the activation of Wnt signaling through \u03b2-catenin can increase cycling and expansion of neural progenitors, and that loss of such signaling can result in a loss of progenitor compartment. Chem et al., Science 297: 365-369 (2002); Zechner et al., Dev. Biol. 258: 406-418 (2003). Just as normal activation of Wnt signaling may promote self-renewal of neuronal stem cells, aberrant Wnt pathway activation may be tumorigenic in the nervous system. Experimental evidence supporting this conclusion is the discovery that medulloblastoma, a pediatric brain tumor of the cerebellum, contains mutations in both \u03b2-catenin and Axin\u2014thereby suggesting that medulloblastomas arise from primitive progenitors that become transformed in response to uncontrolled Wnt signaling. Zurawel et al., Cancer Res. 58: 896-899 (1998); Dahmen et al., Cancer Res. 61: 7039-7043 (2001); Baeza et al., Oncogene 22: 632-636 (2003). Thus, it is strongly suggested that the inhibition of Wnt signaling by the Wnt antagonists of the invention may be an effective therapeutic in the treatment of various neuronal proliferative disorders, including brain tumors, such as gliomas, astrocytomas, meningiomas, Schwannomas, pituitary tumors, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), medulloblastomas, craniopharyngioma, pineal region tumors, and non cancerous neurofibromatoses.","Wnt Signaling in Hematopoietic Stem Cells","Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to the adult blood cells of the circulatory system in a process of lineage-committed progenitor cells from multipotential hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). It is also apparent that Wnt signaling contributes to the self-renewal and maintenance of HSC's, and that dysfunctional Wnt signaling is responsible for various disorders resulting from HSC's, such as leukemias and various other blood related cancers. Reya et al., Nature 434: 843-850 (2005); Baba et al., Immunity 23: 599-609 (2005); Jamieson et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 351(7): 657-667 (2004). Wnt signaling is normally reduced as stem cells convert to committed myeloid progenitor cells. Reya et al., Nature 423: 409-414 (2003).","Not only are Wnt ligands themselves produced by HSC's, but Wnt signaling is also active, thereby suggesting autocrine or paracrine regulation. Rattis et al., Curr. Opin. Hematol. 11: 88-94 (2004); Reya et al., Nature 423: 409-414 (2003). Additionally, both \u03b2-catenin and Wnt3a promote self renewal of murine HSCs and progenitor cells, while application of Wnt-5A to human hematopoietic progenitors promotes the expansion of undifferentiated progenitors in vitro. Reya et al., supra.; Willert et al., Nature 423: 448-452 (2003); Van Den Berg et al., Blood 92: 3189-3202 (1998).","In addition to HSC's, it is apparent that embryonic stem cells, epidermal stem cells and epithelial stem cells are responsive or dependent on Wnt signaling for maintenance in an undifferentiated, proliferating state. Willert et al., supra; Korinek et al., Nat. Genet. 19: 379-383 (1998); Sato et al., Nat. Med. 10: 55-63 (2004); Gat et al., Cell 95: 605-614 (1998); Zhu et al., Development 126: 2285-2298 (1999). Therefore the inhibition of Wnt signaling with the Wnt antagonists of the present invention may be a therapeutic in the treatment of disorders resulting from dysfunctional hematopoieses, such as leukemias and various blood related cancers, such as acute, chronic, lymphoid and myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative disorders. These include myeloma, lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's) chronic and nonprogressive anemia, progressive and symptomatic blood cell deficiencies, polycythemia vera, essential or primary thrombocythemia, idiopathic myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), mantle cell lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom macroglobinemia.","Wnt Signaling in Aging","The Wnt signaling pathway may also play a critical role in aging and age-related disorders. As reported in Brack A S, et al., Science, 317(5839):807-10 (2007), muscle stem cells from aged mice were observed to convert from a myogenic to a fibrogenic lineage as they begin to proliferate. This conversion is associated with an increase in canonical Wnt signaling pathway activity in aged myogenic progenitors and can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors. Additionally, components of serum from aged mice bind to the Frizzled proteins and may account for the elevated Wnt signaling in aged cells. Injection of Wnt3A into young regenerating muscle reduced proliferation and increased deposition of connective tissue.","The Wnt signaling pathway has been further implicated in aging process in studies using the Klotho mouse model of accelerated aging in which it was determined that the Klotho protein physically interacted with and inhibited Wnt proteins. Liu H, et al., Science, 317(5839):803-6 (2007). In a cell culture model, the Wnt-Klotho interaction resulted in the suppression of Wnt biological activity while tissues and organs from Klotho-deficient animals showed evidence of increased Wnt signaling.","Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions","In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention are obtained in customary manner, e.g. by treating the compounds with an acid or a suitable anion exchange reagent. Internal salts of compounds of the present invention containing acid and basic salt-forming groups, e.g. a free carboxy group and a free amino group, may be formed, e.g. by the neutralisation of salts, such as acid addition salts, to the isoelectric point, e.g. with weak bases, or by treatment with ion exchangers. Salts can be converted into the free compounds in accordance with methods known to those skilled in the art. Metal and ammonium salts can be converted, for example, by treatment with suitable acids, and acid addition salts, for example, by treatment with a suitable basic agent.","Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids, e.g., acetate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bromide\/hydrobromide, bicarbonate\/carbonate, bisulfate\/sulfate, camphorsulfonate, chloride\/hydrochloride, chlortheophyllonate, citrate, ethandisulfonate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hippurate, hydroiodide\/iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurylsulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthoate, napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, octadecanoate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate\/hydrogen phosphate\/dihydrogen phosphate, polygalacturonate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfosalicylate, tartrate, tosylate and trifluoroacetate salts.","Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.","Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases.","Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, ammonium salts and metals from columns I to XII of the periodic table. In certain embodiments, the salts are derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, silver, zinc, and copper; particularly suitable salts include ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts.","Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like. Certain organic amines include isopropylamine, benzathine, cholinate, diethanolamine, diethylamine, lysine, meglumine, piperazine and tromethamine.","The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from a parent compound, a basic or acidic moiety, by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base (such as Na, Ca, Mg, or K hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate or the like), or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, use of non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile is desirable, where practicable. Lists of additional suitable salts can be found, e.g., in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d, 20th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., (1985); and in \u201cHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use\u201d by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002).","The present invention also provides pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention that converts in vivo to the compounds of the present invention. A pro-drug is an active or inactive compound that is modified chemically through in vivo physiological action, such as hydrolysis, metabolism and the like, into a compound of this invention following administration of the prodrug to a subject. The suitability and techniques involved in making and using pro-drugs are well known by those skilled in the art. Prodrugs can be conceptually divided into two non-exclusive categories, bioprecursor prodrugs and carrier prodrugs. See , Ch. 31-32 (Ed. Wermuth, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 2001). Generally, bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds, which are inactive or have low activity compared to the corresponding active drug compound, that contain one or more protective groups and are converted to an active form by metabolism or solvolysis. Both the active drug form and any released metabolic products should have acceptably low toxicity.","Carrier prodrugs are drug compounds that contain a transport moiety, e.g., that improve uptake and\/or localized delivery to a site(s) of action. Desirably for such a carrier prodrug, the linkage between the drug moiety and the transport moiety is a covalent bond, the prodrug is inactive or less active than the drug compound, and any released transport moiety is acceptably non-toxic. For prodrugs where the transport moiety is intended to enhance uptake, typically the release of the transport moiety should be rapid. In other cases, it is desirable to utilize a moiety that provides slow release, e.g., certain polymers or other moieties, such as cyclodextrins. Carrier prodrugs can, for example, be used to improve one or more of the following properties: increased lipophilicity, increased duration of pharmacological effects, increased site-specificity, decreased toxicity and adverse reactions, and\/or improvement in drug formulation (e.g., stability, water solubility, suppression of an undesirable organoleptic or physiochemical property). For example, lipophilicity can be increased by esterification of (a) hydroxyl groups with lipophilic carboxylic acids (e.g., a carboxylic acid having at least one lipophilic moiety), or (b) carboxylic acid groups with lipophilic alcohols (e.g., an alcohol having at least one lipophilic moiety, for example aliphatic alcohols).","Exemplary prodrugs are, e.g., esters of free carboxylic acids and S-acyl derivatives of thiols and O-acyl derivatives of alcohols or phenols, wherein acyl has a meaning as defined herein. Suitable prodrugs are often pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid, e.g., lower alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters, lower alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or di-substituted lower alkyl esters, such as the \u03c9-(amino, mono- or di-lower alkylamino, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, the \u03b1-(lower alkanoyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl or di-lower alkylaminocarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester and the like conventionally used in the art. In addition, amines have been masked as arylcarbonyloxymethyl substituted derivatives which are cleaved by esterases in vivo releasing the free drug and formaldehyde (Bundgaard, 2503 (1989)). Moreover, drugs containing an acidic NH group, such as imidazole, imide, indole and the like, have been masked with N-acyloxymethyl groups (Bundgaard, , Elsevier (1985)). Hydroxy groups have been masked as esters and ethers. EP 039,051 (Sloan and Little) discloses Mannich-base hydroxamic acid prodrugs, their preparation and use.","Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention, including their salts, may also be obtained in the form of hydrates, or their crystals may, for example, include the solvent used for crystallization. Different crystalline forms may be present. The compounds of the present invention may inherently or by design form solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents (including water); therefore, it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. The term \u201csolvate\u201d refers to a molecular complex of a compound of the present invention (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) with one or more solvent molecules. Such solvent molecules are those commonly used in the pharmaceutical art, which are known to be innocuous to the recipient, e.g., water, ethanol, and the like. The term \u201chydrate\u201d refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water. The compounds of the present invention, including salts, hydrates and solvates thereof, may inherently or by design form polymorphs.","Compounds of the invention in unoxidized form may be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of the invention by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like) in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80\u00b0 C.","All starting materials, building blocks, reagents, acids, bases, dehydrating agents, solvents and catalysts utilized to synthesize the compounds of the present invention are either commercially available or can be produced by organic synthesis methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art (Houben-Weyl 4Ed. 1952, Methods of Organic Synthesis, Thieme, Volume 21). All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g. \u201csuch as\u201d) provided herein is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention otherwise claimed.","General Conditions","Mass spectra were collected on Agilent HPLC\/MSD systems using electrospray ionization.
