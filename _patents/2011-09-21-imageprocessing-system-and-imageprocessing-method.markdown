Description of the Related Art","Mobile devices, such as mobile telephones and PDAs, are widely used in modern society. Similarly, large MFP (Multi-function Peripheral) devices are also widely used in office environments, print rooms, universities, etc. However, a practical method for printing from mobile phones to MFPs or for scanning documents to mobile phones has been lacking.","WO 2007\/026938 describes a mechanism for scanning to and printing from mobile phones. The mobile phone communicates with an MFP using an RFID card, which allows exchange of wireless network configuration parameters. Based on the wireless configuration parameters communication between the mobile phone and the MFP is configured to allow jobs to be printed from the mobile phone or documents to be scanned to the mobile phone.","Whilst the teaching of WO 2007\/026938 goes some way towards allowing mobile printing, it is inconvenient because it requires a non-contact IC card unit (contactless smart card) to be built into the mobile phone. Mobile phones and other devices with such built-in contactless smart cards are not yet in wide-spread use.","Modern mobile phones (so called smart phones) now include operating systems and the ability to download and install software applications.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an image-processing system and an image-processing method that allows communication between mobile devices and peripheral devices without the need for dedicated hardware in the mobile device.","According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an image-processing system comprising: a peripheral apparatus including a peripheral device, the peripheral apparatus being configured to send a registration request to register communication parameters of the peripheral device in association with a piece of identification information;","a server configured to receive the registration request and to register the communication parameters of the peripheral device in association with the piece of identification information; and a mobile device configured to determine the piece of identification information and to send a request to the server with the determined piece of identification information, wherein the server is configured to associate the registered details of the peripheral device with the request from the mobile device thereby allowing a connection to be configured between the mobile device and the peripheral device.","Preferably the connection between the mobile device and the peripheral device is configured by at least one of the mobile device and the peripheral apparatus retrieving communication parameters stored on the server.","In some embodiments, the connection between the mobile device and the peripheral device is a direct connection such that the mobile device and the peripheral device can communicate directly with each other.

The configuration of the first embodiment is suitable for use for the purposes of demonstration of printing from and scanning to mobile phones in an exhibition or show room environment. A commercial implementation of the present invention will be described in the fourth embodiment.","Referring again to , the MFP , web server , application server , and mobile phone  are able to communicate with each other over a single Wi-Fi network.","As mentioned above, the MFP  and the web server  are associated with each other. In particular, a web application  is run on the web server  in order to control operations on the MFP .  shows the web application , which includes presentation logic  and business logic . Installed on the MFP  is a web browser  which receives HTML web pages to be displayed to a user from the presentation logic . Also installed on the MFP  is a service interface  to allow the business logic  of the web application  to access various services of the MFP . For example, the business logic  may send commands to the service interface  (SOAP interface) to cause the scanner to perform a scanning operation.","A RESTful (Representational State Transfer) interface is provided between the web server , application server  and mobile phone . It is recalled that all three devices (web server , application server , and mobile phone ) can communicate with each other via Wi-Fi over a single network. The REST interface is defined as follows. In the following description the resource is given, then a description of the resource, followed by the HTTP request method and a description of the request method:","\/sessionusers\/{identification information}\/session","A session object for given identification information.

The device contains information about a SOAP service endpoint which is used for scanning a document. It also includes the address for printing.","GET: gets the device.","Payloads of transactions conducted via the REST interface are formatted in XML or JSON.","The application server can also communicate with the MFP  via a SOAP\/HTTP interface (services ), allowing the application server to access services, such as printing, faxing, or scanning, on the MFP .","Operation of the image-processing system will now be described with reference to .  is a flowchart showing steps performed by the web server ,  is a flowchart showing steps performed by application server ,  is a flowchart showing steps performed by the mobile phone , and  is a flowchart showing steps performed by the MFP . In each case, the steps are performed by an appropriately configured program or software running on the respective device on the hardware described earlier.","For purposes of illustration imagine a scenario in which a user holding the mobile phone  walks up to the MFP  and wishes to either scan to the mobile phone  or print from the mobile phone . When the user looks at the display unit  of the MFP , he or she sees a display corresponding to . The user uses the touch screen of the display unit  in order to select the \u2018scandroid\u2019 icon. Touching the icon on the touch screen launches the web browser  on the MFP . The web browser  requests a first page of the scandroid application from the web server  causing the scandroid application to be launched on the web server . The first page of the scandroid application is a web page shown in . Whilst generating the web page shown in , the web application  on the web server  generates a random number, s. The generated number  is embedded in the web page by the presentation logic  and is displayed to the user in the web browser . At this time the application  also sends, S, a message to the application server in order to generate a session. Upon receipt of this request, the application server  generates, S, a session in the database . The generated session is identified by a sessionid, which is native to the database, and stores the random number as identification information in the session. The application server  also registers the MFP  as the source for transfers associated with the sessionid.","The user holding the mobile phone  next launches a scandroid application on the mobile phone  and is presented with the screen display shown in  on the display unit  of the mobile phone . At this time the scandroid application on the mobile phone  starts an FTP server on the mobile phone . The user uses the operation unit  of the mobile phone  to enter, S, the generated identification number displayed on the display unit  of the MFP  into the mobile phone . The user then selects the start button  shown in .","The scandroid application on the mobile phone  is pre-configured with an IP address of the application server  allowing the mobile phone to communicate with the application server . After the user has selected the start button , the scandroid application on the mobile phone  causes the mobile phone  to send a request to register, S, the mobile phone  as the destination for the session with an identification number corresponding to the entered number. This request includes details of the address of the FTP server running on the mobile phone . Upon receipt of this request, the application server registers, S, the mobile phone  as the destination in connection with the session along with the FTP server details. In this way, the session including the generated identification number on the application server  includes information relating to both the MFP  as source device and the mobile phone  as destination device.","Next the mobile phone displays on display unit  a list of files stored on the mobile phone. This display is shown in .","Once the user has entered the identification number into the mobile phone , the user selects \u2018next\u2019 on the display of the MFP  shown in . The MFP  then displays a screen shown in  to allow the user to enter scan setting for use in the scanning operation, S. The user may enter settings to specify color or mono scanning, a scanning resolution, a file format for the scanned document and a scanned document file name. The user then selects the start scan button .","In response to selection of the start scan button , the MFP notifies the web server  that the scan button  has been selected. The web server  receives the scan settings in step S. The web server  sends a request for a scan job including the scan settings to the application server  in step S. In response to receipt of the request for a scan job, S, the application server adds the FTP server details of the mobile phone  stored in the session to the scan settings and sends a scan job to the SOAP interface  of the MFP , S. Upon receipt of the scan job, S, including scan settings and destination details, the MFP  performs the requested scan and sends, S, the scanned document data to the FTP server on the mobile phone  over the Wi-Fi network.","The mobile phone  receives the scanned file, S, and stores it in a memory on the mobile phone , thus completing the scanning operation.","If the user wishes to print from the mobile phone  to the printer , the user uses the scandroid application on the mobile phone  to select a file from a list of files stored on the mobile phone  and then selects a print command. The mobile phone  requests source device information from the application server , and then sends the selected file to LPR port  of the MFP . The document to be printed must be stored or converted in the mobile phone  to a format that can be natively interpreted by the MFP , in this embodiment the file is sent in pdf format. In response to receiving the document, the MFP  prints the file.","In the first embodiment an association is set up between the MFP  and the mobile phone  based on the identification information, which is a random number generated by the web server . The web server  generates a web page in which the generated number is embedded so that the user can read the number when the web page is displayed in the web browser  of the MFP  In the second embodiment, step S is performed using barcodes. The web server generates a web page (see ) in which a barcode  is embedded, the barcode  encoding the generated number.","In the second embodiment, when the user launches the scandroid application on the mobile phone , the camera unit  is activated and the images collected by the camera unit  are displayed in a window on the display unit . The user directs the camera unit  towards the display unit  of the MFP , which is displaying the web page with the embedded barcode . When the barcode  is in view of the camera, the mobile phone  automatically performs barcode recognition in order to extract the number from the barcode  displayed on the display unit  of the MFP .","The number extracted from the barcode is used by the mobile phone as the identification information in the same manner as described in the first embodiment. Accordingly, the description of the other operations of the image-processing system of the first embodiment will not be repeated.","The second embodiment is advantageous in the identification information can be obtained by \u2018scanning\u2019 the display unit  of the MFP  with the mobile phone . In embodiments where the generated number itself is not displayed, it is more difficult, in a case that there is a queue of users waiting to use the MFP , for another user to make use of the identification information if they are not directly in front of the MFP . The second embodiment also has the advantage that it requires fewer button presses for a user and in that it speeds up the overall scanning method.","In a third embodiment of the invention, the identification information is generated based on GPS co-ordinates of the MFP . The MFP  generates a session at the application server  and stores in the session a first predetermined number of the GPS co-ordinates identifying the location of the MFP .","In a case that a user wishes to scan from the MFP , the user places the mobile phone  on the MFP  and opens the scandroid application on the mobile phone. The scandroid application accesses a GPS unit on the mobile phone  and identifies GPS coordinates identifying the mobile phone's position. The scandroid application on the mobile phone  selects the first predetermined number of GPS coordinates and uses these coordinates as identification information to identify the session for registering as the destination device. As the mobile phone  and the MFP  are in the same location (the mobile phone  is resting on the MFP ) the identification information registered for the MFP  matches the identification information generated by the mobile phone  allowing the mobile phone  and MFP  to use the same session.","The identification information can be selected to be the first predetermined number of digits of the GPS position in any coordinate format. The predetermined number of coordinates should preferably be selected so that the location of the MFP  is identified to within a reasonable degree of accuracy. If too many coordinates are selected and the degree of accuracy is too high, the mobile phone  and MFP may not agree on their locations and they will not generate the same identification information. This will cause the image-processing system to fail. On the other hand, if too few digits of the GPS location are used, there may be a problem that two or more MFPs try to use the same identification information. This problem can be overcome by displaying a list of MFPs  registered in the session on the display unit  of the mobile phone  and allowing the user to select the appropriate MFP . In many cases, the predetermined number of coordinates should specify accuracy to within a few meters.","In order to overcome the problems identified above in the third embodiment, the fourth embodiment makes use of proximity in order to allow the mobile phone  to access the same session as the MFP .","In the fourth embodiment, the web server  sends a request to generate a session at the application server  and registers the MFP  as a source device in the generated session. The request from the web server  includes coordinates identifying the location of the MFP , which are stored in the generated session by the application server .","When he or she wants to scan, the user brings the mobile phone  close to the MFP  and starts the scandroid application on the mobile phone . The scandroid application on the mobile phone  sends a request to register the mobile phone  as the destination device to the application server , including coordinates of its location identified from the built in GPS unit.","When the application server  receives the registration request from the mobile phone , it searches the sessions in the database in order to identify sessions with registered source devices that are located within a predetermined range of the mobile phone. The predetermined range may be, say, 5 meters.","If the application server finds no sessions with source devices within the predetermined range of the mobile phone , the application sends the mobile phone  an error message and the connection process fails.","If the application server  finds a single session with a source device within the predetermined range of the mobile phone , the application server  identifies the session in which the source device is registered as the appropriate session and registers the mobile phone  as the destination device for that session.","If the application server  finds more than one session including a source device located within the predetermined range of the mobile phone , the application server  returns information indicating the identity of the sessions and corresponding source devices within range of the mobile phone . Upon receipt of this information the mobile phone  displays a list of the sessions and corresponding source devices on the mobile phone  in order to allow a user to select the appropriate source device from which he or she wishes to use to scan. Once the user has selected the appropriate session and source device, the selection is sent from the mobile phone  to the application server  and the application server registers the mobile phone  as the destination device in the appropriate session.","After the mobile phone  is registered as destination device in the appropriate session, the method proceeds as previously described in connection with the first embodiment. The image-processing apparatus of the fourth embodiment allows easier operation in a case where there are multiple MFPs in a small area and allows the user to select the appropriate MFP  to scan from.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["10","13","10","13"]},"Similar to the first and second embodiments, the web server  sends a request to register the MFP  at the application server  using a generated random number. The application server  receives this request and generates a session with identification information corresponding to the generated number. This process is automatically performed on a daily basis, with a new session with different identification information being generated overnight when the coffee shop is closed. As with the second embodiment, the identification information is encoded in a barcode. However, in the fourth embodiment, the barcode is generated at the application server  and is sent to a till  in the coffee shop.","In a case that a user wishes to print to and\/or scan from the MFP , the user needs to make a purchase at the till . The ability to use the coffee shop's MFP  may be subject a separate charge or provided as a complimentary service to the coffee shop's customers. When the user has made an appropriate purchase, the user is given a receipt with the barcode printed on it.","At this stage, as the user has walked in from the street, the mobile phone does not know the address of the application server that it should contact with a request. The address information may be configured on the user's phone in one of several different ways. Firstly, the application-server address information may be displayed in the coffee shop and the user may enter this information into a scandroid application on the mobile phone  manually. Alternatively, different versions of the scandroid application may be available for download to the user's mobile phone with the application server details already pre-configured within it. For example, the user may download a scandroid application that allows printing and\/or scanning within a particular chain of coffee shops, the downloaded scandroid application having the details of the application server  for that serves the MFPs  of that chain of coffee shops pre-configured. A third way of configuring the address of the application server  is to provide the address of the application server  in a barcode on the till receipt. In such embodiments, the till receipt includes two barcodes, a first barcode that encodes information about the address of the application server and a second barcode that encodes identification information of the session for accessing MFP .","In order to print or scan, the user opens the appropriate scandroid application on the mobile phone  and scans the barcode on the till receipt in the manner described in connection with the second embodiment. If the address of the server is to be obtained by scanning a separate barcode on the till receipt, the scanning process involves two scanning steps, a first in which the barcode encoding the address of the application server  is read and decoded by the mobile phone  and a second in which the barcode encoding the identification information is read and decoded by the mobile phone .","The embodiment then proceeds as described previously to allow the user to print to and\/or scan from the MFP . As noted above, the identification information is automatically changed on a daily basis, so that a user may use the barcode on his or her receipt to print and\/or scan on the day of purchase, but will not be able to print or scan on another day because the identification information encoded in the barcode will have changed and the mobile phone  will fail to find the session of the MFP  on the application server .","In contrast to the first embodiment, the fourth embodiment involves communication across multiple networks. The MFP  and web server  communicate with each other via a LAN internal to the coffee shop. The application server  is connected to the internet and is accessible by the web server  and the mobile phone  via a web interface.","Embodiments of the present invention have been described above in which data is transferred between the MFP  and the mobile phone  over a Wi-Fi network. However, this is not necessarily the case and many other types of connection could be used. In some other embodiments the data is uploaded and\/or downloaded between the mobile phone  and the MFP  via the web server . The mobile phone sends and receives data from the web server  using FTP over a 3G connection on the mobile phone . In such embodiments the data is transferred to or from the MFP  by the web server  via a LAN using FTP or HTTP.","The embodiments above have described scanning documents placed on the image reader  of the MFP  and sending the scanned document to the mobile phone . However, in another embodiment the user may scatter a collection of business cards on the image reader  of the MFP . In this embodiment, as before, the MFP  performs a scanning operation in response to a user's command entered on the MFP's user interface and invoked via the MFP's SOAP\/HTTP interface. However, instead of immediately sending the scanned image data to the mobile phone  via FTP, the scanned data is first sent to the web server . The web server receives the scanned data and makes use of OCR and form recognition software installed on the web server . The form recognition software recognizes that the received scanned image corresponds to a collection of business cards and the OCR software identifies details on the business cards such as name, telephone number, address, etc. The web server  then converts the extracted data into a business card format, such as vcard. The extracted vcard details are then embedded in a web page and the sent to the MFP  for display. The user then looks at the displayed web page on the display unit  to confirm the accuracy of the extracted vcard details before selecting a send option in the displayed web page. Selection of the send option by the user causes FTP transfer of the business cards in the vcard format to the mobile phone  using the FTP transfer method previously described in connection with the transfer of scanned image data. An advantage of this embodiment is that the vcard details (in XML format) are more useful and significantly smaller in size that the original document scanned by the MFP .","The first to fourth embodiments of the present invention include a separate MFP, web server, application server, and database. However, in other embodiments of the invention the function of the web server may be included in the MFP.","In yet further embodiments the function of the application server may be included in the MFP. In such embodiments, the image processing system may include a plurality of MFPs and one of the MFPs may be configured to act as the application server, performing the function of the application server described above in the embodiments.
