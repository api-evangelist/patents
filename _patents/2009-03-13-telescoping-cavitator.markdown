title: Telescoping cavitator
abstract: A high speed underwater projectile configuration that includes a cylindrical telescoping cavitator design capable of providing projectile nose shape change where such change to the projectile nose tip geometry results in supercavitation and a concomitant vaporous cavity in the water that reduces projectile drag resistance while maximizing projectile range and where the projectile nose tip further includes a retractable cavitator piston feature. The projectile nose is designed to house a cylindrical cavitator piston that protrudes forward from the projectile and is held in place until launch. Velocity induced hydrodynamic forces on the forward face of this cavitator piston cause the piston to start moving aft and to gradually cause the piston to retract into the projectile nose, until a larger, secondary cavitator is exposed to the vaporous cavity.

The projectile nose is designed to house a cylindrical cavitator piston that protrudes forward from the projectile at launch. Velocity induced forces on this cavitator piston cause the piston to gradually retract into the projectile nose, until a larger, secondary cavitator is exposed to the vaporous cavity.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","The U.S. Navy is developing underwater gun systems for use in anti-mine and anti-torpedo operations. A basic gun system includes underwater ballistic projectiles, an underwater gun, a ship-mounted turret, a targeting system, and a combat system. The underwater gun shoots the underwater projectiles that are specially designed for rapid neutralization of undersea targets at relatively long ranges of up to 200 meters. The undersea targets are identified and localized with specialized targeting systems, and the combat system provides the control commands to direct the ship-mounted turret to point the gun towards the target.","Referring now to , there is shown a typical prior art tapered supercavitating projectile generally identified as . Projectile , once fired from an underwater gun, can accurately travel relatively large distances by making use of the phenomenon known as the supercavitation effect. Supercavitation occurs when projectile body  travels through water  at very high speeds and a vaporous cavity  forms at its forward tip . With proper projectile design, the vaporous cavity can extend back beyond the projectile back end  so as to envelop the entire projectile. Because the enveloped projectile is not in direct contact with the water, excluding the small cavitator tip and an occasional collision with the cavity wall, known as \u201ctail slap\u201d, the viscous drag on projectile body  is significantly reduced over the drag that would be experienced by a fully wetted projectile body.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","b ","a "],"b":["40","16","40","16","40","42","44","46","16","44","16","16","42","46"]},"The difficulty with this fixed geometry approach is that very tight tolerances must be maintained in the location and size of the secondary cavitator  for it to be effective. If cavitator  is too large or placed too far forward it will interfere with cavity generation by the primary cavitatator . If it is too far aft or too small, it will never engage the cavity boundary and the cavity will close on the afterbody  of projectile  rather than on secondary cavitator .","What is needed is to improve the stepped cavitator concept in such a way as to improve its effectiveness throughout the supercavitating projectile's flight.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide a telescoping primary cavitator disposed within a high speed projectile nose;","It is a further object that the telescoping primary cavitator controllably and smoothly transitions a formed vaporous supercavitation cavity to a secondary cavitator while in flight;","Another object is to have the primary cavitator recede into the projectile nose at a controlled rate so as to maintain the drag reducing cavity over the projectile body for as long as possible;","These objects are accomplished with the present invention by providing a high speed underwater projectile configuration that includes a cylindrical telescoping cavitator design capable of providing projectile nose shape change where such change to the projectile nose tip geometry results in supercavitation and a concomitant vaporous cavity in the water that reduces projectile drag resistance while maximizing projectile range and where the projectile nose tip further includes a retractable cavitator piston feature. The projectile nose is designed to house a cylindrical cavitator piston that protrudes forward from the projectile and is held in place until launch. Velocity induced hydrodynamic forces on the forward face of this cavitator piston cause the piston to start moving aft and to gradually cause the piston to retract into the projectile nose, until a larger, secondary cavitator is exposed to the vaporous cavity.","With reference to the above described drawings wherein like numerals represent like parts throughout the several figures, there is shown a telescoping cavitator piston system in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.","Rather than relying on the velocity decay of a high speed projectile to engage a secondary cavitator, a variable geometry configuration is now described where the primary cavitator is movable and is allowed to transit backwards at a controlled rate as the projectile travels through the water. The combined action of changes in the forward cavitator geometry and the reduction in size of the vaporous cavity due to projectile slowing induce the secondary cavitator to engage the vaporous cavity at precisely the desired point in the projectile trajectory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["100","102","104","106","102","108","104","104","16","102","102","102","108","16","104","5","110","108","102","102","110","110","108","102","108","110","102"]},"The time during projectile flight at which secondary cavitator  is engaged by the flow is determined by the rate at which the piston cavitator retracts into the projectile nose. This rate in turn is controlled by the size of the annulus D-d, the viscosity of the constrained fluid and the motion produced load f on the piston cavitator  face.","The design of the primary cavitator  of the present invention has the advantage of producing low drag at high speeds, but the projectile decelerates during flight and at some point cavitator  becomes too small to sustain the vaporous cavity and hence high speed projectile flight. At this point secondary cavitator  is engaged and the larger vaporous cavity is sustained for a considerably longer period.","The primary advantage of the telescoping cavitator design described here is that it provides significantly longer range and accuracy as compared to the limited range and accuracy of existing fixed cavitator high speed underwater projectiles because the vaporous cavity is sustained longer.","What has thus been described is a high speed underwater projectile configuration that includes a cylindrical telescoping cavitator design capable of providing projectile nose shape change where such change to the projectile nose tip geometry results in supercavitation and a concomitant vaporous cavity in the water that reduces projectile drag resistance while maximizing projectile range and where the projectile nose tip further includes a retractable cavitator piston feature. The projectile nose is designed to house a cylindrical cavitator piston that protrudes forward from the projectile and is held in place until launch. Velocity induced hydrodynamic forces on the forward face of this cavitator piston cause the piston to start moving aft and to gradually cause the piston to retract into the projectile nose, until a larger, secondary cavitator is exposed to the vaporous cavity.","Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example: a method of restraining the piston cavitator in its forward position prior to flight can be included. Any adhesive or highly viscous sealant or mechanical detent that releases under launch loads would serve such a purpose well; also multiple stages of telescoping pistons can be used to provide improved performance.","In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 2","i":["a ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 3&4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
