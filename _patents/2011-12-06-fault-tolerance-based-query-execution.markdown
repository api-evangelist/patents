{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments generally relate to computer systems, and more particularly to methods and systems for executing queries.","Complex event processing (CEP) is a technology for enabling the information contained in the events, flowing through various layers of the enterprise IT infrastructure, to be discovered, understood in terms of its impact on high level management goals and business processes, and acted upon in real time. CEP provides the ability to analyze high-volume and high-speed event streams. The event streams may include financial data feeds, any continuous stream of events of a similar type or the like.","A CEP system is typically used for performing CEP on the event streams\/data. The CEP system receives several user queries from users for processing the event streams\/data. CEP system shares many aspects with traditional database systems, including multi-query optimization. A typical multi query optimization approach involves obtaining a query plan for the queries by identifying similar sub query graphs in the received queries and reusing the result produced by the sub query graphs for determining the final query results. The CEP system then maps the query plan to physical or virtual nodes.","A drawback of using the multi-query optimization approach in the CEP system is that whenever one of these nodes crash the query located on the crashed node stops processing data. Further, due to the multi-query optimization, the query affected by the crashed node may be needed by multiple other queries. This leads to an avalanche-like propagation of the failure, where queries running on non-crashed nodes also cannot process data as they are dependent on the query located on the crashed node.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for fault tolerance based query execution are described herein.","In one aspect, plurality of queries are received from a user. The plurality of queries including one or more operators.","In another aspect, based on the received plurality of queries, a fault tolerance degree is determined for the one or more operators.","In still another aspect, based on the determined fault tolerance degree, one or more nodes are assigned to the one or more operators.","In still another aspect, the received plurality of queries are executed by the assigned one or more nodes.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for fault tolerance based query execution are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

The fault tolerance degree of the operator may represent the relative importance of the operator, among the operators included in the queries received at block , for execution of the queries received at block . In one embodiment, the fault tolerance degree of an operator is equal to the number of queries dependent on the operator. In the above example, two queries (queries  and ) are dependent on the filter operator f(a) (as both include the filter operator f(a)) and only one query (query ) is dependent on the filter operator f(b) and the join operator f(a)f(b). Therefore, the fault tolerance degree for the filter operator f(a) is determined as 2 and the fault tolerance degree for the filter operator f(b) and the join operator f(a)f(b) is determined as 1.","Next at block , nodes are assigned to each of the operators in the queries received at block . The nodes are assigned to the operators for executing the operators. The nodes may be a physical node, for example, a computer, or a virtual node. The nodes are assigned to the operators based on the fault tolerance degree of the operators determined at block . The number of nodes assigned to the operator may be equal to the fault tolerance degree of the operator. In the above example, two nodes may be assigned to the filter operator f(a) as the fault tolerance for the filter operator f(a) is 2, and one node each may be assigned to the filter operator f(b) and the join operator f(a)f(b). As both queries  and  are dependent on the filter operator f(a) for their execution, both the queries  and  would be executed even if one of the nodes assigned to the filter operator f(a) crash.","Finally at block , the queries received at block  are executed by the nodes assigned at block . In the above example, the filter operator f(a) is executed simultaneously by both the nodes, in case both are working, assigned to the filter operator f(a). The result obtained from one of the two assigned nodes is determined as the result of the filter operator f(a). The obtained result of the filter operator f(a) may then be re-used and joined with the result of filter operator f(b) to obtain the result of the query .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2A-B","b":["200","202"]},"As discussed above, the received queries may be a code for performing operations on the data. The received queries may include operators which in combination process the data. The operators may be, for example, a split operator, a map operator, a gather operator, a filter operator, a join operator, etc. For example, consider a \u201cquery A\u201d (f(a)f(b)f(c)) and a \u201cquery B\u201d (f(a)f(b)) received from a user. The \u201cquery A\u201d includes three filter operators: f(a), f(b), and f(c) for filtering data streams a, b, and c, respectively. The \u201cquery A\u201d also includes two join operators: f(a)f(b) and f(a)f(b)f(c). The \u201cquery B\u201d includes two filter operators f(a) and f(b) for filtering data streams a and b, respectively and one join operator: f(a)f(b). The user may also provide the requested query fault tolerance for \u201cquery A\u201d as 1 and the requested query fault tolerance for \u201cquery B\u201d as 2.","Next at block , a multi-query optimization is performed on the operators included in the queries received at block . Multi-query optimization is a technique for optimizing the execution of the queries received by the CEP system at block . In one embodiment, multi-query optimization optimizes the execution of the queries (received at block ) by reducing the number of queries concurrently running in the CEP system. The multi-query optimization may reduce the number of queries by identifying identical sub-queries within a query plan, and re-using the results obtained from executing the identical sub-queries for executing the queries. A query plan is obtained for executing the operators included in the queries (received at block ) after performing the multi-query optimization. In one embodiment, the query plan is defined as a set of all queries submitted by users to the CEP system and active at a given moment of time after the multi-query optimization. The query plan includes an ordered set of steps for executing the operators to execute the queries. The query plan may include sub-queries which are a subset of the query plan. In the above example, a multi-query optimization may be performed on the filter operators f(a), f(b), and f(c) and the join operators f(a)f(b) and f(a)f(b)f(c) included in the \u201cquery A\u201d and the \u201cquery B.\u201d The filter operator (f(a)f(b)) identical in both the \u201cquery A\u201d (f(a)f(b)) and the \u201cquery B\u201d (f(a)f(b)f(c)) is identified as the identical sub-query in the query plan. According to the query plan, initially, the filter operator f(a), and the filter operator f(b) are to be executed. Next, a join operation is to be performed on the results obtained from the filter operator f(a) and the filter operator f(b) to execute the join operator f(a)f(b) (identical sub-query). The result of the identical sub query f(a)f(b) is the query result for \u201cquery B\u201d. To optimize the multi-query, the result of the identical sub query f(a)f(b) is then re-used and joined with the result of the filter operator f(c) to execute the filter operator (f(a)f(b)f(c)). The result of execution of the filter operator (f(a)f(b)f(c)) is the result of the \u201cquery B\u201d.","Next, at block , a determination is made whether the requested query fault tolerance is received, from the user, for the queries received at block . In case, the requested query fault tolerance is received for the queries (e.g., condition in block  is true) a fault tolerance degree is determined for each of the operators included in the query plan, based on the requested query fault tolerance degree of the queries (block ). In one embodiment, the fault tolerance degree of an operator is determined, based on the requested query fault tolerance, by traversing the query plan to identify if any of the descendant operators of the operator, in the query plan, is an end operator for a query. The descendant operators are operators encountered by the operator when traversing the query plan. The descendent operator is an end operator when the result of execution of the descendent operator is a query result of one of the queries (received at block ). The requested fault tolerance of the queries corresponding to the identified descendant operators (identified as end operators) are compared with each other to determine the requested query fault tolerance having the highest value. Finally, the requested query fault tolerance having the highest value is determined as the fault tolerance degree of the operator. In the above example, the descendant operators for the filter operator f(a) is the join operators f(a)f(b) and f(a)f(b)f(c) which are encountered when traversing the query plan. The join operators f(a)f(b) and f(a)f(b)f(c) are end operators for the \u201cquery B\u201d and the \u201cquery A\u201d, respectively, as executing the join operator f(a)f(b) and the join operator f(a)f(b)f(c) executes the \u201cquery B\u201d and the \u201cquery A\u201d, respectively. As both the join operators f(a)f(b) and f(a)f(b)f(c) are end operators for the \u201cquery B\u201d and the \u201cquery A\u201d, respectively, the requested query fault tolerances 2 and 1 corresponding to the \u201cquery B\u201d and the \u201cquery A\u201d, respectively, are compared with each other. Based on the comparison it is determined that the requested query fault tolerance (2) of \u201cquery B\u201d has the highest value. Finally, the highest requested query fault tolerance (2) of the \u201cquery B\u201d is determined as the fault tolerance degree of the filter operator f(a). Similarly, the fault tolerance degree of operators f(b), f(a)f(b), f(c) and f(a)f(b)f(c) are determined as 2, 2, 1 and 1, respectively.","In case the requested query fault tolerance of the queries is not received (condition in block  is false) a query outdegree is calculated for each of the operators included in the query plan (block ). The query outdegree of the operator is a representation of the number of queries dependent on the operator. In one embodiment, the query outdegree of the operator is the number of queries including the operator. The query outdegree of the operator may be calculated by traversing the query plan and determining if any of the descendant operators of the operator is of type \u201cquery\u201d. In one embodiment, the descendant operator is of type \u201cquery\u201d when the output of execution of the operator is a query result. For each descendant operator of the operator that is of type \u201cquery\u201d the count of the query outdegree (which is initialized to 0) of the operator is incremented by 1. The count obtained after traversing the query plan is determined as the query outdegree of the operator. The calculation of the query outdegree is done recursively and assumes that the query plan forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In one embodiment, a DAG is a directed graph with no directed cycles. For example, a DAG may be formed by a collection of vertices and directed edges, each edge connecting one vertex to another, such that there is no way to start at some vertex v and follow a sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again. Further, it assumes that the terminating vertices in the query plan DAG are of type query.","In the above example, for the filter operator f(a) the join operators f(a)f(b) and f(a)f(b)f(c) are descendent operators, which are encountered by the filter operator f(a) when traversing the query plan. When the query plan is traversed, it is determined that the join operator (f(a)f(b)) is of type \u201cquery\u201d (as the output of execution of the join operator (f(a)f(b)) is the query result of query B). As the join operator (f(a)f(b)) is of type \u201cquery\u201d the count of the query outdegree for the filter operator f(a), which is initially 0, is incremented by 1. Next, the join operator f(a)f(b)f(c) is encountered, which again is of type \u201cquery\u201d (as the output of executing the join operator f(a)f(b)f(c) is the query result of query A). Therefore, the query outdegree for the filter operator f(a) is again incremented by 1 to obtain a value of 2. As there are no more descendent operators of the filter operator f(a), the calculated query outdegree (2), obtained after traversing the query plan, is determined as the query outdegree of the filter operator f(a). Similarly, the query outdegree for the operators f(b), f(a)f(b), f(c) and f(a)f(b)f(c) is determined as 2, 2, 1 and 1, respectively. In one embodiment, the calculated query outdegree is normalized for the total number of queries in the CEP system to obtain a normalized query outdegree for the operator. The normalized query outdegree is calculated by the formula:\n\nNormalized query outdegree of the operator=query outdegree of the operator\/number of queries in the system.\n\nA normalized query outdegree value of 1 indicates that the output of the operator is being used by all the queries in the CEP system. In the above example, the normalized query outdegree value for the filter operator f(a) is 1 (query outdegree (2)\/total number of queries (2)). Similarly, the normalized query outdegree for the operators f(b), f(a)f(b), f(c) and f(a)f(b)f(c) are determined as 1, 1, 0.5, and 0.5, respectively.\n","Next at block , a fault tolerance degree for the operators in the query plan is determined, based on the query outdegree of the operators calculated at block . As discussed above, the fault tolerance degree of the operator may represent the importance of the operator for executing the queries in the query plan. In one embodiment, the calculated query outdegree of the operator is determined as the fault tolerance degree (one-to-one assignment) of the operator. In the above example, the query outdegree for the operators f(a), f(b), f(a)f(b), f(c) and f(a)f(b)f(c) is determined as 2, 2, 2, 1 and 1, respectively (same as the query outdegree of these operators, based on the one-to-one assignment).","Next, at block , number of nodes to be assigned to each of the operators in the query plan are determined based on the fault tolerance degree of the operator (which is determined either based on the requested query fault tolerance (block ) or based on the query outdegree (block )). The query fault tolerance degree of the operator may be determined as the number of nodes to be assigned to the operator. In one embodiment, the number of nodes to be assigned to the operator is determined based on the availability of nodes for executing the queries. For example a determination may be made to assign a higher number of nodes to an operator having a higher fault tolerance degree and a lower of nodes to an operator having a lower fault tolerance value. In the above example, based on the determined fault tolerance degree of the operators, the number of nodes to be assigned to the operators f(a), f(b), f(a)f(b), f(c) and f(a)f(b)f(c) are determined as 2, 2, 2, 1 and 1, respectively.","Next at block , nodes are assigned to the operators in the query plan based on the determined number of nodes to be assigned to the operators (determined at block ). For example, a pool of physical nodes or virtual nodes is available to the CEP system. Based on the determined number of nodes (at block) to be assigned to the operator one or more nodes from the pool of nodes are assigned to the operator. Each operator in the query plan may be assigned at least one node from the pool of nodes. The nodes are assigned to the operator for executing the operator. In the above example, a node  and a node  are assigned to the filter operator f(a) (based on the determined number of nodes  to be assigned to the filter operator f(a)), a node  and a node  are assigned to the filter operator f(b) (based on the determined number of nodes  to be assigned to the filter operator f(b)), a node  and a node  are assigned to the join operator f(a)f(b) (based on the determined number of nodes  to be assigned to the join operator f(a)f(b)), a node  is assigned to the filter operator f(c) (based on the determined number of nodes  to be assigned to the filter operator f(c)), and a node  is assigned to the join operator f(a)f(b)f(c) (based on the determined number of nodes  to be assigned to the join operator f(a)f(b)f(c)).","Finally, the queries received at block  are executed by executing the operators in the query plan (block ). The operators in the query plan are executed by the nodes assigned to the operators in block . In one embodiment, if more than one nodes is assigned to an operator then the operator is executed simultaneously by each of the assigned nodes. The result obtained from one of the nodes (simultaneously executing the operator) may then be used for executing the operators dependent on this operator. Simultaneously executing the operator by more than one nodes ensures that the queries (received at block ) are executed even if one of these nodes crash. The operators may be executed in an order defined by the query plan. In the above example, the nodes - and the nodes - simultaneously execute the filter operator f(a) and the filter operator f(b), respectively. Output originating from one of the nodes  and , and one of the nodes  and  is then provided to the nodes  and . The nodes  and  then simultaneously execute the join operator f(a)f(b). The output obtained from one of the nodes  and  is the result of execution of the query B. Next, the output obtained from one of the nodes  and , and the output obtained from node  (which execute the filter operator f(c)) is provided to the node  which executes the join operator f(a)f(b)f(c). The output obtained from the node  is the result of execution of the query A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG.

These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments of the invention may include remote procedure calls or web services being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions. The term \u201ccomputer readable storage medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media that stores one or more sets of instructions. The term \u201ccomputer readable storage medium\u201d should be taken to include any physical article that is capable of undergoing a set of physical changes to physically store, encode, or otherwise carry a set of instructions for execution by a computer system which causes the computer system to perform any of the methods or process steps described, represented, or illustrated herein. Examples of computer readable storage media include, but are not limited to: magnetic media, such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROMs, DVDs and holographic devices; magneto-optical media; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and execute, such as application-specific integrated circuits (\u201cASICs\u201d), programmable logic devices (\u201cPLDs\u201d) and ROM and RAM devices. Examples of computer readable instructions include machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher-level code that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example, an embodiment of the invention may be implemented using Java, C++, or other object-oriented programming language and development tools. Another embodiment of the invention may be implemented in hard-wired circuitry in place of, or in combination with machine readable software instructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","702","722","700","716","722","704","706","704","706","702","706","700","710","712","700","710","712","700","714","700","720","720","700","718","700","708","724","724","724","720","724"]},"A data source is an information resource.
