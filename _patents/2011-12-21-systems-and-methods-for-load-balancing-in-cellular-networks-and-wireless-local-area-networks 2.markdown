{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","Overview","Example Embodiments"],"p":["The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/332,804, filed Dec. 21, 2011, by Goerke et al., entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LOAD BASED OPTIMIZATION IN COMMUNICATION NETWORKS\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for load balancing in heterogeneous radio system deployments, for example between cellular networks and wireless local area networks (WLANs).","Wireless networks are telecommunication networks that use radio waves to carry information from one node in the network to one or more receiving nodes in the network. Cellular telephony is characterized by the use of radio cells that provide radio coverage for a geographic area, with multiple cells arranged to provide contiguous radio coverage over a larger area. Wired communication can also be used in portions of a wireless network, such as between cells or access points. Wireless communication technologies are used in connection with many user equipment, including, for example, satellite communications systems, portable digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, and mobile devices (e.g., cellular telephones). Such devices can connect to a network (e.g., the Internet) as long as the user is within range of such a wireless communication technology.","The increase in data traffic is straining wireless network operators' existing packet core elements. The increase in data traffic can overload network devices in wireless networks, and it may even cause wireless network service disruptions. The demand for data over wireless networks is not expected to slow, especially as mobile devices become more sophisticated and as users become more dependent on mobile devices.","Certain embodiments disclose a method that includes receiving a wireless network condition message that includes data load information associated with a base station in the wireless network, for example a cellular network. The method can also include receiving a wireless local area network (WLAN) condition message that includes data load information associated with an access point in a WLAN. The method further includes identifying a physical location of the base station and the access point and identifying which of the base station and the access point is capable of providing network service to a user equipment. The method can include triggering data load information associated with the identified base station and the identified access point to be sent to the user equipment.","Network operators can address the rapid increase in data traffic by correspondingly increasing the network capacity. One way to increase the network capacity is by deploying parallel communication networks using dissimilar radio technology. For example, a network operator can deploy both a cellular communication network and a wireless local area network (WLAN) in a single region so that a portion of the data traffic is serviced through a cellular communication network and the rest of the data traffic is serviced through a WLAN. In some cases, a network operator can leverage a WLAN that is operated by a third-party. If a WLAN is already deployed in a certain area, the network operator can offload data traffic from the cellular network to the WLAN. In another example, a network operator can deploy two parallel cellular networks but using two different technologies. For instance, the network operator can deploy a Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based cellular network that provides islands of hot spot coverage within a wide area Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) 2000-based cellular network.","One issue with a parallel communication system is efficiency. A communication network is often designed to be a stand-alone system. Therefore, parallel, independent communication networks do not balance data load across the networks. Such an independent operation of communication networks can be particularly inefficient when one of the networks is heavily utilized while other networks are under-utilized.","For example, suppose that a cellular network and a WLAN are deployed in a certain region. When a mobile device enters this region with parallel communication networks, the mobile device can detect two parallel communication networks and decide to attach to one of the two parallel networks. Because a WLAN is often faster than a cellular network, a mobile device can decide to attach to the WLAN instead of the cellular network.","Such a network selection strategy, based on prior knowledge about communication networks, can be sufficiently efficient if this mobile device was the only mobile device operating in the region. However, if there are hundreds of other mobile devices operating in that region, this network selection strategy may not be sufficiently efficient. In fact, such a strategy could potentially over-utilize the WLAN and under-utilize the cellular network to the extent that the WLAN speed falls below the cellular network speed.","Mobile devices could use the data load information of parallel communication networks to determine which one of the two networks to attach to. For example, a mobile device can be configured to attach to one of the least utilized networks. However, receiving data load information from each of the parallel communication networks can disrupt mobile devices' on-going data communication. Oftentimes, a mobile device is not equipped to access parallel communication networks simultaneously due to hardware constraints. Therefore, to receive data load information from each of the parallel communication networks, a mobile device has to (1) detach from the current network, (2) attach to the network of interest, (3) receive data load information from the attached network, and (4) iterate steps - until the mobile device receives data load information from all the parallel networks. Because the mobile device would detach itself from the current network, the mobile device has to halt any on-going data communication until it receives data load information from all the parallel networks. This can be detrimental to the data communication efficiency, especially when the mobile device supports a plurality of communication network technologies and is configured to receive the data load information frequently.","The disclosed systems and methods illustrate a mechanism for balancing data load across parallel communication networks. In particular, the disclosed systems and methods are directed to providing mobile devices with parallel networks' data load information so that mobile devices can determine which one of the parallel networks to attach to. Certain embodiments of the disclosed systems and methods illustrate how to efficiently provide data load information to mobile devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","112","1","134"]},"The access network  can communicate with an access gateway  that implements a combination of functionalities such as a packet data serving node (PDSN), a HRPD serving gateway (HSGW), and a serving gateway (SGW). In operation, the PDSN functionality can be used with 1\u00d7RTT , the HSGW functionality can be used with HRPD  and eHRPD , and the SGW functionality can be used with the eNodeB . The access gateway  can communicate with an anchor gateway , which can implement a packet data network gateway (PGW) and a Home Agent (HA), and a mobility management entity (MME) . On the access network side, the anchor gateway  can also communicate with an evolved packet data gateway (ePDG)  that provides connectivity to the WLAN\/Femto\/other transceiver -. On the packet core side, the anchor gateway can communicate with the operator's IP service domain , the Internet , and IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) . An authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server\/home subscriber server (HSS)  can communicate with the access gateway , the anchor gateway , or both.","The Home Subscriber Server (HSS)  can be a master user database that supports IMS network entities that handle calls. The HSS  stores subscription-related information (subscriber profiles), performs authentication and authorization of the user, and can provide information about the subscriber's location and IP information. The HSS  also maintains binding information on which gateway is currently serving a UE. Even when the UE  is detached from the network, the HSS  maintains the binding information until the UE  re-attaches itself and updates the binding information. The AAA server  can provide authentication, access control, and accounting to the network. The authentication can involve verification of the subscriber, the access control can involve granting or denying access to specific services, and the accounting that can take place is the tracking of the use of network resources by subscribers. Other servers, such as the Home Location Register (HLR) can be used in other embodiments. In certain embodiments, the AAA\/HSS  can communicate with the access gateway  for charging purposes.","The LTE communication network includes a PDN gateway (PGW) , a serving gateway (SGW) , an E-UTRAN (evolved-UMTS terrestrial radio access network) , and a mobility management entity (MME) . The evolved packet core (EPC) of an LTE communication network includes the MME , SGW  and PGW  components. In some embodiments, one or more EPC components can be implemented on the same gateway or chassis as described below.","The SGW sits in the user plane where it forwards and routes packets to and from the eNodeB and PGW. The SGW also serves as the local mobility anchor for inter-eNodeB handover and mobility between 3GPP networks. The SGW routes and forwards user data packets, while also acting as the mobility anchor for the user plane during inter-eNB handovers and as the anchor for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies (terminating S4 interface and relaying the traffic between 2G\/3G systems and PGW). For idle state UEs, the SGW terminates the down link data path and triggers paging when down link data arrives for the UE. The SGW manages and stores UE contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service and network internal routing information. The SGW also performs replication of the user traffic in case of lawful interception.","The PGW acts as the interface between the LTE network and other packet data networks, such as the Internet or SIP-based IMS networks (fixed and mobile). The PGW serves as the anchor point for intra-3GPP network mobility, as well as mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP networks. The PGW acts as the Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF), which manages Quality of Service (QoS), online\/offline flow-based charging data generation, deep-packet inspection, and lawful intercept. The PGW provides connectivity to the UE to external packet data networks by being the point of exit and entry of traffic for the UE. A UE may have simultaneous connectivity with more than one PGW for accessing multiple packet data networks. The PGW performs policy enforcement, packet filtering for each user, charging support, lawful interception, and packet screening. The PGW also provides an anchor for mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP technologies such as WiMAX and 3GPP2 standards (CDMA 1\u00d7 and EVDO).","The MME resides in the EPC control plane and manages session states, authentication, paging, mobility with 3GPP 2G\/3G nodes, roaming, and other bearer management functions. The MME can be a standalone element or integrated with other EPC elements, including the SGW, PGW, and Release 8 Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). The MME can also be integrated with 2G\/3G elements, such as the SGSN and GGSN. This integration is the key to mobility and session management interworking between 2G\/3G and 4G mobile networks.","MME  is a control-node for the LTE access network. The MME is responsible for UE tracking and paging procedures including retransmissions. MME  handles the bearer activation\/deactivation process and is also responsible for choosing the SGW for a UE at the initial attach and at time of an intra-LTE handover. The MME also authenticates the user by interacting with the HSS . The MME also generates and allocates temporary identities to UEs and terminates Network Access Server (NAS) signaling. The MME checks the authorization of the UE to camp on the service provider's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and enforces UE roaming restrictions. The MME is the termination point in the network for ciphering\/integrity protection for NAS signaling and handles the security key management. Lawful interception of signaling is also supported by the MME. The MME also provides the control plane function for mobility between LTE and 2G\/3G access networks with the S3 interface terminating at the MME from the SGSN (not shown). The MME also terminates the S6a interface towards the home HSS for roaming UEs.","The ePDG\/HeNB  is responsible for interworking between the EPC and fixed untrusted non-3GPP access technologies such as a WLAN, WiMAX, LTE metro, and femtocell access networks. The ePDG\/HeNB  can use IPSec\/IKEv2 to provide secure access to the EPC network. Optionally, the ePDG\/HeNB  can use Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to interact with the PGW when the mobile subscriber is roaming in an untrusted non-3GPP system. The ePDG is involved in tunnel authentication and authorization, transport level packet marking in the uplink, policy enforcement of Quality of Service (QoS) based on information received via Authorization, Authentication, Accounting (AAA) infrastructure, lawful interception, and other functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","200","204","202","206","208","204","208","212","214","134","112","2","228","228","122","228","116"]},"In some embodiments, the efficient mechanism for balancing data load across parallel communication networks can be implemented on gateways, such as PGW\/HA , PDSN\/HSGW\/SGW , SGSN\/MME , PGW\/GGSN , or SGW . The gateways can access and maintain information relating to the communication session, the subscriber, the radio bearers, and the policies relating to the communication session. The gateways may be used to provide various services to a UE  and implement the quality of service (QoS) on packet flows. Several of these functions are used in providing, for example, voice over IP (VoIP) routing and enhanced services, such as enhanced charging, stateful firewalls, and traffic performance optimization (TPO). The communication networks also allow provision of applications such as VoIP, streaming video, streaming music, multi-user gaming, location based services, and a variety of delivered to a mobile node. Residing within the gateways can be one or more network processing units, line cards, as well as packet and voice processing cards.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["134","134","108","220","108","120","232","112","112","222","222","112","112","224","228","226","234","230"]},"The BSLF  can be a part of cellular network's mobility unit, for example, an MME . A cellular network is a radio network with multiple transceivers, where each transceiver provides communication to a localized service area called a cell. The cellular network can include LTE networks, HSPA+ networks, and UMTS networks, for example. The size of a cell can vary depending on the transceiver. A macro cell transceiver is typically used by service providers to provide coverage over about a five kilometer distance.","The ANDSF  is typically deployed as a stand-alone network device that is accessible by UE . The ANDSF  can be co-located with the LBCIF . In the case of a trusted WLAN, the WLC  is located in the WLAN access network. If the trusted WLAN is operated by the cellular network operator, the WLC  can also be located in an MME . The WLC  and the LBCIF  can communicate using a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) or a Representational State Transfer (REST) protocol. Likewise, the BSLF  and the LBCIF  can communicate using the SOAP or the REST protocol, and the LBCIF  and the ANDSF  can communicate using the SOAP or the REST protocol.","The WLAN controller  can include a wireless LAN controller (WLC) . A WLC  can perform traditional roles of access points, such as association or authentication of wireless clients. APs A-C, also called access points, can register themselves with the WLC  and tunnel management and data packets to the WLC , which then switches the packets between the user equipment and the wired portion of the network. WLC  can be in charge of the configuring the WLAN. WLC  can provide configuration information to the APs A-C so that the APs A-C can act as a wireless interface to the UEs .","The APs A-C can be equipped with antennas that are configured to transmit and receive data. For example, the APs A-C may transmit video or audio traffic and receive acknowledgements. In one embodiment, the APs A-C can communicate in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standard, including for example, IEEE 802.11n and 802.11k. The APs A-C may transfer video or other forms of high data rate traffic such as audio, or any other type of data traffic.","An ANDSF  is configured to assist UEs to discover non-3GPP networks such as WLAN or WiMax. To this end, the ANDSF  can be configured to provide, to a UE, policy information regarding routing, mobility and discovery. The policy information can include an inter-system mobility policy, which indicates network selection rules in case only one network is available, (e.g., cellular or WLAN), an inter-system routing policy, which indicates network selection rules in case more than one network is available (e.g., both cellular and WLAN), and discovery information that lists the networks that may be available to the UE and any candidate information about the networks. UEs can register with the ANDSF  to receive service from the ANDSF .","In certain embodiments, an AP  can broadcast its data load condition to UEs  (or all the UEs in the AP's service area) using a Quality of Service Basic Service Set (QBSS) load element. The QBSS load element is a part of beacon frames generated by APs and contains the data load information associated with the APs. The QBSS load element can include three parameters: station count, channel utilization, and available admission capacity. The station count can indicate the total number of UEs currently associated with an access point. The channel utilization rate can indicate the normalized value of the total channel utilization which gives the percentage of the time the channel is sensed to be busy using either the physical or virtual carrier sense mechanism of the access point. The available admission capacity can indicate the amount of time that can be used by explicit admission control. A user equipment can use the QBSS load element parameters to decide to which of the available access points to attach.","The communication system in  has a cellular network and a WLAN operating in parallel. Each network can have a plurality of service areas. A service area is often served by a wireless interface, such as a base station  or an AP . For example, a cellular network can include multiple service areas, each service area served by a base station ; a WLAN can include multiple service areas, each service area served by an AP . In certain embodiments, service areas in different networks can overlap. For example, in , the base station's service area  overlaps with the APs' service areas A-C. If a UE A is in an area covered by both WLAN and a cellular network, then the UE A can attach to one of the overlapping networks for network services.","In certain embodiments, the cellular network and the WLAN are configured to collect their own network condition information. The network condition information can include information on the network configuration and the network usage. For example, the network condition information can include the data load information, which indicates the amount of data being handled by one or more of service areas in a network and\/or the amount of additional data traffic that could be handled by one or more of service areas in a network. The network condition information can also include the geo-location of wireless interfaces in a network and a list of UEs currently served by one or more service areas in a network and, if available, the geographic position of the UEs. In certain embodiments, the network condition information associated with a cellular network can be collected by a BSLF  in a MME . In certain embodiments, the network condition information associated with a WLAN can be collected by the WLC  in the WLAN control system .","The cellular network and the WLAN can share the collected network condition information with a central node . The central node , in turn, can retrieve the data load information from the received network condition information, and deliver the retrieved data load information to UEs . There can be at least two ways to deliver the data load information to UEs : (1) via a WLC  using an enhanced 802.11k signalling or (2) via an ANDSF  using an IP signalling. For example, in the first option, the central node  can deliver the data load information to the WLC . In turn, the WLC  can deliver the data load information to the AP . The AP  can subsequently broadcast the data load information to the UEs in the AP's service area. In certain embodiments, the AP  can broadcast the information as an enhanced-Quality of Service Basic Service Set (e-QBSS) load element. In the second option, the central node  can deliver the relevant data load information to the ANDSF , and the ANDSF  can relay the data load information to the UE . These options allow the UE  to receive the network data load information of both the cellular network and the WLAN without disconnecting from the currently attached network.","In certain embodiments, the central node  can deliver only relevant portion of the data load information to UEs . For a UE , the relevant data load information can include the data load information of wireless interfaces that are capable of serving the UE . To determine which wireless interfaces can serve the UE , also called candidate wireless interfaces, the central node  can analyze the location of wireless interfaces. For example, if a UE A is attached to an AP A, the central node  can identify the serving AP A as one of the candidate wireless interfaces. To find additional wireless interfaces that can also serve the UE , the central node  can use the location information of the serving AP A and the location information of other wireless interfaces. For example, if a particular wireless interface is physically proximate to the serving AP A so that the service are of a particular wireless interface includes that of the serving AP A, the central node  can identify the particular wireless interface as one of the candidate wireless interfaces. In some embodiments, if the service coverage of the particular wireless interface overlaps with that of the serving wireless interface, the central node  can identify that the particular wireless interface as one of the candidate wireless interfaces.","The UE  can use the received data load information to determine to which wireless interface to attach. In other words, the UE  can use the data load information to determine whether to remain attached to the current wireless interface or to disconnect from the current wireless interface and attach to a wireless interface with less congestion and\/or with more available resources. In certain embodiments, the UE  can also analyze additional information to decide to which wireless interface to connect. For example, the UE  can use one or more of the following: the load condition associated with the wireless interfaces, the wireless signal strengths associated with the wireless interfaces, and a configuration status on the UE  indicating whether the UE  favors the cellular network or the WLAN.","In certain embodiments, the central node  can periodically deliver the data load information to UEs. This way, UEs can attach to a network in a better network condition in substantially real-time. In other embodiments, the central node  can deliver the data load information in response to certain triggering events. For example, a central node  can analyze the received network condition information to determine if any of the service areas in the parallel networks are congested or heavily utilized. If one of the service areas is congested or heavily utilized, the central node  can identify the UEs currently served by the congested service area and the wireless interfaces that can also serve the congested service area. Subsequently, the central node  can send, to the identified UEs , the data load information associated with the identified wireless interfaces. This way, the identified UEs can disconnect from the congested service area, determine which of the wireless interfaces to connect to, and attach to the determined wireless interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["234","1","232"]},"In certain embodiments, the BSLF  can receive data load information from a base station . A base station  can be configured to measure its data load and share the measured data load information with other network devices over X2 connections. Thus, the BSLF  (or the MME  in which the BSLF  resides) can establish a plurality of X2 connections with base station  and receive the data load information from one or more base stations . The data load information can be formatted in accordance with 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Technical Specification 36.423 v. 10.3.0, entitled \u201cEvolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); X2 Application Protocol (X2AP),\u201d which is herein incorporated by reference.

To identify the physical location of a base station , the BSLF  (or the MME  hosting the BSLF ) can send a location request to the base station . The location request can be sent over an S1 interface using an S1 application protocol. Upon receiving the location request, the base station  can obtain its positioning information. In certain embodiments, the base station  can use a global positioning system (GPS) to obtain its positioning information. Subsequently, the base station  can send a location reply to the BSLF . The location reply can include the physical location identifier of the base station , which can be represented in terms of GPS coordinates or geographic latitudes and longitudes. The location reply can be sent over an S1 interface using an S1 application protocol. In other embodiments, the BSLF  can identify the physical location of the base stations  using a standardized positioning architecture specified in 3GPP Technical Specification 23.271, V. 10.2.0, entitled \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Functional stage 2 description of Location Services (LCS) (Release 10),\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In certain embodiments, the BSLF  can also identify the physical, geographic location of UEs . For example, the BSLF  (or the MME  hosting the BSLF ) can send a UE positioning request to a base station . The base station  can identify the UEs  attached to the base station  and determine the location of the attached UEs  using techniques specified in 3GPP Technical Specification 36.305, V. 10.3.0, entitled \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Stage 2 functional specification of User Equipment (UE) positioning in E-UTRAN (Release 10),\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Then the base station  sends a UE positioning response to the BSLF , including physical location identifiers of UEs  served by the base station .","In step , the BSLF  can send a cellular network condition message to the central node . The cellular network condition message can include the gathered cellular network condition information.","In step , the WLC  can determine the network condition associated with the WLAN. The WLC  can determine one or more of the components in the network condition using one or more of the following embodiments. In certain embodiments, the WLC  can receive data load information from an AP . For example, an AP  can be configured to measure its data load and send the measured data load information to the WLC . The WLC  can receive the measured data load information using Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol. CAPWAP is a standard, interoperable protocol that enables the WLC  to manage a collection of wireless access points.","In certain embodiments, the WLC  can identify the physical location of one or more APs . To identify the physical location of an AP , the WLC  can send a location request to the AP . Upon receiving the location request, the AP  can obtain its positioning information. In certain embodiments, the AP  can obtain its positioning information using a global positioning system (GPS). Subsequently, the AP  can send a location reply to the WLC . The location reply can include the physical location identifier of the AP , which can be represented in terms of GPS coordinates or geographic latitudes and longitudes. In some embodiments, the WLC  may be in communication with a Mobility Service Engine (MSE)  for querying the location of an AP . For example, the WLC  can send a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) request to MSE . The SOAP request can include the identity of the AP . Upon receiving the SOAP request, the MSE  can provide the geolocation of the AP to the WLC  by returning a SOAP response. In other embodiments, the WLC  may have been pre-provisioned with the AP geo-location information and be able to retrieve the geolocation of the AP by mapping the identity of the AP  to the stored location information.","In step , the WLC  can send a WLAN condition message to the central node . The WLAN condition message can include the gathered WLAN condition information. In certain embodiments, steps - and steps - are performed out-of-order or in parallel. In certain embodiments, steps - or steps - or both are performed in response to an external trigger signal.","When the central node  receives the cellular network condition message and the WLAN condition message, the central node  can decide whether to send the received data load information to one or more UEs  or not. In certain embodiments, the central node  can be configured to send the received data load information to UEs  periodically. To this end, the central node  can monitor a timer and determine whether a predetermine amount of time has passed since the central node  sent the data load information to the UEs .","In other embodiments, the central node  can be configured to send the received data load information in response to certain triggering events. For example, a central node  can analyze the received network condition information to determine if any of the service areas in the parallel networks are congested or heavily utilized. If one of the service areas is congested or heavily utilized, the central node  can identify the UEs currently served by the congested service area and the wireless interfaces that can also serve the congested service area. Subsequently, the central node  can send, to the identified UEs , the data load information associated with the identified wireless interfaces. This way, the identified UEs can disconnect from the congested service area, determine which of the available wireless interfaces to connect to, and attach to the determined wireless interface.","Suppose that the central node  has decided to send data load information to a UE . In step , the central node  can determine which data load information would be relevant for the UE . For a UE , the relevant data load information can include the data load information of candidate wireless interfaces that can serve the UE . Therefore, the central node  can be configured to identify candidate wireless interfaces associated with the UE . In some embodiments, the UE  can indicate which wireless interfaces can serve the UE . This indication can be provided to the MME  as a classmark or configuration information. In one embodiment, the MME  can provide the classmark or configuration information to the central node . In another embodiment, the MME  can determine the candidate wireless interfaces and send a list of candidate wireless interfaces to the central node .","In certain embodiments, identifying candidate wireless interfaces can depend on whether the UE  is attached to the WLAN or the UE  is attached to the cellular network. If the UE  is attached to the WLAN, the central node  can identify the serving AP  as one of the candidate APs for the UE . Also, if the UE  is attached to the cellular network, the central node  can identify the serving base station  as one of the candidate base stations for the UE .","In certain embodiments, the central node  can identify additional candidate wireless interfaces based on wireless interfaces' relationship to the serving wireless interface. In particular, the central node  can be configured to identify wireless interfaces whose service coverage overlaps with that of the serving wireless interface. To this end, the central node  can analyze the location of the serving wireless interface, the location of other wireless interfaces, and the average size of service areas covered by each type of wireless interfaces. For example, the central node  can determine the physical distance between the serving AP  and a base station . If the physical distance between the serving AP  and the base station  is small enough such that the service area of the serving AP  overlaps, wholly or partially, with the service area of the base station , then the central node  can identify the base station  as a candidate wireless interface. The physical distance can be measured using the Euclidean distance metric, the Chebyshev distance metric, the Manhattan distance metric, or the Minkowski distance metric.","In other embodiments, to identify additional candidate wireless interfaces, the central node  can communicate with an identity database. In one embodiment, an identity database can be configured to maintain information on which wireless interfaces can serve the service area of a particular wireless interface. In another embodiment, an identity database can also be configured to maintain available wireless interfaces for a particular geographic location. The identity database can use this information to identify wireless interfaces with overlapping service area with the serving interface. Therefore, the central node  can request the identity database to identify which additional wireless interfaces can serve the service area of the serving interface.

The additional network condition information can include one or more of the following: the load condition associated with the candidate wireless interfaces, the wireless signal strength associated with the candidate wireless interfaces, and a configuration status on the UE  indicating whether the UE  favors the cellular network or the WLAN. The configuration status can be represented numerically. For example, the configuration status can be between 0 and 1, 0 indicating that the UE  should always attach to a base station, and 1 indicating that the UE  should always attach to an AP. The received data load information and the additional network condition information can be combined to generate a selection score using a selection algorithm. For example, the selection algorithm can have two inputs, the received data load information and the additional network condition information, where the received data load information would adaptively modify the selection algorithm. For instance, the selection algorithm can include a function with hysteresis and the received data load information can determine the threshold in the hysteresis function.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["234","230","1","5","1","5"]},"Suppose that the central node  has decided to send the data load information to a UE .

The features of a network device that implements a gateway, in accordance with some embodiments, are further described below.  illustrates the implementation of a network device in accordance with some embodiments. The network device  includes slots  for loading application cards and line cards. A midplane can be used in the network device to provide intra-network device communications, power connections, and transport paths between the various installed cards. The midplane can include buses such as a switch fabric , a control bus , a system management bus, a redundancy bus , and a time division multiplex (TDM) bus. The switch fabric  is an IP-based transport path for user data throughout the network device implemented by establishing inter-card communications between application cards and line cards. The control bus  interconnects the control and management processors within the network device. The network device management bus provides management of system functions such as supplying power, monitoring temperatures, board status, data path errors, card resets, and other failover features. The redundancy bus  provides transportation of user data and redundancy links in the event of hardware failures. The TDM bus provides support for voice services on the system.","The network device supports at least four types of application cards: a switch processor I\/O card (SPIO) , a system management card (SMC) , a packet service card (PSC) , and a packet accelerator card (not shown). Other cards used in the network device include line cards  and redundant crossbar cards (RCC) . The line cards , when loaded in the network device, provide input\/output connectivity to the network and other devices, as well as redundancy connections. The line cards  include interfaces to the network through Ethernet, Fiber Optic, and the other communication mediums. The redundant crossbar card (RCC)  includes a non-blocking crossbar and connections to each of the cards in the network device. This allows a redundant connection to be made through the redundant crossbar card  from any one card to any other card in the network device. The SPIO card  serves as a controller of the network device and is responsible for such things as initializing the network device and loading software configurations onto other cards in the network device.","The system management card (SMC)  and switch processor card (not shown) are system control and management cards for managing and controlling other cards in the network device. The packet accelerator card (PAC) and packet service card (PSC)  provide packet processing, context processing capabilities, and forwarding capabilities among other things. The PAC and PSC  perform packet-processing operations through the use of control processors and a network processing unit. The network processing unit determines packet processing requirements; receives and transmits user data frames to\/from various physical interfaces; makes IP forwarding decisions; implements packet filtering, flow insertion, deletion, and modification; performs traffic management and traffic engineering; modifies\/adds\/strips packet headers; and manages line card ports and internal packet transportation. The control processors, also located on the packet accelerator card, provide packet-based user service processing.","The operating system software can be based on a Linux software kernel and run specific applications in the network device such as monitoring tasks and providing protocol stacks. The software allows network device resources to be allocated separately for control and data paths. For example, certain packet accelerator cards and packet services cards can be dedicated to performing routing or security control functions, while other packet accelerator cards\/packet services cards are dedicated to processing user session traffic. As network requirements change, hardware resources can be dynamically deployed to meet the requirements in some embodiments. The system can be virtualized to support multiple logical instances of services, such as technology functions (e.g., a SeGW PGW, SGW, MME, HSGW, PDSN, ASNGW, PDIF, HA, or GGSN).","The network device's software can be divided into a series of tasks that perform specific functions. These tasks communicate with each other as needed to share control and data information throughout the network device. A task is a software process that performs a specific function related to system control or session processing. Three types of tasks operate within the network device in some embodiments: critical tasks, controller tasks, and manager tasks. The critical tasks control functions that relate to the network device's ability to process calls such as network device initialization, error detection, and recovery tasks. The controller tasks mask the distributed nature of the software from the user and perform tasks such as monitor the state of subordinate manager(s), provide for intra-manager communication within the same subsystem, and enable inter-subsystem communication by communicating with controller(s) belonging to other subsystems. The manager tasks can control system resources and maintain logical mappings between system resources.","Individual tasks that run on processors in the application cards can be divided into subsystems. A subsystem is a software element that either performs a specific task or is a culmination of multiple other tasks. A single subsystem can include critical tasks, controller tasks, and manager tasks. Some of the subsystems that can run on a network device include a system initiation task subsystem, a high availability task subsystem, a recovery control task subsystem, a shared configuration task subsystem, a resource management subsystem, a virtual private network subsystem, a network processing unit subsystem, a card\/slot\/port subsystem, and a session subsystem.","The system initiation task subsystem is responsible for starting a set of initial tasks at system startup and providing individual tasks as needed. The high availability task subsystem works in conjunction with the recovery control task subsystem to maintain the operational state of the network device by monitoring the various software and hardware components of the network device. Recovery control task subsystem is responsible for executing a recovery action for failures that occur in the network device and receives recovery actions from the high availability task subsystem. Processing tasks are distributed into multiple instances running in parallel so if an unrecoverable software fault occurs, the entire processing capabilities for that task are not lost. User session processes can be sub-grouped into collections of sessions so that if a problem is encountered in one sub-group users in another sub-group will not be affected by that problem.","The architecture also allows check-pointing of processes, which is a mechanism to protect the system against any critical software processes that may fail. The self-healing attributes of the software architecture protects the system by anticipating failures and instantly spawning mirror processes locally or across card boundaries to continue the operation with little or no disruption of service. This unique architecture allows the system to perform at the highest level of resiliency and protects the user's data sessions while ensuring complete accounting data integrity.","Shared configuration task subsystem provides the network device with an ability to set, retrieve, and receive notification of network device configuration parameter changes and is responsible for storing configuration data for the applications running within the network device. A resource management subsystem is responsible for assigning resources (e.g., processor and memory capabilities) to tasks and for monitoring the task's use of the resources.","Virtual private network (VPN) subsystem manages the administrative and operational aspects of VPN-related entities in the network device, which include creating separate VPN contexts, starting IP services within a VPN context, managing IP pools and subscriber IP addresses, and distributing the IP flow information within a VPN context. In some embodiments, within the network device, IP operations are done within specific VPN contexts. The network processing unit subsystem is responsible for many of the functions listed above for the network processing unit. The card\/slot\/port subsystem is responsible for coordinating the events that occur relating to card activity such as discovery and configuration of ports on newly inserted cards and determining how line cards map to application cards.","The session subsystem is responsible for processing and monitoring a mobile subscriber's data flows in some embodiments. Session processing tasks for mobile data communications include: S1\/S5\/S8 interface termination for LTE networks, A10\/A11 interface termination for CDMA networks, GSM tunneling protocol (GTP) termination for GPRS and\/or UMTS networks, asynchronous PPP processing, IPsec, packet filtering, packet scheduling, Diffserv codepoint marking, statistics gathering, IP forwarding, and AAA services, for example. Responsibility for each of these items can be distributed across subordinate tasks (called managers) to provide for more efficient processing and greater redundancy. A separate session controller task serves as an integrated control node to regulate and monitor the managers and to communicate with the other active subsystem. The session subsystem also manages specialized user data processing such as payload transformation, filtering, statistics collection, policing, and scheduling.","In providing emulation, as MIPv4 is received from a mobile node, the session subsystem can setup a MIPv4 termination and setup a PMIPv6 session towards the core network. A session manager can track the mapping of the sessions and processing to provide the emulation and inter-working between the networks. A database can also be used to map information between the sessions, and store, for example, NAI, HoA, AE information in some embodiments.","The network device allows system resources to be allocated separately for control and data paths. For example, certain PACs\/PSCs could be dedicated to performing routing or security control functions while other PACs\/PSCs are dedicated to processing user session traffic. As network requirements grow and call models change, hardware resources can be added to accommodate processes, such as encryption, packet filtering, etc., that require more processing power.  illustrates a logical view of the software architecture of a network device in accordance with certain embodiments.

The SPC\/SMC  can be configured in a primary and secondary arrangement that provides redundancy and failsafe protection. The modules or tasks running on the SPC\/SMC  are related to network device wide control and management. The boot configuration task  includes information for starting up and testing the network device. The network device can also be configured to startup in different configurations and providing different implementations. These can include which functionalities and services are capable of running on the SPC\/SMC . The high availability task  maintains the operational state of the network device by monitoring the device and managing recovery efforts to avoid disruption of service. The resource manager tracks and assigns the available resources for sessions and demands on the network device. This can include load balancing among different processors and tasks running on the network device. Processes can be distributed across the system to fit the needs of the network model and specific process requirements. For example, most tasks can be configured to execute on SPC\/SMC  or a PAC\/PSC , while some processor intensive tasks can also be performed across multiple PACs\/PSCs to utilize multiple CPU resources. Distribution of these tasks is invisible to the user. The switch fabric control  controls the communication paths in the network device. The controller tasks module  can manage the tasks among the resources of the networks to provide, for example, VPN services, assign ports, and create, delete, and modify sessions for UE .","The PAC\/PSC  is a high-speed processing card that is designed for packet processing and the tasks involved with providing various network functionalities on the network device.

A session allows a UE  to communicate with the network for voice calls and data. The AAA manager  manages accounting, authentication, and authorization with an AAA server in the network. PAC\/PSC  provides a DPI task  and a signaling demux . The DPI task  provides inspection of packet information beyond layer  for use and analysis by the network device. The signaling demux  can provide scalability of services in combination with other modules. PAC\/PSC provides redundancy through standby tasks . Standby tasks  store state information and other task information so that the standby task can immediately replace an active task if a card fails or if there is a scheduled event to remove a card.","In some embodiments, the software needed for implementing a process or a database includes a high level procedural or an object-orientated language such as C, C++, C#, Java, or Perl.
