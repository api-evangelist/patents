title: Mitigation of high stress areas in vertically offset structures
abstract: Alternative methods of constructing a vertically offset structure are disclosed. An embodiment includes forming a flexible layer having first and second end portions, an intermediate portion coupling the first and second portions, and upper and lower surfaces. The distance between the upper and lower surfaces at the intermediate portion is less than the distance between the upper and lower surfaces at the first and second end portions. The first end portion is bonded to a base member. The second end portion of the flexible layer is deflected until the second end portion contacts the base member. The second end portion is bonded to the base member.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Vertically offset silicon structures for use in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) or microsystem technology (MST) or nanotechnology can be created by, employing a voltage V, anodically bonding a silicon structure  to an etched glass wafer  (), removing the handle material from the silicon, and then pushing parts of the silicon into contact with the glass while performing a second anodic bond using the voltage V (). During formation of this second bond, the silicon  is pulled down to the glass , and high stresses can develop near the anchor of the push-down structure where the first anodic bond took place. These stresses can cause fracture in the silicon push-down structure  or otherwise have a negative impact on the performance of the mechanism.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-1","b":["2","2","200","200","12","44","44","12","46","44","12","13","14","70","48","15","12","70","12","48","15","13","14"]},"After the intermediate portion  is formed, the first end portion  is bonded to the glass base  to form an anchor . In the case of a silicon layer  and a glass base , anodic bonding may be used to bond the layer  to the base . When the base  and silicon layer  are made of different materials, appropriate bonding including but not limited to fit, fusion, eutectic, epoxy attachment techniques known to those having ordinary skill in the art may be used.","Subsequently, and as best illustrated in , the second end portion  of the silicon layer  is deflected a vertical distance  until the second end portion contacts the base  as indicated by reference numeral . The deflection may be effected by an electrically conductive or semi-conductive material , preferably highly doped silicon. While the electrically conductive material  is in contact with the second end portion , a voltage  is applied between the base  and the second end portion  to effect anodic bonding of the second end portion  to the base. In alternative embodiments, the first and\/or second bondings between the layer  (as well as the layer  discussed below herein) and base  may be effected through the use of frit, fusion, eutectic, epoxy attachment or other appropriate types of bonding techniques.","As such, before bonding the silicon  to the glass , a partial etch is performed to create the intermediate portion  near the anchor location  in order to thin the material at that location. Doing so causes the structure to be more flexible in the vertical direction. Additionally, the gap between the glass and the surface of the partially etched silicon will prevent the anodic bond from forming near the anchor and causing unduly high stresses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 3-1","b":["3","2","300","300","46","44","44","46","13","14","80","44","46","80","52"]},"The first end portion  is bonded to the glass base  to form an anchor .

This metal is electrically connected to the silicon layer  at the first anodic bond . During the second anodic bonding, the metal and silicon will be at the same potential, and there will be no force pulling the silicon down near the anchors. This will prevent high stresses from forming near the anchor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 4-1","b":["4","2","400","400","46","44","44","46","13","14"]},"The first end portion  is bonded to the glass base  at an end portion  to form an anchor .
