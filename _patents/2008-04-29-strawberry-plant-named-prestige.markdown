title: Strawberry plant named ‘PRESTIGE’
abstract: This invention relates to a new and distinct variety of strawberry plant named ‘PRESTIGE’. This new strawberry plant named ‘PRESTIGE’ is primarily adapted to the growing conditions of the central coast of California, and is primarily characterized by its medium to large plant size; medium fruit size; spreading calyx segments; long petiolule length; three to four leaflets/tri-foliate; moderate fruit production with very good flavor; and medium green foliage with medium glossy texture and medium interveinal blistering.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed: \n\n","The present invention relates to a new and distinct strawberry variety named \u2018PRESTIGE\u2019. This new variety is a result of a controlled cross made in 2000 in an ongoing breeding program between strawberry variety designated \u2018PS-1269\u2019 (patented, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 10,686) and strawberry variety designated \u2018PS-3523\u2019 (patented, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 14,447). The variety is botanically known as ","The seedling resulting from the aforementioned cross was selected from a controlled breeding plot in Monterey County, California in the summer of 2002. After its selection, the new variety was asexually propagated by stolons in both San Joaquin County, California and Siskiyou County, California. The new variety was extensively tested over the next several years in fruiting fields in Monterey County, California. This propagation has demonstrated that the combination of traits disclosed herein as characterizing the new variety are fixed and remain true to type through successive generations of asexual reproduction.","\u2018PRESTIGE\u2019 is primarily adapted to the climate and growing conditions of the central coast of California. The nearby Pacific Ocean provides the needed humidity and moderate temperatures to produce a strong vigorous plant and maintain fruit quality during the spring, summer and fall production months.","The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of \u2018PRESTIGE\u2019, which in combination distinguish this strawberry plant as a new and distinct variety:\n\n","The strawberry varieties that are believed to be most closely related to the new strawberry variety \u2018PRESTIGE\u2019 are the strawberry variety \u2018PS-592\u2019 (patented, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 9,903) and the strawberry variety \u2018PS-4634\u2019 (patented, U.S. Plant Pat. No. PP 17,487). In comparison to the similar strawberry varieties \u2018PS-592\u2019 and \u2018PS-4634\u2019, the new strawberry variety \u2018PRESTIGE\u2019 differs by the following combination of characteristics as described in Table 1:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0015"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"\u2018PS-592\u2019","\u2018PS-4634\u2019"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(U.S. Plant","(U.S. Plant"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Pat.
