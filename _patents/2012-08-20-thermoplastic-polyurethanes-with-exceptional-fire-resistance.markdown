In this test, the tested materials are given classifications of UL-94 V-0, UL-94 V-1 and UL-94 V-2 on the basis of the results obtained with the ten test specimens. Briefly, the criteria for each of these UL-94-V-classifications are as follows:","UL-94 V-0: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 10 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 50 seconds. None of the test specimens should release and drips which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","UL-94 V-1: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 30 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 250 seconds. None of the test specimens should release any drips which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","UL-94 V-2: the total flaming combustion for each specimen after removal of the ignition flame should not exceed 30 seconds and the total flaming combustion for 5 specimens should not exceed 250 seconds. Test specimens may release flaming particles, which ignite absorbent cotton wool.","Fire resistance may also be tested by measuring surface flame spread as for example described in Fire Retardancy of Polymeric Materials (C. A. Wilkie, A. B. Morgan), chapter 14 \u201cFundamentals of Fire Testing and What Tests Measure\u201d, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2ed, (2010). These test methods provide a laboratory test procedure for measuring and comparing the surface flammability of materials when exposed to a prescribed level of radiant heat energy to measure the surface flammability of materials when exposed to fire. The test is conducted using small specimens that are representative, to the extent possible, of the material or assembly being evaluated. The rate at which flames travel along surfaces depends upon the physical and thermal properties of the material, product or assembly under test, the specimen mounting method and orientation, the type and level of fire or heat exposure, the availability of air, and properties of the surrounding enclosure. If different test conditions are substituted or the end-use conditions are changed, it may not always be possible by or from this test to predict changes in the fire-test-response characteristics measured. Therefore, the results are valid only for the fire test exposure conditions described in this procedure.","Typical surface flame spread tests are the ASTM E-162 and the ASTM E-84 test. ASTM E162 was developed as a less expensive and more convenient flame spread test alternative to E84. The tunnel specified by E84 constitutes an expensive and cumbersome piece of apparatus. The ASTM radiant panel test has numerous advantages over that of E84. The sample size of the E162 is 6 by 18-in, while E84 requires a sample 20-in by 25-ft long, which is a rather large size to deal with. It should be noted, however, that (4) samples are required for E162, whereas E84 requires only one.","With the E162 test, a Flamespread Index (Is) is derived by multiplying a Flamespread Factor (Fs) with the Heat Evolution Factor (Q). Fs resents the speed at which the flame front burns down the specimen and Q represents the heat that is generated above the burning sample. The results are categorized as a class A rating obtained when the Flamespread Index is below 25. A class B rating is obtained with a Flamespread Index between 26 and 75, and the lowest rating, a class C rating, is obtained when the Flamespread index is between 76 and 100.","The E84 test uses a similar classification system, but the Flamespread Index is calculated on the basis of the area under the curve of flame tip location versus time. Additionally, the obscuration of smoke in the exhaust duct of the tunnel is determined and expressed as a smoke developed index (SDI). This number is based on the area under the light transmission versus time curve normalized to the area for red oak flooring, which by definition has an SDI of 100. In all classification cases (A, B, or C), the SDI must be 450 or less.","The term \u201chydrolytic stability\u201d as used herein is defined as the ability of the polymer to resist hydrolysis in a water boil test. The ability to resist hydrolysis can be measured by the change in relative viscosity after exposure which is an indication in molecular weight change. For example, a neat resin sample can be placed in pure water (triple distilled) for up to 168 hours under reflux conditions at normal pressure. The samples can be removed periodically, and the relative viscosity (\u03b7) can be determined by dissolving the sample in dichloromethane at 25\u00b0 C. at a concentration of 0.5 g polymer\/liter and measuring the solution with an Ubbelohde viscometer. A significant change in the \u03b7value after the water boil is indicative of a change in molecular weight of the polymer due to hydrolysis. A polymer with good hydrolytic stability would not exhibit a significant change in \u03b7as a result of this test.","\u201cMolecular weight,\u201d as used herein, can be determined by relative viscosity (\u03b7) and\/or gel permeation chromatography (GPC). \u201cRelative viscosity\u201d of a polymer is measured by dissolving a known quantity of polymer in a solvent and comparing the time it takes for this solution and the neat solvent to travel through a specially designed capillary (viscometer) at a constant temperature. Relative viscosity is a measurement that is indicative of the molecular weight of a polymer. It is also well known that a reduction in relative viscosity is indicative of a reduction in molecular weight, and reduction in molecular weight causes loss of mechanical properties such as strength and toughness. GPC provides information about the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of a polymer and is typically obtained from a calibration line that is determined using polystyrene (PS) samples of known molecular weights. It is known that the molecular weight distribution of a polymer is important to properties such as thermo-oxidative stability (due to different amount of end groups), toughness, melt flow, and fire resistance, for example, low molecular weight polymers drip more when burned.","The term \u201ctoughness\u201d, as used herein, is determined qualitatively on a film or a molded specimen.","The terms \u201ctransparency,\u201d \u201coptical transparency,\u201d and \u201clight transmission\u201d used herein are intended to describe the amount of visible light (wavelength range approximately 300 nm to 700 nm) that can pass through the thickness of a given sample, usually presented in a percentage less than 100%. The transparency is typically measured using a visible spectrophotometer by placing the sample in the light beam, and the amount of light that passes through is recorded.","Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) are a class of urethane plastics with many useful properties, including elasticity, transparency, toughness, and resistance to oil, grease and abrasion, and thermoplastic-like processability. An overview of the production, properties and applications of TPUs is given for example in the Plastics Handbook (G. Becker, D. Braun), volume 7 \u201cPolyurethane\u201d, Munich, Vienna, Carl Hanser Publishing, 1983. TPUs are thermoplastic elastomers consisting of linear segmented block copolymers composed of hard and soft segments derived from the monomers used in their synthesis. Polyurethanes are, generally, synthesized by the reaction of a difunctional isocyanate compound, oligomer, or polymer with a difunctional hydroxy compound, oligomer, or polymer or combinations thereof, in the presence of a catalyst. Other additives may also be present during synthesis. Consequently, there are a tremendous number of possible combinations that can be synthesized by varying the chemical structure of the reactants and the molecular weight range of the TPU, and an enormous variety of different TPUs in which the polymer's structure has been manipulated to achieve the desired combination of properties for a specific application.","Embodiments of the invention include any TPUs encompassed by the description above, and TPUs prepared from any combination of compounds, oligomers, or polymers. For example, in some embodiments, the TPUs may be prepared from difunctional isocyanates (i.e., diisocyanates) that are aromatic including, but not limited to, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or aliphatic, including, but not limited to, hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). In other embodiments, the difunctional isocyanates may also be polymeric and may include, for example, polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which is a blend of molecules having two-, three-, and four- or more isocyanate groups, with an average functionality of 2.7. In certain embodiments, the diisocyanates can be modified by partially reacting them with a polyol to form a prepolymer. A \u201ctrue prepolymer\u201d is formed when the stoichiometric ratio of isocyanate to hydroxyl is equal to 2:1, and a \u201cquasi-prepolymer\u201d is formed when the stoichiometric ratio of isocyanate to hydroxyl groups is greater than 2:1. Such prepolymers can be exposed to moisture to convert the isocyanate to amino groups which subsequently react with remaining isocyanate groups to form a urea linkage.","The other monomer used in the synthesis of TPUs is, generally, a difunctional hydroxyl compound (i.e., diol), oligomer or polymer. Examples of commonly used monomeric diols used in the making of TPUs include, but are not limited to, 1,2-ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, diethylene glycol, glycerine, and trimethylolpropane. Polymeric diols (i.e., polyols) can also be used in the production of TPUs, and are often formed by base-catalyzed addition of propylene oxide and\/or ethylene oxide onto a hydroxyl or amine containing initiator, or by polyesterification of a di-acid, such as adipic acid, with glycols, such as ethylene glycol or dipropylene glycol. The most common polyols are polyether polyols, polycarbonate diols and polyester polyols. The molecular weight of the polyols can cover a broad range from oligomeric to high molecular weight polymer.","Catalysts used in the synthesis of TPUs include, but are not limited, to amine compounds and organometallic complexes. Examples of amine catalysts include tertiary amine catalysts such as, but are not limited, to triethylenediamine also known as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA), and dimethyl-ethanolamine (DMEA). Organometallic compounds based on mercury, lead, tin (dibutyltin dilaurate), bismuth (bismuth octanoate), and zinc can also be used as polyurethane catalysts. Mercury carboxylates, such as phenylmercuric neodeconate, are particularly effective catalysts. Bismuth and zinc carboxylates have also been used as catalysts in the synthesis of TPUs. Alkyl tin carboxylates, oxides and mercaptides oxides are used including, but not limited to, dibutyltin dilaurate, dioctyltin mercaptide, and dibutyltin oxide.","TPUs may be produced continuously or discontinuously. Thermoplastically processable polyurethane elastomers may be made up either step by step (prepolymer dosing process) or by the simultaneous reaction of all components in one stage (one shot dosing process). The best known production processes are the band process and the extrusion process.","A number of TPUs are commercially available including but not limited to Elastollan (BASF & Elastogran), Pearlthane (Merquinsa), Desmopan (Bayer), Estane (Lubrizol), Pellethane (Lubrizol), New power industrial limited (New Power\u00ae), Irogran (Huntsman), Exelast EC (Shin-Etsu Polymer Europe B.V.), Laripur (COIM SpA), Avalon (Huntsman) and Isothane (Greco).","Currently available fire resistant TPUs require halogenated monomers such as halogenated diols, or halogenated additives or small molecules that can leach out of the TPU over time to achieve fire resistance. As a consequence, these TPUs are not environmentally friendly.","Embodiments of the invention are directed to fire resistant TPUs, compositions, articles of manufacture, and other products including such TPUs, and processes for making these TPUs and such compositions. Various embodiments are directed to TPUs formulated with phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate copolymers including phosphonate components, and in certain embodiments, the TPUs may be formulated with phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and copolymers including phosphonate components including aryl components (i.e., \u201caryl phosphonates\u201d). The compositions of the invention may include TPU and phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate copolymers that are combined to result in a composition in which non-covalent, ionic interactions hold the TPU and phosphonate components together. In other embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate copolymers may be covalently attached to the TPU either by binding to free functional groups on the TPU or crosslinking TPU chains or by being incorporated into the main chain of the TPU during preparation of the TPU.","The methods of some embodiments include mixing polyurethanes and polyurethane precursors with phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and copolymers including phosphonate components in a melt by any of the myriad of mixing processes commonly used in the plastics industry. The fire resistant TPUs including phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and copolymers including phosphonate components exhibit a combination of properties including good melt processability and optical transparency, without significant reduction in elastomeric properties and tensile strength, toughness, and elongation to break that are improved over the properties of currently available TPUs while providing less environmental impact. In particular embodiments, the TPU formulations of the invention may have optical transparencies of at least 40%, or about 40% to about 100%, about 50% to about 95%, about 60% to about 90%, about 65% to about 85%, or about 70% to about 80%, or any value between these exemplary ranges.","Phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers are known in the literature and any such phosphonates can be used in embodiments of the invention. For example, in various embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may be linear, branched, or hyperbranched, and in some embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may contain functional end groups such as, but not limited to, phenol, phosphonate, ester, carbonate, epoxy, vinyl, and the like. In particular embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may be predominately hydroxyl terminated polyphosphonates or oligophosphonates, random or block co-oligo(phosphonate ester)s and co-oligo(phosphonate carbonate)s, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,861,499; 7,449,526; 7,645,850; 7,816,486; and 7,838,604 each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In certain embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may include one or more structural units of general formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"14.56mm","wi":"73.49mm","file":"US09267017-20160223-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"The linear or branched polyphosphonates or copolyphosphonates may be prepared by any method known in the art. However, the method by which the polyphosphonate or copolyphosphonate is prepared may affect the properties of the final mixture. For example, in some embodiments, the polyphosphonate component may be prepared by polymerization of one or more diphenyl phosphonates (DPP) and one or more aromatic dihydroxy compound, such as bisphenol A (BPA). The DPP and aromatic dihydroxy compound used may be prepared by any method and combined to form polyphosphonate by any method. Additionally, other components such as, for example, branching agents and catalysts may be used in such process.","In various embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may have a weight average molecular weight of greater than 500 g\/mole. For example, in some embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may have weight average molecular weight of from about 1,000 g\/mole to about 140,000 g\/mole, and in other embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may have a weight average molecular weight of from about 1,500 g\/mole to about 90,000 g\/mol, about 10,000 g\/mole to about 80,000 g\/mole, or any weight average molecular weight within these ranges. Such phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers are generally soluble in, for example, methylene chloride; however, phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers can also be hydrolytically stable and insoluble in, for example, methylene chloride. Both soluble or insoluble phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers can be included in the formulations encompassed by the invention, and in some embodiments, a mixture of soluble and insoluble phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers can be included in the TPU formulations of the invention.","In various embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers included in a TPU formulation may be present at loading levels of from about 5 wt. % to about 50 wt. % by weight, about 10 wt. % to about 40 wt. %, about 15 wt. % to about 25 wt. %, and so on, or any weight percentage there between. For example, in particular embodiments, the phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may be included in TPU formulations at loading levels of 5 wt. %, 10 wt. %, 15 wt. %, 20 wt. %, 25 wt. %, 30 wt. %, 35 wt. %, 40 wt. %, 45 wt. %, or 50 wt. %.","The TPU component of formulations including TPU and phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may be any TPU known in the art including but not limited to those described above. For example, the TPUs encompassed by embodiments can include aromatic diisocyanates such as, but not limited to, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or aliphatic diiosocynates such as, but not limited to, hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), or polymeric isocyanates having two-, three-, and four- or more isocyanate groups, and diols including, but are not limited to, 1,2-ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, diethylene glycol, glycerine, and trimethylolpropane or polyols formed by base-catalyzed addition of propylene oxide and\/or ethylene oxide onto a hydroxyl or amine containing initiator or polyesterification of a di-acid, such as adipic acid, with glycols, such as ethylene glycol or dipropylene glycol. In particular embodiments, the polyol component may be a polyether polyol, polycarbonate diol, or polyester polyols. More specific TPUs include commercially available TPUs including but not limited to Elastollan (BASF & Elastogran), Pearlthane (Merquinsa), Desmopan (Bayer), Estane (Lubrizol), Pellethane (Lubrizol), New power industrial limited (New Power\u00ae), Irogran (Huntsman), Exelast EC (Shin-Etsu Polymer Europe B.V.), Laripur (COIM SpA), Avalon (Huntsman) and Isothane (Greco).","Compositions including TPU and one or more phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers such as those described above generally exhibit excellent fire resistance, transparency, and melt processability, and this combination of properties is achieved without significantly changing the mechanical properties of the TPU including good flexibility and toughness. In particular, the one or more phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers with TPU results in substantially no loss in transparency while providing good flame resistance. In general, prior art compounds with good flame resistance develop a haze or some opacity that is not observed in the compositions of the invention. Therefore, compositions including only TPU and one or more phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers can be used only as an engineering polymer in articles of manufacture.","In other embodiments, such compositions including the combination of a TPU and one or more phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers may further include one or more additives such as, but not limited to, anti-oxidants, anti-dripping agents, additional flame retardants, UV stabilizers, glass, carbon, aramide, graphite, lubricants, continuous fiber or chopped fiber. Still other embodiments include polymer compositions including at least one composition including TPU and one or more phosphonate oligomers, phosphonate co-oligomers, phosphonate polymers, and phosphonate containing copolymers and at least one other polymer, oligomer, or monomer mixture.

illustrated in Tables 3 and 4, the TPU\/polyphosphonate blends have good mechanical properties (Table 3) and an excellent fire resistance (Table 4). Depending on the use of a high Mw polyphosphonate or a low Mw phosphonate oligomer, the material demonstrate more rigid stiff properties (EX1-3) with a high modulus or more flexible properties with a low modulus and high elongation at break (EX4). Adding the polyphosphonates or phosphonate oligomers also hardly affected the hardness of the materials.","Irrespective of the Mw, all materials that contain the phosphonate additive obtained a class A rating in the E-162 test. A class A rating is obtained when the Flamespread Index is below 25. A class B rating is obtained with a Flamespread Index between 26 and 75, and the lowest rating, a C rating, is obtained when the Flamespread index is between 76 and 100. Thus, the comparative examples 1 and 2 even do not get a rating according this test.","Example 3 was tested according E84, where a similar rating as in the E-162 test is used. Additionally, a Smoke Development Index is measured that needs to be below 450 for either a class A, B, or C classification. The test data for Example 3 show that the material falls well within the class A rating according the E84 test.","Very surprisingly, the optical transparency of the materials did not decrease when the polyphosphonate or phosphonate oligomers were added. Thus, the materials remained transparent, had adjustable mechanical properties and excellent FR properties. This combination of properties has not been achieved before with TPUs using flame retardant additives.","Additional blends were made using a different TPU source (Table 5) and varying the amount of polyphosphonate. These data confirmed the class A rating when adding 20 wt % of polyphosphonate to TPU. At 10% a class B rating was obtained. In both cases the optical transparency of the TPU remained unchanged and the blends with the polyphosphonate were transparent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"% T and E162 test results for TPU samples"},{"entry":"with 10 and 20 wt % of polyphosphonates"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Optical","E162 test"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Elastollan\u2009\u00ae","FRX100-","Trans-","Flame-","Heat of","Flame-"]},{"entry":["Sam-","1185A,","2,","parency,","spread","Evolu-","spread"]},{"entry":["ple","wt %","wt %","%","Factor","tion","Index"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["EX5","90","10",{"u":"70"},"9","5","43"]},{"entry":["EX6","80","20",{"u":"64"},"5","3","15"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Examples 1-6 were all made with polyether based TPUs.
