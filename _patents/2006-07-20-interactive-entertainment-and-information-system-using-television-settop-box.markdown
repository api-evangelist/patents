title: Interactive entertainment and information system using television set-top box
abstract: An interactive entertainment and information system using a television set-top box, wherein pages of information are periodically provided to the set-top box for user interaction therewith. The pages include associated meta-data defining active locations on each page. When a page is displayed, the user interacts with the active locations on the page by entering commands via a remote control device, whereby the system reads the meta-data and takes the action associated with the location. Actions include moving to other active locations, hyperlinking to other pages, entering user form data and submitting the data as a form into memory. The form data may be read from memory, and the pages may be related to a conventional television program, thereby providing significant user interactivity with the television.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/895,452, filed Jun. 29, 2001, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/882,908 filed Jun. 26, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,317,885.","The invention relates generally to interactive television, and more particularly to an interactive entertainment and information system using a cable television set-top box.","The existing network of coaxial cable television wiring was once foreseen as providing the primary high-speed infrastructure for linking computers and computerized televisions to sources of information such as the Internet. However, it is becoming apparent that the availability of such cable-based information access will not be realized in the near term, if ever, particularly as competing high-speed transmission media (such as that based on higher quality telephone lines, faster modems and ISDN technology) become entrenched. Indeed, the current economic climate has made it impractical, or at least extremely risky, for cable television service providers to replace their existing base of possibly tens or even hundreds of thousands of receive-only cable set-top converter boxes with computerized transmit-and-receive cable modems. However, such two-way cable modems are needed to provide subscribers with interactive television and a real-time, high-speed link to information services, while simultaneously providing conventional television programming thereon.","At the same time, it is certain that many cable subscribers simply want low-cost television programming. This leaves cable providers with the dilemma of losing subscribers if they raise prices in order to upgrade their systems, or being left behind by new competitors and competing technologies if they do not. One solution is to convert to new technologies gradually. For example, conventional television programming can now be transmitted over cable in a digital format, enabling the transmission of many more (virtual) channels on the same bandwidth cable. Rather than force all subscribers to convert to the digital format, however, cable service providers will transmit a mixture of analog and digital signals for a period of time. This reduces the total number of channels transmitted to less than the maximum possible allowed by the bandwidth, but allows the cable companies to keep subscribers who are reluctant to convert.","Regarding information services on the television, a number of low-cost devices presently exist for allowing access to information services using a television set instead of a computer monitor. However, these devices do not approach interactive television, but instead do little more than use the television display as an inexpensive monitor while connecting to the information service via a conventional, telephone-based modem. As a result, with such a device there is no direct connection between programs transmitted to a viewer and interaction with web pages or the like about those programs. For example, a viewer of a home shopping channel wishing to purchase a displayed item cannot simply do so with the low cost-device, but instead must first connect to the information service (e.g., the Internet) via the user's service provider, find the shopping channel's web-site (if one exists), find the appropriate item (if available on the web-site) and then place the order. Most significantly, these devices tie up a telephone line for long periods of time, a significant drawback in many households.","Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide an interactive entertainment and information system using a cable television set-top box.","A related object is to provide the above system using existing digital set top boxes without need for modification of the hardware therein.","Another object is to provide a system as characterized above that enables a user to hyperlink between pages of information.","Yet another object is to provide a system of the above kind that facilitates an interactive relationship between transmitted programming and information pages related thereto.","A related object is to allow a user to submit form information, including forms related to a viewed television program.","In accomplishing those objects, another object is to provide a simple to operate, low cost information service to those users desiring same.","Still another object is to provide a system of the above kind that is flexible and extensible.","Briefly, the present invention provides an interactive television system including a head-end having means for injecting video information into a transmission medium. The video information includes a plurality of page images. Detection means at a subscriber end, such as hardware and software in a cable set-top box in conjunction with a remote control device, detect a first request to display one of the plurality of page images. Upon detection of the first request, the box selects and displays the page image, wherein the page image includes at least one active location, such as a link, having an action corresponding thereto. The detection means further detects a second request to take the action that corresponds to the active location, whereupon the action is taken. For example, a new page might be displayed when a link is selected. The video information includes meta-data or the like associated therewith for providing information about the active location and the action to be taken upon selection thereof. Other actions may include those related to form entry and submission of form data.","Other objects and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:","I. Overview","A basic feature of the Information Service architecture described below is the ability to deliver a stream of MPEG still images, or image pages, to a cable user (subscriber). Associated with these high-quality pages is a set of meta-data describing links to other pages along with a limited set of side effects and actions. The user can select and activate the links with a hand-held remote control, thereby interacting with the pages of information displayed on the television screen.","II. The Head-End","Turning to the drawings and referring first to , there is shown a system generally designated  into which the present invention may be incorporated. In general, the system  transmits signals comprising video and audio information from a cable head-end  onto a coaxial cable transmission medium , the signals being received at a plurality of subscriber locations -. Signal boosters (not shown) may be provided for amplifying and distributing the signals to the plurality of locations. At least one of the subscriber locations, such as the location , includes a digital set-top box  or the like equipped to convert the transmitted signals into signals capable of being received by a standard (e.g., NTSC) television set  for displaying video images and\/or outputting audio to a consumer end-user. Of course, the present invention does not require coaxial cable as the physical transmission medium, as signals can alternatively be transmitted over any transmission medium, including wireless means such as so-called \u201cwireless cable\u201d broadcasts, digital satellite communication, and so on.","As shown in more detail in , the head-end  includes a head-end LAN , including a download server  and an access control server , for controlling the operation of the head-end  via an Ethernet connection  to the various components therein. One of the components connected to the LAN is a satellite integrated receiver\/transcoder , which, as is known, receives and encodes digital television programming signals such as originating from microwave broadcasts received via a satellite antenna (dish) . One such receiver\/transcoder  is manufactured by General Instrument Corporation, Model No. IRT 1000, and outputs twenty-seven megabits per second (27 Mb\/s) MPEG2 transport streams modulated onto a forty-four megahertz intermediate frequency carrier. In turn, the MPEG2-encoded transport streams are received by an intermediate frequency to radio frequency (IF\/RF) upconverter , (General Instrument Corporation, Model No. C6U), which modulates the streams onto six megahertz (analog) channels and injects the signals onto the cable transmission medium . With multiplexing of multiple, packetized digital signals per six megahertz analog channel, hundreds of digital channels may be injected onto a single coaxial medium, although at present a mixture of analog and digital channels will likely be transmitted.","According to one aspect of the invention and as described in more detail below, in addition to conventional television programming, the cable head-end  outputs a plurality of still images, or information pages to information service subscribers. To this end, the cable head-end  includes an information server . The primary function of this head-end server  of the Information Service is to receive and store page data and carousel management information from content providers, and then to inject the page images onto the local cable system, i.e., produce a real-time carousel data stream for modulation onto a six megahertz channel of the transmission medium . The server  may have the page image data permanently stored therein, but typically will regularly download at least some of the page image data from an external data source  such as the Internet. As described below, the subscriber can interact with the digital set-top box  to selectively display the various page images on the screen of the television set .","More particularly, the information service server includes a carousel delivery application  for delivering a carousel  () of rendered HTML page images to the set-top box  along with meta-data for each page. Each page image consists of a single frame MPEG2 video sequence that is capable of being decoded by an MPEG video decoder  in the set-top box  (). The meta-data for each page describe the structure and contents of the page image. As described above, the carousel  of page images and meta-data are delivered to a client set-top-box  as a standard MPEG2 Transport Stream, broadcast in-band over a six MHz NTSC channel.","The preferred head-end interactive information server  comprises a rack-mounted personal computer, including an Intel Corporation P6 200 megahertz (or better) central processing unit, 128 megabytes of RAM, a two gigabyte or larger hard disk drive, and an ISDN or better connection to the external data source (Internet) . The server  also includes an Ethernet connection  to the local head-end LAN , and a TAXI (serial protocol) interface card  () along with an appropriate TAXI driver  therefor. The operating system is Windows NT Server 4.0. Although only one such server  is necessary for a typical head-end , two information service servers may be installed in a head-end for purposes of increased reliability based on redundancy. For redundant systems, the NT Servers will run Microsoft Clustering software.","As shown in more detail in , to inject the signals, the information server  is connected via its taxi interface card  (on copper) to an in-band data modulator  connected to an intermediate frequency to radio frequency upconverter . The preferred in-band data modulator  is manufactured by General Instrument Corporation, model number IM-1000, which accepts 27 Mb\/s transport streams from the information service server  and encodes and modulates those signals to a 44 MHz intermediate frequency. As with the redundant servers, there may be two IM-1000 in-band data modulators.","A second IF\/RF Upconverter  (General Instrument Corporation, Model No. C6U) converts the 44 MHz intermediate signal to an RF signal and injects the RF signal into the cable system's transmission medium . In this manner, the 27 Mb\/s MPEG2 transport streams containing page images originating from the information server  are modulated onto a six megahertz analog channel for reception by subscribers.","Lastly, the head-end  includes an out-of-band data multiplexor  (General Instrument Corporation, Model No. OM-1000) which is a required component of virtually any head-end . As is known, the out-of-band data multiplexor  may be used by the present information service to communicate information service-related data to the cable network. This data, including channel maps and possibly email as described below, is routed through the cable nation data center, and is thus only indirectly related to the operation of the information service head-end .","III. The Subscriber End","A. Hardware","Turning to the subscriber end of the system , as best shown in , the preferred set top box  is a digital set top box manufactured by General Instrument Corporation, Model No. DCT-1000. Although not necessary to the invention, it is significant that with this particular set-top box the hardware is unmodified, so that the existing base of publicly distributed set-top boxes may implement the Information Service without requiring upgrade servicing or replacement. However, to provide the service in accordance with the present invention, the operation of the box  is modified by additional software downloaded thereto. Such software includes a browser  which communicates with an operating system  of the box  by placing calls through an application programming interface (API) , as described in more detail below.","As shown in , the digital cable box  includes an in-band tuner  and an out-of-band tuner , along with appropriate demodulators  and , respectively. A microprocessor  controls the tuning operation of the tuners  and  based on commands received from a subscriber via an input device such as a keypad or an infrared remote control device , as described below. To this end, the set-top box  includes an infrared sensor  connected to an infrared receiver  which provides the command signaling information to the microprocessor . A memory system  includes the VRTX operating system  stored therein, and preferably comprises a combination of volatile dynamic RAM  and non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) .","In accordance with digital broadcasts wherein digitized channels are multiplexed as data packets onto a six megahertz analog channel, the set-top box  also includes at least three packet identification (PID) filters - to extract the appropriate encoded data packets for a user-selected digital channel. Based on the user-selected display, audio and other requirements, the microprocessor  writes an identification value to each of the PID filters -, whereby the filters - pass only those packets corresponding to that value. As shown in , one of the PID filters, filter , provides the filtered packets to an audio decoder  which decodes the digital audio data (encoded according to the AC3 format), while another PID filter  provides filtered packets (MPEG2 encoded) to the video decoder .","As can be readily appreciated, in addition to line-level audio and video outputs, the resulting video signal may be output from the set-top box  with separate luminance and chrominance signals (SVHS format). As is typical, the set-top box  may also contain a modulator (not shown) for combining the audio and video signals onto a modulated carrier channel such as channel  or , for compatibility with television sets not having separate audio and video inputs.","A third PID filter  is provided to extract in-band and out-of-band data directed to the operation of the set-top box . A packet processor  handles those packets. The set-top box is also equipped with an on-screen display frame buffer (OSD)  capable of superimposing alphanumeric characters, other symbols and bitmap graphics over a displayed image. To accomplish this superimposition, an overlay  is provided to appropriately combine the video outputs of the video decoder  and the OSD .","The cable box  functions when the user provides an appropriate and valid command to the cable box . For example, in response to a digital channel selection command, the microprocessor tunes the in-band tuner  to an appropriate analog channel based on the digital channel selected by the subscriber. If a digital channel was selected, a table or the like stored in the memory  determines the analog channel that carries the digital channel's packets, along with the packet identification numbers corresponding to that channel, for writing into the PID filters  and . Once the PIDs have been written, the audio and video decoders  and  will receive the appropriate packets and decode and output appropriate signals. As described below with reference to the present invention, some of the packets will include page images associated with the information service.","The subscriber also will be provided with an input device, such as the hand-held remote control  best shown in . The preferred input device  includes four directional (up, down, left and right cursor) buttons, -respectively, and a \u201cSELECT\u201d button . The remote control  may include a dedicated button, chosen as the \u201cA\u201d button  of , which may be used to enter the information service in one alternative scenario described below. The preferred remote control input device  will also provide the normal complement of TV-related buttons including a numeric keypad , volume adjustment, channel adjustment, mute and so on. Other buttons such as those for control of a videocassette recorder also may be provided. The remote control is preferably wireless, e.g., an infrared or RF-based remote control, but of course alternatively may be wired. Moreover, alternate input devices need not be remote, but may for example, be provided as a keypad (not shown) on a set-top box.","B. The Browser","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the user utilizes the set-top box  to enter and interact with the Information Service. To this end, the browser  has been downloaded into the memory  of the set-top box , along with APIs  for interfacing the browser  to the operating system  of the set-top box . The operation of the browser  is generally described herein with reference to the flow diagram of .","In one scenario, when the subscriber, via the remote control , tunes to a specified (and otherwise unused for programming) channel reserved for the Information Service, the browser  provides the subscriber with a page image having page elements displayed thereon including links to other information. The page images are obtained from the external data source , ordinarily the Internet, and are Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages provided by a third party that have been converted to an intermediate format as described below. For example, television stations, advertisers, pollsters and the like may obtain rights to have one or more page images transmitted on the cable medium  for potential viewing by the consumer end-user.","As shown by steps - of , the initial page image is preferably a default (home) page that is displayed when this particular Information Service channel is selected. Another page based on information known to the system, such as a page corresponding to the previous channel being viewed by the user, may be displayed when the user enters this channel. Although not necessary to the invention, it is feasible that more than one such channel may be provided for entering the information service, with a potentially different initial page for each channel.","By way of example, the image  of , including a number of links -, may be the default page displayed when channel  is selected. For visibility purposes, the cable box  utilizes the on-screen display (OSD)  to draw focus (e.g., denoted in  by the visible ring, i.e., box  or the like) on one of the links when the page  is displayed. Other elements which can be focused are shown in  as being surrounded by dashed boxes (not ordinarily visible to an actual user). As shown by step , the browser  then waits for a command from the user. One such command is entered as the user presses one of the directional cursor buttons -on the remote control  ().","As detected by step  and , when the user presses a directional cursor button -, at step  the browser  reads the meta-data associated with the displayed page to determine how to adjust focus, (described below), and then draws the focus at the next location at step . In this manner, the user tabs through the links -, changing the focus until a desired link is focused. Then, using the SELECT button  () of the remote control , (as detected by steps  and  of ), the user commands the browser  to take an action associated with the focused link. Examples of some possible actions are represented in , and include hyperlinking to another display page, filling in a check-box, submitting a form, and so on as described in more detail below.","If the user pushes the \u201cA\u201d button  on the remote control , step  detects this command. Since the user entered the Information Service via the service's specific channel, step  returns the user to step  which displays the default page of the Information Service. In other words, pressing the \u201cA\u201d button in this scenario returns the user to the home page of the service. The user exits the service in this scenario by entering another channel, as detected by step .","In another scenario, the user is watching programming on a specific channel that participates in the Information Service. If the user pushes the \u201cA\u201d button  on the remote control  () at any time while viewing such a participating channel, as detected by step , an initial page image (the \u201ctop-level\u201d page) corresponding to that channel is displayed (step ), along with links to other pages. For example, (assuming station participation), a user viewing ESPN will be shown an ESPN top-level page when the \u201cA\u201d button  is pressed. As before, if the top-level page provides links, the user can select from among those links and jump to other pages from that top-level page, but in this scenario those links ordinarily connect to only a small number of pages that are recognized as being \u201ctied\u201d to the original video channel. The user can exit the service by changing to another channel (step ), or by again pushing the \u201cA\u201d button  (step ). Note that in this scenario, step  does not display the home page when the \u201cA\u201d button is detected, but instead branches to step  where the set-top box is returned to the previous channel and the service is exited.","Moreover, if the service was entered via the \u201cA\u201d button  (), the act of changing the channel resets and exits the Information Service. For example, if a page image page corresponding to a participating channel is being displayed, and the user changes to another channel but then returns to the original channel, the video program of the original channel will be displayed, not the page corresponding thereto.","Note that if another command is entered, (e.g., a PLAY command corresponding to a video recorder), the command can be handled by the browser  as desired. For example, the command can be treated like a channel selection (exiting the service) or just ignored. Steps - are shown to generally represent receipt of such a command.","In any event, if the user selects a page in the service and does not immediately select a link, it is possible for the page image to be updated at a frequency equal to the maximum initial latency of the carousel . At present, a nominal maximum latency for an image to cycle back for display is about eight seconds, but this is variable depending on the amount of carousel bandwidth dedicated to a given page. More particularly, a frequently accessed page may be placed in the carousel  more than once at spaced-apart locations to reduce the latency for that page by increasing its frequency therein. For example, the service home page may be placed in the carousel  four times, providing a maximum latency of approximately two seconds for that page.","To facilitate the user interaction, once the service has been entered and a page is displayed, (step  or step ), using the OSD , the browser  in the digital set-top box  draws focus on the first page element listed in a FocusDescriptor list in the meta-data (described below) associated with that page. The geometry (shape) of the indicator (i.e., the focus ring) drawn by the OSD  is also determined by information in the FocusDescriptor list. It is also feasible to specify the color, shading and the like of the focus ring in the meta-data.","As described above, the user may change the focus via the direction buttons -on the remote control , whereby the focus is re-drawn on the appropriate element (step ). More particularly, the order of changing focus in response to a directional button, i.e., the focus chain, is specified by the focus descriptors that are carried in the page meta-data. The focus descriptors explicitly specify where focus should be next drawn when the user depresses the up, down, left or right buttons -on the remote control device . For remote controls lacking direction keys, a single button can be used to tab through the links, in which event the order in which the focus descriptors occur in the focus descriptor list determines the focus chain.","In either arrangment, while focus is rendered on a particular element, the user may select that element by pressing the SELECT button  on the remote control  (step ), or an equivalent button (e.g., ENTER button) available on other devices. Regardless of how selected, when the element is selected, the browser  takes an appropriate action. The following table summarizes the actions taken by the browser for various types of page elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Drawing",{}]},{"entry":["Element","Tag","Required","Browser action"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Text","<A HREF=url>","Focus","On selection jump to page indicated by URL."]},{"entry":["Anchor","anchor text"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/A>"]},{"entry":["Image","<A HREF=url>","Focus","On selection jump to page indicated by URL."]},{"entry":["Anchor","<IMG SRC=url>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/A>"]},{"entry":["Client","<AREA SHAPE=shape","Focus","On selection jump to page indicated by URL."]},{"entry":["Image","COORD=coord"]},{"entry":["Map","HREF=url>"]},{"entry":["Automatic","<META HTTP-","None","Jump to page indicated by URL automatically"]},{"entry":["Hyperlink","EQUIV=",{},"after delay (in seconds)."]},{"entry":[{},"REFRESH"]},{"entry":[{},"CONTENT=\u201ddelay;"]},{"entry":[{},"URL=url\u201d>"]},{"entry":["Guide","<A HREF=url>","Focus","On selection pass the URL string to the"]},{"entry":["Hyperlink","GUIDE",{},"GUIDE."]},{"entry":[{},"<\/A>"]},{"entry":["One","<INPUT","Focus","Echo numerals when they are entered on the"]},{"entry":["Line Text","TYPE=TEXT>","\u201c0\u201d\u2013\u201c9\u201d","keypad.

First, as represented by step , the browser determines a page to display, i.e., a default page or a linked page. At step , the browser  references meta-data associated with that page to determine the page group to which that page belongs, and the digital channel corresponding thereto. As described in more detail below, a one-to-one mapping exists between a page group and a digital channel, and nine-to-one mapping exists between carousel pages and digital channels.","Cable boxes typically provide APIs  to control the tuner and selection of program elements in the MPEG2 stream. The browser  uses such an API (in the APIs ) to specify the digital channel corresponding to the appropriate page group on the carousel , whereby the microprocessor  in the set-top box  tunes the in-band tuner  to the appropriate carrier (step ) and selects the program (Service) corresponding to the desired page group (step ). Note that the mapping between digital channels and carousel page programs is fixed. Next, at step , the browser  selects the program element (service component) containing the carousel page for display, and uses an API (or the like) to select the Video Program Element for display (step ). As a result of this step, the PID is written to the PID filter  and the page image is decoded and displayed by the hardware.","At step , the Browser  selects the program element that carries the meta-data for the page group. Cable boxes may provide an API for this function, this time to acquire an identifier for the page meta-data. At step , the browser  reads the page meta-data, which, as described in more detail below, includes a record for each element on the page. Each element record includes information such as the geometry of focus for that element and other information specific to that element. For anchor elements, (described below), the record includes the digital channel and program element for the page to which the link refers. Note that the carousel  contents are completely described by the carousel meta-data, which is carried in-band. No out-of-band or backchannel data transmission is required to navigate between pages in the carousel .","After the meta-data has been read (step ) by the browser , at step , the browser  draws focus on the default link as specified by the page meta-data. At this time, the page is ready for user-interaction. For example, as described above, the browser  draws focus on other links as they are tabbed to by the user, according to the focus chain specified in the page meta-data.","The browser  supports a subset of HTML anchors. The processing of each type of anchor is described below.

The browser  uses this information to draw focus on hyperlinks and to select other pages for display when hyperlinks are selected. The page meta-data also specify the focus chain. At present, the browser  handles text anchors, image anchors, and areas within imagemaps identically. Thus, when the user moves focus to a hyperlink, the browser  simply draws focus, using the OSD , on some region of the screen as indicated by geometry information in the page meta-data. When the user selects the link, the browser  changes the display to the destination page as indicated by the link data in the former page's meta-data.","At present, it is not possible to specify explicitly that an anchor within a page should receive initial focus. Instead, the first anchor or imagemap in the HTML source will be the element that receives initial focus when a page is first displayed. Within an imagemap the order of the <AREA> tags will determine the order of focus within that imagemap. The order of the <IMG> tag within the HTML source will determine where the imagemap anchors will occur in the focus chain. Note that it is possible to edit the focus chain for a page at page conversion time, (described below), in order to achieve results that cannot be generated simply in an HTML source.","Automatic hyperlinks are allowed, in which after the page is displayed and the delay (specified in meta-data) has elapsed, the browser  displays the page to which the hyperlink refers. As before, the page meta-data of the former page includes information that the browser  uses to select the destination page for display. Nothing is rendered in response to an automatic hyperlink.","A server-side slideshow may also be indicated, in which a series of still images is sequentially displayed on the same page. Unlike a client-side autolink to another page, (which can produce a similarly-appearing client-side slideshow using multiple pages), the page change for a server-side slideshow takes place at the server side. Via the slideshow tag, the server  inserts a new page image in place of the old with each new cycle of the carousel . On the client side, the displayed slideshow page autolinks to itself to reacquire page meta-data. The slideshow feature enables the injection of a series of still images with appropriate meta-data, while only using a single page of the carousel . Moreover, the server  may obtain the series of images in advance, eliminating real-time downloading thereof. By way of example, a real estate entity may use this feature to present a series of images of new homes with accompanying meta-data, but only use one page of those available in the carousel . Note that a slideshow can present an image for any multiple of the carousel revolution time, e.g., eight seconds, by replicating images in a series as desired.","Moreover, this feature can be used in conjunction with client-side autolinks (using more than one page) to produce other update intervals. Indeed, by rebuilding the carousel, animation may be accomplished. To this end, a plurality of still images with slight changes from image to image will appear as animated movement. If a single-page slideshow, the animation may appear somewhat slow depending on the latency (e.g., a movement every eight seconds). However, with autolinks to multiple pages, the animation may be sped up. Note that MPEG2 is arranged to transmit change information between frames, and thus not much bandwidth is required to accomplish animation. Other image enhancements such as brightening a focus ring, adding images together and so on may be performed by rebuilding the carousel, taking advantage of MPEG2 features wherever possible.","In keeping with the invention, the browser  supports a subset of HTML forms with a few extensions.

By way of example,  shows an exemplary page  including text boxes -, radio buttions -, and a check box . In addition, the page  includes a button  for submitting an order, a \u201cRESET\u201d button  for clearing entries, and a hyperlink element . In , focus is shown (by the solid rectangular ring) as being on the \u201cPURCHASE NOW\u201d submit button , while elements which can be focused are shown surrounded by dashed boxes (not ordinarily visible to an actual user).","One such form is a guide form, which is processed in real time by the programming guide to take an appropriate action upon user submission thereof. As described below, depending on the current time, the programming guide allows a user to link to a currently available program, add the program to a timer for timed viewing thereof, and\/or prompt the user to purchase a pay-per-view event.","Another type of form is for purchasing merchandise or the like. To perform a purchase with this type of \u201cstore-and-forward\u201d form, the user tabs through the various elements to select and enter appropriate information. The entered attributes (e.g. color, size, style, quantity, payment method and so on) are temporarily stored in the memory . Once the appropriate data is entered in this manner, the user selects the \u201cPURCHASE NOW\u201d link , which stores the selected information as data  () (preferably in the non-volatile memory ) in the set-top box . At a later time, the purchase information will be collected from the set-top box  with a polling procedure, whereby each box in the cable system  is directed in turn to call a polling server  via its modem  (), typically late at night.","More particularly, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is no real-time interaction with a web server. As a consequence, form submission must be emulated. The meta-data for a page image includes all the necessary information required to generate a standard URL query string. When a form is submitted, data including the ACTION URL, the query string, and METHOD are stored as data  (preferably in NVRAM ) in the set-top-box  as an ASCII string. These data are formatted exactly like a standard URL query string. The METHOD, GET or POST is appended to the form query string. In other words, a form element named _METHOD is appended to every form query string automatically. For instance, \u201c&_METHOD=GET\u201d. An upload forms server  of the Information Service removes this sub-string when the form data are processed.","When the set-top-box  is polled via its modem  for the return data (typically once per day), the form data for all such forms which have been submitted are returned to the upload forms server  of the Information Service. The server  processes the form data and generates the appropriate HTTP GET or POST requests to the specified ACTION URL. Of course, user information, including name, billing and mailing addresses, and credit card type and number, will need to be collected from each user before a purchase can be made. This information can either be held remotely by the polling server , or stored within the set-top box  to be sent with each purchase. If this information is not available or valid, then the \u201cPURCHASE NOW\u201d button will link to an \u201cerror\u201d page in the carousel, which will direct the user to call the service provider.","No immediate confirmation of the purchase will be available. The CGI scripts for Information Service forms cannot return HTML documents to subscriber-users since the contents of the carousel are broadcast and not unicast. However, the CGI forms script can send Email to the user in response to a forms query. To this end, the Email address of a particular set-top-box can be returned with the form data by using the Magic Element Name _EMAIL in a HIDDEN form elements (described below). Thus, an e-mail confirmation notice may be sent to the user, as described below with reference to the e-mail scenario.","The focus geometry for form elements is specified in the page meta-data, described below. As before, the browser  uses this information to draw focus on the form elements. At present, it is not possible to specify that a particular form element has the default focus for that form. Instead, the first form element in the HTML source will be the first element that receives focus when the user tabs to the form. It is also not presently possible to specify that a particular form element has the default focus for the page in which that element is contained. If, however, the form is the first element in the HTML source, then the first element in that form will receive the initial focus.","Note that for high-quality imaging, (relative to the low quality provided by the OSD ), the face of a submit button (such as the \u201cPURCHASE NOW\u201d link ) is rendered at page conversion time as part of the compressed page image. The button borders, however, are rendered at display time using the OSD  of the set-top-box . The page meta-data includes information that the browser  uses to draw button focus as well as drawing button borders.","As a result, when the user selects a submit button, the browser  directs the OSD  to draw the button borders such that the button appears to be depressed and released. As generally shown in , when the user selects a submit button (step ,  and step , ), the browser  then queues the appropriate form query string (step ) for upload as described above, (or for processing by the program guide as described below). If a DESTINATION attribute is specified on the containing form, (as detected by step ), then following the submit command the browser  will jump to the page corresponding to that destination (step ).","Similarly, a reset button face (e.g., \u201cRESET\u201d button ) is rendered at page conversion time as part of the compressed page image. The button borders are likewise rendered at display time using the OSD  of the set-top-box  so that the button appears to be depressed and released. The page meta-data includes information that the browser  uses to draw button focus as well as drawing button borders. When the user selects the reset button (step ), the browser  appropriately draws the button borders and restores the form elements to their default state (step ).","Any page that contains a text entry box or password box (described below) contains a reset button so that the user can clear errors. At present, the text entry and password boxes allow entry but do not support any other type of editing.","Any submit element, e.g., a \u201cSUBMIT\u201d button or a submit image element, is also rendered at page conversion time as part of the compressed page image. The page meta-data includes information that the Browser  uses to draw focus on the image. When the user selects the Submit Image, the Browser  queues the appropriate form query string for upload or processing by the guide. If a DESTINATION attribute is specified on the containing form then the Browser  will jump to that page.","Check boxes are also rendered at page conversion time as part of the compressed page image. Since a check mark may or may not appear based on the user entry, the check mark is rendered at display time using the OSD  of the set-top-box . The page meta-data includes information that the browser  uses to draw box focus as well as drawing the check marks on the box. When the user selects a check box (step ), the browser  inverts the state of the box (step ) in the memory  and correspondingly changes the display by either drawing or erasing a checkmark (shown as an \u201cX\u201d in box  of ) on the selected checkbox. When the form is submitted, the boxes that are checked result in name\/value pairs in the form query string.","Similarly, radio buttons are rendered at page conversion time as part of the compressed page image. The user-movable check (shown as a darkened circle in box of ), however, is rendered at display time using the OSD  of the set-top-box . The page meta-data includes information that the browser  uses to draw button focus as well as drawing check marks on the button. When the user selects a radio button (step ), the browser  sets the state of that button to selected while de-selecting others with the same name. At step , the browser  also causes the OSD to draw a suitable checkmark on the button, and erase the checkmarks on any other buttons with the same name. When the form is submitted, the button that is checked results in a name\/value pair in the form query string.","At present, a Text Entry Box only supports entry and echo of the numerals \u201c0\u201d through \u201c9,\u201d and only a single font and pitch are supported. A Text Entry Box is rendered at page conversion time as part of the compressed page image. Echoed text is rendered at display time using the OSD  of the set-top-box . The page meta-data includes information that the browser  uses to draw focus as well as information for drawing the characters.","When a text box is selected at step  ( (), the browser  draws focus on the text box. If the user depresses a number key on the keypad then at step  that number is displayed in the leftmost position of the text box and advances the text entry position to the next character position. No cursor is presently displayed to indicate the text entry position, and the next character is simply the rightmost unoccupied character position in the text box. When the user depresses another number key on the keypad, that number is displayed in the new character position and the text entry position is advanced. When the form is submitted a name\/value pair is appended to the form query string.","Certain rules for text boxes presently apply. If the user attempts to enter more than characters then allowed in the SIZE field of the meta-data (described below), those characters are ignored. Moreover, for now a text box does not support any type of editing, and thus in order to clear errors, the user uses a reset button on the form. No default values (using the VALUE attribute) may be specified for text boxes. The Password Box is identical in function to the text box except that the characters are not echoed. Instead, an asterisk (\u201c*\u201d) or the like is displayed at step  for every character that is entered.","The browser  also supports the DISABLED attribute, (seldom supported by legal HTML), which, when used in conjunction with the magic name \u201c_TOTAL\u201d can be used to generate a read-only text box which displays the total cost of a purchase transaction. For instance the tag <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME=_TOTAL SIZE=5> will generate a text box  characters in size in which the following result is displayed: _TOTAL=_QUANTITY*_PRICE+_SANDH, where _QUANTITY is presumably to be entered by the user in a text box (e.g., the text box ) and _PRICE and _SANDH are specified using hidden text. Such a read only text box  is shown in .","Hidden text results only in page meta-data. Nothing is rendered either at page conversion time or at display time. When a form is submitted Hidden Text results in a name\/value pair being appended to the form query string.","Certain state information stored within the set-top-box may be returned as part of the form query string by using \u201cmagic element names\u201d for the NAME of the hidden text. In such an event, no VALUE need be specified.","The Information Service of the present invention adds two attributes to the standard HTML syntax. More particularly, a first way in which the Information Service extends the standard HTML hidden text syntax is by adding the attribute AUTOSUBMIT to the tag <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN>. When the user leaves a page with a form containing a hidden text element with the AUTOSUBMIT attribute, the form query string is queued for upload just as if the user had selected a submit button.","Second, the attribute DESTINATION has been added to the tag <FORM>. This tag causes the Browser  to jump to the specified page when the user submits the form. This allows the author to specify an HTML page that simulates the result of the HTTP GET on normal form submission (e.g., through CGI). This tag is unique to the Information Service system.","For any page, it is possible to include a link that tunes the set-top box  to a video channel rather than a link to another page. To this end, the Information Service facilitates interaction with a programming guide (e.g., PreVue). The exact behavior of the link depends on the type of video program that is selected. If the link selects a channel with no time (of day) associated therewith, or selects a channel with a time that indicates a currently available program, the set-top box immediately tunes to the selected channel. If the associated time is in the future, the user is presented with a programming guide pop-up window and prompted to add the program to a timer for timed viewing thereof. If the program is a pay-per-view event, the user is prompted to buy the event, and, if purchased, the browser  either tunes to the channel or adds the program to the timer.","To accomplish such actions, the Information Service provides access to functions in the programming guide through the use of forms. A form that accesses the guide does so by specifying an ACTION URL that is processed by the guide, that is, the guide looks like a web-server running a CGI script. One such guide is accessed using the URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.prevue.com\/cgi\/guide\u201d.","At page conversion time, this URL is recognized, and meta-data for the page indicate that the form query string should be submitted to the guide for processing. At page display time, when the form is submitted, the browser  submits the form query string to the guide rather than queue it for upload. To reduce meta-data size and simplify argument processing, the query string is preferably collapsed into a compact binary representation thereof at page conversion time. This syntax allows page image authors to access guide emulation (e.g., provided by PreVue) at author time. The following table sets forth the queries that are supported by the guide:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Function","Query Syntax","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["TUNE","Function=TUNE","Switch to a television"]},{"entry":[{},"&SourceID=program_name","program"]},{"entry":[{},"&Time=now"]},{"entry":["REMIND","Function=TUNE","Set a reminder for a television program"]},{"entry":[{},"&SourceID=program_name",{}]},{"entry":[{},"&Time=some_future_time"]},{"entry":["RECORD","Function=REC","Set a reminder for a television"]},{"entry":[{},"&SourceID=program_name","program"]},{"entry":[{},"&Time=some_future_time"]},{"entry":["EMAIL HELO","Function=HELO","Opens EMAIL session"]},{"entry":["EMAIL QUIT","Function=QUIT","Closes EMAIL session"]},{"entry":["EMAIL DATE","Function=DATE","Display current message"]},{"entry":[{},"&UpperLeft=xlocation+ylocation","RFC822 \u201cDate\u201d text at the"]},{"entry":[{},"&LowerRight=xlocation+ylocation","specified screen location."]},{"entry":["EMAIL FROM","Function=FROM","Display current message"]},{"entry":[{},"&UpperLeft=xlocation+ylocation","RFC822 \u201cFrom\u201d text at the"]},{"entry":[{},"&LowerRight=xlocation+ylocation","specified screen location."]},{"entry":["EMAIL SUBJ","Function=SUBJ","Display current message"]},{"entry":[{},"&UpperLeft=xlocation+ylocation","RFC822 \u201cSubject\u201d text at the"]},{"entry":[{},"&LowerRight=xlocation+ylocation","specified screen location."]},{"entry":["EMAIL BODY","Function=BODY","Display current message"]},{"entry":[{},"&UpperLeft=xlocation+ylocation","RFC822 message body text at"]},{"entry":[{},"&LowerRight=xlocation+ylocation","the specified screen location."]},{"entry":["EMAIL ACKS","Function=ACKS","Save the current message and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"increment the current message"]},{"entry":[{},{},"indicator."]},{"entry":["EMAIL ACKD","Function=ACKD","Delete the current message"]},{"entry":[{},{},"and increment the current"]},{"entry":[{},{},"message indicator."]},{"entry":["EMAIL ACKB","Function=ACKB","Save the current message and"]},{"entry":[{},{},"decrement the current"]},{"entry":[{},{},"message indicator."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"As described above, the carousel of page images and meta-data are carried as a single MPEG2 Transport Stream, and each page image is a single MPEG2 video sequence consisting of a single I-Frame image of the rendered HTML page. As generally represented in the program map tables -of , each page image is carried as a single program element (i.e., Service Component) of a program (i.e., Service), and, (as limited by the DCT1000 set-top box), each program (Service) ordinarily consists of ten program elements. As further seen in the program map tables -of , nine of the program elements (i.e., a page group) contain page images, and the other program element contains the meta-data for the nine page images that make up the program. The meta-data are carried as the first program element within a program.","As also represented in , each group of nine image pages in the carousel , which correspond to a distinct program, is mapped to a single digital channel. Thus, (as described above with reference to ), in order to display a particular page, the browser  tunes to the appropriate digital channel and selects the appropriate program element (Service Component) for display. The browser  also selects the first (meta-data) program element so that it can render focus and execute links as directed by the user. The transport stream includes the appropriate PSI data to allow the page images to be selected and displayed.","According to digital transmission conventions, the program map table -(i.e., Service Definition Table) maintained for each program contains 10 entries, and, including the PID which caries the program map table, thus uses 11 PIDs. A program association table  (Service Association Table) associates programs with program map PIDs and thus contains as many entries as the number of carousel pages divided by nine. The maximum number of page images that may be carried by a single carousel  is limited to 6700 pages. Note that if PCRs must be supplied to ensure that the set-top-box NTSC sub-carrier does not drift, then a single valid PCR stream will be multiplexed with the carousel data. The program map table for all programs references this PID as the PCR_PID.","Pages are delivered to the server in a two-stage process. First, a content provider transfers information (from an external source such as the Internet ) to the Information Service server , the information including provider identification, a root URL of the content, and the date and time the content is to become valid. Any acceptable protocol for this transmission is feasible, including Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or a private message protocol on top of TCP\/IP.","Second, using HTTP, the Information Service server gathers the content at the specified URL and stores it for processing into the carousel . The timing of this transfer may vary depending on several factors, including available storage at the server, number of pending transfers, date and time the content is to become valid and default actions specified by the cable operator. In any event, the content is transferred before the start time. For real-time updates (e.g. sports, scores or stock information), the same process is followed, but with an immediate start time. The system is designed to allow for low latency for both the information transferring and content gathering stages.","As generally represented in the block diagram of , a conversion process  converts the page  into an intermediate page format , where it is passed to a carousel builder .

Note that there is a one-to-one mapping between program elements and pages and a nine-to-one mapping between pages and programs. At step , the page image is then wrapped with the appropriate Transport Stream systems-layer syntax using the appropriate PID from the program map table (Service Definition Table). Then, at step , the page meta-data are wrapped in the appropriate private_message_stream syntax and Transport Stream syntax, using the appropriate meta-data PID from the Program Map Table.","At step , the meta-data (described below) for any pages that contain links to the (newly provided) page are modified to contain the program number and program element for this page. Similarly, at step , the meta-data for the newly-provided page is modified to contain the program number (SourceID) and program element (Service Component) for pages that are linked to by the page. The initial state of the link program number in the page meta-data is such that a Null page is indexed. The Null page resides on program number , and contains an image indicating that the page is not available. Lastly, as represented by step , when the carousel  is ready for transmission, the information server  periodically takes each carousel image stored in the 50 and injects the image onto the transmission medium , a process which continues for the carousel  until page information therein is changed. As a result, pages are periodically available at the subscriber end as described above.","The carousel builder  maintains a carousel description that is modified by page update messages. Each time the carousel  changes, the carousel builder  creates a new carousel image (in server memory) from the carousel description and the pages (stored on disk). When the new carousel image is completed, it replaces the old carousel at the beginning of the next cycle. Note that in the case of pages that change each cycle, i.e., \u201cslide show\u201d pages, a new carousel must be built for each cycle.","V. Meta-Data","In order for the user to interact with the pages, the page images have meta-data and PSI data associated therewith in the Transport Stream. In general, the carousel page meta-data contain the information necessary for the browser  to render focus on the links on the page corresponding thereto. The meta-data also contain information for selecting a new page image when the user selects a link, gather form input from a subset of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) form elements and\/or post form input for deferred processing.","The meta-data for a page group (of nine pages) are carried in a single program element consisting of private_stream_messages. To associate the appropriate meta-data with its corresponding page, the meta-data is fragmented into multiple private_stream_messages such that the meta-data for a particular page is carried as a unique session. Each private_stream_message is capable of containing a predetermined number of bytes of meta-data. The meta-data for a page consists of four tables, identified herein as the page element table, the link table, the focus table, and the form table.

First, an author creates a page using standard HTML content creation tools, such as provided in an HTML-ready authoring program . Such authoring programs using standard content creation tools are well known and will not be described in detail herein. However, because the pages are to be viewed on a television, the author should take care to create an HTML page suitable for television viewing. For example, the author should select font styles and sizes appropriate for television display, and avoid color and luminance transitions which generate dot-crawl. Indeed, the author may wish to view a close approximation of the ultimately resulting page by using a VGA to NTSC converter with underscan and antiflicker filtering enabled. In any event, as shown in , an HTML source  including an HTML document and associated image files is provided.","After the author is satisfied with the initial result, the author runs a Phase 1 post-processing tool , which performs a number of operations on the HTML source . Such a tool includes the operations of rendering the page at a 640 by 480 resolution and vertically scaling the page such that the full 640 by 480 image resides within the SMPTE safe action area of a 704 by 480 overscanned television raster (approximately 640 by 432). The scaled page image is bordered by black. In addition, the rendered page is vertically filtered to reduce interlace flicker, and horizontally filtered to reduce cross-luma and chross-chroma interference artifacts.","In phase one processing, the meta-data that define how focus should be drawn on links and form elements are inferred by the HTML layout. The focus geometry is specified on a 352 by 480 grid that overlays the 704 by 480 page image. In other words, only even pixel addresses are allowed in focus specifications. The meta-data that contain the name of the HTML pages associated with each link are inferred from the HTML source , as are meta-data that describe any forms. The meta-data defining the focus geometry and link URLs are encoded using standard client-side image map tags, i.e., <AREA>. The HREF attribute for entries relating to form element focus will contain the URL specified by the ACTION attribute in the <FORM> tag. Appended to that URL will be the form query string fragment defined by that form element. The HREF attribute for hyperlinks will contain the URL from the corresponding anchor or imagemap.","The output  of this first phase includes a true color bitmap (.BMP) file containing the processed page image and an HTML file that contains the original HTML source encapsulated in a <META> tag. Also contained are the original image files encapsulated in a <META> tag, a client-side imagemap that is the processed page image, wherein the name of the image file is identical to the name of the HTML source file, and a <MAP> tag defining the geometry of focus for all page elements that can receive focus including form elements. The HTML file also contains the meta-data for the page encapsulated in a <META> tag, and the meta-data for each page element encapsulated in a <META> tag.","Since all focus geometry is specified using standard client-side image map syntax, the author can use standard imagemap editing tools to change the focus geometry if desired. Moreover, since the page image is output as a true color .BMP file, the author can make any necessary changes to the image using standard image editing tools. Note that if desired, the anti-flicker, cross-luma, and cross-chroma filtering may be postponed to the next phase (described below).","The order of the <AREA> tags in the <MAP> tag determines the focus chain. As a result, it is possible to edit the Focus Chain for a page at this stage in order to achieve results that cannot be generated simply in the HTML source . For example, the author may change the focus chain order by changing the order in which these tags occur, since the first <AREA> tag defines where focus is initially drawn when the page is displayed.","After the author is satisfied with the focus geometry, focus chain order and the final page image, a phase2 post-processing tool  is run. The phase2 tool  performs a number of operations, including coding the page image as a single MPEG I-Frame, and processing the <MAP> tag to generate focus descriptors for each page element. The focus descriptors for each page element are combined with the other meta-data for each page element.","The output of this second phase is a single HTML file  containing a number of items encapsulated in a <META> tag, including the original HTML source, the original image files, the processed page image and the compressed page image. Also contained in the file  are the meta-data for the page and the meta-data for each page element therein. After phase2 processing, the page is in the intermediate page format (described above), and the author provides the final file to the carousel building tool , such as by running a file transfer program  to transfer the file via the Internet  to the server  of the Information Service.","Note that the phase1 and phase2 processes ( and , respectively) can be run back-to-back without intervention. The break exists therebetween to provide authors the ability to exercise more control over the process if so desired. Thus, as described above, between phase1  and phase2  of the tool chain, an author may edit the focus geometry by using any number of existing imagemap editing tools, while the focus chain may also be edited by editing the FOCUS meta-data.","To allow the HTML author to reference user-specific data stored in the set-top-box  and perform other limited functions, a set of form element names are defined to have special meanings, as set forth in the table below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0178"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00022","num":"00022"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Element name","Meaning and usage","Format"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["_SHIPNAME","Default shipping name.

Other","At least some existing programming guide applications and cable system infrastructures support one-way e-mail broadcasts to all users. This function can be extended to allow one-way e-mail to a specific subscriber, using the existing (e.g. PreVue) e-mail notification and display mechanism. E-mail data can be sent to a specific set-top box via the out-of-band modulator  () and the out-of-band tuner  (), in the same manner that a specific box is enabled for receiving a pay-per-view movie. Although not directly linked to the Information Service architecture, a head-end e-mail server is considered a part of the Information Service head-end installation, and the e-mail server software is supplied by the assignee of the present invention.","The Information Service e-mail client is implemented using standard HTML forms. A simple example would be a form containing buttons for \u201cPrevious\u201d, \u201cNext\u201d, and \u201cDelete\u201d which would submit the appropriate query strings to the guide in order to have the mail text rendered using the OSD  over the page image. The author of the page can specify where the \u201cFrom\u201d address is rendered and where the message text is rendered. The coordinates for these fields are referenced to a 352 by 480 OSD grid, where the original 640 by 480 page image underlays the center 320 by 432 pixels.","Although at present e-mail is generally read-only, it is understood that two-way e-mail is feasible. For example, outgoing e-mail messages may be written to the memory  and polled via the modem  () by an e-mail server or the like, or sent directly (or as soon as a telephone line is available) thereto via the modem  upon user command. Moreover, a backchannel which sends information on the transmission medium  from the various set-top boxes back to the head-end  may be dedicated, in which event all data, including form entry data and e-mail data, can be immediately transferred without polling the modem . However, in order for e-mail to be practical, a more sophisticated alphanumeric input device, such as a conventional QWERTY keyboard arranged for communicating with the set-top box, would likely need to be provided.","It is also feasible to add audio to the carousel , whereby audio may be optionally played while the user is in the Information Service. In such a system, part of the information sent with each transmitted page is the next block (or blocks, if multiple, user-selectable audio streams are transmitted) of encoded audio data. Depending on the amount of memory in the set-top box, the audio data may be buffered so as to load more than one carousel revolution's worth (e.g. eight seconds) of audio data from a given carousel  into the set-top box  for each stream. However, by regularly changing the carousel, the audio may be a real-time broadcast.","Lastly, instead of a carousel , it is feasible to have the server  execute a program that selectively injects the pages into the transport stream. For example, based on statistical information such as page popularity in conjunction with the time of day, (information which may be sampled and polled from the set-top box ), more popular pages can be injected more frequently into the stream than less popular pages. The maximum latency for a given page can thus be controlled, without effecting the total number of pages possible, (which occurs with a carousel by increasing a page's frequency in the carousel at the expense of decreasing the number of distinct pages therein).","As can be seen from the foregoing detailed description, there is provided an interactive entertainment and information system using a cable television set-top box, wherein existing digital set top boxes may be used without need for modification of the hardware therein. The system enables a user to hyperlink between pages of information, and facilitates an interactive relationship between transmitted programming and information pages related thereto. The user may submit form information, including forms related to a viewed television program. The system provides a simple to operate, low cost information service, while being flexible and extensible.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions, a certain illustrated embodiment thereof is shown in the drawings and has been described above in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
