{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of pending application U.S. Ser. No. 10\/315,250, filed on Dec. 10, 2002, entitled USER INTERFACE FOR MOBILE HANDHELD COMPUTER UNIT. This application claims priority from provisional application No. 61\/132,469, filed on Jun. 19, 2008, entitled IMPROVED KEYPAD FOR CHINESE CHARACTERS.","The field of the present invention is user interfaces for electronic devices and, more particularly, to touch screen user interfaces.","Touch screens provide user interfaces through which a user enters input to a computing device by touching a screen at a selected location, with a stylus or with his finger.","Conventional touch screens are limited as to the types of user inputs that they can recognize. For example, conventional touch screens are unable to distinguish between a soft tap and a hard press. In some prior art embodiments users initially select an item on the screen, and then subsequently activate the selected item. However, because prior art touch screens do not distinguish between degrees of pressure, the user is required to remove his finger or stylus from the screen and activate his selection with a second tap. It would be advantageous to produce touch screens that distinguish between varying amounts of pressure applied to the screen so that a user can select an item by touching its location on the screen, and then activate the item by applying additional pressure to the touch location without having to first remove his finger or stylus from the screen.","In conventional touch screens the keys are often small relative to the touch area, especially in handheld devices. The keys are also often situated close together. This can make it difficult to determine which key is being pressed by the user. It would be advantageous to clearly indicate to the user which key the user has selected, and furthermore, to allow the user to accept or reject the selected key without first removing his finger or stylus from the screen in order to perform a second tap.","Current user interfaces are basic and often require navigation through a series of menus in order to perform a desired operation. The present invention presents a user interface that is versatile in providing the user with many options, while requiring only few selections to activate a desired function. To further enhance user experience, certain functions are performed automatically without requiring the user to enter a selection.","Aspects of the present invention relate to user interfaces designed for use with a touch screen. The present invention relates to computer readable media storing computer programs with computer program code, which, when read by a computer unit, allows the computer to present a user interface for the computer unit.","In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the computer unit features a touch sensitive display area. According to preferred embodiments an initial display configuration presents a plurality of gadgets on the display. These gadgets are small areas of the screen that indicate which functions each gadget will perform when activated by the user. When a gadget is activated, typically by the user touching the area of the display on which the gadget is displayed, the gadget increases in size and provides the user with icons and information about the gadget's functions. Significantly, the gadget does not cover the entire display area. Thus, when a gadget, or even a plurality of gadgets, is active, the primary display of all available gadgets is still accessible. This primary display can be compared to a desktop in computer operating system user interfaces. However, this primary display in the user interface of the present invention is not the same as a desktop where active windows can cover icons on the desktop. In the present invention, gadgets are arranged in a manner that open gadgets do not cover other gadgets. Rather, when an open gadget expands in size, other gadgets are shifted to make room for the expanded gadget. This allows the user to scroll the primary display or desktop to view any gadget. In the context of the present invention, this primary display area that includes both open and closed gadgets is called the home window. The user scrolls the home window to view gadgets that are shifted beyond the viewable area of the display. An expanded, or activated, gadget has an expanded window, but often it is not large enough to display everything contained in that gadget window. To view contents of the gadget not displayed in the visible portion of the gadget window, the user scrolls the gadget window. Thus, two different scroll operations are provided: scrolling the home window and scrolling a gadget window. According to one embodiment, scrolling is executed by gliding a finger or stylus along the touch screen to shift the active display area of the home window or of the gadget. The scrolling affects the home window if the finger glide began in an area of the screen that does not belong to an active gadget; the scroll affects an active gadget window if the finger glide began inside that active gadget window.","Various embodiments of the invention support several methods of scrolling a window. According to one embodiment, scrolling is done when the user touches the display inside the window area, for example at an edge of the window, or on an icon, such as an arrow or scrollbar, indicating a scroll operation. According to another embodiment, scrolling is done by the user touching the window with a finger or stylus and then gliding the finger or stylus along the touch sensitive screen in a direction indicating the desired direction of the scroll. When the content of the home display is larger in two dimensions than the actual display screen, this operation is like panning an image or map. When it is larger along only one axis (e.g., only vertically), the scrolling only scrolls in the one axis even when the glide is not orthogonal along the one axis.","Another aspect of the present invention relates to computer readable media storing a computer program with computer program code, which, when read by a mobile handheld computer unit, allows the computer to present a user interface for the mobile handheld computer unit. The user interface features a touch sensitive area in which representations of a plurality of keys are displayed, and each key is mapped to a corresponding location in the touch sensitive area at which the representation of the key is displayed. A key in this context includes, inter alia, alphabetic keys such as in a QWERTY keypad, numeric keys and also icons representing programs or functions. A key is selected, but not activated, when an object touches the corresponding location. This intermediate status of being selected but not activated facilitates the user to subsequently activate a desired key and avoid activating a neighboring key that the user selected but does not wish to activate. A selected key is activated when the object touching it applies additional pressure to the key location.","According to preferred embodiments of the invention, when a key is selected, the user interface generates a secondary representation of the key, such as a callout balloon containing the key representation. The callout balloon is placed away from the key location (being touched) so that the user can easily view which key is selected without lifting his finger. According to another embodiment, an audio representation of the selected key is generated so the user hears which key was selected.","According to still further features in preferred embodiments of the invention, the user touches the screen (with a finger or stylus) at a first location, for example selecting a first key. The user then glides his finger or stylus over the screen to additional locations. At each additional location a new key is selected and the previously selected key is deselected. The user can activate any selected key by applying additional pressure to the screen. The user does not have to remove the object from the screen to glide and select additional keys even after activating a first key.","Additional touch pressure is detected in various ways according to several embodiments. According to one embodiment, the touch sensitive area is a light-based touch screen operable to detect different levels of touch pressure. For example, light-based touch screens typically include a calculating unit operable to identify the size, shape and contours of an area being touched based on a pattern of obstructed light. See applicant's co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/494,055, titled ON A SUBSTRATE FORMED OR RESTING DISPLAY ARRANGEMENT, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. When a finger or flexible object is used as a touch object, as additional pressure is applied to the touch surface, the contact area of the finger or object touching the screen increases. Thus, additional pressure is detected when an increase in the contours of the covered touch area is detected.","Alternatively, or in combination with the above, the touch sensitive area features both a touch screen operable to identify a touch location on the screen and a pressure sensor operable to detect pressure applied to the screen but not sensitive to the location of the object applying the pressure.","Other aspects of the present invention relate to convenient arrangement and function of icons to perform popular functions within a user interface. Thus, a camera gadget features a multimedia messaging service (MMS) button facilitating sending an active photo in an MMS message; a keylock gadget locks the computer and displays an instrumental keypad for entering a musical code to unlock the computer; a reporting gadget displays information for a first period of time and is then automatically deactivated. Several reporting gadgets are provided, including a gadget that displays the time of day; a gadget displays a weather forecast; a gadget that displays stock market information.","According to still further features in preferred embodiments the reporting gadget continues to display its information for a second period of time if the gadget is touched during the first period of time. I.e., automatic deactivation after the first period of time is canceled.","Touch screen keypads offer great flexibility in keypad interface design\u2014flexibility that cannot be achieved with electromechanical keypads. Custom design keypads can be generated on a touch screen, where the markings on each key and the functions that each key provides are optimized for a designated application. Moreover, touch screen keypads can change modes, from one pad of keys and associated functions to a different pad of keys and associated functions. Custom keypads are of particular advantage for multi-lingual applications.","A general description of touch screen keypad interfaces, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, and several examples thereof, are described in detail hereinbelow.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to improved keypads for inputting Chinese characters using XT9 stroke input, and using Chinese Pinyin. XT9 stroke input builds Chinese characters using six basic strokes, and offers selection of possible characters and phrases based on a set of strokes that have been input. Chinese Pinyin uses Latin characters that transliterate a sound or a syllable, in combination with a digit that represents an intonation or inflection. E.g., Ma in a rising tone is m-a-1, and Ma in a descending tone is m-a-2.","Reference is now made to , which is an illustration of an improved stroke-based keypad for entering Chinese characters by inputting strokes, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  is a keypad , used for inputting basic strokes. Also shown in  is a sequence of strokes - that are successively input by a user, and a corresponding sequence of Chinese characters - that are entered in a message being composed.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, keypad  is generated and displayed on a touch screen. Keypad  has fewer than the standard 12 keys in a touch pad, allowing more room on screen for displaying characters.","Further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the keys of keypad  are customized so that they contain only relevant information. For example, a prior art keypad displays a digit, 3-4 characters, and a basic Chinese stroke, all inside one key, even though in XT9 stroke mode the basic Chinese stroke is the only useful one. The custom keys of the present invention display only the basic Chinese strokes, or the strokes and numbers, but no characters.","There are two types of key presses supported by keypad \u2014regular and long. A regular key press adds the stroke shown on the key to the series of strokes - already pressed. As strokes are successively entered, a numbered array  of Chinese characters or phrases is dynamically displayed along the top of the keypad. These characters or phrases are predicted based on the key presses already entered. In order to select one of the numbered elements of array , the user performs a long key press on that number. Alternatively, the user may keep entering strokes until only one option remains.","Often, however, more predicted characters or phrases exist than can be displayed along the top of the keypad. The N2 phone, manufactured by Neonode of Stockholm, Sweden, has a joystick button at the bottom of the phone. Twitching the joystick up\/down displays different sets of predicted characters or phrases. When the intended character or phrase is displayed and associated with a given digit, a long press on that digit serves to select the intended character or phrase.","Reference is now made to , which is an illustration of an improved keypad for inputting Chinese characters using Pinyin, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  is a keypad , used for inputting Latin characters. Also shown in  is a sequence of Latin characters M-o-H-S-a-n that are successively input by a user, and a corresponding sequence of Chinese characters that are entered in a message being composed.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, keypad  uses accent characters, rather than digits, to convey an intended intonation or inflection. Further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, keypad  displays only information relevant for Pinyin input on each key; no Chinese basic strokes are shown.","There are two types of Pinyin input. A user enters a Latin transliteration of an intended word using the Latin keypad input (12 keys). For each key, several letters are possible. The list of predicted Latin syllables based on the current sequence of keypad presses is displayed. Twitching the joystick right or left selects the desired combination. Also, a series of predicted Chinese characters or phrases is displayed and selected by a long press on a respective digit. Twitching the joystick up\/down displays other predicted Chinese characters or phrases. Entering a space after a series of letters indicates the end of a previous character or phrase.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the user is able to combine stroke and Pinyin input, and compose a sequence of at least two Chinese characters using XT9 stroke input for at least one character and Pinyin input for at least one other character. The user switches between XT9 stroke input mode and Pinyin input mode by performing a sweeping motion in relation to the touch screen, such as, inter alia, sweeping a finger across the top of the touch screen. The series of at least two Chinese characters may be a text message, a name, a data entry, or any other such input.","Further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the user is able to compose a series of at least one Chinese character and at least one non-Chinese term, wherein the non-Chinese term includes at least one Latin character, digit, emoticon, punctuation mark, another non-Chinese symbol, or any combination thereof. The series is composed by switching input modes for each alphabet or Chinese input or digit input by sweeping across the top of the touch screen. For example, the user may input at least one Chinese character using either Pinyin or stroke input, or a combination thereof. The user may then perform a sweeping motion in relation to the touch screen to change the input mode to English. For example, the user may sweep a finger across the top of the touch screen to change the input mode to English. In this mode, the keypad presents Latin characters. The user then proceeds to input Latin characters using the Latin keypad displayed on the touch screen. Alternatively, the user may repeat a series of sweeping motions; e.g., the user sweeps a finger across the top of the touch screen, repeatedly, changing the input mode with each sweeping motion, until a digit keypad is displayed and digit input mode is active. The user may then proceed to enter at least one digit, adding the at least one digit to the series of Chinese characters already contained in the message. It will thus be appreciated that the user may switch between different input modes while composing a single message, a command, a name, a data entry or another such input, including at least two different types of characters, in an easy and simple and convenient manner.","Further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a keypad displaying emoticons is displayed. In this mode, the user may select an emoticon to be entered into the text of a message, or such other input.","Yet further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, drawings, including inter alia, emoticons, are constructed in a similar manner to XT9 stroke input. In this mode, the user interface displays the basic building blocks for the drawing, such as a curve, a semicolon, a circle, and other symbols. As the user taps multiple symbols, possible drawings or emoticons that can be formed using the selected elements are displayed, and the user may either select the desired complete drawing or emoticon from the displayed list, or may continue entering additional building blocks until only one option remains. This mode of input is convenient as the number and size of the keys presented is optimized for the number of available building blocks, and each key only displays information relevant for the active input mode.","Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for enabling multiple input modes, whereby the screen display in each input mode is optimized for that mode. Optimizations include (i) configuring the number of keys displayed, (ii) configuring the size, position and shape of the keys in relation to the screen, (iii) configuring the size, position and shape of the area of the display showing text already entered, (iv) configuring the size, position and shape of the area of the display showing possible completions for the current character, phrase or symbol, and (v) displaying only at least one character, symbol, digit or other figure that is relevant to the active input mode on each key.","Embodiments of the present invention also provide methods and systems for enabling multiple input modes and switching between the input modes by performing a sweeping motion in relation to the screen. These methods and systems are easier and more convenient than using a menu interface to switch input modes. Additionally, these methods do not use up screen space to provide a switching key, to switch between input modes, and, as such, screen space may be used for information related to the current input mode and the current text. These methods and systems also enable switching between many input modes, by repeating the sweeping motions to advance through the input modes. In the N2 phone manufactured by Neonode AB, this mode of switching active keypads is used with standard 12-key keypads, for example, inter alia, switching between numeric, Swedish and English keypads. However, switching the layout of the keys is not used in the Neonode N2 phone. Moreover, other, prior art methods of switching between input modes require more than one action to advance through a list of input modes.","Reference is now made to FIGS.  and -, which include several exemplary touch screen interfaces. Shown in  is a touch screen interface, displaying a clock dial in the lower left corner of the screen. Several gadgets are displayed in the touch screen, each gadget representing an application that runs on the phone.","According to embodiments of the present invention, selection and subsequent activation of an on-screen element, such as, inter alia, a gadget, a letter, a key, a button or an icon, is implemented by two primary features. The first feature, referred to as pressure sensing, provides the touch screen with one or more pressure sensors operative to determine contact with the screen by an external object such as a finger. In one embodiment, the user places a finger or a stylus over the desired on-screen element to select it, as illustrated in , and then applies pressure to the screen to activate the on-screen element, as illustrated in . In another embodiment, the user selects the on-screen element by placing a finger or stylus over the position of the on-screen element but not in contact with the screen. Several touch screen devices, such as certain light-based touch screens and certain tablet personal computers, enable detection of a finger or other pointing device over a position on the screen without making actual contact. Applicant's co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/371,609, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,339,379, for LIGHT BASED TOUCHSCREEN, filed on 15 Feb. 2009, is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In another embodiment, the user selects the on-screen element with a finger or other pointing device in contact with the screen and activates the on-screen element by removing his finger or pointing device from contact with the screen. In another embodiment, the user selects the on-screen element with a finger or other pointing device in contact with the screen and activates the on-screen element by increasing the pressure of contact with the screen. In this case the pressure sensor distinguishes between the initial contact and the subsequent high pressure contact. This is illustrated in  showing a profile of a finger in contact with a display, where only the thickness of the display is shown. In  the finger moves across the screen to select at least one element. Movement across the screen is indicated by a double-tipped arrow parallel to the screen surface. Once an element is selected by positioning the finger over a desired element, the element is activated by applying pressure to the screen as indicated by the down-pointing arrow in .","The second feature, referred to as callout balloons, indicates a selected on-screen element to the user by displaying a graphic, such as by (i) enlarging the on-screen element, (ii) displaying a callout balloon with a copy of the on-screen element inside, or (iii) a combination thereof. The callout balloon is illustrated in .  shows a star inside a callout balloon, and  shows the letter \u2018A\u2019 inside a callout balloon. As the user moves his finger over the screen, different callout balloons appear. Callout balloons are generated in such a manner that the user's finger and hand do not obstruct the user from viewing the callout balloon. Thus, for example, the callout balloon appears above the finger as shown in the figures. When the finger is at the top of the screen the callout balloon is displayed off to a side of the screen that is visible to the user. The user may configure the interface to display callouts to the left or right of his finger. For example, a user who operates the phone with his left hand may prefer to display callout balloons off to one side of his finger, and a user who operates the phone with his right hand may prefer that callout balloons display to the other side of his finger. These two features of pressure sensing and callout balloons can be applied separately or in combination.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, touch screens for phones captioned \u201cPower ON\/Power OFF\u201d are shown in . Two phones are displayed under the \u201cPower ON\u201d caption; namely, a first phone () with a blank screen, indicating that power is off, and a second phone () with gadgets displayed thereon, indicating that power is on. A \u201chome key\u201d is displayed at the bottom of the phones. Activating the home key, such as by touching the key, causes the power to be turned on. A single phone is displayed in  under the \u201cPower OFF\u201d caption. Touching the home key for an extended period of time, such as for 5 seconds, causes the phone to power off. An \u201coff\u201d gadget is shown at the bottom center of the display screen. Activating the \u201coff\u201d gadget also causes the phone to power off.","Additionally in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, touch screens for phones captioned \u201cKey lock\u201d are shown in . In  a lock gadget is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. Activating the lock gadget, such as by pressing on it, causes the phone to lock. When the phone is locked activation of the phone is restricted is some manner. E.g., when the phone is locked, touching the screen in a way that would activate a gadget when the phone is unlocked, does not activate the gadget when the phone is locked. In order to unlock the phone, the user activates the home key, located at the bottom center of the device, as shown in .  shows the phone after it has been unlocked: gadgets are now displayed on screen and are activated in response to user input.","Further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a touch screen for a phone captioned \u201cKey lock high security\u201d is shown in FIG. . When the home key is activated, such as by touching the home key, a keypad is displayed and a user is prompted to enter a security code. Subsequently, the phone cannot be unlocked unless the security code is entered. Optionally, additional security is implemented by use of fingerprint identification, wherein the phone cannot be unlocked unless a fingerprint is authenticated. Optionally, additional security is implemented by requiring the user to glide a finger over the screen in a designated gesture, in order to unlock the phone. The phone cannot be unlocked unless the touch screen detects the designated gesture. Examples of designated gestures include inter alia, an \u201cS\u201d shaped gesture, or a gesture wherein multiple corners of the screen are touched concurrently or in sequence. Optionally, additional security is implemented by displaying a musical keypad or keyboard and the user must play a particular tune of at least one note on the keypad or keyboard in order to unlock the phone.","Yet further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a touch screen for a phone captioned \u201cHome\/return from application\u201d is shown in . An application display screen is shown in , indicating that the user is running an application that substantially occupies the screen. A basic screen is shown in , for activating gadgets and applications. In order to return from the application screen () to the basic screen (), the user activates the home key displayed at the bottom of the phone, such as by touching the home key. Tapping on the home key causes the open application to remain open, and causes the basic screen to display, thereby enabling launching additional applications. According to an alternative embodiment, tapping on the home key causes the open application to be closed.","Moreover in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a touch screen for a phone captioned \u201cScroll alternatives\u201d is shown in . Four phones are displayed under the \u201cScroll alternatives\u201d caption, each phone illustrating a different method and system for a touch-based user interface. Scrolling is useful when multiple gadgets are available for the user to activate or use, but not all of the gadgets are displayed on the screen at one time. In this case, the user can scroll to expose additional gadgets and to hide some of the previously visible gadgets. In , labeled \u201cAlt \u201d, the user sweeps his finger or other interface input, such as inter alia a stylus, along the screen in a direction indicating that he would like to uncover additional gadgets and cover exposed gadgets. E.g., sweeping a finger across the width of the screen from right to left causes gadgets virtually located beyond the left screen border to be exposed, and causes gadgets previously located along the right screen border to be hidden. Similarly, sweeping a finger across the height of the screen from the bottom to top causes gadgets virtually located above the top edge of the display to be exposed, and gadgets previously located at the bottom edge of the screen to be hidden.","In  labeled \u201cAlt \u201d, a scroll cursor is shown along the right edge of the screen. The user touches the cursor and makes a sliding gesture along the right edge of the screen to cause gadgets virtually located beyond the bottom edge of the screen to be exposed, and causes gadgets previously situated at the upper edge of the screen to be hidden.","In  labeled \u201cAlt \u201d, a button gadget is shown with two opposite arrows at the lower right corner of the screen. The user selects this gadget by touching one of the arrows, which causes the screen display to scroll according to the direction of the touched arrow.","In  labeled \u201cAlt \u201d, two arrow gadgets are shown at the top and bottom of the display screen. The user selects one of the two arrows, which causes the screen display to scroll according to the direction of the selected arrow.","Additionally in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a touch screen for a phone captioned \u201cHome screen\u201d is shown in .
