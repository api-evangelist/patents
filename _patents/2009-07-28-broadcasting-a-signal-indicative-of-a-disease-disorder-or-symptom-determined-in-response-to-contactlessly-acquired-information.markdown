Atrial fibrillation is the most common long-term arrhythmia and the most common arrhythmia-related cause of hospital admission, with greater than 2 million Americans and greater than 150,000 new cases treated each year. This number is expected to rise with an aging population since incidence is associated with advanced age. Atrial fibrillation involves chaotic and rapid (tachy) contractions of the atria that overload the atrial-ventricular (AV) node causing irregular, often fast, ventricular contractions. Such arrhythmia can be identified by measuring the heartbeat intervals and electrical activity of the heart, as through an electrocardiogram (ECG). For identifying and treating atrial fibrillation, the system would include one or more sensor devices able to remotely sense heartbeat intervals and ECG readings by measuring small electrical potentials using a high input impedance electrometer. Examples of such sensor devices can be found in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20060058694, supra; WO 2003\/048789, supra; Harland, Meas. Sci. Technol., supra; Prance et al., 2007 Journal of Physics: Conference Series, supra. Such a sensor device would provide noninvasive and remote monitoring, and could be worn by the patient, for instance in or on clothing or jewelry, such as in a wrist band in non-conductive contact with the body, for example as described by U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20060058694, supra; WO 2003\/048789, supra; and C. J. Harland et al., -14 Meas. Sci. Technol. 923-928 (2003). Instead or in addition, the one or more sensor devices could be included in or associated with a piece of furniture, or with electronics such as a personal computer, or with some other item within, e.g., one meter from the patient. For example, the one or more sensor devices able to measure electric potentials could be embedded in an object, such as a desk, bed or chair, in direct but non-conductive contact with the patient, as described by U.S. Pat. No. 7,245,956, supra. The patient would be monitored by the one or more sensor devices, while at rest, while working at a desk or a computer, for example at a place of employment, or while engaged in activities, for example outside of the home.","Information gathered by the one or more sensor device would be communicated to a computing device of the system, either via direct connection, for example when the sensor device is embedded in a computer, or wirelessly, for example using radiowaves or ultrasound waves, or Bluetooth technology. The computing device could be a computer, such as a hand-held computer or a personal computer, and could be part of a network and able to access a central database. The computer could include a treatment regimen circuit or treatment decision circuit. The computer and its associated circuitry would process the information to determine, for example, whether the heart is beating within normal limits for the patient or if the ECG readings are outside set parameters. Such processing would include application of a computer program and could include input from a user, for example the patient or a health care provider. If observed abnormalities are determined by the computer or the user to constitute a pathology, e.g. atrial fibrillation, the system and\/or user can would signal the neuromodulation device to initiate a neuromodulation treatment.","Treatment for atrial fibrillation can include affecting a portion of the autonomic nervous system, especially one or more vagal nerve or efferent thereof. Control of heart rate and rhythm is mediated by the autonomic nervous system via opposite\/complementary signals through sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) nerve fibers to promote respectively excitation or at rest signaling. The parasympathetic fibers originate at the medulla oblongata, and the cervical vagus nerves run parallel to the carotid arteries. Atrial (and to a lesser degree ventricular) myocardium is also innervated by vagal efferent nerves. The right vagus nerve primarily innervates the sinoatrial (SA) node (which initiates the beat at the right atrium) and upon stimulation slows nodal firing; the left vagus innervates the AV node (which receives and imparts the impulse) and moderates ventricular conduction of the beat. During atrial fibrillation, the atria discharge at a high rate. The ventricular rate at this time is rapid and irregular and is dependent on the conducting ability of the AV node, which is often blocked. Thus, influencing (e.g. stimulating or blocking) the vagus nerves can affect the electrophysiology of the heart and be used in the treatment of pathologies such as atrial fibrillation.","Once signaled by the computer, the neuromodulation device would initiate one or more neuromodulating stimulus, for example by providing a current to nervous system component that is a vagus nerve or related fiber. In some forms such a neuromodulating stimulus would initiate a stimulating action potential; in some forms such a neuromodulating stimulus would block an action potential. A number of devices and systems are known in the art that can provide a stimulating or blocking neuromodulation to a vagal nerve. In one example, the system and method used to treat a heart condition, such as atrial fibrillation, would include one or more partially or completely implanted neuromodulation device responsive to instructions transmitted from the computer or network. Treatment would include, for example, the computer or network, as part of its programming, circuitry, or in response to commands from the user, communicating instructions wirelessly to the one or more partially or completely implanted neuromodulation devices, which would then provide neuromodulation stimulus to one or more vagal nerves. For instance, the computer, having processed the information from the remote sensor device, determines the need for treatment, and, as part of its programming or instructed to do so by a user, the computer sends out a wireless signal to a receiver and controller associated with the partially or completely implanted neuromodulation source. Such wireless signaling is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,321,793, Vagal stimulation for atrial fibrillation therapy to O. Ben-Ezra et al. In some cases, the neuromodulation device would include a portion, such as one or more electrodes with leads, in direct contact with tissue and controlled by a pulse generator, which may also be implanted, perhaps at a site distant from the electrodes, or it may be external and provide the pulse wirelessly. Examples of implanted and external pulse generators are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,496,404 to Meadows et al., supra and U.S. Pat. No. 7,146,217 to Firlik et al., supra, and in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No 20050143787, Method and system for providing electrical pulses for neuromodulation of vagus nerve(s), using rechargeable implanted pulse generator, by B. Boveja. Additional examples of implanted generators include those used in Northstar's Renova System or in St. Jude's SCS systems, including examples powered by a long-life battery, a rechargeable system, or an external power source. In some cases, the neuromodulation device would include a portion, such as a controller, external to the body of the patient and coupled with the computer or network. Such an external controller would be programmed to accept information or instructions from the computer, network, or remote sensor device and, in response to the received information, to transmit a wireless signal to one or more implanted portion of the neuromodulation device, for example a pulse generator, which would then initiate neuromodulation such as stimulating or blocking a vagus nerve or fiber. Examples of external controllers able to receive information and communicate wirelessly with pulse generators, which may be implanted separately from the electrodes, or may be wholly integrated or wholly external to the electrodes, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,146,217 to Firlik et al., supra. Examples of an external controller able to communicate with an implanted pulse generator are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,496,404 to Meadows et al., supra and U.S. Pat. No. 7,127,297 Multiprogrammable tissue stimulator and method to Law, et al. Examples of external components and vagal stimulation devices are described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No 20050143787 to B. Boveja, supra.","In some cases, as an alternative or in addition to wireless communication between the computer and the neuromodulation device, the computer would provide an indicator, such as an audio or visual indicator or report, to the user instructing the user to interface the computer with the neuromodulation device. For example, the user would interface the computer with portions of the neuromodulation device. For example a magnetic transcutaneous external controller or a radiofrequency controller, which in turn would communicate with the implanted portion of the neuromodulation device. Examples of such external components are described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20050131467, Method and apparatus for electrical stimulation therapy for at least one of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and refractory hypertension, by B. Boveja and U.S. Pat. No. 7,127,297 to Law, et al., supra. In some cases, wireless transmission would also serve as a means to power the implanted portion of the neuromodulation device, as described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No 20050143787, Method and system for providing electrical pulses for neuromodulation of vagus nerve(s), using rechargeable implanted pulse generator, by B. Boveja and U.S. Pat. No. 7,146,217 to Firlik et al., supra. Alternatively or in addition, a portable energy source may provide energy transcutaneously, for example to recharge an implanted device as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,496,404 to Meadows et al., supra. In some cases, the power source will be entirely external and energy transmitted to the implanted device, for example by radiofrequency. An example of such an external energy source is the St. Jude's Renew Radiofrequency SCS System.","In an alternative to a neuromodulation device implanted in contact with a vagus nerve, at least a portion of the implanted neuromodulation device would be adjacent to the nerve, for example within a nearby blood vessel through which it could provide the neuromodulation stimulus to the nerve. Such a device, for example, is described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20050187584, Vagal nerve stimulation using vascular implanted devices for treatment of atrial fibrillation, by S. Denker et al. or in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20060259085, Neural stimulation system with pulmonary artery lead, by Y. Zhang.","In some cases, the computer and its circuitry and programming would determine that the optimum treatment for the identified atrial fibrillation would include, for example, the system or method and its neuromodulation device restoring a normal sinus rhythm (NSR). In other situations the optimum treatment would include continuing atrial fibrillation under controlled circumstances, for example as a means of avoiding formation of blood clots that can occur during repeated episodes of AF\/NSR. In some cases, treatment for the atrial fibrillation provided by the system or method would include providing at least two forms of neuromodulation, for example inducing an action potential and inhibiting an action potential, which could be the induced potential subsequently inhibited, or a second action potential, for example in a separate nerve. In some cases, treatment for atrial fibrillation provided by the system or method would include providing neuromodulation having a particular set of parameters, such as, for example, providing a current of a particular amplitude such as between about 2 and about 10 milliamps, or frequency, or providing pulses of current, for example of a duration lasting between about 0.1 and about 4 milliseconds, or for example repeated in intervals of between about 2 and about 10 milliseconds in, for instance, intermittent, repetitive, or random bursts. In some cases, treatment for atrial fibrillation provided by the system or method would include providing neuromodulation only under particular circumstances, for example during sleep or wakefulness, during a point in the circadian rhythm, or during a point in the cardiac cycle; in this case the system or method could use additional information from the one or more sensors or from a component of the computer, such as a clock. Examples of devices and methods which could be used to provide forms of neuromodulation for treatment of atrial fibrillation are described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20080091241, Vagal stimulation for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, by O. Ben-Ezra et al; U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20080125825, Therapeutic maintenance of atrial fibrillation by electrical stimulation, by T. David; U.S. Patent Application Pub.

Ben-Ezra et al; or U.S. Pat. No. 7,321,793, Vagal stimulation for atrial fibrillation therapy, to O. Ben-Ezra et al. Additional neuromodulation devices may be used to affect additional nerves, such as efferent or afferent to the vagus nerves, sympathetic nerves, or myocardial tissue. Such devices are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20080091245, Combined parasympathetic stimulation and cardiac pacing, by O. Ben-Ezra et al.","During and following treatment, monitoring the patient via the sensor device can continue and the treatment can be adjusted accordingly as determined by the computer of the system, via its programming or user input. In addition, the neuromodulation device, perhaps as part of the controller, would store information or report information, for example to a separate computer system or a network, regarding the neuromodulation treatment provided, such as the type and duration of stimulation applied to a vagus nerve.","A system described herein, or a method, can be used to identify and treat a health condition affecting the heart of a human patient, for instance an abnormal heart rhythm such as atrial fibrillation. Arrhythmia associated with atrial fibrillation can be identified by measuring the heartbeat intervals and electrical activity of the heart, as through an ECG. For identifying and treating atrial fibrillation, the system would include one or more sensor devices able to remotely sense heartbeat intervals and ECG readings by providing and receiving an electromagnetic signal directed at and reflected from the patient. Such sensor devices using illuminating, reflected, electromagnetic, including radiofrequency (RF), or microwave signals are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,272,431, Remote-sensing method and device to W. McGrath, U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20040123667, Remote-sensing method and device, by W. McGrath; and U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20080045832, Remote-sensing method and device, by W. McGrath. One or more of such sensor devices, which could include or be arranged as a sensor array, would be deployed, for example, throughout a room, perhaps as part of a smart room network. The patient would be monitored continuously while occupying the space, for example while at sleep or while performing normal daily activities within a room or home.","The system or method for treating a heart condition such as atrial fibrillation would include a computing device and its related software and circuitry. Information gathered by the one or more sensor devices would be wirelessly communicated to the computing device. The computing device could be a computer, such as a hand-held computer or a personal computer, and able to access a central database. The computer could include a treatment regimen circuit or treatment decision circuit. The computer system would receive information from the one or more sensor devices regarding the heart rate and ECG readings. The computer would process the received information utilizing stored information such as a medical history database of the patient or treatment modalities. The computer would then determine the appropriate treatment, at least partly based on the stored information such as a table or database of treatments recommended in response to the identified condition, such as normal sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. The appropriate treatment in some cases would include no neuromodulation. As a further example, if the received information includes a heart rate and heart rhythm indicative of rapid atrial fibrillation, the computer and its treatment regimen circuit and treatment decision circuit determines the optimum treatment to be stimulation of the vagus nerve, which would slow the heart, allowing the heart to more completely relax and the ventricles to experience increased filling. With larger diastolic volumes, the heart beats more efficiently. The computer signals the neuromodulation device to initiate treatment. Alternatively, the computer provides information on the sensed property or condition, the identified rapid atrial fibrillation, and the recommended neuromodulation to the user, for example through a screen or hardcopy printout. The user, for example the patient or health care provider, makes the final decision for treatment and enters the decision into the computer system via an interface, such as a keyboard, touch screen, mouse, or stylus, and the resultant signal is sent to the neuromodulation device.","Once signaled by the computer, the neuromodulation device would initiate a neuromodulating stimulus, for example by providing a current to the vagus nerve or related fiber. In one example, the system and method used to treat a heart condition, such as atrial fibrillation, would include one or more partially or completely implanted neuromodulation device responsive to instructions transmitted from the computer. Treatment would include, for example, the computer or network, as part of its programming, circuitry, or in response to commands from the user, communicating instructions wirelessly to the one or more partially or completely implanted neuromodulation devices, which would then provide neuromodulation stimulus to the one or more vagal nerves. For instance, having processed the information from the remote sensor device and determined that the best treatment is stimulation of the vagal nerve to slow the heart rate, the computer sends out a wireless signal to a receiver and controller associated with the partially or completely implanted neuromodulation source. Such wireless signaling is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,321,793, to O. Ben-Ezra et al., supra. In some cases, the neuromodulation device would include a portion, such as one or more electrodes with leads, in direct contact with tissue and controlled by a pulse generator, which may also be implanted, perhaps at a site distant from the electrodes, or it may be external and provide the pulse wirelessly. Examples of implanted and external pulse generators are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,496,404 to Meadows et al., supra and U.S. Pat. No. 7,146,217 to Firlik et al., supra, and in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No 20050143787, Method and system for providing electrical pulses for neuromodulation of vagus nerve(s), using rechargeable implanted pulse generator, by B. Boveja. Additional examples of implanted generators include those used in Northstar's Renova System or in St. Jude's SCS systems, including examples powered by a long-life battery, a rechargeable system, or an external power source. In some cases, the neuromodulation device would include a portion, such as a controller, external to the body of the patient and coupled with the computer or network. Such an external controller would be programmed to accept information or instructions from the computer, network, or remote sensor device and, in response to the received information, to transmit a wireless signal to one or more implanted portion of the neuromodulation device, for example a pulse generator, which would then provide neuromodulation such as stimulating or blocking a vagus nerve or fiber. Examples of external controllers able to receive information and communicate wirelessly with pulse generators, which may be implanted separately from the electrodes, or may be wholly integrated or wholly external to the electrodes, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,146,217 to Firlik et al., supra. Examples of an external controller able to communicate with an implanted pulse generator are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,496,404 to Meadows et al., supra and U.S. Pat. No. 7,127,297 to Law, et al, supra. Examples of external components and vagal stimulation devices are described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No 20050143787 to B. Boveja, supra.","In some cases, the computer and its circuitry and programming would determine that the optimum treatment for the atrial identified fibrillation would include, for example, the system or method and its neuromodulation device restoring a normal sinus rhythm (NSR). In other situations the optimum treatment would include continuing atrial fibrillation under controlled circumstances, for example as a means of avoiding formation of blood clots that can occur with during repeated episodes of AF\/NSR. In some cases, treatment for atrial fibrillation provided by the system or method would include providing at least two forms of neuromodulation, for example inducing an action potential and inhibiting an action potential, which could be the induced potential subsequently inhibited, or a second action potential, for example in a separate nerve. In some cases, treatment for atrial fibrillation provided by the system or method would include providing neuromodulation having a particular set of parameters, such as, for example, providing a current of a particular amplitude such as between about 2 and about 10 milliamps, or frequency, or providing pulses of current, for example of a duration lasting between about 0.1 and about 4 milliseconds, or for example repeated in intervals of interval of between about 2 and about 10 milliseconds in, for instance, intermittent, repetitive, or random bursts. In some cases, treatment for atrial fibrillation provided by the system or method would include providing neuromodulation only under particular circumstances, for example during sleep or wakefulness, during a point in the circadian rhythm, or during a point in the cardiac cycle; in this case the system or method could use additional information from the one or more sensors or from the computer, such as a clock. Examples of devices and methods which could be used to provide such forms of neuromodulation for treatment of atrial fibrillation are described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20080091241, Vagal stimulation for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, by O. Ben-Ezra et al; U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20080125825, Therapeutic maintenance of atrial fibrillation by electrical stimulation, by T. David; U.S. Patent Application Pub.

Ben-Ezra et al; or U.S. Pat. No. 7,321,793, Vagal stimulation for atrial fibrillation therapy, by O. Ben-Ezra et al. Additional neuromodulation devices may be used to affect additional nerves, such as efferent or afferent to the vagus nerves, sympathetic nerves, or myocardial tissue. Such devices are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20080091245, Combined parasympathetic stimulation and cardiac pacing, by O. Ben-Ezra et al.","In some cases, the computer of the system would be programmed to continue monitoring via the remote sensor devices and the signal generator, which would send instructions, for example different or additional instructions, to the neuromodulation device. During and following treatment, monitoring the patient via the sensor device can continue and the treatment can be adjusted accordingly as determined by the computer of the system, via its programming or user input. In addition, the neuromodulation device, perhaps as part of the controller, would store information or report information, for example to a separate computer system or a network, regarding the neuromodulation treatment provided, such as the type and duration of stimulation applied to a vagus nerve.","The system or a method described herein can be used to treat a sleep disorder or an effect thereof in an adult human person performing an activity. Hypersomnia, which can be described as an excessive need for sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and episodes of involuntary sleep (\u201csleep attacks\u201d) is known to be associated with a number of sleep-related disorders. In some persons these symptoms are characteristic sequelae of primary somnolence disorders, such as narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, recurrent hypersomnia like Kleine-Levin Syndrome, and nervous system disorders such as encephalitis. In other cases these symptoms present as secondary to a pathology, for example a sleep-related breathing disorder like sleep apnea, or are observed with certain diseases, such as nervous system disorders like Parkinson's Disease or epilepsy, or in patients taking certain medications, e.g. dopamine agonists. For additional description of sleep disorders see e.g., J. Black et al., 24(3) Semin Neurol 271-282 (2004); J. Black et al., -3(4) Focus 585-597 (2005); or American Academy of Sleep Medicine, (2ed., 2005).","EDS and similar effects can present problems in daily living, for example occurring at inappropriate times, interrupting normal activities and even compromising safety; they can also be indicative of a problem requiring attention. A sleep-related disorder or an effect thereof, such as drowsiness or involuntary sleep, can be evaluated in a person performing an activity by determining a state of alertness, for example by measuring the characteristics of the pupil of an eye, such as pupil oscillation or miosis. In the system or method for treating a sleep-related disorder or effect thereof, such measurements would be obtained remotely by using a sensor device that includes a pupillometer. An example of a pupillometer sensor device using a camera or infrared optics is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,097,295, Apparatus for determining the alertness of a driver, to M. Griesinger et al., or in U.S. Pat. No. 7,226,164, Method and apparatus for testing sleepiness, to M. Griesinger et al. A sensor device including a pupillometer could, for example, be incorporated into a computer camera, e.g. mounted in or on a computer monitor or the dashboard or interior of a vehicle, and would be configured to scan the pupils of an individual facing the camera. The sensor would monitor the person continuously or at programmed intervals.","Hypersomnia, narcolepsy, or other sleep-related disorders, or a related effect such as drowsiness can be evaluated through electroencephalography (EEG), for example by identifying one or more alterations in the distribution of energy in the person's EEG signal, or through electrooculogram (EOG) readings, as by identification of eye movements. Additional description of such evaluation using EEG, with or without EOG, is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,167,298, Devices and methods for maintaining an alert state of consciousness through brain wave monitoring, to R. Levin; and in C. Papadelis et al., --118 Clinical Neurophysiology:1906-1922 (2007); , Proceedings of the 28th IEEE EMBS Annual International Conference (2006), and C. Marzano et al., 30(5) Sleep 610-6 (2007). In some cases of detecting and treating a sleep-related disorder or an effect thereof, the system or method would remotely obtain EEG readings, with or without obtaining concurrent EOG readings. For example, the system or method would include one or more sensor devices having a high input impedance electrometer and configured to measure small electrical potentials, and could include additional devices for obtaining EOG readings. Examples of such sensor devices and technologies are described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20060058694, supra; WO 2003\/048789, supra; C. J. Harland et al., 81(17) Appl. Phys.

In one example, the system would include one or more sensor devices able to remotely sense heartbeat intervals and ECG readings by measuring small electrical potentials using a high input impedance electrometer.

In addition, the sensor devices could include an electromagnetic inductance device able to measure cardiac activity variability, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,254,439, Method and system for contactless evaluation of fatigue of an operator to D. Misczynski. As an alternative or in addition, the one or more sensor devices would include a device responsive to an electromagnetic signal directed at, illuminating, and reflected from the person to measure heartbeat intervals and ECG information.

Alternatively or in addition, the sensor devices would be embedded in or associated with a piece of furniture, such as a chair or desk, or in the headrest of a car seat, or in an accessory such as a seat belt, or in a freestanding or tabletop appliance, or in electronics such as a personal computer, car computer, or related accessories. The sensor devices could be arranged as an array, for example embedded in a number of items or associated within a defined area, such as a vehicle or room. In some cases, the sensor device would acquire information regarding additional physiologic conditions. For example, respiration or temperature could also be obtained remotely using a sensor device as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,272,431 supra; U.S. Patent Application Pub.

As described herein, the one or more sensor devices, which could be arranged in one or more arrays, would detect and accumulate information regarding the eye (e.g. pupillometry or EOG readings), brain waves (e.g. EEG readings), or heart activity (e.g. heart rate and ECG readings), or combinations thereof. For monitoring a person at a workstation, the sensors as described would be associated with, for example, the desk, chair, or computer of the workstation, and would be, e.g., within one meter of the person. Alternatively or in addition, the sensor devices would be associated with an area encompassing the workstation, for example placed on or near a wall of a room or work cubicle. For monitoring a person in a vehicle, the sensor devices would be embedded in the seat, e.g. in the headrest, belt, or seatback, e.g. within one meter of the person. Alternatively or in addition, the sensor devices would be associated with the interior space of the vehicle. The sensor devices of the system would communicate with the computer of the system and, directly or indirectly as through the computer, with the neuromodulation device of the system.","In some cases the system or method system or method for detecting and treating a sleep-related disorder or an effect thereof would include a patient confirmation device able to confirm that the person being monitored by the one or more sensor devices is the person requiring assessment and possible treatment. For example, when a person sitting in a car or at a workstation is being monitored by the sensor devices for alertness and evidence of drowsiness, the sensor devices would include a camera able to capture the image of the person's face. Information from the sensor devices, including the image, would be transmitted to the computer of the system, and programming within the computer would compare the acquired image information to stored image information. If the image matches the person to be treated, monitoring and treatment would continue. If the image does not match that of the person to be treated, monitoring ceases, in addition, a signal could be sent to the neuromodulation device blocking its activation. Additional sensor devices would be included in the system as needed, including, for example, a sensor for receiving radiofrequency identification signal such as those provided by a chip in a bracelet and carrying information regarding the wearer. Hardware and software able to distinguish between individuals is known in the art.","In the system or method for detecting and treating a sleep-related disorder or an effect thereof, information gathered by the one or more sensor devices would be communicated to a computing device of the system, either via a direct connection, e.g. when the sensor device is associated with the computer, or wirelessly. The computing device could be a computer, such as a hand-held computer or personal computer and could be part of a network. The computing device could include circuitry, for example a treatment regimen circuit or the treatment decision circuit. The computer and its associated circuitry would store or process the information, for example to determine the level of alertness of the person, using stored parameters. Processing would include application of a computer program and could include input from a user, for example the person or a health care provider. If measured parameters are determined by the computer or user to represent a decrease in alertness or onset of drowsiness, the system or user would signal the neuromodulation device to initiate a neuromodulation treatment.","Vagal nerve fibers have a wide distribution throughout the central nervous system (CNS), and vagal stimulation produces evoked potentials from the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. Vagal afferent stimulation has been shown to elicit EEG synchronization or desynchronization and to affect sleep states. For detecting and treating a sleep disorder or an effect thereof, the system or method can provide stimulus or blocking neuromodulation signals to a vagal nerve using a neuromodulation device. In some cases, the neuromodulation device would include a partially or completely implanted device responsive to instructions transmitted from, for example, the computer of the system, possibly through a controller. For example, the computer of the system, as part of its programming or in response to commands from the user, would communicate instructions wirelessly to the one or more partially or completely implanted neuromodulation devices able to stimulate one or more vagal nerves. For example, the computer of the system, having processed the information from the sensor devices and as part of its programming or if instructed to do so by a user, would send out a radio signal to a receiver associated with at least a portion of an implanted neuromodulation device, such as a controller. Such wireless signaling is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,321,793, Vagal stimulation for atrial fibrillation therapy to O. Ben-Ezra et al. Alternatively, the system or method would include a neuromodulation device in which a portion, such as a controller, is external to the body of the person. Such an external controller of the neuromodulation device would be programmed to accept information or instructions from the computer, network, or remote sensor device and, in response to the received information, to transmit a wireless signal to one or more implanted receiving portions of the neuromodulation device, which would then stimulate or block a vagus nerve or fiber. An example of such an external controller is described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20050131467 Method and apparatus for electrical stimulation therapy for at least one of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and refractory hypertension, 20050131467 by B. Boveja, supra. In some cases, wireless transmission to the receiver would also serve as a means to power the implanted portion of the neuromodulation device. An example of a neuromodulation device having an external controller and implanted portions is described in U.S. Patent No. U.S. Patent Application 20050143787 Method and system for providing electrical pulses for neuromodulation of vagus nerve(s), using rechargeable implanted pulse generator, by B. Boveja, supra. In some cases, instead of a neuromodulation device implanted in contact with a vagus nerve, the neuromodulation device would have at least a portion that is near the nerve, for example within a nearby blood vessel, through which it can stimulate the nerve. An example of such an intravascular neuromodulation device is described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20050187584, by S. Denker et al., supra. In some cases, for example as an alternative to wireless communication between the computer and neuromodulation device, the computer of the system would provide an indicator, such as an audio or visual indicator or report, to the person or health care provider instructing them to interface the computer with a portion of the neuromodulation device, such as a controller. For example, the computer would provide visual instructions on a computer screen indicating to the person to place an external controller, near the subcutaneous receiver of the neuromodulation device. The controller, when placed within range of the receiver, provides instructions to the neuromodulation device, for example to turn the device on or off. An example of a controller for use by a person or a health care provider is the Access programmer of the Activa Therapy System by Medtronic. Examples of neuromodulation devices and their control, for example using magnetic controllers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,760,626, Apparatus and method for treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders using programmerless implantable pulse generator system, to B. Boveja. Examples of neuromodulation devices and their control, for example using radiofrequency communication, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,127,297 to Law, et al., supra.","Treatment for a sleep-related disorder such as narcolepsy or a related condition such as excessive sleepiness, can be provided by the system or method in response to a detection of drowsiness. For example, when the drowsiness occurs during an activity such as driving or working at a computer, the one or more sensor devices of the system would detect the drowsiness by remote pupillography identifying a pattern of oscillations in the pupil, or by remote EEG recognizing bursts of alpha activity with increased synchrony, or both. The sensor devices would then communicate with the signal generator, or a computer of the system, which would in turn signal the neuromodulation device to initiate treatment. The neuromodulation device would respond to provide treatment, for example, by inducing an electrical stimulus to modulate the electrical activity of the vagus nerve and thereby alter the electrophysiology of the brain and desynchronize the EEG activity, by stimulation of the vagus nerve at a frequency in the range from 20 to 75 Hz and greater than 0.1 volt. An example of such treatment is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,335,657, Therapeutic treatment of sleep disorder by nerve stimulation to T. Reese et al.","EDS and similar effects can be indicative of a problem requiring attention, such as sleep deprivation due to a sleeping-related disorder like apnea. Repeated periods of hypersomnolence or EDS can indicate onset, ongoing, or worsening of a disorder. In some cases, the sensor devices, the signal generator, or the computer would accumulate information regarding the number and duration of episodes of drowsiness, for example during daytime waking hours, and use this information to initiate treatment during sleep, with or without further sensing, perhaps remotely, of physiologic parameters, such as respiratory patterns that may be indicative of sleep apnea. Multiple or long-term readings would be obtained by the remote sensor devices and the information stored or processed for use in treatment. For example, as readings from the one or more sensor devices are obtained, stored, and processed, if certain predetermined parameters are met, e.g. a certain number of episodes of drowsiness occurring over a period of time, such as 12 hours or 24 hours, additional sensing by the sensor devices may be initiated at a later time, through programming or manually. In one example, the computer of the system processes information received from the sensor devices and determines that additional sensing is indicated during nocturnal sleep time, and the computer of the system signals the sensor devices to provide additional readings for heart rate or respiratory rate and assess them for variability indicative of the presence of apnea. If signaled by the sensor devices or computer, the neuromodulation device would provide treatment, for example providing an electrical stimulus to modulate the electrical activity of the vagus nerve to alter the electrophysiology and so synchronize the patient's EEG activity to promote sleep as a treatment to lessen occurrences of EDS.","In some cases, the computer of the system would be programmed to continue monitoring via the remote sensor devices and the signal generator, which would send instructions, for example different or additional instructions, to the neuromodulation device. During and following treatment, monitoring the person via the sensor device can continue and the treatment can be adjusted accordingly as determined by the computer of the system, via its programming or user input.

Rizzo et al., 26(5) SLEEP 607-611 (2003).","In humans, there are two types of sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM), which can be identified by electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) readings. EEG frequencies are characterized as beta (>13 cycles\/sec), alpha (8-13), theta (4-7), and delta (<4 cycles\/sec). REM sleep is characterized by mixed high-frequency, low-amplitude \u2018desynchronized\u2019 activity on EEG with theta waves, and by REMs identified on EOG. NREM sleep can be further divided into four stages corresponding to increasing depth of sleep, indicated by progressive dominance in the EEG of high-voltage, low-frequency, and rhythmic, slow \u2018synchronized\u2019 wave activity. Mixed frequency theta waves and slow rolling eye movements characterize stage 1 sleep. An increasing percentage of delta waves is associated with stages 2-4. Throughout the sleep interval, normal sleep architecture is characterized by cycles of light sleep (stages 1 and 2), deeper slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4), and REM sleep. Initiation and maintenance of sleep involves a complicated network of neurological and endocrine signaling deep in the brain within and between the hypothalamus, thalamus and brainstem, and recent studies in animals and patients have provided insight into the various roles, including those of the vagus nerve and related pathways, sympathetic and autonomic nervous systems, and hormonal control. Disturbances in the system, due to extrinsic or intrinsic factors, can lead to insufficient sleep and fragmented sleep. Fragmented sleep, (predominantly microfragmentation), has been associated with such conditions as sleep-related breathing disorders like apnea and nervous disorders including epilepsy.

For example, the computer of the system, having processed the information from the sensor devices as part of its programming or if instructed to do so by a user, would send out a radio signal to a receiver, associated with an implanted neuromodulation device. Such wireless signaling is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,321,793, supra. Alternatively, the system or method would include a neuromodulation device in which a portion, such as a controller, is external to the body of the person and associated with the computer of the system. Such an external controller of the neuromodulation device would be programmed to accept information or instructions from the computer, network, or remote sensor device and, in response to the received information, to transmit a wireless signal to one or more implanted receiving portions of the neuromodulation device, which would then stimulate or block a vagus nerve or fiber. An example of such an external controller is described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20050131467 by B. Boveja, supra. In some cases, wireless transmission to the receiver would also serve as a means to power the implanted portion of the neuromodulation device. An example of neuromodulation devices with such external controllers with implanted portions are described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20050143787, by B. Boveja, supra. In some cases, instead of a neuromodulation device implanted in contact with a vagus nerve, the neuromodulation device would have at least a portion that is near the nerve, for example within a nearby blood vessel, through which it can stimulate the nerve. An example of such an intravascular neuromodulation device is described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20050187584, by S. Denker et al., supra. In some cases, for example as an alternative to wireless communication between the computer and neuromodulation device, the computer of the system would provide an indicator, such as an audio or visual indicator or report, to the person or health care provider instructing them to interface the computer with a portion of the neuromodulation device, such as a controller. For example, the computer would provide visual instructions on a computer screen indicating to the person to place an external controller such as a magnetic controller, near the subcutaneous receiver of the neuromodulation device. The magnetic controller, when placed within range of the receiver, provides instructions to the neuromodulation device, for example to turn the device on or off Examples of such neuromodulation devices and their control are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,760,626, Apparatus and method for treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders using programmerless implantable pulse generator system, to B. Boveja.","Treatment for a sleep-related disorder, such as sleep apnea or fragmented sleep, can be provided by the system or method in response to a detection of a sleep state. For example, as a person exits a deep sleep state and enters REM sleep, the one or more sensor devices of the system would detect increased desynchronized activity in the brain by remote EEG, and REMs by EOG. In some cases, the one or more sensors or the computer would accumulate information regarding the length of time the person remained in REM sleep and\/or the number of times the person enters REM sleep or other sleep states. The sensor devices would communicate to the computer of the system, which would in turn signal the neuromodulation device to initiate treatment. Treatment, for example, would include inducing an electrical stimulus to modulate the electrical activity of the vagus nerve and thereby alter the electrophysiology of the brain and synchronize the EEG activity, e.g. using the neuromodulating device to provide a stimulus at a frequency at or above 75 Hz and below 3 volts. An example of such treatment is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,335,657, Therapeutic treatment of sleep disorder by nerve stimulation to T. S. Reese and J. F. Wernicke. In some cases, the sensor devices would detect cardioelectric or respiratory patterns that may be indicative of sleep apnea. If sleep apnea were detected and identified, computer would signal the neuromodulation device to provide treatment, for example to reduce the effects of sleep apnea and encourage sleep. The neuromodulation device would induce an electrical stimulus to modulate the electrical activity of the vagus nerve to alter the electrophysiology and so synchronize the patient's EEG activity. In some cases, treatment would include the neuromodulation device providing stimulation of a nerve branch, for example the trigeminal or glossopharyngeal nerve. In some cases, for example to stimulate multiple nerves or branches, treatment would include the neuromodulation device having multiple electrodes, for example as part of an implant, which could be quite small. Such devices are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,734, Cranial nerve stimulation treatments using neurocybernetic prosthesis, to J. Zabara; or U.S. Pat. No. 7,167,751, Method of using a fully implantable miniature neurostimulator for vagus nerve stimulation, to T. Whitehurst et al. In some cases, the system would include a neuromodulation device that is miniaturized and subcutaneously injectable with an external controller able to interface with the computer of the system. Examples of such subcutaneous injectable neuromodulation devices are described in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 20090157147, Implantable Transponder Systems and Methods by L. Cauller and R. Weine.","In some cases using the system or method to treat a sleeping disorder or related condition, such as sleep apnea, would include modulating the autonomic nervous system. In some cases, the remote sensor devices would provide accumulated or real time information to the computer of the system, which would signal the neurmodulation device. The neuromodulation device would provide treatment including stimulating or inhibiting the autonomic nervous system via a nerve pathway. An example of such treatment is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,149,574, Treatment of conditions through electrical modulation of the autonomic nervous system, to A. Yun et al., In addition or instead, the neuromodulation device would stimulate the spinal cord via an implanted or transcutaneous device. An example of such a device and its use is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,155,278, Neurostimulation to treat effects of sleep apnea, to G. King et al. Alternatively or in addition, the neuromodulation device would stimulate a targeted nerve such as the phrenic nerve, which would directly affect a physiologic system such as respiration, thereby providing treatment for the sleeping disorder or its effects.","All references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety or to the extent their subject matter is not otherwise inconsistent herewith.","In some embodiments, \u201cconfigured\u201d includes at least one of designed, set up, shaped, implemented, constructed, or adapted for at least one of a particular purpose, application, or function.","It will be understood that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims, are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of introductory phrases such as \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca receiver\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one receiver\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, it will be recognized that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201cat least two chambers,\u201d or \u201ca plurality of chambers,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two chambers).","In those instances where a phrase such as \u201cat least one of A, B, and C,\u201d \u201cat least one of A, B, or C,\u201d or \u201can [item] selected from the group consisting of A, B, and C,\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended to be disjunctive (e.g., any of these phrases would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, or A, B, and C together, and may further include more than one of A, B, or C, such as A, A, and C together, A, B, B, C, and Ctogether, or Band Btogether).
