{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Application Ser. No. 61\/079,801, filed on Jul. 10, 2008, and entitled, \u201cInteractive Search Querying.\u201d","This specification relates to interaction between a search application and a web browser application on a mobile computing device.","More and more, people spend their time interacting with electronic devices\u2014whether in the form of desktop computers, set-top television boxes, mobile devices such as smartphones, or other such devices. People like best those devices that are intuitive to use and whose interactions best meet their expectations regarding how machines should work. They interact with electronics through inputs and outputs from the devices, where the outputs generally are provided audibly and\/or on a flat graphical display screen, and the inputs may occur via touch screens, joysticks, mice, four-directional keypads, and other such input mechanisms.","Fine distinctions in user interfaces can make a world of difference in a user's experience with a device. User interface options may be reduced for mobile devices, where full-sized keyboards are not available or no keyboards are available. In such situations, intuitive interaction may be at a premium. The importance of such interaction may be even more pronounced with mobile devices, where the user may need to interact with a device using a single hand or just a few fingers.","In general, this document interaction between a search application and a web browser application on a mobile computing device. In a first aspect, a computer-implemented search method includes receiving, at a non-browser application on a computing device, part or all of a user search query. The method further includes displaying search results responsive to receiving the search query in the non-browser application. The method further includes receiving a user selection of one of the search results. The method further includes automatically displaying, in response to the user selection of the one of the search results, a landing page for the one of the search results in a web browser on the computing device. The method further includes receiving from the user a selection of a first back button in the web browser and, in response to the user selection of the first back button, activating the non-browser application.","Implementations can include any, all, or none of the following features. The method can include displaying, in response to the user selection of the first back button, the search results in the non-browser application. The method can include displaying a second back button in the non-browser application and displaying, in response to a user selection of the second back button, a search entry screen. The method can include displaying, in response to the user selection of the back button, a search entry screen in the non-browser application. Activating the non-browser application can include directing the browser to a first page before displaying the landing page, wherein the first page contains code to redirect the computing device to the non-browser application. The method can include registering a Uniform Resource Identifier corresponding to the non-browser application, wherein the Uniform Resource Identifier can be made available to the web browser for activating the non-browser application. A Uniform Resource identifier for the first page can include a state counter having a value that controls whether the first page directs a user to the non-browser application or to the web browser.","In a second aspect, a computer-readable data storage medium storing computer-executable instruction that, when executed, perform actions includes receiving, at a non-browser application on a computing device, part or all of a user search query. The device further includes displaying search results responsive to receiving the search query in the non-browser application. The device further includes receiving a user selection of one of the search results. The device further includes automatically displaying, in response to the user selection of the one of the search results, a landing page for the one of the search results in a web browser on the computing device. The device further includes receiving from the user a selection of a first back button in the web browser and, in response to the user selection of the first back button, activating the non-browser application.","Implementations can include any, all, or none of the following features. The actions can further include displaying, in response to the user selection of the first back button, the search results in the non-browser application. The actions can further include displaying a second back button in the non-browser application and displaying, in response to a user selection of the second back button, a search entry screen. The actions can further include displaying, in response to the user selection of the back button, a search entry screen in the non-browser application. Activating the non-browser application can include directing the browser to a first page before displaying the landing page, wherein the first page contains code to redirect the computing device to the non-browser application. The actions can further include registering a Uniform Resource Identifier corresponding to the non-browser application, wherein the Uniform Resource Identifier can be made available to the web browser for activating the non-browser application. A Uniform Resource Identifier for the first page can include a state counter having a value that controls whether the first page directs a user to the non-browser application or to the web browser.","In a third aspect, a computer-implemented search presentation system includes a web browser stored on a computing device. The system further includes a native search application stored on a computing device, wherein the native search application is programmed to receive part or all of a search query from a user and display search results from a search engine in response to receiving the part or all of the search query, activate the web browser to display a landing page in response to a user selection of one of the search results, and provide code for the web browser to cause the web browser to activate the native search application upon a user selection of a first back button in the web browser.","Implementations can include any, all, or none of the following features. The native search application can be programmed to display the search results in response to the user selection of the first back button. The native search application can be programmed to display a second back button and display, in response to a user selection of the second back button, a search entry screen in the native search application. The native search application can be programmed to cause the web browser to be directed to a first page before displaying the landing page, wherein the first page contains code to redirect the computing device to the native search application. The native search application can be programmed to cause a Uniform Resource Identifier corresponding to the native search application to be registered with the web browser, wherein the Uniform Resource Identifier can be made available to the web browser for activating the native search application. A Uniform Resource Identifier for the first page can include a state counter having a value that controls whether the first page directs a user to the native search application or to the web browser.","In a fourth aspect, a computer-implemented search presentation system includes a web browser stored on a computing device for a user. The system further includes a native search application operable on the computing device to receive all or parts of search queries and to cause search results corresponding to the queries to be displayed to the user. The system further includes means for transitioning between the native search application and the browser.","The systems and techniques described here may provide one or more of the following advantages. First, a system can provide results before a user has fully entered a query, and may thus permit the user to short-circuit a full query entry if they see information that is particularly relevant to them before they have had to enter the entire query. Also, a system can provide for improved search interaction by using a native search application that can provide more power than a search application running in a web browser, but may integrate well with the web browser. The system may also permit a user to be provided with improved search results by logging interaction data, where the user has consented, and using such data to personalize or otherwise improve the manner in which search results are presented to the user. Moreover, the search application described here, and other applications, may be personalized to a group to which the user belongs so that when the user requests to have the application installed on his or her computing device, the application may be installed in a manner that is customized to the group. Such a technique may provide particular advantages to corporations that use hosted software applications. Moreover, where query entry occurs via an on screen keyboard, the techniques described here may provide an intuitive mechanism by which the user may remove the keyboard from the screen when it is not needed, and may thus increase the area for the display of search results and similar content.","The details of one or more implementations of the interactive search querying feature and other features are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","This document describes systems and techniques for interactive search querying. Using a mobile computing device, a user inputs a search query. The mobile computing device presents search suggestions to the user as the user inputs the query, and can also present search results, where the suggestions and the results are responsive to search queries that correspond to a partial search query (i.e., where the user has not indicated an intent to submit a complete query, such as by pressing an \u201center\u201d key). In some implementations, one or more operations of the interactive search querying are performed by a search server in communication with the mobile computing device. For example, the search server and the mobile computing device can be in communication over a network such as a wireless network and\/or the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","100","102","104","104"]},"The user interface  also displays a user input area . In the example shown here, the user input area  is a keyboard implemented within a touch screen display. In some implementations, the user input area  can include hardware for making search query inputs, such as buttons. In another implementation, the user can interact with a keyboard displayed on a screen using a pointing device, such as a dial or a track ball.","The search application  includes a search query input area . The user makes selections in the user input area  to make an input in the search query input area . Alternatively, the user can select an \u201cExplore More Products\u201d button  to initiate other applications. The areas outside the keyboard may be termed a content area, as they display content for interaction with a user when the user is performing searches and reviewing the results of the searches. In  the user has not yet started entering a query into the mobile computing device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["102","108","104","112"]},"In particular, in response to the search input \u201cad,\u201d the search application  updates the corpora suggestions area  to include suggestions for \u201cAdam Ant,\u201d \u201cAnno Domini,\u201d \u201cAdvertising Information,\u201d and \u201cadenoviris.\u201d As indicated by its associated torso icon, \u201cAdam Ant\u201d is a contact, for example, from the user's address book. \u201cAnna Domini\u201d and \u201cAdvertising Information\u201d are web pages, as indicated by their associated globe icons. \u201cAdenovirus\u201d is a previous search query, as indicated by its associated magnifying glass icon. The user can select the \u201cAdam Ant\u201d suggestion to view information for the \u201cAdam Ant\u201d contact. In addition, the user can select either the \u201cAnna Domini\u201d web page or the \u201cAdvertising Information\u201d web page to view the selected web page. The user can also select the \u201cadenovirus\u201d previous search query to perform that web search query again.","While shown here as presenting suggestions after two character inputs have been made (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d), in some implementations, the search application  can update the corpora suggestions area  after each character input is made by the user. In addition, the search application  can continue to update the corpora suggestions area  as the user makes further inputs in the search query input area . In some implementations, the search application  updates the corpora suggestions area  for each character input without (and\/or until) receiving an indication from the user that the search query is complete.","The search application  can use the search query to perform a search of one or more of the corpora. In addition, the search application  can use the search query to request suggestions from an external system, such as a search server or a suggestions server. For example, the search application  can perform a search of corpora that reside on the mobile computing device , such as contacts in an address book, bookmarks for a browser, web browsing history, and previous searches. In another example, a search server or suggestions server can perform a search of corpora that do not reside on the mobile computing device , such as web pages. In another example, the search application  can offload processing to a search server or a suggestions server by allowing the external server to perform searches of corpora that may already reside on the mobile computing device. In some implementations, the search application  periodically updates resident corpora information on an external server to reduce network traffic at the time the search is requested.","In some implementations, the search application  updates the corpora suggestions area  as suggestions become available. For example, the search application  may quickly search for and retrieve suggestions from locally stored corpora. Suggestions from corpora stored at an external server may be slower than suggestions from locally stored corpora. Therefore, the \u201cAdam Ant\u201d and \u201cadenovirus\u201d suggestions may be displayed quickly or immediately, while a delay occurs before inserting the \u201cAnna Domini\u201d and \u201cAdvertising Information\u201d suggestions into the list of corpora suggestions.","The search application  also includes a web search suggestions area . As the user makes inputs in the search query input area , the search application  updates the web search suggestions area  with web searches related to the search query in the search query input area . As with the corpora suggestions area , the web search suggestions area  can be updated as the user inputs characters. For example, in response to the search query \u201cad,\u201d the search application  presents web search suggestions including \u201cadriana,\u201d \u201cadidas,\u201d and \u201ccode adam.\u201d In some implementations, where the query terms in the web search suggestions include the search query, the search application  replaces the search query within the web search suggestion with a shorter placeholder symbol, such as two periods. The user can select any of the web search suggestions to request that the selected web search be performed. In some implementations, the search application  forwards the requested web search to a search server. The search server performs the search (e.g., using an index of web pages) and returns the search results to the search application . In some implementations, the search server can return the search results to a browser application at the mobile computing device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["102","112","112"]},"In the case of a touch screen, the user can select a location within the corpora suggestions area  and drag the selection to a second location. In another example, the user can make an input using a device such as a dial or track ball to scroll the corpora suggestions area .","In addition to scrolling through suggestions in the corpora suggestions area , the user can make an input to scroll through the suggestions in the web search suggestions area . As shown here, an \u201cAdelaide\u201d web search suggestion is now in view and the \u201cadriana\u201d web search suggestion is partially out of view. Again, the user can use an input device such as a touch screen, dial, or track ball to make the input to scroll through the suggestions in the web search suggestions area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1D","b":["102","106","106","112","112","106","106","106","102","106","112","106","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["102","104","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["102","200","102","200","200","202","202","104","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["102","104","112","100","104"]},"The search application  also updates the \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d contact suggestion to show the home telephone number  that the user recently called. The search application  can also show other interactions recently performed by the user, such as an address to which the user sent an email.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["102","100","104","112","104","114","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["102","300","300","300","300","108"]},"A particular search corpus may also be selected by a user selecting a particular corpora, such as a particular domain or sub-domain, that appears in a list of results in the search application . For example, a user may long-press on the ask.com result to have the query that a user has typed or is typing, submitted to an index that is limited to the ask.com domain\u2014i.e., to search only on that site for the entered term.","The search application  updates the corpora suggestions area to include only suggestions from the encyclopedia corpus that relate to the search query \u201cask.\u201d In particular, the suggestions include a suggestion to \u201cSearch Encyclopedia for ask.\u201d For example, the \u201cSearch Encyclopedia for ask\u201d suggestion may perform a search of the encyclopedia using a search tool native to or provided by the encyclopedia. The corpora suggestions also include two topics from the encyclopedia, \u201cAsk.gov\u201d and \u201cAmplitude-shift keying.\u201d The encyclopedia topics present additional information regarding the topics, such as a brief portion of the topic content and the web address of the topic. The user can select the encyclopedia topics to navigate to web pages that display the topics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["102","300","104","302","302"]},"In some implementations, the search application  presents the search results area . In some implementations, another application, such as a browser application presents the search results area . In some implementations, the search application  sends the search query to a vertical search server (e.g., an image search server) to perform the search of the selected corpus. In some implementations, the contents of the search results area  is a web page provided by the vertical search server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["102","300","104","104","302"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["102","108","112","112"]},"The term \u201clibrary\u201d may be included in a whitelist of categories typically used for local search. Here, local search refers to a search for something that is geographically near the mobile computing device  and\/or the user. For example, local search categories can include terms such as \u201crestaurant,\u201d \u201ctheater,\u201d \u201clibrary,\u201d and other destinations users typically search for near their geographic location. In addition, a local search category can include sub-categories. For example, the \u201crestaurant\u201d category can include a sub-category of \u201cThat.\u201d In this example, where a user inputs a search query of \u201crestau,\u201d not only can the \u201crestaurant\u201d local search suggestion be presented, but a \u201cthat restaurant\u201d local search suggestion can be presented as well. If the user has made a previous interaction including \u201cThat,\u201d such as a selection in an address book entry for a restaurant named \u201cThat-2-Go\u201d or a previous search query for \u201cThat Cultural Center,\u201d then the search application  moves the \u201cthat restaurant\u201d local search suggestion to a position above the \u201crestaurant\u201d local search suggestion in the corpora suggestions area .","In some implementations, the whitelist is stored at a suggestion server. For example, the suggestion server can receive the \u201clibrary\u201d search query from the search application . The suggestion server compares the search query to categories in the whitelist to determine if the search query includes a local search category. The suggestion server provides the determined local search suggestions to the search application  and the search application  presents the local search suggestions in the corpora suggestions area .","In another example, the whitelist is stored at the mobile computing device . The mobile computing device  compares the search query to the categories in the whitelist to determine if a term in the search query represents a local search category. In some implementations, a suggestion server maintains the whitelist and periodically updates a copy of the whitelist at the mobile computing device .","The user can select the \u201cSearch for \u2018library\u2019 near me\u201d suggestion to initiate the local search for the search query \u201clibrary.\u201d The search application  sends the search query \u201clibrary\u201d to a local vertical search server. The search application  also sends a geographic location associated with the local search request, such as a latitude of 44.9765 degrees and a longitude of \u221293.2712 degrees, a postal code of \u201c55402,\u201d or a city of Minneapolis.","For example, the search application  may determine a geographic location using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device within or accessible to the mobile computing device . The search application  can send latitude and longitude values of the mobile computing device  to the local search server. In another example, the search application  can determine a geographic location using another method, such as cellular\/wireless tower lookup or a geo-IP (Internet Protocol) lookup using a database of IP addresses or WHOIS information. In another example, the user can input a particular geographic location, such as by inputting a mailing address, city, state, or postal code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["102","104","104","302","302","400","400","402","404","114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["102","302"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["102","500","500","500","502","502","500","504","504"]},"In addition, the browser application  includes navigation controls, such as a back arrow button .

In some implementations, the URL after the URI scheme is ignored by the search application . In some implementations, the browser application  can pass state change information to the search application  within a LIRL after the \u201cgsearch:\/\/\u201d URI scheme. For example, if the user changes the search query in the web page presentation area , then the change can be made to the search query input area  when the search application  is displayed again.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},"Referring now specifically to the process, at box , a computing device displays a content area and a keyboard on a touchscreen display. Such a display may be similar to that shown in the figures above, such as in , where a search entry box is shown with a keyboard on a touchscreen.","The user may perform various actions with the device, such as by entering characters into a search box using the keyboard, so as to submit a query to a search engine. Such interaction by the user may result in additional information being displayed in a content area, such as by having search results that are responsive to a query being displayed in the content area. A keyboard may take up a substantial portion of the display, so that not all of the search results can be displayed at one time in the content area. As a result, as shown by box , the device may receive a user swiping input. The swiping input, or dragging input, may involve the receipt of a user contact on a touchscreen followed by motion while the contact is maintained. For example, a user may press their index finger against the touchscreen and may drag the finger across the touchscreen so as to provide a swiping input.","Because a device may be able to accept a variety of user inputs on a touchscreen at any one time\u2014where the intent of the input can depend on the location of the inputs, the type of input (e.g., tapping or dragging or double tapping), and the length or direction of motion that accompanies an input\u2014the process shown here may then test a user input to determine the likely intent of the user. For example, at box , the process tests whether the motion by the user is directed toward a bottom edge of the keyboard. For example, when the keyboard is arranged across the bottom of the display (e.g., ), the device may determine whether the user's motion is toward the bottom edge of the display. Such a determination may be made, for example, by obtaining, from an operating system that controls the user interface, figures that indicate the coordinates of an initial user touch on the screen, and later coordinates as the user moves their finger on the screen. If such figures indicate that the finger is moving downward on the Y-axis, a program may determine that the user is dragging their finger downward toward the bottom of the keyboard. Such a determination may also be made by a component of the operating system that may then report descriptive data, rather than coordinate data, relating to a selection by a user. For example, the component of the operating system may report an area in which a touching event occurred, a speed of motion for the event, and the direction of the motion.","If the motion is not toward the bottom of the keyboard, as determined at box , then the input is determined to be for a reason other than to affect the display of the keyboard, and a different module or component may provide feedback to the user based on the input. For example, the user input may have been a tapping input to indicate a selection of a visual control on the display.","If the motion is toward a bottom of the keyboard (or other appropriate measure by which a user can indicate an intent to hide a keyboard in an intuitive manner), then the process tests, at box , whether the motion started in an appropriate area of the display. For example, in some implementations, hiding of a keyboard may be instituted by a user pressing in the content area and swiping downward to another particular area, or across a particular distance. As a result, box  may determine whether the user started the swiping motion in the content area. If the user did not start the motion in the content area than the user may be intending to indicate a different command than a command to remove the keyboard.","If the motion did start in the appropriate area, the process may then test, at box , whether the motion has reached a correct area or distance. For example, a system may be programmed so that downward sliding motions over a short distance in a content area has one meaning, whereas downward sliding motions across a longer distance have a different meaning, such as to cause the hiding of a keyboard. For example, a keyboard may be hidden only when the user slides across the content area and their finger subsequently reaches the edge of the content area or the edge of the keyboard. Alternatively, the keyboard may be hidden after the user has slid their finger a sufficient distance across the content area or across the display, regardless of whether the finger has reached the keyboard or not. In another implementation, the keyboard may disappear after the user's finger has traveled a sufficient distance downward through the keyboard, so that the user must provide an exaggerated input starting in the content area and moving into and across at least an upper part of the keyboard, before the keyboard will be hidden.","During a user's downward motion, or the initial start of such downward motion, the process may change the visual look of the keyboard, so as to provide feedback to the user that indicates that the action the user is performing is an action that may result in the hiding of the keyboard. For example, when a user initially starts to slide their finger downward in a content area, the keyboard may be shifted downward slightly on the display, or may be made to shrink slightly on the display, so as to indicate to the user that further sliding of their finger in the same direction may result in the keyboard going away entirely, and not simply just shifting or shrinking. Other changes in the visual appearance of the keyboard, or other feedback such as sounds created by the device, may also be provided to the user after they have started a motion indicating an intent or possible intent to hide a keyboard, but before the motion has progressed sufficiently that the device will actually hide the keyboard.","At box , the process sends a command to the operating system to hide the keyboard. For example, a search application that is a native application on a device may have access to a keyboard only indirectly through components of an operating system. The operating system may make the keyboard available to various applications, but for security and other reasons, may maintain control over how the keyboard is directly handled. As a result, a program such as a search application may use a command that may be obtained through a standard application programming interface (API), to pass a message to a component of the operating system that is responsible for the keyboard, so as to cause the display of the keyboard to change, or to cause the keyboard to be hidden.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},"Starting a box , a search application opens a text entry area. For example, when the search application is initially launched, it may display to a user a data entry box where the user can type text for search queries that the user would like to submit to a remote search engine system. Upon recognizing that the search box requires entry of text, the search application may desire to provide the user with a keyboard to make the entry of text easier, and may thus communicate with the operating system components in a standard manner to call for a keyboard to be displayed, as at box . The operating system components may then cause the display of the keyboard, at box , such as by displaying the keyboard adjacent to the text entry area and a separate area for displaying search results to the user (which together make up the content area, with or without other areas displaying or receiving content form the user).","The process may then wait for further input from the user, such as data entry on the keyboard by the user pressing buttons on the display of the keyboard, at box . The operating system components may recognize that the data was entered with respect to the search application, and may thus pass the data to the search application, which may then display the entered data as a query for the device. The entered data also can include an indication to submit a query, and in response, the search application may also display results for that query, as shown at box .","A user of the device may then determine that they are done entering text for a period of time, and they thus no longer need to use the keyboard in the near future. The user may also determine that they have received a number of search results and that they are unable to view all the search results with the keyboard occupying a substantial portion of the display. The user may thus provide a touchscreen input in a manner that indicates the user's intent to have the keyboard removed or hidden. In this example, at box , the user provides a swiping or dragging input that is received by the device.","The search application or another application may receive notification of the swiping input from the operating system components, and it may interpret the input in an appropriate manner, according to parameters established for the application. For example, the swiping motion may only be valid for purposes of affecting the keyboard if the motion is made in a particular direction such as toward a perimeter of a display in the direction of the keyboard, in a manner to show an intent to swipe the keyboard off the display.","Various parameters may be established for determining whether such input is valid as an attempt to remove the keyboard, or is instead an intent to provide a different command to the device. If such an intent is indicated by the user input, the search application or another appropriate structure may call for removal of the keyboard (box ). For example, the search application may transmit to the operating system components an command that causes the operating system to remove the keyboard from the screen (box ). A search application may then expand outward, as appropriate, to fill whatever space on the display was vacated by the keyboard.","At some later point in time, such as after the user has reviewed all of the search results and perhaps visited landing pages associated with some of the search results, the user may choose to enter a new query or to edit the query they previously entered. In such a situation, the user may tap in the area of a text entry box so as to move an active area on a display (e.g., a cursor) to the text entry box (box ). Upon such an indication by the user, or another user input reflecting an intent to enter additional textual data, the search application may call the operating system so as to have the keyboard displayed again (box ). The operating system components may then respond in a normal manner by activating the keyboard and causing it to be displayed on the display (box ). Such actions as described above may then be repeated in various manners so as to match the operation of a device to inputs and expectations of a user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 9A","b":["900","900"]},"For example, a small company may choose to receive reliable computer applications at a low cost by subscribing to a hosting service, where employees may access the service from anywhere that has a Web connection. However, the company may have certain preferences, such as the look and feel of a user interface, applications or features that can be accessed by members of the organization (e.g., a corporation may want to turn off a chat feature of a communication application), and custom data (e.g., corporate contact directories) to be accessed by employees of the company. The mechanisms described here may permit a user, when accessing an on-line service that provides the hosting service, to indicate that they are an employee of the company and to subsequently have all of the settings for the particular user's selected applications set so as to match the preferences of the company.","The process  begins at box , where an applications store is displayed. Such a store may be any web accessible site where a variety of software applications are available to users for activation or download. One example of such a site is the APPLE APP STORE. The display of the application store may simply involve displaying icons for a number of computing applications that a user can load onto his or her computing device. The user may select a particular application for download by clicking on the icon for such an application, and the downloading and installation of the application on the user's computing device may occur by a variety of techniques.","The user may also be presented with a control, at box , that, if selected by the user, may cause the user to be prompted to identify a group with which the user is affiliated. For example, a user may be asked to enter the domain for their group (e.g., www.google.com or www.ibm.com). The user may also simply enter an normal name for the group (\u201cWorld Wildlife Fund\u201d), and the system may search for a matching name and then correlate it with other identifying information for the organization (e.g., a particular domain).","A representative for the group may have previously registered the group, such as using the GOOGLE APPS FOR YOUR DOMAIN service. Such registration may have resulted in the representative identifying a domain at which data for the group will be stored, the applications that should be made available for the group, various parameters that affect the manner in which those applications are displayed (e.g., selecting a theme and color scheme for the group), and providing data to the system (e.g., linking a document repository to the system and providing a corporate contact list to the system). Thus, at box , the process  may identify group-specific applications that have been identified as applications that should be made available to members of the group. Such applications may be applications that are available to the general public, but that are provided to members of the group in a customized manner, or applications that are not available to the general public (e.g., applications that were written specifically for the group or applications for which various groups may choose to pay a subscription fee). The process  may also cause those applications to be displayed to the user, such as in a manner shown in , where group-specific applications are shown in a first area of an application store and general applications, which are available to the general public, are shown in a second area. The user may choose to download the same application from either area in some instances, where downloading the application from the group-specific area will cause it to have its parameters established according to the pre-determined standard for the group, such as by pointing it to a particular sub-domain of a hosting service. In contrast, downloading the application from the general area may simply cause the application to be assigned to an account for the particular user, and may obtain parameters associated with the user, but not parameters associated with the particular group.","To obtain such display of applications, the user may initially be required to provide authentication information. For example, the user may have to establish that they are operating using an e-mail address from the domain associated with the group (e.g., by providing their e-mail address, having a token sent to the address by the system, and then providing the token back to the system), or the user may need to log into an account (e.g., with ID and password) that has previously been associated with the group.","At box , the process  receives a selection by a user of a group-specific application. The user may, for example, click on a icon in the group-specific are of an application store, to indicate that they would like to have the application loaded onto their computing device in a manner that the application is customized for the group. Thus, at box , the process  installs the application for the user with the group-specific parameters set. Such a process may simply involve associating a URI with an icon for launching the application, where the URL is directed to a domain or subdomain for the group. The installation may alternatively, or in addition, involve a full download and installation of a native application on the device, where the application points to a central server when it is run so as to obtain group-specific parameters for its operation. The parameters may also be copied to the device itself during installation, and an instance of the application loaded onto the device may refer to such local parameters when the application is invoked.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 9B","b":["911","911"]},"The process  starts at box , where a search application is launched.

The search application may operate like the search applications discussed above, including by receiving search queries entered by a user of the device and displaying search results and other information retrieved form the device and from central servers in response to the queries. As a user interacts with the search application, certain actions\u2014such as selection of menu items, clicks on pointing devices, selection of certain search results, time spent by the user at landing sites for certain search results, whether an EULA (end user license agreement) was displayed to a user, keystrokes by a user, the selection of a business listing from a search result set, a call to a business, a selection to search on a particular corpus of information, the selection of a suggestion, the hiding or showing of a keyboard, and other similar actions\u2014may be logged, such as in a string of alphanumeric text, where each action is added to the end of the string. Characters for use as short-hands for each action may be selected according to a standard scheme, and other meta information such as timestamps for certain or all actions may also be recorded.","Such analysis may be an optional feature for the user, so that the user can block the analysis if the user has privacy concerns. Permitting such analysis, however, may allow a system to improve the quality of search results that it delivers to the user. But a user may choose to turn the feature off, and may be provided with notice when the system is set to be turned on. In this manner, the user can control the level of access that is provided to their device by other services. A user may also provide limited access, such as by maintaining privacy over information about the user's location, a cell identifier for the user's device, and other such information. Also, the logged information may be anonymized in various known manners where appropriate.","To lessen the bandwidth needed for logging interaction data from a computer device to a central server, the buffered data may be stored (box ) until the occurrence of an event that requires transmission of the data or an event that would result in a need for bandwidth in any event. Under the first category, for example, the buffer may be transmitted to a central server when a user closes the search application (see box ). Under the second category, for example, the buffered data may piggyback on a transmission to a server system that must be made immediately because it is required to provide a user with input in an application hey are currently using (box ). For example, where a suggestion server corresponds to a logging system, the buffered data may piggy-back on a transmission to the suggestion server.","The server system may use the buffered data (box ) in various manners when it receives the data. First, the server system may parse and reformat the data so that it can be stored with activity data that was previously received from the same user or device. In addition, where a user has multiple devices on a common account (e.g., a laptop computer and a smart phone), the log data from the two devices may be merged to create a single log for the user. The log data may then be aggregated with similar data from a large number of users, and statistical analysis may be performed to make determinations regarding how users, as a whole, respond to certain search results. As one example, for instance, a search result that has been ranked very highly, but on which user seldom click or for which users return quickly from the landing page (thus indicating that they did not like the result), may be demoted in rank using log data showing that large numbers of users do not react favorable to the search result.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1000","1002","1002","1004","1002","1004"]},"One such component is a display interface , which may be responsible for rendering content for presentation on the touch screen display .

The display interface  may also be responsible for displaying icons like those discussed above, that may provide a user with an indication that a particular mode of input is currently in operation for the device .","An input interface  may be responsible for translating commands provided by a user of the device . For example, such commands may come from a keyboard, from the touch screen display , or from other such sources, including dedicated buttons or soft buttons (e.g., buttons whose functions may change over time, and whose functions may be displayed on areas of the touch screen display  that are adjacent to the particular buttons). The input interface  may determine, for example, in what area of the display commands are being received, and thus for which application being shown on the display the commands are intended. In addition, the input interface  may interpret input motions on the touch screen display  into a common format and pass those interpreted motions (e.g., short press, long press, straight-line drags, and inputs involving more than one tap) to the appropriate application.

In addition, a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver module  may provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data to the mobile computing device , which may be used as appropriate by applications running on the mobile computing device .","The mobile computing device  may also communicate audibly using an audio codec , which may receive spoken information from a user and convert it to usable digital information. The audio codec  may likewise generate audible sound for a user, such as through a speaker, e.g., in a handset of the mobile computing device . Such sound may include sound from voice telephone calls, may include recorded sound (e.g., voice messages, music files, etc.) and may also include sound generated by applications operating on the mobile computing device .","The mobile computing device  may be implemented in a number of different forms, as shown in the figure. For example, it may be implemented as a cellular telephone . It may also be implemented as part of a smartphone , personal digital assistant, or other similar mobile device.","Various implementations of the systems and techniques described here can be realized in digital electronic circuitry, integrated circuitry, specially designed ad servers ASICs (application specific integrated circuits), computer hardware, firmware, software, and\/or combinations thereof. These various implementations can include implementation in one or more computer programs that are executable and\/or interpretable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor, which may be special or general purpose, coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.","These computer programs (also known as programs, software, software applications or code) include machine instructions for a programmable processor, and can be implemented in a high-level procedural and\/or object-oriented programming language, and\/or in assembly\/machine language. As used herein, the terms \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d and \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d refer to any computer program product, apparatus and\/or device (e.g., magnetic discs, optical disks, memory, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs)) used to provide machine instructions and\/or data to a programmable processor, including a machine-readable medium that receives machine instructions as a machine-readable signal. The term \u201cmachine-readable signal\u201d refers to any signal used to provide machine instructions and\/or data to a programmable processor.","To provide for interaction with a user, the systems and techniques described here can be implemented on a computer having a display device (e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor) for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device (e.g., a mouse or a trackball) by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback (e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback); and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","The systems and techniques described here can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component (e.g., as a data server), or that includes a middleware component (e.g., an application server), or that includes a front end component (e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the systems and techniques described here), or any combination of such back end, middleware, or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication (e.g., a communication network). Examples of communication networks include a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), and the Internet.","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","A number of embodiments have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of what has been described. For example, various forms of the flows shown above may be used, with steps re-ordered, added, or removed. Also, although several applications of the search systems and methods have been described, it should be recognized that numerous other applications are contemplated. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A-6C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-7D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A-8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
