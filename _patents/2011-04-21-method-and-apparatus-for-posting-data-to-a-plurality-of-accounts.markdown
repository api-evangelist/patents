It should be noted that the term IT policy, in general, refers to a collection of IT policy rules, in which the IT policy rules can be defined as being either grouped or non-grouped and global or per-user. The terms grouped, non-grouped, global and per-user are defined further below. Examples of applicable communication devices include pagers, cellular phones, cellular smart-phones, wireless organizers, personal digital assistants, computers, laptops, handheld wireless communication devices, wirelessly enabled notebook computers and the like.","The mobile device is a two-way communication device with advanced data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other mobile devices or computer systems through a network of transceiver stations. The mobile device may also have the capability to allow voice communication. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device, it may be referred to as a data messaging device, a two-way pager, a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities, a wireless Internet appliance, or a data communication device (with or without telephony capabilities). To aid the reader in understanding the structure of the mobile device and how it communicates with other devices and host systems, reference will now be made to .","Referring first to , shown therein is a block diagram of an example implementation of a mobile device . The mobile device  includes a number of components such as a main processor  that controls the overall operation of the mobile device . Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through a communication subsystem . The communication subsystem  receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . In this example implementation of the mobile device , the communication subsystem  is configured in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards. The GSM\/GPRS wireless network is used worldwide and it is expected that these standards will be superseded eventually by Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS). New standards are still being defined, but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein, and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the implementations described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem  with the wireless network  represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM\/GPRS communications. With newer network protocols, these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.","Although the wireless network  associated with mobile device  is a GSM\/GPRS wireless network in one example implementation, other wireless networks may also be associated with the mobile device  in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that may be employed include, for example, data-centric wireless networks, voice-centric wireless networks, and dual-mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual-mode networks include, but are not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or CDMA2000 networks, GSM\/GPRS networks (as mentioned above), and future third-generation (3G) networks like EDGE and UMTS. Some other examples of data-centric networks include WiFi 802.11, Mobitex\u2122 and DataTAC\u2122 network communication systems. Examples of other voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems.","The main processor  also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM)  (which can be generally viewed as any type of volatile storage), a flash memory  (which can be generally viewed as any type of non-volatile storage), a display , an auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystem , a data port , a keyboard , a speaker , a microphone , short-range communications  and other device subsystems .","Some of the subsystems of the mobile device  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions. By way of example, the display  and the keyboard  may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over the network , and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list.","The mobile device  can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device . In certain implementations, to identify a subscriber, the mobile device  utilizes a SIM\/RUIM card  (i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module) to be inserted into a SIM\/RUIM interface  in order to communicate with a network. The SIM card or RUIM  is one type of a conventional \u201csmart card\u201d that can be used to identify a subscriber of the mobile device  and to personalize the mobile device , among other things. Without the SIM card , the mobile device  is not fully operational for communication with the wireless network . By inserting the SIM card\/RUIM  into the SIM\/RUIM interface , a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services may include: web browsing and messaging such as e-mail, voice mail, Short Message Service (SMS), and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). More advanced services may include: point of sale, field service and sales force automation. The SIM card\/RUIM  includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM card\/RUIM  is inserted into the SIM\/RUIM interface , it is coupled to the main processor . In order to identify the subscriber, the SIM card\/RUIM  can include some parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). An advantage of using the SIM card\/RUIM  is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. The SIM card\/RUIM  may store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well, including datebook (or calendar) information and recent call information. Alternatively, identification information can also be programmed into the flash memory .","The mobile device  is a battery-powered device and includes a battery interface  for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . In at least some implementations, the battery  can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists the battery  in providing power V+ to the mobile device . Although current technology makes use of a battery, future technologies such as micro fuel cells may provide the power to the mobile device .","The mobile device  also includes an operating system  and software components  to  which are described in more detail below. The operating system  and the software components  to  that are executed by the main processor  are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory , which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system  and the software components  to , such as specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Other software components can also be included, as is well known to those skilled in the art.","The subset of software applications  that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, will normally be installed on the mobile device  during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application  that can be any suitable software program that allows mobile device  to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application  as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received are typically stored in the flash memory  of the mobile device  or some other suitable storage element in the mobile device . In at least some implementations, some of the sent and received messages may be stored remotely from the device  such as in a data store of an associated host system that the mobile device  communicates with.","The software applications can further include a device state module , a Personal Information Manager (PIM) , and other suitable modules (not shown). The device state module  provides persistence, i.e. the device state module  ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory, such as the flash memory , so that the data is not lost when the mobile device  is turned off or loses power.","The PIM  includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest, such as, but not limited to, e-mail, contacts, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network . PIM data items may be seamlessly integrated, synchronized, and updated via the wireless network  with the mobile device subscriber's corresponding data items stored and\/or associated with a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on the mobile device  with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber's office computer system.","The mobile device  also includes a connect module , and an IT policy module . The connect module  implements the communication protocols that are required for the mobile device  to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system, such as an enterprise system, that the mobile device  is authorized to interface with. Examples of a wireless infrastructure and an enterprise system are given in , which are described in more detail below.","The connect module  includes a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be integrated with the mobile device  to allow the mobile device  to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system. The connect module  allows the mobile device  to establish an end-to-end secure, authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module  can be used to pass IT policy commands from the host system to the mobile device . This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module  to modify the configuration of the device . Alternatively, in some cases, the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.","The IT policy module  receives IT policy data that encodes the IT policy. The IT policy module  then ensures that the IT policy data is authenticated by the mobile device . The IT policy data can then be stored in the flash memory  in its native form. After the IT policy data is stored, a global notification can be sent by the IT policy module  to all of the applications residing on the mobile device . Applications for which the IT policy may be applicable then respond by reading the IT policy data to look for IT policy rules that are applicable.","The IT policy module  can include a parser (not shown), which can be used by the applications to read the IT policy rules. In some cases, another module or application can provide the parser. Grouped IT policy rules, described in more detail below, are retrieved as byte streams, which are then sent (recursively, in a sense) into the parser to determine the values of each IT policy rule defined within the grouped IT policy rule. In at least some implementations, the IT policy module  can determine which applications are affected by the IT policy data and send a notification to only those applications. In either of these cases, for applications that aren't running at the time of the notification, the applications can call the parser or the IT policy module  when they are executed to determine if there are any relevant IT policy rules in the newly received IT policy data.","All applications that support rules in the IT Policy are coded to know the type of data to expect. For example, the value that is set for the \u201cWEP User Name\u201d IT policy rule is known to be a string; therefore the value in the IT policy data that corresponds to this rule is interpreted as a string. As another example, the setting for the \u201cSet Maximum Password Attempts\u201d IT policy rule is known to be an integer, and therefore the value in the IT policy data that corresponds to this rule is interpreted as such.","After the IT policy rules have been applied to the applicable applications or configuration files, the IT policy module  sends an acknowledgement back to the host system to indicate that the IT policy data was received and successfully applied.","Other types of software applications can also be installed on the mobile device . These software applications can be third party applications, which are added after the manufacture of the mobile device . Examples of third party applications include games, calculators, utilities, etc.","In non-limiting implementations, mobile device  can include a feed application  and a post application . Feed application  receives data from any suitable number of application servers -, -, - . . . -N (collectively referred as application servers , and an individual application server as application server ), which can comprise RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed servers, social networking sites such as Twitter\u2122, Facebook\u2122, online communities, or the like. With reference to , data received from the application servers , via host system  described below, is provided in the feed application , for example in as associated graphical user interface (GUI) at display . Associated accounts ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC- application servers  are registered at mobile device  (e.g. registration data is stored in a data file associated with feed application ), and when feed application  is running, feed application  logs into the associated accounts ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC- in an always connected mode. Hence, posts, news, feeds or the like from each account at each application server  appear in the GUI of the feeds application .","The post application , which is described in more detail below, has access to the stored registration data associated with the feeds application , and enables the mobile device  to upload data to at least a subset of application servers  simultaneously.","The post application , which is described in more detail below, has access to the stored registration data associated with the feeds application , and enables the mobile device  to upload data to at least a subset of applications servers  simultaneously.","The additional applications can be loaded onto the mobile device  through at least one of the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communications subsystem , or any other suitable device subsystem . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .","The data port  enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device  other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device  through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication.","The data port  can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the mobile device  and another computing device. The data port  can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances, the data port  can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery  of the mobile device .","The short-range communications subsystem  provides for communication between the mobile device  and different systems or devices, without the use of the wireless network . For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short-range communication. Examples of short-range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Bluetooth, and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE.","In use, a received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the main processor . The main processor  will then process the received signal for output to the display  or alternatively to the auxiliary I\/O subsystem. A subscriber may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, using the keyboard  in conjunction with the display  and possibly the auxiliary I\/O subsystem . The auxiliary subsystem  may include any suitable input device such as: a touch screen, mouse, track ball, infrared fingerprint detector, a touchpad, a touch screen or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard  may comprise an alphanumeric keyboard and\/or telephone-type keypad. However, other types of keyboards may also be used. A composed item may be transmitted over the wireless network  through the communication subsystem .","For voice communications, the overall operation of the mobile device  is substantially similar, except that the received signals are output to the speaker , and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, can also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display  can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","Referring now to , an example block diagram of the communication subsystem component  is shown. The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , as well as associated components such as one or more embedded or internal antenna elements  and , Local Oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) . The particular design of the communication subsystem  is dependent upon the communication network  with which the mobile device  is intended to operate. Thus, it should be understood that the design illustrated in  serves only as one example.","Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, and analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification and transmission over the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but also provides for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The wireless link between the mobile device  and the wireless network  can contain one or more different channels, typically different RF channels, and associated protocols used between the mobile device  and the wireless network . An RF channel is a limited resource that must be conserved, typically due to limits in overall bandwidth and limited battery power of the mobile device .","When the mobile device  is fully operational, the transmitter  is typically keyed or turned on only when it is transmitting to the wireless network  and is otherwise turned off to conserve resources. Similarly, the receiver  is periodically turned off to conserve power until it is needed to receive signals or information (if at all) during designated time periods.","Referring now to , a block diagram of an example implementation of a node  of the wireless network  is shown. In practice, the wireless network  comprises one or more nodes . In conjunction with the connect module , the mobile device  can communicate with the node  within the wireless network . In the example implementation of , the node  is configured in accordance with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) technologies. The node  includes a base station controller (BSC)  with an associated tower station , a Packet Control Unit (PCU)  added for GPRS support in GSM, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) , a Home Location Register (HLR) , a Visitor Location Registry (VLR) , a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) , a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) , and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) . This list of components is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the components of every node  within a GSM\/GPRS network, but rather a list of components that are commonly used in communications through the network .","In a GSM network, the MSC  is coupled to the BSC  and to a landline network, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)  to satisfy circuit switched requirements. The connection through the PCU , the SGSN  and the GGSN  to a public or private network (Internet)  (also referred to herein generally as a shared network infrastructure) represents the data path for GPRS capable mobile devices. In a GSM network extended with GPRS capabilities, the BSC  also contains the Packet Control Unit (PCU)  that connects to the SGSN  to control segmentation, radio channel allocation and to satisfy packet switched requirements. To track the location of the mobile device  and availability for both circuit switched and packet switched management, the HLR  is shared between the MSC  and the SGSN . Access to the VLR  is controlled by the MSC .","The station  is a fixed transceiver station and together with the BSC  form fixed transceiver equipment. The fixed transceiver equipment provides wireless network coverage for a particular coverage area commonly referred to as a \u201ccell\u201d. The fixed transceiver equipment transmits communication signals to and receives communication signals from mobile devices within its cell via the station . The fixed transceiver equipment normally performs such functions as modulation and possibly encoding and\/or encryption of signals to be transmitted to the mobile device  in accordance with particular, usually predetermined, communication protocols and parameters, under control of its controller. The fixed transceiver equipment similarly demodulates and possibly decodes and decrypts, if necessary, any communication signals received from the mobile device  within its cell. Communication protocols and parameters may vary between different nodes. For example, one node may employ a different modulation scheme and operate at different frequencies than other nodes.","For all mobile devices  registered with a specific network, permanent configuration data such as a profile is stored in the HLR . The HLR  also contains location information for each registered mobile device and can be queried to determine the current location of a mobile device. The MSC  is responsible for a group of location areas and stores the data of the mobile devices currently in its area of responsibility in the VLR . Further, the VLR  also contains information on mobile devices that are visiting other networks. The information in the VLR  includes part of the permanent mobile device data transmitted from the HLR  to the VLR  for faster access. By moving additional information from a remote HLR  node to the VLR , the amount of traffic between these nodes can be reduced so that voice and data services can be provided with faster response times and at the same time requiring less use of computing resources.","The SGSN  and the GGSN  are elements added for GPRS support; namely packet switched data support, within GSM. The SGSN  and the MSC  have similar responsibilities within the wireless network  by keeping track of the location of each mobile device . The SGSN  also performs security functions and access control for data traffic on the wireless network . The GGSN  provides internetworking connections with external packet switched networks and connects to one or more SGSN's  via an Internet Protocol (IP) backbone network operated within the network . During normal operations, a given mobile device  must perform a \u201cGPRS Attach\u201d to acquire an IP address and to access data services. This requirement is not present in circuit switched voice channels such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) where addresses are used for routing incoming and outgoing calls. Currently, all GPRS capable networks use private, dynamically assigned IP addresses, thus requiring the DHCP server  connected to the GGSN . There are many mechanisms for dynamic IP address assignment, including using a combination of a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server and a DHCP server. Once the GPRS Attach is complete, a logical connection is established from a mobile device , through the PCU , and the SGSN  to an Access Point Node (APN) within the GGSN . The APN represents a logical end of an IP tunnel that can either access direct Internet compatible services or private network connections. The APN also represents a security mechanism for the network , insofar as each mobile device  must be assigned to one or more APNs and mobile devices  cannot exchange data without first performing a GPRS Attach to an APN that it has been authorized to use. The APN may be considered to be similar to an Internet domain name such as \u201cmyconnection.wireless.com\u201d.","Once the GPRS Attach operation is complete, a tunnel is created and all traffic is exchanged within standard IP packets using any protocol that can be supported in IP packets. This includes tunneling methods such as IP over IP as in the case with some IPSecurity (IPsec) connections used with Virtual Private Networks (VPN). These tunnels are also referred to as Packet Data Protocol (PDP) Contexts and there are a limited number of these available in the network . To maximize use of the PDP Contexts, the network  will run an idle timer for each PDP Context to determine if there is a lack of activity. When a mobile device  is not using its PDP Context, the PDP Context can be de-allocated and the IP address returned to the IP address pool managed by the DHCP server .","Furthermore, the host system  is in communication with the application servers  via any suitable combination of communication links and communication networks, which can be at least one of wired or wireless. As described above, the mobile device  can be signed into accounts ACC , ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC- at the application servers , and the application servers  can send data associated with the respective accounts to the mobile device  for storage and display thereon, for example via the feed application . Furthermore, data can be posted to application servers  via post application  described below. Applications servers  can comprise RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed servers, social networking sites such as Twitter\u2122, Facebook\u2122, or the like, or any other suitable application server.","Furthermore, mobile device  is associated with at least one account ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC- at, at least one application server  (accounts ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC- collectively referred as accounts ACC, and generically as an account ACC). Each application server  can be associated with one or more of accounts ACC. As depicted application server - is associated with accounts ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, application server - is associated with accounts ACC-, ACC-, and application servers -, -N are not associated with any accounts. Indeed, it is appreciated that application servers -, - are each enabled to provide services for which multiple accounts for mobile device  have been created, specifically services that provide data to mobile device  for feed application , such as social networking data, RSS data, feed data, or the like. Furthermore, data can be posted or published to accounts ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC-, ACC- for access by other devices who are subscribed to respective data from accounts ACC. It is further appreciated that application servers -, -N are application servers for which no accounts have yet been created; however accounts could be created at a later time.","Referring now to , shown therein is a block diagram illustrating components of an example configuration of a host system  that the mobile device  can communicate with in conjunction with the connect module . While not depicted in , it is appreciated that host system  is also in communication with application server . The host system  will typically be a corporate enterprise network or other local area network (LAN), but may also be a home office computer or some other private system, for example, in variant implementations. In this example shown in , the host system  is depicted as a LAN of an organization to which the mobile device  is associated. Typically, a plurality of mobile devices can communicate wirelessly with the host system  through one or more nodes  of the wireless network .","The host system  comprises a number of network components connected to each other by a network . For instance, a desktop computer with an accompanying cradle  for the mobile device  is situated on a LAN connection. The cradle  for the mobile device  can be coupled to the computer by a serial or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, for example. Other computers -are also situated on the network , and each may or may not be equipped with an accompanying cradle . The cradle  facilitates the loading of information (e.g. PIM data, private symmetric encryption keys to facilitate secure communications) from the user computer to the mobile device , and may be particularly useful for bulk information updates often performed in initializing the mobile device  for use. The information downloaded to the mobile device  may include certificates used in the exchange of messages.","It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the user computers -will typically also be connected to other peripheral devices, such as printers, etc. which are not explicitly shown in . Furthermore, only a subset of network components of the host system  are shown in  for ease of exposition, and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the host system  will comprise additional components that are not explicitly shown in  for this example configuration. More generally, the host system  may represent a smaller part of a larger network (not shown) of the organization, and may comprise different components and\/or be arranged in different topologies than that shown in the example implementation of .","To facilitate the operation of the mobile device  and the wireless communication of messages and message-related data between the mobile device  and components of the host system , a number of wireless communication support components  can be provided. In some implementations, the wireless communication support components  can include a message management server , a mobile data server , a contact server , and a device manager module . The device manager module  includes an IT Policy editor  and an IT user property editor , as well as other software components for allowing an IT administrator to configure the mobile devices . In an alternative implementation, there may be one editor that provides the functionality of both the IT policy editor  and the IT user property editor . The support components  also include a data store , and an IT policy server . The IT policy server  includes a processor , a network interface  and a memory unit . The processor  controls the operation of the IT policy server  and executes functions related to the standardized IT policy as described below. The network interface  allows the IT policy server  to communicate with the various components of the host system  and the mobile devices . The memory unit  can store functions used in implementing the IT policy as well as related data. Those skilled in the art know how to implement these various components. Other components may also be included as is well known to those skilled in the art. Further, in some implementations, the data store  can be part of any one of the servers.","In this example implementation, the mobile device  communicates with the host system  through node  of the wireless network  and a shared network infrastructure  such as a service provider network or the public Internet. Access to the host system  may be provided through one or more routers (not shown), and computing devices of the host system  may operate from behind a firewall or proxy server . The proxy server  provides a secure node and a wireless internet gateway for the host system . The proxy server  intelligently routes data to the correct destination server within the host system .","In some implementations, the host system  can include a wireless VPN router (not shown) to facilitate data exchange between the host system  and the mobile device . The wireless VPN router allows a VPN connection to be established directly through a specific wireless network to the mobile device . The wireless VPN router can be used with the Internet Protocol (IP) Version 6 (IPV6) and IP-based wireless networks. This protocol can provide enough IP addresses so that each mobile device has a dedicated IP address, making it possible to push information to a mobile device at any time. An advantage of using a wireless VPN router is that it can be an off-the-shelf VPN component, and does not require a separate wireless gateway and separate wireless infrastructure. A VPN connection can be a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\/IP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\/IP connection for delivering the messages directly to the mobile device  in this alternative implementation.","Messages intended for a user of the mobile device  are initially received by a message server  of the host system . Such messages may originate from any number of sources. For instance, a message may have been sent by a sender from the computer within the host system , from a different mobile device (not shown) connected to the wireless network  or a different wireless network, or from a different computing device, or other device capable of sending messages, via the shared network infrastructure , possibly through an application service provider (ASP) or Internet service provider (ISP), for example.","The message server  typically acts as the primary interface for the exchange of messages, particularly e-mail messages, within the organization and over the shared network infrastructure . Each user in the organization that has been set up to send and receive messages is typically associated with a user account managed by the message server . Some example implementations of the message server  include a Microsoft Exchange\u2122 server, a Lotus Domino\u2122 server, a Novell Groupwise\u2122 server, or another suitable mail server installed in a corporate environment. In some implementations, the host system  may comprise multiple message servers . The message server  may also be adapted to provide additional functions beyond message management, including the management of data associated with calendars and task lists, for example.","When messages are received by the message server , they are typically stored in a data store associated with the message server . In at least some implementations, the data store may be a separate hardware unit, such as data store , that the message server  communicates with. Messages can be subsequently retrieved and delivered to users by accessing the message server . For instance, an e-mail client application operating on a user's computer may request the e-mail messages associated with that user's account stored on the data store associated with the message server . These messages are then retrieved from the data store and stored locally on the computer . The data store associated with the message server  can store copies of each message that is locally stored on the mobile device . Alternatively, the data store associated with the message server  can store all of the messages for the user of the mobile device  and only a smaller number of messages can be stored on the mobile device  to conserve memory. For instance, the most recent messages (i.e. those received in the past two to three months for example) can be stored on the mobile device .","When operating the mobile device , the user may wish to have e-mail messages retrieved for delivery to the mobile device . The message application  operating on the mobile device  may also request messages associated with the user's account from the message server . The message application  may be configured (either by the user or by an administrator, possibly in accordance with an organization's information technology (IT) policy) to make this request at the direction of the user, at some pre-defined time interval, or upon the occurrence of some pre-defined event. In some implementations, the mobile device  is assigned its own e-mail address, and messages addressed specifically to the mobile device  are automatically redirected to the mobile device  as they are received by the message server .","The message management server  can be used to specifically provide support for the management of messages, such as e-mail messages, that are to be handled by mobile devices. Generally, while messages are still stored on the message server , the message management server  can be used to control when, if, and how messages are sent to the mobile device . The message management server  also facilitates the handling of messages composed on the mobile device , which are sent to the message server  for subsequent delivery.","For example, the message management server  may monitor the user's \u201cmailbox\u201d (e.g. the message store associated with the user's account on the message server ) for new e-mail messages, and apply user-definable filters to new messages to determine if and how the messages are relayed to the user's mobile device . The message management server  may also compress and encrypt new messages (e.g. using an encryption technique such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES, or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)) and push them to the mobile device  via the shared network infrastructure  and the wireless network . The message management server  may also receive messages composed on the mobile device  (e.g. encrypted using Triple DES), decrypt and decompress the composed messages, re-format the composed messages if desired so that they will appear to have originated from the user's computer , and re-route the composed messages to the message server  for delivery.","Certain properties or restrictions associated with messages that are to be sent from and\/or received by the mobile device  can be defined (e.g. by an administrator in accordance with IT policy) and enforced by the message management server . These may include whether the mobile device  may receive encrypted and\/or signed messages, minimum encryption key sizes, whether outgoing messages must be encrypted and\/or signed, and whether copies of all secure messages sent from the mobile device  are to be sent to a pre-defined copy address, for example.","The message management server  may also be adapted to provide other control functions, such as only pushing certain message information or pre-defined portions (e.g. \u201cblocks\u201d) of a message stored on the message server  to the mobile device . For example, in some cases, when a message is initially retrieved by the mobile device  from the message server , the message management server  may push only the first part of a message to the mobile device , with the part being of a pre-defined size (e.g. 2 KB). The user can then request that more of the message be delivered in similar-sized blocks by the message management server  to the mobile device , possibly up to a maximum pre-defined message size. Accordingly, the message management server  facilitates better control over the type of data and the amount of data that is communicated to the mobile device , and can help to minimize potential waste of bandwidth or other resources.","The mobile data server  encompasses any other server that stores information that is relevant to the corporation. The mobile data server  may include, but is not limited to, databases, online data document repositories, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, or enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications.","The contact server  can provide information for a list of contacts for the user in a similar fashion as the address book on the mobile device . Accordingly, for a given contact, the contact server  can include the name, phone number, work address and e-mail address of the contact, among other information. The contact server  can also provide a global address list that contains the contact information for all of the contacts associated with the host system .","It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that the message management server , the mobile data server , the contact server , the device manager module , the data store  and the IT policy server  do not need to be implemented on separate physical servers within the host system . For example, some or all of the functions associated with the message management server  may be integrated with the message server , or some other server in the host system . Alternatively, the host system  may comprise multiple message management servers , particularly in variant implementations where a large number of mobile devices need to be supported.","Alternatively, in some implementations, the IT policy server  can provide the IT policy editor , the IT user property editor  and the data store . In some cases, the IT policy server  can also provide the device manager module . The processor  of the IT policy server  can be used to perform the various steps of a method for providing IT policy data that is customizable on a per-user basis as explained further below and in conjunction with . The processor  can execute the editors  and . In some cases, the functionality of the editors  and  can be provided by a single editor. In some cases, the memory unit  can provide the data store .","The device manager module  provides an IT administrator with a graphical user interface with which the IT administrator interacts to configure various settings for the mobile devices . As mentioned, the IT administrator can use IT policy rules to define behaviors of certain applications on the mobile device  that are permitted such as phone, web browser or Instant Messenger use. The IT policy rules can also be used to set specific values for configuration settings that an organization requires on the mobile devices  such as auto signature text, WLAN\/VoIP\/VPN configuration, security requirements (e.g. encryption algorithms, password rules, etc.), specifying themes or applications that are allowed to run on the mobile device , and the like.","It is to be emphasized that the foregoing provides non-limiting examples of configurations for mobile device , host system . For example, it is to be understood that mobile device  is purely an example, and it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a variety of different portable electronic device structures are contemplated. Indeed variations on mobile device  can include, without limitation, a cellular telephone, a portable email paging device, a camera, a portable music player, a portable video player, a portable video game player and the like. Other contemplated variations include devices which are not necessarily portable, such as desktop computers.","Referring now to , a specific contemplated variation of device  is indicated at . Mobile device contains several of the same components as device , or variations on them, and accordingly, like components bear like references, except followed by the suffix \u201ca\u201d. However, while  showed a block diagram of the internal components of device ,  shows an example physical appearance and structure for device . Of note is that  shows the mobile device as comprising a chassis that supports display . Display can comprise one or more light emitters such as an array of light emitting diodes (LED), liquid crystals, plasma cells, or organic light emitting diodes (OLED). Other types of light emitters are contemplated. Chassis also supports keyboard . It is to be understood that this specification is not limited to any particular structure, spacing, pitch or shape of keyboard , and the depiction in  is purely example. For example, full or reduced \u201cQWERTY\u201d keyboards are contemplated. Other types of keyboards are contemplated. Device also comprises a first pointing device - which in a present implementation is implemented as a touch-pad, but in other implementations can be implemented as a joystick, trackball, track-wheel. Device also comprises a second pointing device - which in a present implementation is implemented as a touch-sensitive membrane disposed over display , thereby providing a touch-screen for device . While two pointing devices - and -, it is to be understood that in variations, only one pointing device - and - may be provided. It should also be understood that other types of input devices are contemplated, including input devices which are structurally different that the specific examples provided are contemplated, but are also functionally equivalent and able to, for example, receive \u201cswipe\u201d inputs and send an electrical signal representing such an input to processor . Device also comprises a speaker for generating audio output, and a microphone for receiving audio input.","Referring now to , another specific contemplated variation of device  is indicated at . Mobile device contains several of the same components as device , or variations on them, and accordingly, like components bear like references, except followed by the suffix \u201cb\u201d. Of note is that in , keyboard is not provided, while two pointing devices - and - are provided. Again, in a variation of device , only one of pointing devices - and - may be provided, although in such a variation, typically second pointing device - is provided in order to provide a touch-screen for device ","For convenience, the following discussion is made with reference to mobile device , including both pointing devices - and -, but upon reading the remainder of this specification, those skilled in the art will become able to appreciate how the following discussions can be applied to variations of mobile device . To that end,  shows a block diagram of device .  is a modified version of , and of note  specifically shows touch-pad - and touch-screen -. Also of note is that, in a present non-limiting example implementation, touch-pad - is configured to not only be sensitive to touch inputs, but touch-pad - is also mechanically structured as a mechanical switch, such that it can also be mechanically depressed and moved in a direction that is normal to the surface of touch-pad -. The mechanical switch is also spring biased towards a non-depressed position, so that upon release the mechanical switch returns to the non-depressed position. Accordingly, touch-pad - is configured to receive selection inputs by mechanical depression of touch-pad -, while touch-screen - is configured to receive selection inputs corresponding to screen focus by a tap received on touch-screen -. It should be noted, however, that in variations, touch-pad - can additionally be configured, or alternatively configured, to receive selection inputs by a tap received on touch-pad -. Where touch-pad - can received a tap input, then the mechanical switch can be removed from touch-pad - altogether.","While not shown, in another variation it should be understood that touch-screen - can also be varied to also include a mechanical switch so that a force requiring a mechanical click on touch-screen - in order to select an item in focus on touch screen -. Such a mechanical switch can be provided for touch-screen - either in lieu of, or in addition to, the \u201ctap\u201d input capability provided for touch-screen -.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["100","197"],"i":["b","b.

For example, uploads to some accounts ACC (e.g. Twitter\u2122 accounts) can be limited to a total given maximum number of characters, such as 140 characters. However, different accounts can have different maximum numbers of characters that can be uploaded. The maximum total number of characters that can be provided in message region  can be determined from the account ACC having smallest maximum number of characters that can be uploaded (e.g. a lowest common denominator character limit, so that message data can be posted to all accounts ACC). As depicted in , region  indicates that 140 characters are remaining as no text has yet been received in message region .

It is further appreciated that each of icons  comprises: a first respective indicator  of a respective account; a second respective indicator  of a service associated with the account; and a respective picture , as described above. It is appreciated that steps  and  can be performed in any suitable order, or in parallel.","At step , input data from an input device, such as auxiliary I\/O , is received the input data indicating that at least one of the icons  has been selected. At step , the processor  controls the display  to provide an indicator  of selection at each of the icons  which are selected. At step , the message data is transmitted to each of the plurality of accounts ACC associated with each of the icons  which are selected. For example the message data is transmitted via the communications subsystem  when the virtual button  is actuated.","Similarly, processor  can control display  to provide, adjacent to at least one of the message region  or the icons , at least one of a region for receiving at least one of link data, picture data, file data, event data, or video data to be posted with the message data. The at least one of the link data, the picture data, the file data, the event data or the video data can be posted to an account ACC when the message data is posted.","As described above, in some implementations a picture in an icon  or  can include a picture downloaded from a respective application server . In these implementations, method  can further comprise refreshing a picture downloaded from an application server  (or a remote server) by querying the application server  in a refresh operation or a synchronization operation and receiving a refresh picture in response. Alternatively, method  can further comprise refreshing the picture downloaded from the application server  by receiving a refresh picture from the remote server, the refresh picture transmitted by the application server  in a refresh operation or a synchronization operation.","In general, method  can further comprise receiving the message data in the message region  via an input device; however in some implementations blank message data can be posted, or only a link or only a picture. Hence, receiving message data in message region  is generally optional.","Method  can further comprise: receiving messages from at least a second subset of the accounts via the communications subsystem , each of the messages received in a respective data feed, for example in feed application ; controlling the display  to provide the messages; receiving selection data from an input device indicating that one of the messages has been selected; and populating the message region  with the one of the messages, such that the message data comprises the one of the messages. In other words, message region  can also be populated using a forward command executed in the feed application , the forward command triggering the processing of the post application  and the pre-population of at least one of the message region, the link region  or the picture region  using data selected in the feed application .","Attention is now directed to , which is similar to  with like elements having like numbers. However, in these implementations, 147 characters have been received in message region , and region  has been controlled to indicate that \u22127 characters are remaining (i.e. there are 7 characters more than the maximum amount for updating to accounts ACC having a 140 character limit). The number of characters exceeding the limit of accounts ACC having the lowest maximum number of characters can be provided using any suitable method (e.g. using text such as \u201cThe maximum has been exceeded by 7\u201d can be provided in region ).","Furthermore it is appreciated that icons - and - are automatically unselected when the maximum number of characters for associated accounts are exceeded in message region  as an attempt to post more than  characters to these accounts would result in either an error or a nonsensical truncation of the message data. The automatic unselection of icons - and - is reflected by icons - and - being changed to an unselected state (e.g. by way of the checkmark being removed and associated text and picture being grayed out or ghosted, or icons - and - being disabled). Hence, in general, when associated maximum character limits are reached for each account ACC, an associated selected icon  is changed from a selected state to an unselected state. Furthermore, unselected icons associated with the same service are disabled from being selected. Furthermore, it is appreciated that when the number of characters in message area  is reduced to being within a maximum amount associated with a respective account ACC, the associated icon(s)  can be changed back to a selected state. Alternatively, the associated icons(s)  can be reenabled for selection: in these implementations, for the message data to be posted to accounts ACC associated with icons  that were previously changed from a selected state to an unselected state, the associated icons  are re-selected by receiving suitable input data.","It is further understood that while implementations of  have been described with reference to mobile device , with input data being received via auxiliary I\/O , further implementations can be implemented on mobile device or mobile device with input data being received via at least one of touch-pad - or touch-screen -.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some implementations, the functionality of mobile devices , , can be implemented using pre-programmed hardware or firmware elements (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), etc.), or other related components. In other implementations, the functionality of mobile devices , , can be achieved using a computing apparatus that has access to a code memory (not shown) which stores computer-readable program code for operation of the computing apparatus. The computer-readable program code could be stored on a computer readable storage medium which is fixed, tangible and readable directly by these components, (e.g., removable diskette, CD-ROM, ROM, fixed disk, USB drive). Alternatively, the computer-readable program code could be stored remotely but transmittable to these components via a modem or other interface device connected to a network (including, without limitation, the Internet) over a transmission medium. The transmission medium can be either a non-wireless medium (e.g., optical and\/or digital and\/or analog communications lines) or a wireless medium (e.g., microwave, infrared, free-space optical or other transmission schemes) or a combination thereof.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection.
