{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention pertains to information browsing. More particularly, this invention relates to browsing information available on a network (such as the Internet) and executing an application (such as a video conferencing application) in the context of information browsing.","2. Background","As computer technology advances, using a computer system for browsing, in particular browsing information available on a network, has continually increased. A network refers to a collection of two or more computer systems communicatively coupled to one another. A network may also be interconnected to one or more other networks. One particular type of interconnected networks which has become popular recently is the Internet. Typically in a network or a collection of interconnected networks one computer system, referred to as the client system, accesses a second computer system, referred to as the host system, in order to obtain data from the host system.","One use of interconnected networks, particularly the Internet, is referred to as the world wide web or simply \u201cthe web\u201d. The web refers to the multiple networked computer systems geographically dispersed throughout the world that allows data to be transferred among the computer systems using the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP). A number of \u201cweb browsers\u201d are commercially available which assist client system users in obtaining and browsing information from host systems (also referred to as web servers). By using such a browser, a client system user is able to retrieve and view documents from a web server locate anywhere in the world. Each web server typically functions independently of the other web servers.","As the popularity of information browsing continues to increase, it is expected that it will become the primary model of user interaction with the computer system, just as the \u201cdesktop\u201d model has become for graphical user interfaces. However, one problem with prior art web browsers is that typically only \u201cdocuments\u201d from a single web server can be loaded at the client system and used by the client system user at a time. Thus, a client system user is typically prohibited from viewing \u201cdocuments\u201d from one web server while browsing different \u201cdocuments\u201d from another independent web server in a single instance of a browser. Rather, multiple browser instances must be employed. Similarly, prior art web browsers also do not allow an independent application \u201cunrelated\u201d to the documents of a web server to be co-executed within an instance of a browser. The independent unrelated application must be executed in another window.","Therefore, a need exists for seamless integration of information browsing from multiple independent uncollaborated information sources, including running independent unrelated applications within the context of information browsing.","An integrated information browsing and video conferencing interface is described herein. A conferencing application is executed and displayed in a first portion of a web browser window.","in the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.","The present description includes material protected by copyrights, such as illustrations of graphical user interface images which the assignee of the present invention owns. The assignee hereby reserves its rights, including copyright, in these materials, and each such material should be regarded as bearing the following notice: Copyright Intel Corporation. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like. It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the present invention, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","100","130","140"]},"Each client system  can be any of a wide range of \u201ccomputing\u201d devices which provide a user with the ability to access the Internet . A client system  can access the Internet  either directly or through an ISP  as illustrated. Examples of such \u201ccomputing\u201d devices include conventional desktop computers as well as Internet \u201cappliance\u201d devices, such as a WebTV\u2122 Internet Terminal available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., or WebTV Networks Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.","Each ISP  is typically a computer system having a large amount of storage space (typically on the order of hundreds of gigabytes or terabytes) and multiple communication lines for facilitating access to the Internet  by client systems .","Each host system  is also typically a computer system which can be accessed by client systems . According to one embodiment, each host system  includes one or more HyperText Markup Language (HTML) compatible web pages which can be accessed via the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and displayed by an HTML compatible Internet browser running on a client system . In this embodiment, an individual user can access a web page at a host system  by entering an identifier, referred to as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), of the web page. In addition, each host system  may also contain one or more data files which can be accessed by client systems . These data file(s) may be accessed via HTTP, or alternatively other protocols, such as the file transfer protocol (FTP).","The web pages, also referred to as HTML documents, can be either static or dynamic documents. A static document or static page refers to a web page which does not provide for user interaction with the page. The data of the web page is simply displayed for the user, and does not provide for additional inputs to the page by the user. A dynamic document or dynamic page, also referred to as an Internet application, refers to a web page which is not static and, through various controls and scripts, provides for user interaction with the document. A dynamic document can include controls and scripts which execute various applications at the client system. Thus, a user is often able to input additional data to the page to which the page, based on its programming, responds.","The Internet  is a combination of multiple conventional hardware components, including computer systems, routers, repeaters, gateways, and communications links spread throughout the world. These hardware components are organized hierarchically to provide multiple logical levels of networks. The hardware components of Internet  interact to route data from one computer system to another. According to one implementation, data is transferred between computer systems using the well-known Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol. The data is typically transferred in units referred to as \u201cpackets\u201d or \u201cdatagrams\u201d. Typically, each packet includes data, a source address identifying the system which initiated the packet and a target address identifying the system to which the packet is to be sent. Additional control information, such as a checksum, may also be included in the packet. The number of bytes of data contained within a packet is dependent on the network protocol being used.","The communication links illustrated in  can be any of a wide range of conventional communication media and may be different for different client systems , host systems , and ISPs . For example, a communication link may be a coaxial cable, a fiber-optic cable, or may represent a nonphysical medium transmitting electromagnetic signals in the electromagnetic spectrum, such as infrared or radio frequency signals. Additionally, a communication link may also include any number of conventional routing or repeating devices, such as satellites or electromagnetic signal repeaters.","It is to be appreciated that although client systems  and host systems  are illustrated as being different machines, a single hardware system may be both a client system and a host system. If the hardware system is initiating an access for information to another system then the hardware system is referred to as a client system. However, if the hardware system is being accessed by another system to obtain information from the hardware system then the hardware system is referred to as a host system.","It is to be appreciated that additional networks may also be included in the network environment . For example, multiple client systems  may be coupled together in an Ethernet, token ring, or other conventional network and access an ISP  through this additional network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","220","230","240","250","260","110","200"]},"Operating system  manages and controls the operation of the client system, including the input and output of data to and from network browser  as well as other software applications (not shown). Operating system  provides an interface, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), between the user and the software applications being executed on the system. According to one embodiment of the present invention, operating system  is the Windows\u2122 95 operating system, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. However, it is to be appreciated that the present invention may be used with other conventional operating systems, such as other versions of Microsoft Windows\u2122 (for example, Windows\u2122 3.0, Windows\u2122 3.1, or Windows\u2122 NT), Microsoft DOS, OS\/2, available from International Business Machines Corporation of Armonk, N.Y., the Apple Macintosh Operating System, available from Apple Computer Incorporated of Cupertino, Calif., the NeXTSTEP\u00ae operating system available from Apple Computer Incorporated, or the UNIX operating system, available from Santa Cruz Operations of Santa Cruz, Calif.","Network browser , also referred to as an information browser, provides a user interface, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), which allows an individual to send information to and receive information from another networked system. According to one embodiment of the present invention, network browser  is an HTML compatible Internet browser, such as Internet Explorer, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., Navigator\u2122, available from Netscape Communications Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., or HotJava\u2122, available from Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif. It is to be appreciated, however, that browser  can be any of a wide variety of conventional interfaces which allow an individual user to access other networked systems.","Communication interface , according to one embodiment, includes a Windows Sockets 2 interface, as defined in the Windows Sockets 2 Service Provider Interface Specification, Revision 2.2.0, dated May 10, 1996, the Windows Sockets 2 Application Programming Interface, Revision 2.2.0, dated May 10, 1996, and the Windows Sockets 2 Protocol-Specific Annex, Revision 2.0.3, dated May 10, 1996. Alternatively, communication interface  may include Windows Sockets 1.1 interface, as defined in the Windows Sockets Interface Specification, Version 1.1, dated Jan. 20, 1993. Communication interface  controls communication between the network and browser , persistency control , and augmented browser control .","When enabled, persistency control logic  registers itself with browser  to receive events originated by web browser  which include the web page identifiers input to browser . Additionally, persistency control logic  conditionally prevents browser  from replacing the current display with newly identified HTML documents. In one embodiment, persistency control  intervenes in the display of newly requested data such that the new data is co-displayed with the previously received data, thereby providing display persistency. Persistency control logic , when enabled, monitors the data requests input to network browser . In the case of the world wide web, these data requests are web page identifiers, also referred to as URLs. Web page identifiers can be input to browser  in any of a wide variety of conventional manners, including a user typing in a specific identifier, hitting a \u201cBack\u201d or \u201cForward\u201d button, selecting an identifier from a list of \u201cfavorites\u201d, selecting a link in an HTML document, etc.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the portion of the received data which persists in the web browser is that data corresponding to a dynamic page, also referred to as an Internet application. All information related to the Internet application, including controls and data such as application-specific executable code, application-specific HTML content, and application-specific scripts are maintained by the client system. Persistency control  effectively \u201clocks\u201d this information into the client system, thereby preventing it from being erased when a new web page is loaded. In other words, rather than allowing browser  to clear the entire display, the persistency control  intervenes and in cooperation with augmented browser control  displays the new data in an \u201cunlocked\u201d portion of the browser's display window.","Persistency control logic  initiates augmented browser control  when persistency control logic  is enabled. Augmented browser control  retrieves and displays the newly requested web pages at the request of persistency control logic . Together, the \u201clocked\u201d and \u201cunlocked\u201d portions allow web pages from two independent non-collaborating web servers to be displayed concurrently. Thus, the web page from a first page source persists and the user is able to continue to interact with the persisting web page even though web pages from different sources are being retrieved and browsed.","It should be noted that the HTML documents displayed by augmented browser control  can be located locally as well as remotely. Thus, a particular identifier may indicate to augmented browser control  to access an HTML document via Internet  of , or alternatively the HTML document may be stored locally at the client system.","Persistency control logic  registers itself, upon its creation, with browser . More specifically, in embodiments where browser  is the Microsoft Internet Explorer, persistency control logic  accesses an IConnectionPoint interface of browser  via an IServiceProvider interface of browser . Persistency control logic  then registers with browser  using an Advise command, thereby causing browser  to notify persistency control logic  of all the browser events. Persistency control logic  monitors the events received from browser , waiting for either a BeforeNavigate or FrameBeforeNavigate event. Both of these events indicate that browser  is about to navigate to a new web page. In other words, each of these events indicates a new identifier has been input to browser  by the user. One parameter of each of these events is the identifier of the new page to which browser  is about to navigate. Thus, persistency control logic  is aware of the new page request input to browser . An additional parameter for both the BeforeNavigate and FrameBeforeNavigate events is a cancel parameter. The cancel parameter can be set by persistency control logic  prior to completing processing of the received event, thereby causing browser  to cancel retrieving of the new web page.","Persistency control logic  then sends an event indicating the new identifier that has been input by the user. This event is received by scripts executing in the Internet application page. These scripts respond to the received event and direct augmented browser control  to navigate to the requested page. Augmented browser control  includes logic, analogous to that of browser , which allows it to access and retrieve the requested web page. In one implementation, the scripts direct augmented browser control  to navigate to the requested page by calling a Navigate command of augmented browser control . Upon receipt of the identifier, augmented browser control  retrieves and displays the requested web page.","The display of information within the browser window is controlled by both augmented browser control  and the Internet application which is \u201clocked\u201d. Scripts in the Internet application control the size and display location where the Internet application is displayed to the user. Control logic within augmented browser control  controls the size and display location where the web pages being browsed are displayed to the user. In one embodiment, the scripts of the Internet application notify augmented browser control  of the size and display location of the Internet application, and augmented browser control  simply uses the remaining screen location within the window of browser .","In one embodiment of the present invention, persistency control logic  also monitors the events received from browser  for a Resize event. The Resize event indicates that the window size of browser  is being changed. Persistency control logic  notifies the scripts of the Internet application of this change, thereby allowing it to adjust the size and display location where the Internet application is displayed to the user. The scripts then notify augmented browser control  of the new size and display location of the Internet application, thereby allowing augmented browser control  to adjust the size and display location where the web pages being browsed are displayed to the user, based on the new size of the browser  window.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the Internet application which is \u201clocked\u201d by persistency control  is a web page invoking a video conferencing application, such as a ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application, available from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. Other video conferencing applications include, for example, the Intel Video Phone with ProShare\u00ae technology, or other Intel Business Video Conferencing with ProShare\u00ae technology applications. The ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application remains executing and displayed in the context of the browser while at the same time the system user is able to browse different web pages from independent uncollaborated web servers. In another embodiment of the present invention, the Internet application which is \u201clocked\u201d by persistency control  is a web page invoking a video application which provides a video stream to the client system, such as NetShow\u2122, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. This video stream could be, for example, a training video or a demonstration.","Another example of a web page invoking an Internet application that can be \u201clocked\u201d by persistency control  is a web page listing application. Such a listing application maintains a record of each web page which has been accessed by a user during the current browsing session. Page identifiers are displayed to the user in any of a variety of manners, such as chronologically or alphabetically. Selection of one of the page identifiers by the user causes that identifier to be input to the browser and thus retrieved again for the user.","It is to be appreciated that web pages invoking other Internet applications can be \u201clocked\u201d by persistency control  within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Examples of such Internet applications include chat applications, file transfer applications, flight reservation applications, etc.","In one embodiment, Internet applications are initiated by selection of a particular link on a web page by the user. By way of example, a particular corporation may include a \u201ctalk to customer representative\u201d link. Selection of the link by a user causes a ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application to execute on the client system and connects to a customer representative of the corporation. In one implementation, the link includes the type of link to establish, the number to call, and the type of conference to establish. The type of link to establish can be an ISDN link or TCP\/IP link. The number to call will either be a conventional phone number in the case of an ISDN link or a network address in the case of a TCP\/IP link. The type of conference can be an audio\/video conference or an audio\/video\/data conference.","It is to be appreciated that only the application-specific information need be maintained when \u201clocking\u201d a particular web page. That is, if a link is selected which causes execution of a ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application, then only the controls and HTML content necessary to continue executing the ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application need be \u201clocked\u201d. Any additional HTML content (e.g., unrelated descriptions surrounding the selected link) does not need to be maintained. However, HTML content relating to the Internet application are maintained, such as instructions or labels of selectable options.","In one embodiment of the present invention, augmented browser control  includes a function for sending and receiving messages to and from the Internet application. In this embodiment, there can be a functional relationship between the \u201clocked\u201d Internet application and the HTML documents being browsed in the augmented browser. In one implementation, selection of a particular link on a web page displayed by the augmented browser control causes a message to be sent to the Internet application for the Internet application to act on. By way of example, selection of a particular option on a training index web page displayed by the augmented browser control can be conveyed to the Internet application which displays the appropriate video to the user via the Internet application. Similarly, in another implementation, selection of a particular option in the Internet application causes a message to be sent to the augmented browser to act on. By way of example, selection of a particular block of video, or after a predetermined period of time after start of a video stream, a message is sent to the augmented browser control to obtain another web page.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the \u201clocked\u201d application includes a function to synchronize the \u201cunlocked\u201d portion of the display with the \u201cunlocked\u201d portion of the display on another system. In one implementation, this is referred to as a view synchronization option. The view synchronization option causes the views of the two or more systems to be synchronized. By way of example, if the Internet application is a web page invoking a ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application, then the two or more client\/host system users that are engaged in the conference can be synchronized to the same web page using the view synchronization option. The view synchronization option can be provided to the user and selected by the user in any of a wide variety of manners, such as a hot button, menu option, command line input, dialog box, etc. In embodiments which support the view synchronization option, scripts of the \u201clocked\u201d application maintain a copy of the identifier of the most recently requested web page. Thus, upon selection of the view synchronization option by a user, the Internet application, knowing the web page currently being viewed by the user, transfers the identifier of this web page to the other systems involved in the Internet application. In one embodiment, where the Internet application is a web page invoking a ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application, the identifier is transferred via the data channel of the conference to all the users participating in the conference. Upon receipt of the identifier, scripts of the Internet application at each of the receiving systems directs the augmented browser control at the system to access and retrieve the identified web page.","In one embodiment of the present invention, persistency control logic  is enabled whenever an Internet application is accessed. According to an alternate embodiment, persistency control logic  is enabled when a web page is accessed which indicates to enable persistency control . In one implementation this indication is a script in the web page which executes persistency control  when the web page is accessed. Thus, in this embodiment, web page designers can decide whether to make use of the present invention.","In an alternate embodiment, persistency control logic  is automatically enabled at the client system, such as at system reset or when web browser  is launched. In one implementation, a specific application can be launched, such as a ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application, and be ready to make or receive a video conference call when web browser  is launched. Alternatively, a portion of the display can remain blank, waiting for an Internet application to be accessed.","In one embodiment of the present invention an additional monitoring application, listener logic , is also executed. In one implementation, listener logic  is executed at system reset. In alternate implementations, listener logic  is user executed. Listener logic  monitors the input signals received by operating system . When listener logic  monitors an incoming ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing call, it automatically executes browser  and persistency control logic , as well as the ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application. Thus, listener logic  allows a user to make use of the present invention without requiring the user to execute the browser and the ProShare\u00ae Personal Conferencing application every time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIGS. 3","i":["a ","b "],"b":["3","210","305","310","210","315","320","210","325"]},"However, if the page is an Internet application, step , then persistency control logic  is enabled, step . In the illustrated embodiment, persistency control logic  is enabled via a script in the requested web page. As part of being enabled, persistency control logic  registers itself with browser  to receive web page identifiers when they are input by the user. Upon being enabled, persistency control logic  creates the augmented browser control, step , which displays the web pages within the browser  along with the Internet application. Persistency control logic  then \u201clocks\u201d the application, step , thereby causing the application to persist even though the pages being browsed and displayed in the augmented browser may change.","Eventually, web browser  receives another web page request from the user, step . Persistency control , having registered with browser , is notified of the web page request, step . Persistency control logic  then prevents browser  from accessing and displaying the requested web page, step . Persistency control logic  then conveys an identifier of the requested page to the augmented browser control, which accesses and retrieves the page, step . Thus, the requested page is displayed along with the \u201clocked\u201d application. The \u201clocked\u201d portion continues to be displayed until the persistency is disabled, step .

In particular, network\/communication interface  is used to provide communication between system  and any of a wide range of conventional networks, such as an Ethernet, token ring, the Internet, etc. It is to be appreciated that the circuitry of interface  is dependent on the type of network the system  is being coupled to.","Mass storage  is used to provide permanent storage for the data and programming instructions to perform the above described functions implemented in the system controller, whereas system memory  is used to provide temporary storage for the data and programming instructions when executed by processor .","I\/O ports  are one or more serial and\/or parallel communication ports used to provide communication between additional peripheral devices which may be coupled to hardware system .","It is to be appreciated that various components of hardware system  may be re-arranged. For example, cache  may be on-chip with processor . Alternatively, cache  and processor  may be packed together as a \u201cprocessor module\u201d, with processor  being referred to as the \u201cprocessor core\u201d. Furthermore, certain implementations of the present invention may not require nor include all of the above components. For example, mass storage , keyboard and pointing device , and\/or display device  and video memory  may not be included in system . Additionally, the peripheral devices shown coupled to standard I\/O bus  may be coupled to high performance I\/O bus ; in addition, in some implementations only a single bus may exist with the components of hardware system  being coupled to the single bus. Furthermore, additional components may be included in system , such as additional processors, storage devices, or memories.","In one embodiment, the elements of the present invention are implemented as a series of software routines run by hardware system  of . These software routines comprise a plurality or series of instructions to be executed by a processor in a hardware system, such as processor  of . Initially, the series of instructions are stored on a storage device, such as mass storage . It is to be appreciated that the series of instructions can be stored on any conventional storage medium, such as a diskette, CD-ROM, magnetic tape, DVD, laser disk, ROM, etc. It is also to be appreciated that the series of instructions need not be stored locally, and could be received from a remote storage device, such as a server on a network, via network\/communication interface . DVD is currently used as an acronym for digital video disk. However, it appears that the usage is changing to digital versatile disk to reflect the ability of DVD technology to be used for data other than video.","The instructions are copied from the storage device, such as mass storage , into memory  and then accessed and executed by processor . In one implementation, these software routines are written in the C++ programming language. It is to be appreciated, however, that these routines may be implemented in any of a wide variety of programming languages. In alternate embodiments, the present invention is implemented in discrete hardware or firmware. For example, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) could be programmed with the above described functions of the present invention.","In the discussions above, reference is made to transferring data via HTTP over the Internet. However, in alternate embodiments different protocols can be used.","In some of the discussions above reference is made to an Internet application being \u201clocked\u201d by the present invention. However, in an alternate embodiment a static document is \u201clocked\u201d rather than a dynamic document. Thus, in this alternate embodiment, one document, such as the results of a web search or an index, remains on the display while the user is able to continue to browse to additional documents.","Also in the discussions above reference is made to one application being \u201clocked\u201d by the present invention. However, in alternate embodiments additional applications are \u201clocked\u201d. By way of example, persistency control logic  of  may control the \u201clocking\u201d of two different applications and still allow a user to browse the web in a third location of the display.","Thus, the present invention provides for an integrated browser and video conferencing application. The video conferencing application is advantageously displayed to the user in the same window in which the user is able to browse other web pages. Furthermore, video conferencing control options are advantageously displayed to the user as web pages, allowing the user to modify the control options through the web pages.","Thus, an integrated information browsing and video conferencing interface has been described.
