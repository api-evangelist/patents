abstract: A semiconductor device that operates with reduced power consumption having a clock transfer blocking circuit and an external data transfer blocking circuit that blocks a clock signal and a data signal from being transferred to a data output circuit when a data signal captured by a data capturing circuit is to be latched by a latch circuit. If however, the data signal captured is necessary for a later stage of the semiconductor device, then an internal data transfer blocking circuit blocks the data signal from being latched in the latch circuit, while the clock transfer blocking circuit and the external data transfer blocking circuit cause the captured clock signal and data signal to be output to the data output circuit.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to a semiconductor device suitably applicable to an integrated circuit for driving a thin-model display device such as a liquid crystal panel or a plasma display panel.","A gate driver and a source or data driver are known as integrated circuits for driving a liquid crystal display panel in which liquid crystal and a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) are combined. The gate driver functions to selectively drive gate lines running horizontally on the display panel in an order from the top. The data driver converts a picture data signal to a voltage to be applied to liquid crystal and applies the voltage to a pixel electrode connected to a selected gate line.","The data driver has a limited number of outputs mountable on a single integrated circuit. For that reason, a plurality of integrated circuit drivers are used to realize the desired resolution of the liquid crystal display panel. For instance, eight integrated circuit drivers are needed to realize the XGA (eXtended Graphics Array) liquid crystal panel consisting of 1024\u00d7768 dots, each of the drivers having 384 outputs (128\u00d73 in RGB), and ten drivers are needed to realize the SXGA (Super eXtended Graphics Array) consisting of 1280\u00d71024 dots.","2. Description of the Related Art",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["102","101","102","102","102","101"]},"Each of the integrated circuit drivers  is equipped with a gate circuit in the input port via which the data signal is taken. The gate circuit analyzes the data signal applied to all the drivers . Then, the gate circuit opens its own gate and latches the data signal if the data signal should be taken in. After the gate latches the data signal, the gate circuit closes the gate. Thus, each of the drivers  is disabled while the other drivers latch the data signal. Thus, it is possible to reduce power consumed in the data driver.","The interconnections from the common data lines DATA to the respective drivers  have crossing points in the parallel style in which the data signal is sent in parallel. A printed-circuit board on which the drivers  are mounted employs through holes used to connect the data lines DATA and input lines extending to the drivers  formed in another layer. The above interconnection is achieved using a multilayer board having four to six layers.","Since the data lines DATA and the clock line CLK are used to drive all the drivers , a drive circuit connected to these lines is needed to have a high drivability. However, considerable EMI arises from the highly driven lines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["103","101","103"]},"The data signal and the clock signal that travels on the data lines DATA and the clock line CLK are sent to the drivers  in turn. The cascaded arrangement does not have crossing points of the data lines DATA that exist in the parallel formation. Thus, the printed-circuit board on which the driver  is mounted may be formed by a reduced number of layers, for example, two layers. This reduces the cost of the printed-circuit board. Further, the circuit that supplies the data signal and the clock signal to the data lines DATA and the clock line CLK is required to drive only the first driver , and may have a reduced drivability. This contributes to reduction in EMI resulting from the data lines DATA and the clock line CLK.","However, it should be noted that the data cascading system differs from the parallel formation in that the data signal passes inside the integrated circuit of the driver and is sent to the next stage. Therefore, the driver is required to continue to input the data signal for the next stage even after the data signal that is to be taken in its own integrated circuit is completely latched.","Taking into consideration the above, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device in which reduced power is consumed in the data cascading system.","The above object is achieved by a semiconductor device capable of capturing a necessary data signal from a data signal that travels therein. The semiconductor device comprises: a data capturing circuit receiving a clock signal and a data signal from an outside of the semiconductor device; a data output circuit sending the clock signal and the data signal captured by the data capturing circuit to the outside; a latch circuit latching the data signal captured by the data capturing circuit; and an internal data transfer blocking circuit blocking the data signal from being transferred to the latch circuit while the data capturing circuit receives the data signal that is not to be latched by the latch circuit.","Also, the above object is achieved by a liquid crystal display panel driver of a data cascading system in which a data signal is input and is cascaded to a next stage. The driver comprises: a data capturing circuit receiving a clock signal and a data signal from an outside of the semiconductor device; a data output circuit sending the clock signal and the data signal captured by the data capturing circuit to the outside; a latch circuit latching the data signal captured by the data capturing circuit; and an internal data transfer blocking circuit blocking the data signal from being transferred to the latch circuit while the data capturing circuit receives the data signal that is not to be latched by the latch circuit.","The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention by way of example.","The outline of the present invention is now described with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The semiconductor device includes a data capturing circuit , a data output circuit , and a latch circuit . The data capturing circuit  captures the clock signal and the data signal from the outside of the semiconductor device. The data output circuit  outputs the captured clock signal and the data signal to the next stage. The latch circuit  latches the data signal captured by the data capturing circuit . Further, the semiconductor device includes a clock transfer blocking circuit , an external data transfer blocking circuit , and an internal data transfer blocking circuit . The clock transfer blocking circuit  blocks outputting of the clock signal to the data output circuit  while the latch circuit  continues to hold the captured data signal. The external data transfer blocking circuit  blocks outputting the data signal to the data output circuit  while the latch circuit  continues to hold the captured data signal. The internal data transfer blocking circuit  blocks outputting of the data signal to the latch circuit while the data signal is being output to the data output circuit .","In operation, the data capturing circuit  captured the clock signal and the data signal serially sent from the outside of the semiconductor device. If the data signal is to be latched by the latch circuit , the clock transfer blocking circuit  and the external data transfer blocking circuit  block outputting the clock signal and the data signal to the data output circuit . The internal data transfer blocking circuit  generates an internal clock signal from the clock signal and operates the latch circuit . The data capturing circuit  latches the data signal thus captured. The data signal thus latched is transferred to an internal circuit and processed, and is then output via the output port.","When the latch circuit  finishes latching of the data signal, the clock transfer blocking circuit  and the external data transfer blocking circuit  are allowed to output the clock signal and the data signal to the data output circuit  to the next stage. In addition, the internal data transfer blocking circuit  stops generating the internal clock signal. Thus, the latch circuit  stops operating while it is not supplied with the internal clock signal.","In the above-mentioned manner, when the data signal to be latched is supplied, the latch circuit  latches the data signal. During that time, the clock transfer blocking circuit  and the external data transfer blocking circuit  inhibit the clock signal and the data signal from being output to the data output circuit . Thus, the semiconductor device of the next stage is stopped due to stoppage in supply of the clock signal, and power consumption can be reduced. In contrast, when the data signal to be latched by any of the stages following to the first stage is supplied, the clock transfer blocking circuit  and the external data transfer blocking circuit  output the clock signal and the data signal to the data output circuit , while the latch circuit  of the first stage is stopped due to stoppage in supply of the clock signal by the internal data transfer blocking circuit . Thus, power consumption in the first stage of semiconductor device can be reduced.","A description will now be given of an embodiment of the present invention in which the semiconductor device is applied to the integrated circuit driver for driving the source lines of the liquid crystal display panel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"An integrated circuit driver  is equipped with a data capturing circuit , a data control circuit  and a data output circuit . The data capturing circuit  captures the clock signal CLK and the data signal DATA from the outside of the driver. The data control circuit  processes the clock signal and the data signal captured by the data capturing circuit . The data output circuit  outputs the clock signal and the data signal processed by the data control circuit  to the next stage of integrated circuit driver. Further, the driver  is equipped with a latch circuit  and a shift register circuit . The latch circuit  latches the data signal from the data control circuit . The shift register circuit  controls the latch circuit  to sequentially latch the data signal serially supplied.","The clock signal CLK and the data signal DATA input to the driver  are sent to the data capturing circuit  and the data control circuit . When the data signal supplied is to be latched in the latch circuit , the data control circuit  buffers the data signal and transfers it to the latch circuit . At that time, the data control circuit  does not transfer the data signal to the data output circuit . After the latch circuit  completely latches the data signal, the data control circuit  stops transferring the data signal to the latch circuit , and controls to transfer the input clock signal and data signal to the data output circuit .","The data signal latched by the latch circuit  is sent to an internal circuit that drives the liquid crystal display panel. The internal circuit has the function of converting the input data signal to an analog output voltage, which is then to the corresponding source line of the liquid crystal display panel via an output buffer.","As described above, the data control circuit  separates the data signal to be sent to the latch circuit  from the data signal to be transferred to the driver of the next stage, so that the data unnecessary for the circuits cannot be transferred. Thus, when the driver  captures the data signal addressed thereto, the drivers located at the following stages stop operating. In contrast, when the data is addressed to any of the following stages, the latch circuit  of the driver  of interest stops operating. Thus, the clock signal and the data signal are not supplied to the unnecessary circuits, so that power consumption can be reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},"The data control circuit  has input terminals via which a data signal DATA and a clock signal CLK are respectively received from the data capturing circuit , and input terminals via which a start signal START and a reset signal RESET are respectively received. The data control circuit  has output terminals via which a data signal DATA and a clock signal CLK are respectively transferred to the data output circuit , an output terminal via which the start signal is transferred to the driver of the next stage, and an output terminal via which the internal clock signal is supplied to the shift register circuit , the latch circuit  and the internal circuit.","The input terminal that receives the data signal DATA is connected to a first input of an AND gate, the output of which is connected to an output terminal via which the data signal DATA is transferred to the data output circuit . The input terminal that receives the clock signal CLK is connected to a first input of the AND gate , the output of which is connected to an output terminal via which the clock signal CLK is transferred. The input terminals that respectively receive the start signal START and the reset signal RESET are connected to the corresponding inputs of a D-type flip-flop . A data input of the D-type flip-flop  is connected to a power supply line, and the non-inverting output thereof is connected to the first inputs of an exclusive-OR gate  and a NAND gate . The output of the exclusive-OR gate  is connected to second inputs of the AND gates  and . The output of the NAND gate  is connected to a first input of an OR gate . A second input of the OR gate  is connected to the input terminal that receives the clock signal CLK, and the output thereof is connected to the output terminal via which the internal clock is supplied and the clock input of a counter . The reset input of the counter  is connected to the input terminal that receives the reset signal RESET, and the output thereof is connected to the input of an inverter  and the output terminal via which the start signal is transferred to the driver of the next stage. The output of the inverter  is connected to second inputs of the exclusive-OR gate  and the NAND gate .","An operation of the data control circuit  thus configured will now be given with reference to , in which signal A appears at the output of the flip-flop , signal B appears at the output of the inverter , signal C appears at the output of the exclusive-OR gate , and signal D appears at the output of the NAND gate . The data signals DATA and DATA are latched when the clock signals CLK and CLK are enabled and are not latched when disabled. Therefore, the operations of the clock signals CLK and CLK are typically illustrated.","The data control circuit  receives the clock signal CLK in advance, and receives the reset signal REST at time t, the flip-flop  and the counter  are cleared. Thus, the signal A that is the output of the flip-flop  switches to the low level, and the signal B, which is the inverted version of the output of the counter  switches to the high level. Thus, the signal C, which is the output of the exclusive-OR gate , switches to the high level, so that the AND gates  and  are opened. Thus, the signal D, which is the output of the NAND gate , is switched to the high level, so that the output of the OR gate , namely, the internal clock signal is fixed at the high level.","Thereafter, the start signal START is input at arbitrary time t. Then, the flip-flop  latches the high level of the power supply, and switches its output to the high level. This state is maintained until the next reset signal RESET is input. The output of the flip-flop  is switched to the high level, and the signal C that is the output of the exclusive-OR gate  switches to the low level because the signal B that is the second input thereof is at the high level. Thus, the two AND gates  and  are closed. Thus, the data signal DATA and the clock signal CLK are blocked from being transferred to the data output circuit . The first input of the NAND gate  is supplied with the high level, and the second input thereof is supplied with the high level, so that the output D switches to the low level. Thus, the OR gate  is opened and the clock signal CLK is output as the internal clock signal. The internal clock signal is supplied to the counter  and is output to the shift register circuit , the latch circuit  and the internal circuit as a reference clock.","Due to supply of the internal clock signal, the data signal DATA serially transferred is sequentially captured in the latch circuit  and is converted into parallel data. The counter  counts the number of cycles of the internal clock signal, and counts the number of items of the data signal DATA latched in the latch circuit . The counter  is set so as to correspond to the number of items of data to be latched in the latch circuit . When the count value becomes equal to the numeral number thus set at time t, the output signal of the counter  switches to the high level. This output signal is inverted by the inverter , and the resultant low-level signal B is output. This switches the output signal C of the exclusive-OR gate  to the high level, so that the two AND gates  and  are opened. Thus, the data signal DATA and the clock signal CLK can be transferred to the data output circuit . Since the second input of the NAND gate  switches to the low level, its output signal D switches to the high level. Thus, the OR gate  is closed so that its output can be fixed at the high level. The internal clock is no longer generated from the clock signal CLK, and the counter , the shift register circuit , the latch circuit  and the internal circuit stop operating. Data cannot be transferred to the latch circuit , and power consumption can be reduced. The high-level signal generated when the counter  counts up is used to generate a pulse of the start signal applied to the driver of the next stage.","Each of the following drivers cascaded stops supplying the data signal and the clock signal to the driver of the next stage when its own driver captures the data signal, and stops operating after the data is completely captured, so that the data signal and the clock signal can be transferred to the driver of the next stage. When the one scanning operation is completed, the driver  of interest starts inputting the reset signal RESET again.","The data control circuit  in the embodiment of the present invention employs the exclusive-OR gate  and the NAND gate  to implement the gate control for the data signal and the clock signal. Alternatively, the gate control for the data signal and the clock signal may be implemented by the NAND gate and the exclusive-OR gate, respectively, or may be performed by a combination of other logical gates.","The counter  is used to set the timings for passage and blocking of the data signal and the clock signal, and may be replaced by a shift register for the same effects.","The above-mentioned embodiment of the present invention is directed to the individual drivers formed of integrated circuits for driving the liquid crystal display panel. However, the present invention is not limited to the above. For example, the present invention can be applied to integrated circuit drivers that drive a thin-model display device such as a plasma display panel or an organic electroluminescence (EL) display panel.","As described above, according to the present invention, there is provided the internal data transfer blocking circuit for blocking the data signal from being transferred to the latch circuit while the data capturing circuit is receiving the data signal that is not to be latched by the latch circuit. It is therefore possible to separate the data signal to be sent to the latch circuit and the data signal to be sent to the data output circuit for the next stage from each other. When the latch circuit finishes capturing the data necessary for its own, the internal data transfer blocking circuit blocks the data signal from being transferred to the internal circuit including the latch circuit. Thus, unnecessary operation can be avoided and power consumption can be reduced.","The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the present invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the extract construction and applications shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be regarded as falling within the scope of the invention in the appended claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
