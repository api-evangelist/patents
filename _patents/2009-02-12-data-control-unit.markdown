In particular, the present invention relates to a data control unit which can detect power supply cutoff and can secure time for sufficient backup process.","Generally, since data currently treated in an electronic circuit disappears with a stop of the current supply resulting from a power failure, battery deterioration, etc., even if it turns ON a power supply again, it cannot resume a process. As a method of solving this, there is a method for backing up stored data to a nonvolatile storage and holding data, when the power supply cutoff is detected. A data hold device and data holding method using a nonvolatile storage device are already disclosed (for example, refer to Patent Literature 1).","In the above-mentioned method, a control device which detects power supply cutoff\/turn-on and outputs a signal for request for backup\/recovering of data is used toward a controlled system device having a function for performing fixation of the data. Since these control devices process after the power supply cutoff detection, it is necessary to secure another power supply. However, using a battery causes cost increase. In order to solve this problem, \u201cDATA RESTORING METHOD\u201d is proposed as the method of processing by utilizing discharging time of a capacitor (for example, refer to Patent Literature 2).","On the other hand, \u201cPROGRAMMABLE CONTROLLER AND DISPOSAL METHOD AT THE TIME OF POWER OFF FOR THE SAME\u201d for monitoring the power supply lines of two systems (for example, AC 100V side and DC 5V side, etc.) is already disclosed (for example, refer to Patent Literature 3). However, the method disclosed in the Patent Literature 3 does not set up power source monitor time, and is targeted for only at the time of a stop of the device.","Citation List",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laying-Open Publication No. 2004-186874","Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Application Laying-Open Publication No. H06-231053","Patent Literature 3: Japanese Patent Application Laying-Open Publication No. H09-081286"]}},"Technical Problem","When utilizing the discharging time of a capacitor and performing the process after power supply cutoff, it is useful from the view point of cost to secure needed processing time using the capacitor of small capacity as much as possible. However, in the above-mentioned method, it is necessary to enlarge capacity of a capacitor in order to secure processing time.","When utilizing the discharging time of a capacitor and performing the process after power supply cutoff, since it is necessary to detect power supply cutoff in the range in which the system can operate, it is necessary to set up the voltage level to detect more highly. Usually, for example, in the power supply of 3.3V, when about 3.1V is detected, it is set to regarding as the power supply cutoff etc.","In this case, when the value of power supply voltage is varied by a noise on a power supply line, etc., a possibility of being regarded as the power supply cutoff is high, a useless backup process occurs as a result, and normal operation is prevented.","The purpose of the invention is to provide a data control unit, which can secure the period for sufficient backup process which can be processed, when detecting the power supply cutoff\/turn-on and outputting the signal for requesting a backup (data restoring\/recovery) of data.","Solution to Problem","According to an aspect of the invention, a data control unit comprises a controlled target circuit which has a nonvolatile storage element and performs a predetermined operation; a power supply voltage converter for converting a primary power supply voltage into a secondary power supply voltage; and a detection\/control unit for detecting variation of a potential of each of the primary power supply voltage and the secondary power supply voltage, and outputting a control signal which transfers data in the controlled target circuit to the nonvolatile storage element toward the controlled target circuit.","According to another aspect of the invention, a data control unit comprises a voltage level detection unit for monitoring a voltage level of a power supply; and a control signal generation unit for outputting a control signal for requesting backup of data of a controlled target circuit in the voltage level detection unit when a voltage level of cutoff\/turn-on of the power supply is detected.","According to another aspect of the invention, a data control unit comprises a nonvolatile CPU including a nonvolatile storage element; a power supply voltage converter for converting a primary power supply voltage into a secondary power supply voltage; a voltage level detection unit which the primary power supply voltage is inputted and outputs a voltage detection signal; a reset signal generation unit which the secondary power supply voltage is inputted and outputs a reset signal; a control signal generation unit which the voltage detection signal and the reset signal are inputted, and outputs a control signal and a clock enable signal to the nonvolatile CPU; a clock generation device for outputting a clock signal; and a logic unit for generating an output signal for operating the nonvolatile CPU based on the clock enable signal and the clock signal.","According to another aspect of the invention, a data control unit comprises a primary power supply line to which a primary power supply voltage is supplied; a secondary power source line in which a secondary power supply voltage is supplied; a voltage converter which is placed between the primary power supply line and the secondary power source line, and converts the primary power supply voltage into the secondary power supply voltage; a voltage level detection unit which is connected to the primary power supply line, and outputs a voltage level detection signal; a reset signal generation unit which is connected to the secondary power source line, and outputs a reset signal; and a control signal generation unit which receives the voltage level detection signal and the reset signal, and outputs a control signal.","Advantageous Effects of Invention","According to the data control unit of the present invention, when applying to the controlled system which has a power source line of two systems, the capacity of the capacitor for performing the voltage securing after the power supply cutoff can be applied small.","Moreover, according to the data control unit according to the present invention, when the value of the power supply voltage is varied by the noise on the power source line, etc., a useless backup process (data restoring\/recovery) can be suppressed.","Various embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Generally, and as is conventional in the representation of the circuit blocks, it will be appreciated that the various drawings are not drawn to scale from one figure to another nor inside a given figure, and in particular that the circuit diagrams are arbitrarily drawn for facilitating the reading of the drawings. In the following descriptions, numerous specific details are set forth such as specific signal values, etc. to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details. In other instances, circuits well-known have been shown in block diagram form in order to not obscure the present invention with unnecessary detail.","The embodiments shown below exemplify an apparatus and a method that are used to implement the technical ideas according to the present invention, and do not limit the technical ideas according to the present invention to those that appear below. These technical ideas, according to the present invention, may receive a variety of modifications that fall within the claims.","As shown in , a theoretic block configuration of a data control unit  according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes: a primary power supply line VDL to which a primary power supply voltage VDD is supplied; a secondary power supply line VDL to which a secondary power supply voltage VDD is supplied; a power supply voltage converter  which is placed between the primary power supply line VDL and the secondary power supply line VDL, and converts the primary power supply voltage VDD into the secondary power supply voltage VDD; and a detection\/control unit  placed between the primary power supply line VDL and the secondary power supply line VDL. As shown in , a controlled target circuit  connected to the secondary power supply line VDL is connected also to the primary power supply line VDL through the detection\/control unit .","At this point, in the case of the data control unit  which uses the power supply of two systems which composes the primary power supply voltage VDD and the secondary power supply voltage VDD, it is assumed that the controlled target circuit  which uses the power supply of the system of the secondary power supply voltage VDD can be operated within the limits of the secondary power supply voltage VDD\u00b110% VDD.","An operation of the data control unit  shown in  is expressed as shown in .\n\n","A period from the time point of the primary power supply voltage VDD becoming the VDD detecting voltage level V and being considered that the primary power supply voltage VDD is the power supply OFF to the time point of the secondary power supply voltage VDD becoming the VDD detecting voltage level V, and the controlled target circuit  is turned to the not-ready state is a period TW which can process backup, such as data restoring\/recovery of the controlled target circuit  after detection of the power supply cutoff.","According to the data control unit according to the first embodiment of the present invention, it becomes possible to detect the power supply cutoff before secondary power supply voltage VDD of the secondary power supply line VDL drops by monitoring that the primary power supply voltage VDD (VDD<VDD) of another system whose power supply voltage is higher than the secondary power supply voltage VDD, and detecting that the primary power supply voltage VDD is the power supply cutoff (power supply OFF) as compared with the VDD detecting voltage level V.

That is, since the power supply cutoff is detected after the secondary power supply voltage VDD drops, the time TW in which the process is possible after the power supply cutoff detection is short.","When monitoring the voltage level of the primary power supply voltage VDD of another system and detecting the power supply cutoff, the voltage level to detect can be set up low as compared with the case where monitor only secondary power supply voltage VDD and the power supply cutoff is detected.","When the primary power supply voltage VDD of another system is monitored, it is considered that the primary power supply voltage VDD is the power supply OFF, and the detection level is 90% of normal operation voltage (VDD) by detecting the primary power supply voltage VDD is power supply cutoff (power supply OFF) as compared with the VDD detecting voltage level V level (90% VDD) as mentioned above.","On the other hand, when monitoring the secondary power supply voltage VDD of the secondary power supply line VDL, as shown in , the detection level is 95% of the normal operation voltage (VDD).","Therefore, as for the data control unit according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the probability which can absorb fluctuation of the power supply becomes high compared with the comparative example.","(Detailed Block Configuration)","As a detailed schematic block configuration is shown in , the data control unit  according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes: a primary power supply line VDL to which a primary power supply voltage VDD is supplied; a secondary power supply line VDL to which a secondary power supply voltage VDD is supplied; a power supply voltage converter  which is placed between the primary power supply line VDL and the secondary power supply line VDL, and converts the primary power supply voltage VDD into the secondary power supply voltage VDD; a voltage level detection unit  which is connected to the primary power supply line VDL, and outputs a voltage level detection signal VDT; a reset signal generation unit  which is connected to the secondary power supply line VDL, and outputs a reset signal RSTn; and a control signal generation unit  which receives the voltage level detection signal VDT from the voltage level detection unit , receives the reset signal RSTn from the reset signal generation unit , and outputs a control signal CLS.","As shown in , a controlled target circuit  is connected to the secondary power supply line VDL, and the controlled target circuit  receives the reset signal RSTn from the reset signal generation unit  in the data control unit , and receives the control signal CLS from the control signal generation unit  in the data control unit .","Moreover, in , capacitors C and C are parasitism capacitors which the primary power supply line VDL and the secondary power supply line VDL have, respectively.","(Operation Timing Chart)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["1","2"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["(a) First of all, in the period of the time t to the time t, a power supply is in OFF state.

In addition, the ferroelectric element driving signals PL and PL applied to the first plate line and the second plate line are all set to \u201cL (low level)\u201d.","Moreover, till the point in time W, since the ferroelectric element write signal E is set to \u201cL\u201d and the pass switch  and the pass switch  are turned OFF, each driver for data write (inverters  and  in the example of ) is invalid.","Moreover, till the point in time W, since the normal operation signal E is set to \u201cH\u201d and the first input terminal () of the multiplexer  and the multiplexer  is selected, the normal loop is formed in the loop structure unit LOOP (the part surrounded by , , , and  in ).","In the volatile storage element , when the clock signal CLK is high-level, the inverter  is turned OFF, the pass switch  is turned ON, the pass switch  is turned ON, and the pass switch  is turned OFF. Therefore, in the loop composed of the inverter  and the inverter , when the clock signal CLK changes from the low level to the high level, the imported data input signal D is held. And, in the loop structure unit (, , , ), the data is passed in that condition and the data output signal Q is outputted from the volatile storage element .","On the other hand, when the clock signal CLK is the low level, in the loop structure unit (, , , ), the data input signal D imported when the clock signal CLK changed from the high level to the low level is held, and the data output signal Q is outputted.","\u2014Data Restoring Operation to Ferroelectric Element\u2014","Next, a data restoring operation to the ferroelectric element will be explained.\n\n","The clock signal CLK is set to \u201cL\u201d and the inverted clock signal CLKB is set to \u201cH\u201d. Therefore, the pass switch  is turned OFF and the pass switch  is turned ON.","In particular, in the period of the time points W to W shown by the time t to the time t, a data write operation from the volatile storage element (VSE)  to the nonvolatile storage elements (NVSE) and is executed. This data write operation is indicated by the arrow A from the volatile data signal VSEDATA to the nonvolatile data signal NVSEDATA.","Moreover, in the time points W to W, the ferroelectric element both ends short circuit signal FRST is set to \u201cL\u201d, the MOS transistors Q, Q, Q, and Qare turned OFF, and it is in the state in which the voltage impression toward the ferroelectric capacitors , , , and is possible.","Moreover, in the time points W to W, the ferroelectric element write signal E is set to \u201cH\u201d, and the pass switch  and the pass switch  are turned ON. Therefore, each driver for data write (inverters  and  in the example of ) is validated.","In addition, in the time points W to W, since the normal operation signal E is set to \u201cH\u201d and the first input terminal () of the multiplexer  and the multiplexer  is selected similarly till then, the normal loop is formed in the loop structure unit LOOP (a part surrounded by , , , and  in ).","Moreover, in the time points W to W, the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the first plate line and the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the second plate line are set to \u201cL\u201d, and the ferroelectric element driving signals PL and PL is set to \u201cH\u201d.

Therefore, in the time points W to W, while the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the first plate line and the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the second plate line are set to \u201cL\u201d, it is in the state where the voltage is not applied between the both terminals of the ferroelectric capacitors and , is in the state where the voltage of negative polarity is applied between the both terminals of the ferroelectric capacitor , and is in the state where the voltage of positive polarity is applied between the both terminals of the ferroelectric capacitor ","On the other hand, in the time points W to W, while the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the first plate line and the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the second plate line are set to \u201cH\u201d, it is in the state where the voltage is not applied between the both terminals of the ferroelectric capacitors and , is in the state where the voltage of positive polarity is applied between the both terminals of the ferroelectric capacitor , and is in the state where the voltage of negative polarity is applied between the both terminals of the ferroelectric capacitor ","Thus, the residual polarization state inside the ferroelectric element is set to either the inverted state\/non-inverted state by applying the pulse voltage toward the first plate line and the second plate line. In addition, between the ferroelectric capacitors and and between the ferroelectric capacitors and , the mutual residual polarization state becomes reverse. Moreover, between the ferroelectric capacitors and and between the ferroelectric capacitors and , the mutual residual polarization state also becomes reverse.\n\n","Moreover, in time point W, since the ferroelectric element write signal E is again set to \u201cL\u201d, and the pass switch  and the pass switch  are turned OFF, each driver for data write (inverters  and  in the example of ) is invalid. In addition, although it is unquestioned about the normal operation signal E, it is set to \u201cL\u201d in the example of .\n\n","The ferroelectric element both ends short circuit signal FRST is maintained by \u201cH\u201d from time point W, the MOS transistors Q, Q, Q, and Qare turned ON, and between each both terminals of the ferroelectric capacitors , , , and are short-circuited. Therefore, since it is in the state where no voltage is applied to the ferroelectric capacitors , , and , even when it is a case where the voltage variation occurs at the time of the power supply cutoff, the voltage which is not aimed to the ferroelectric capacitors , , and is not applied, thereby it becomes possible to avoid data deformation.","\u2014Data Recovery Operation from Ferroelectric Element\u2014","Next, a data recovery operation from the ferroelectric element will be explained.\n\n","In particular, in the period T at the time points R to R, data read-out from the nonvolatile storage elements (NVSE) and to the volatile storage element (VSE)  is executed.","At the time point R, whereas the ferroelectric element both ends short circuit signal FRST is set to \u201cL\u201d, the MOS transistors Q, Q, Q, and Qare turned OFF, and it is turned to the state in which the voltage impression toward the ferroelectric capacitors , , , and is possible, while the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the second plate line is maintained by \u201cL\u201d, the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the first plate line is set to \u201cH\u201d. By impression of such the pulse voltage, the voltage signal corresponding to the residual polarization state in the ferroelectric capacitor appears as the node voltage V and the node voltage V.","More specifically based on the example of , a comparatively low voltage signal (the logic is hereinafter referred to \u201cWL (Weak Low)\u201d) appears as the node voltage V, and a comparatively high voltage signal (the logic is hereinafter referred to \u201cWH (Weak Hi)\u201d) appears as the node voltage V. That is, it becomes a shape which the voltage difference according to the difference of the residual polarization state in the ferroelectric capacitor occurs, between the node voltage V and the node voltage V.","At this time, at the time points R to R, since the normal operation signal E is set to \u201cL\u201d, and the multiplexer  and the second input terminal () of the multiplexer  is selected, the logic of the node voltage V is turns to WL, and the logic of the node voltage V is turns to WH. Moreover, the logic of the node voltage V is turned to WH, and the logic of the node voltage V is turned to WL. Thus, at the time points R to R, the node voltages V to V of each part is still in an unstable state (state where logic inverted in the inverter  and the inverter  is not performed thoroughly, and the output logic does not become \u201cL\u201d\/\u201cH\u201d securely).","At the time point R, since the normal operation signal E is set to \u201cH\u201d and the multiplexer  and the first input terminal () of the multiplexer  is selected, the normal loop is formed in the loop structure unit LOOP. With the change of such a signal path, the output terminal (logic: WH) of the inverter  and the input terminal (logic: WH) of the inverter  are connected, and the output terminal (logic: WL) of the inverter  and the input terminal (logic: WL) of the inverter  are connected. Therefore, mismatching is not occurred in the signal logic (WH\/WL) of each node. Hereinafter, while the normal loop is formed in the loop structure unit LOOP, the inverter  tends to pull up the output logic to \u201cH\u201d in response to the input of the logic WL, and the inverter  tends to pull down the output logic to \u201cL\u201d in response to the input of the logic WH. As a result, the output logic of the inverter  is settled by \u201cL\u201d from the unstable logic WL, and the output logic of the inverter  is settled by \u201cH\u201d from the unstable logic WH.","At the time point R, it becomes a shape where the signal (potential difference of the node voltage V and the node voltage V) read from the ferroelectric capacitor is amplified in the loop structure unit LOOP, with the loop structure unit LOOP being applied into the normal loop, and the held data before power supply cutoff is recovered.","At the time point R, since the ferroelectric element both ends short circuit signal FRST is again set to \u201cH\u201d, the MOS transistors Q, Q, Q, and Qare turned ON, and between each both terminals of the ferroelectric capacitors , , and is short-circuited, it is in the state where no voltage is applied to these ferroelectric capacitors , , and . At this time, each of the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the first plate line and the ferroelectric element driving signal PL applied to the second plate line are set to \u201cL\u201d. Therefore, it recovers to the normal operation state as well as the time point W or before.","According to the third embodiment of the present invention, also in the case where the controlled system is applied to the nonvolatile CPU, when detecting the power supply cutoff\/turn-on and outputting the signal for requesting the backup (data restoring\/recovery) of data, the data control unit which can secure the period for sufficient backup process which can be processed can be provided.","According to the data control unit according to the third embodiment of the present invention, when the controlled system is applied to the nonvolatile CPU which has a power source line of two systems, the capacity of the capacitor for performing voltage securing after the power supply cutoff can be applied small.","Moreover, according to the data control unit according to the third embodiment of the present invention, when the controlled system is applied to the nonvolatile CPU and the value of power supply voltage is varied by the noise on the power source line, etc., a useless backup process (data restoring\/recovery) can be suppressed.","While the present invention is described in accordance with the aforementioned embodiments, it should not be understood that the description and drawings that configure part of this disclosure are to limit the present invention.

Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof.","Since the data control unit of the present invention can detect the voltage level of power supply cutoff\/turn-on and sufficient time for backup (data restoring\/recovery) of the data of the controlled target circuit can be secured, the data control unit of the present invention can be applied to wide fields as the controlled target circuit, such as processors, such as a logic operation circuit, a logic unit, CPU, MPU, and DSP, and a game machine, and a mobile computing device, and becomes advantageous in respect of the data protection at the time of battery exhaustion, etc. in particular in battery powered devices.","Reference Signs List",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0001","num":"0184"},"b":["2","3","10","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0002","num":"0185"},"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0003","num":"0186"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0004","num":"0187"},"b":"14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0005","num":"0188"},"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0006","num":"0189"},"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0007","num":"0190"},"b":"18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0008","num":"0191"},"b":"20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0009","num":"0192"},"b":"32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0010","num":"0193"},"b":["34","341","342"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0011","num":"0194"},"b":"35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0012","num":"0195"},"b":["36","361","362"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0013","num":"0196"},"b":"40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0014","num":"0197"},"b":"42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0015","num":"0198"},"b":"44"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0016","num":"0199"},"b":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0017","num":"0200"},"b":["51","51","52","52"],"i":["a","b","a","b; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0018","num":"0201"},"b":["54","56","58"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0019","num":"0202"},"b":["60","61","64","70","72","74","76","80"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0020","num":"0203"},"b":["62","66","68","78","82"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0021","num":"0204"},"b":["84","86"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0022","num":"0205"},"b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0023","num":"0206"},"b":"104"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0024","num":"0207"},"b":["106","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0025","num":"0208"},"b":"110"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0026","num":"0209"},"b":"112"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0027","num":"0210"},"b":"112","i":"a; "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0028","num":"0211"},"b":"112","i":"b; "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0029","num":"0212"},"b":"114"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0030","num":"0213"},"b":"114","i":"a; "},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014-0031","num":"0214"},"b":"114","i":"b; "},"D; data input signal","Q; data output signal","CLK; clock signal","CLKB; inverted clock signal","E; ferroelectric element write signal","E; normal operation signal","FRST; ferroelectric element both ends short circuit signal","PL, PL; ferroelectric element driving signal","VDD; power supply voltage","VDD; primary power supply voltage","VDD; secondary power supply voltage","VDL; primary power supply line","VDL; secondary power supply line","TW, TW; period","RSTn; reset signal (negative logic)","VDT; voltage level detection signal","CLS; control signal","V; VDD detecting voltage level","V; VDD detecting voltage level","V; reset voltage level","C, C; capacitor","DRCS; data restoring control signal","DSCS; data recovery control signal","ACS; arithmetic control signal"]}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["1","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 13"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
