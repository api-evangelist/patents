title: Electronic book electronic links
abstract: An electronic book selection and delivery system distributes text to subscribers. The system includes the ability to use electronic links as well as a system for creating electronic links between specific electronic books and other electronic files. The links may be used or accessed by a menu system or by operation of a cursor and a select button. The other electronic files could be portions of a specific electronic book, such as a Table of Contents. The other electronic files could also exist external to a specific electronic book. For example, definitions provided in an electronic English-language dictionary could be linked to terms contained in an electronic book. The electronic links may be created by the book publisher or may be subscriber-defined. The links may use standard programming language such as hypertext markup language (HTML). The links may be established through use of a relational database.

No. 08\/160,281, entitled TERMINAL FOR SUGGESTING PROGRAMS OFFERED ON A TELEVISION PROGRAM DELIVERY SYSTEM, filed Dec. 2, 1993, which is now U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,785, dated Aug. 25, 1998, and U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/237,827, filed on even date herewith, entitled ELECTRONIC BOOK HAVING LIBRARY CATALOG MENU AND SEARCHING FEATURES. These applications are incorporated by reference herein.","This invention is directed to an electronic book unit having one or more electronic books. More specifically, the invention is an electronic book with links to other electronic files.","Sparked by the concept of an information superhighway, a revolution will take place in the distribution of books. Not since the introduction of Gutenberg's movable typeset printing has the world stood on the brink of such a revolution in the distribution of text material. The definition of the word \u201cbook\u201d will change drastically in the near future. Due to reasons such as security, convenience, cost, and other technical problems, book and magazine publishers are currently only able to distribute their products in paper form. This invention solves the problems encountered by publishers.","An electronic book selection and delivery system is a new way to distribute electronic books to bookstores, public libraries, schools and consumers. The technological breakthroughs of this invention provide a secure system for both delivering selected electronic books and receiving payments. The system has an unusual combination of features that provides the consumer with an electronic book unit that has a high tech aura while being very practical, portable, and easy to use.","The clear advantage of the system is that it eliminates the distribution of any physical object such as a paper book or computer memory device from any book or text distribution system. The purchase of an electronic book may become a PAY-PER-READ\u2122 event avoiding the overhead, \u201cmiddle-men,\u201d printing costs, and time delay associated with the current book distribution system. Published material and text such as the President's speech, a new law, a court decision on abortion, or O. J. Simpson's testimony can be made immediately available to the consumer at a nominal fee.","The system is a novel combination of new technology involving the television, cable, telephone, and computer industries. It uses high bandwidth data transmissions, strong security measures, sophisticated digital switching, high resolution visual displays, novel controls, and user friendly interface software.","The primary components of the text delivery system are the subsystem for placing the text onto a signal path and the subsystem for receiving and selecting text that was placed on the signal path. The preferred embodiment of the system includes additional components and optional features that enhance the system. The system may be configured for use by bookstores, public libraries, schools and consumers.","The system for consumer use is made up of four subsystems, namely: (1) an operations center, (2) a distribution system, (3) a home subsystem including reception, selection, viewing, transacting and transmission capabilities, and (4) a billing and collection system.","The operations center performs several primary functions: manipulating text data (including receiving, formatting and storing of text data), security encoding of text, cataloging of books, providing a messaging center capability, and performing uplink functions. The system delivers the text from the operations center to consumer homes by inserting text data into an appropriate signal path. The insertion of text is generally performed with an encoder at an uplink site that is within or near the operations center. If the signal path is a video signal path, the system can use several lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI), all the lines of the analog video signal, a digital video signal or unused portions of bandwidth to transmit text data. Using the VBI delivery method, the top ten or twenty book titles may be transmitted with video during normal programming utilizing existing cable, satellite, wireless or broadcast transmission capability without disruption to the subscriber's video reception. Using the entire video signal, thousands of books may be transmitted within just one hour of air time. Nearly any analog or digital video distribution system may be used to deliver the video signal with included text.","The text data may also be transmitted over other low and high speed signal paths including a telephone network (e.g., a public switched telephone network) having a high speed connection such as an asynchronous digital subscriber line (ADSL) connection.","The home subsystem performs four primary functions: connecting to the video distribution system, selecting text, storing text, and transacting through a phone or cable communicating mechanism. The components of the home subsystem may be configured in a variety of hardware configurations. Each function may be performed by a separate component, the components may be integrated, or the capability of existing cable set top converter boxes and televisions may be utilized. Preferably, a connector, library unit and an electronic book unit, or viewer unit, are used. The connector portion of the home subsystem receives the analog video signal and strips or extracts the text from the video. The home library stores the text signal, provides a user friendly software interface to the system and processes the transactions at the consumer home. The viewer provides a screen for viewing text or menus and novel user friendly controls. The viewer may also incorporate all the functionality of the home subsystem.","The viewing device is preferably a portable book shaped viewer which stores one or more electronic books for viewing and provides a screen for interacting with the home library unit. A high resolution LCD display is used to both read the books and to interact with the home library software. An optional phone connector or return-path cable connection initiates the telephone calls and, with the aid of the library, transmits the necessary data to complete the ordering and billing portion of the consumer transaction. The user friendly controls include a bookmark, current book and page turn button. The billing and collection system performs transaction management, authorizations, collections and publisher payments automatically utilizing the telephone system.","The electronic link system provides links to other electronics files. The other electronic files may be associated with a specific electronic book. Examples include book reviews and Internet databases. The other electronic files may be included as part of a specific electronic book. Examples include links between a Table of Contents or an Index, and the text of the specific electronic book. The other electronic files may be stored in the viewer or home library unit. Examples include a dictionary and a foreign-language translation dictionary.","The electronic links may be provided by the content supplier. That is, the operations center, or the book's publisher, may provide additional electronic files, such as the electronic dictionary, and may establish electronic links between the electronic dictionary and the text data of a specific electronic book, for example.","The electronic links may be subscriber-defined. That is, the subscriber may select a portion of the text of a specific electronic book, and generate a link between the portion and another electronic file. For example, the subscriber may generate a link between a Latin phrase in a specific book and its English translation in an electronic English dictionary or an electronic Latin-English translation dictionary.","The electronic link may be created using a standard programming language. For example, the links may be generated using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).","A menu system may be provided to assist the subscriber to navigate through different link options.","The electronic links may also link a viewer with an external device or data base. For example, the electronic link may be used to access an Internet web site.","The primary components of the electronic book selection and delivery system  are an encoder , a video distribution system , a connector , and a text selector  as shown in . The encoder  places textual data on a video signal to form a composite video signal. Although the composite signal may contain only textual data, it usually carries both video and textual data. A variety of equipment and methods may be used to encode text data onto a video signal. The video distribution system  distributes the composite video signal from the single point of the encoder  to multiple locations which have connectors . The connector  receives the digital or analog video signal from the video distribution system  and separates, strips or extracts the text data from the composite video signal. If necessary, the extracted text data is converted into a digital bit stream. Text selector  works in connection with the connector  to select text.","Using a connector  and text selector  combination, various methods of selecting and retrieving desired text from a composite or video signal are possible. Text may be preselected, selected as received or selected after being received and stored. The preferred method is for the connector  to strip or extract all the text from the video signal and have the text selector  screen all the text as received from the connector . The text selector  only stores text in long term or permanent memory if the text passes a screening process described below.","An overview of the electronic book selection and delivery system  is shown in . The delivery system  includes: an operations center  including an uplink site , a video distribution system , a home system  including a video connector , a library , a viewer , and a phone connector , telephone system , an internet web site  and a billing and collection system . Also as shown in , the home system  may include connections to a television  and a personal computer . The television  and the personal computer  may be used to display menu screens, electronic books, electronic files, or any other information associated with the delivery system . In addition, the television  and the personal computer  may provide control function that replicate and supplement those of the viewer .","The operations center  receives textual material from outside sources  such as publishers, newspapers, and on-line services. Alternately, the outside sources may maintain electronic books at the Internet web site . The outside sources  may convert textual and graphical material to digital format, or may contract with another vendor to provide this service. The operations center  may receive the textual and graphical material in various digital formats and may convert the textual material to a standard compressed format for storage. In so doing, the operations center  may create a pool of textual material that is available to be delivered to the home system . The textual material may be grouped by books or titles for easy access.","As used herein, \u201cbook\u201d means textual or graphical information such as contained in any novels, encyclopedias, articles, magazines or manuals. The term \u201ctitle\u201d may represent the actual title assigned by an author to a book, or any other designation indicating a particular group, portion, or category of textual information. The title may refer to a series of related textual information, a grouping of textual information, or a portion of textual data. For example, \u201cLatest Harlequin Romance\u201d, \u201cFour Child Reading Books (Ages 10-12)\u201d, \u201cEncyclopedia \u2018BRITANNICA\u2019\u2122\u201d, \u201cPresident's Speech\u201d, \u201cInstruction Manual\u201d, \u201cSchedule of 4th of July Events\u201d, \u201cPet Handbooks\u201d, \u201cRoe v. Wade\u201d, and \u201cThe Joy of Cooking\u201d are suitable titles. Also, the title may be a graphical symbol or icon. Thus, a picture of a wrench may be a title for a repair book, a picture of a computer a title for a computer book, a graphical symbol of a telephone a title for a telephone book, a drawing of a dagger a title for a mystery book, a picture of a bat and ball a title for a sports book and a picture of tickertape a title for a business book. The term \u201celectronic book\u201d refers to the electronic counterpart to a \u201cbook.\u201d","The operations center  includes an uplink site  for placing the text onto a video signal and sending the composite video signal into a video distribution system. The uplink site  would generally include an encoder  (not shown in ) to encode the text onto a video signal.","Many analog and digital distribution systems , or other telecommunications systems, can be used with the delivery system , such as a cable television distribution system, a broadcast television distribution system, video distributed over telephone systems, distribution from the Internet, direct satellite broadcast distribution systems, and other wired and wireless distribution systems.","The home system  performs five primary functions: (1) connecting with a video distribution system, (2) selecting data, (3) storing data, (4) displaying data, and (5) handling transactions. An important optional function of the home sub-system  is communicating using a telephone communication system . The home system  is made up of primarily four parts: a video connector  or similar type of connector for connecting with the video distribution system , a library unit  for storing and processing, an electronic book, or viewer unit,  for viewing menus and text and a telephone connector  for connecting with a telephone communications system . In an alternate arrangement, the viewer  may include all the functionality of the home system .","The billing and collection system  may be co-located with the operations center  or located remote from the operations center . The billing and collection system  is in communication with the home system  via telephone-type communication systems (for example ). Any of a number of telephone type communication systems, such as, a cellular system, will operate with the billing and collection system . The billing and collection system  records the electronic books or portions of text that are selected or ordered by the subscriber. The collection system will charge a subscriber's credit account or bill the subscriber. In addition, the billing and collection system  will monitor that amount due to publishers or other outside sources  who have provided textual data or other services such as air time to enable the text delivery system  to operate.","When electronic books are provided via the Internet web site , the billing and collecting functions may be incorporated into the Internet web site . For example, a subscriber may pay for an electronic book selection by entering a credit card number into a data field of a page of the Internet web site . In this configuration, a separate billing and collection system may not be required.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["a ","a "],"b":["301","200","301","282","302","250","306","278","254","310","250","250","318","322","326","318","322","326"]},"The billing and collection system \u2032 shown has two sections (, ) one for transaction management, authorizations and publisher payments , and the other for customer service . The customer service section  provides for data entry and access to customer account information. Transaction accounting information  is supplied to credit card companies  by the transaction management section  of the billing and collection system \u2032. The credit card companies  provide billing  to customers either electronically or by mail.","Three methods for communicating between the subscriber base  and the billing and collection system \u2032 are shown: by telephone switching  alone, cellular switching  and telephone switching  combined, and by use of the cable system  and the telephone switching . The system shown supports both one-way  and two-way cable communication  with subscribers. Public libraries and schools  as well as bookstores  may use the delivery system .","Public libraries and schools  would have a modified system to allow the viewer  to be checked-out or borrowed while bookstores  would rent or sell the viewer  and sell the electronic books. The bookstores  as well as the public libraries and schools  may be serviced by cable . Optional direct broadcast systems (DBS)  can also be used with the delivery system . The DBS  may provide the electronic books using digital satellite technology, with the electronic books being received via a backyard satellite antenna, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["b ","b"],"b":["301","282","279","279","282","283","283","279","279"]},"The electronic books may then be transferred via a public switched telephone network (PSTN), for example, direct to a subscriber , a library  and a bookstore . The library  and the bookstore  may also provide electronic books to the subscriber .","I. The Operations Center",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["250","254","250","302","250","402","402","404","406","404","250","410","410","414"]},"The processing at the operations center  is controlled by a processor  which uses an instruction memory . The processor  and instruction memory  may be supplied by a personal computer or mini-computer. To perform the catalog and messaging functions, the operations center  uses a catalog and message memory  and the text generator  if necessary.","The data stream of text, catalog and messages is preferably encoded by security module encoding  prior to being sent to the uplink module . Various encoding techniques may be used by the security encoding module  such as the commercial derivative of NSA's encryption algorithm (Data Encryption System (DES)) and General Instrument's DigiCipher II. Following encoding, the encoded text may be stored in text memory  prior to being sent to the uplink . A first-in-first-out text memory arrangement may be used under the control of the processor . Various types of memory may be used for the text memory  including RAM. The operations center  may use file server technology for the text memory  to catalog and spool electronic books for transmission as is described below.","To transmit textual data (i.e., electronic books), the delivery system  uses high bandwidth transmission techniques such as those defined by the North American Broadcast Teletext Standard (NABTS) and the World System Teletext (WST) standard. Using the WST format (where each line of the Vertical Blanking Interval contains 266 data bits), a four hundred page book, for example, may be transmitted during programming using four lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval at a rate of approximately one book every 1.6 minutes (63,840 bits per second). Alternatively, electronic books may be transmitted over a dedicated channel, which interrupts programming so that 246 lines of video can be used to transmit approximately 2,250 books every hour (3.9 Mbits per second). A teletext type format is the simplest but possibly the slowest text format to use with the delivery system . In either event, an encoder  is utilized at an uplink site  to insert textual data into the analog video signal. In many other respects, the delivery of the textual information is completed using existing cable television plant and equipment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a ","b":["282","250","500","282","250","254","504","254","250","282"]},"As shown in block , files are broken into smaller packets of information. Header information is added to the packets. The bit stream is converted from a serial digital bit stream to an analog bit stream that is compatible with an NTSC video signal. Block  shows the switching of analog data into the video lines of a video signal. The analog data is generally placed either in the VBI or the active video lines. In some instances, it may be preferable to utilize unused portions of bandwidth (such as 5-40 MHZ, 70-75 MHZ, 100-109 MHZ or other guard bands) instead of the video lines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b ","b":["508","512","516","520","532","524","524","532","528","524","536","540","544","544","516","548","552"]},"As an alternative to cable, satellite, broadcast, or other television delivery methods, the public telephone system may be used to transmit books to the subscribers. An average electronic book would take about 7 minutes to transmit over the public telephone system. Using the telephone system, it is not necessary to combine video and text into a composite signal. In most other respects, the operation center would remain similar whether text delivery was by telephone or cable. File server technology (such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875, entitled AUDIO\/VIDEO FILE SERVER INCLUDING DECOMPRESSION\/PLAYBACK MEANS, issued to Mincer, et al., and, U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, entitled FILE SERVER SYSTEM HAVING HIGH-SPEED WRITE EXECUTION, issued to Noveck, et al., incorporated herein by reference) may be used at the operation center with a telephone system text delivery method.","As another alternative to cable, television, and telephone system delivery, the public telephone system may be used to provide access to the Internet, where the Internet web site  may be accessed. Electronic books may be ordered, paid for, and delivered directly from the Internet web site  over the telephone system.","In any delivery system using the telephone system, individual subscribers may increase the electronic book deliver rate by incorporating high speed modems or other communication devices such as an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connector, or by use of an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)","II. The Home System","The hardware configuration for a four component home system  is shown in . shows a hardware configuration for a two component home system. The hardware components may also be incorporated into a single unit that communicates with a terminal in a television delivery system or with a telephone system by use of a modem, for example. The home system  performs several functions, such as receiving data and video transmissions, stripping (or extracting) the data from the video signal, screening and storing the data, providing user friendly interface controls and software, displaying menus and text, processing transactions, initiating telephone calls and transmitting billing data. Various hardware configurations may be utilized to achieve the desired functions of the home system . For example, as shown in , the home system  can be configured to utilize the reception and channel tuning capability of the current installed subscriber base of cable converter boxes and televisions . The home system  can also be designed as an advanced set top terminal converter box with menu generation capability, electronic memory and a telephone modem as described in section V below.","The electronic components which make up the home system  can be arranged in a variety of ways. In the four unit system of the viewer  and library unit  are wired together while the remaining components communicate through RF transceivers . In a simple version of the home system  there are only two units, the library unit  and a viewer . shows a two unit home system  with certain optional features. Finally, all the functionality of the home system  may be incorporated into one electronic book unit, or viewer.","The viewer  is generally equipped with a high resolution viewing area , digital logic (including a key , security , and a microprocessor ), video graphics control and memory , power supply circuitry  (not shown), an optional battery  and an optional RF transceiver . In a two unit arrangement, the library unit  contains the connector function to the video distribution system , connector function to a public telephone communications system, and memory  (which may be removable and portable \u2032). More specifically, the library unit  would include data stripping functions , digital logic , memory storage , power circuitry , optional telephone connections  (including cellular or PCN \u2032), optional battery (not shown), optional tuner module  and an optional RF transceiver . The video connector  and the public telephone system connection , as well as the removable portable memory unit  of the library unit  may be broken out into separate components. (shows a removable portable hard disk memory \u2032 with removable cartridges .) Finally, the home system  may include an attached keyboard  or a wireless keyboard . Both the attached keyboard  and the wireless keyboard  may be used to communicate with the viewer  (not shown) or the library unit .","The wireless keyboard  may communicate via radio frequency (RF) signaling, for example. Therefore, the home system  may have as many as six separate components which communicate with each other. The two, three, four, five or six separate components which make up the home system  can communicate with each other in a variety of ways, including hardwired connection , RF transceiver , and other wireless methods.","RF communications are preferred in the home because they allow separate components to be located throughout the home without restriction. The data communicated between the units is preferably secure data. In addition, the library unit  may provide power to the viewer  through the hardwired connection .","Alternatively, a single unit may perform all of the home system  functions. The single unit should use light-weight materials, including a light-weight battery. A single unit eliminates the need to communicate (externally) between units. The single unit is less expensive and eliminates duplicative processing, memory storage and power circuitry.","To receive and strip the data from the video signal at the consumer's home, either a cable interface device or cable connector  is used. The cable connector device includes a tuner , while the cable interface device makes use of existing tuning equipment in the home. In either configuration, data is stripped from the video signal and stored at the subscriber's location in the library unit . The phone connector , and modem  initiate telephone calls and transmit ordering and billing information to the operations center  or billing and collection system . Alternatively, the phone connector  and the modem  may be used to provide access to the Internet to order and receive electronic books from an Internet web site. A digital connector  is provided to communicate digital information with the set top . The library unit  is the intelligent component of the home system, incorporating the hardware and software necessary to store the text data, generate menus and effect the purchase transactions. In addition to an RF transceiver , the library unit  also includes the necessary jacks and connections to allow the delivery system  to be connected to the viewer . As shown in , the library  communicates the text data (electronic book) to the viewer  in a secure format which requires a key  for decryption. The text is generally only decrypted page by page just before viewing.","a. The Video Connector",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["212","608","612","616","620"]},"The connection to the video distribution system is preferably a cable connector to a cable television delivery system, as shown in . The cable connector includes a data stripper circuit , which accepts video input from either a set top converter, TV or VCR , or an optional tuner block  that receives the CATV signal through the cable connector \u2032. The data stripper circuit  strips data out of the video, and outputs a digital bit stream to the digital logic portion  of the library unit . The data is embedded in the video signal either in the vertical blanking interval or the active video portion in an encrypted and compressed format. The data stripper circuit  can be placed inside the set top converter box , TV, or in the library unit. The data stripper circuit  outputs the digital bit stream to be used by the library digital logic .","The video connector  may also contain a channel tuner module  that can tune to the video channel and provide access to the video that contains the data to be stripped. Using the optional tuner module , a set top converter, VCR, or TV tuner is not needed in the home system. The optional tuner module  would instead receive the CATV signal directly through the cable connector .","b. Library","An embodiment of the library unit  for a two unit home system  is shown in both and . The embodiment shown includes the following optional parts: the video connector , phone connector , RF transceiver , and battery pack  in addition to a removal portable memory \u2032, microprocessor , instruction memory unit , digital logic , and power unit .","The library unit  contains a digital logic section  (not shown in ) which includes the microprocessor , the digital logic  and the instruction memory unit . The microprocessor  is preferably a secure microprocessor such as the Mot SC21 device sold by Motorola. The digital logic section  will receive the serial digital bit stream from the data stripper circuit  and process the data. Error correction will also be performed by the digital logic section  and the data will be checked for proper address. If the address of the data is correct and the library unit  is authorized to receive the data, the data will be transferred to the memory storage unit , \u2032. Authorization to receive the data is provided by the cable headend or another distribution point. An authorization code may be sent in the serial digital bit stream. The digital logic section  will send appropriate text and graphical data to the memory storage unit , \u2032. It transfers this data in a compressed and encrypted format and the data remains stored in a compressed and encrypted format.","i. Memory Storage Unit","The memory storage unit of the library may be a removable portable memory unit \u2032 (as shown in , and ). A variety of options are available for memory storage: a hard disk drive, a hard disk with removable platters, and a CD ROM. Referring to , a hard disk drive unit \u2032 which contains removable platters may also be used. This would provide virtually unlimited library storage capacity. Data (i.e., electronic book files) may be stored in the memory storage unit in a compressed and encrypted format. As is also shown in , the data may also contain a key or unique ID number that matches the ID or key of the viewer . This matching of a unique key or ID number prevents unauthorized transfer of text data from the memory storage unit to an unauthorized viewer. Small memory devices such as smart cards, electronic memory cards or PCMCIA cards (personal computer memory card industry association) may also be used to store the data.","ii. Power Circuitry","As shown in and , the library unit  may accept power from either AC wall power , DC power , or optional battery power . The power circuitry ,  may provide all the voltage necessary from either the battery  or AC unit for the various circuitry in the library. The power circuitry ,  may also provide power to the viewer  through a single data cable when connected to the viewer. The power circuitry ,  will recharge the battery using AC power when in operation. With the optional battery unit  installed, the library unit  becomes a portable unit and can still provide power to the viewer . In order to extend battery life, power conservation measures may be utilized, such as shutting down the memory system when not in use. When the viewer  is being utilized and the library circuitry is not being utilized, virtually all power may be shut down to the library unit .","iii. Connection to the Public Telephone System","The connection to the telephone system may be provided by a modem . Various available modems may be used to perform this function. As shown in , cellular phone or PCN phone connections \u2032 may also be provided. When the home system  is first initialized, the modem may be used to transfer the name and credit card information of the consumer to the billing and collection system . The telephone connection  may be utilized each time an electronic book is purchased by a consumer to complete and record the transaction. The telephone connection  may also be used as a means for receiving the electronic books from the operations center  or from an Internet web site, by-passing the video distribution system . The phone connection  may be a separate unit as shown in ","iv.

The author's preview screen  shows a picture of the author, provides a short biography, and may allow the subscriber to order the author's books. The price for ordering the authors various electronic books may also be shown on the menu. Alternatively, the previews may be provided through an electronic link system, which will be described in detail later.","In addition to free previews, in more sophisticated embodiments, the delivery system  provides the subscriber with an electronic book suggestion feature (see ). This is accomplished using the menu system  and the processor with associated memory located at the viewer , library unit  or at the distribution point ( or ). When necessary, information for the program suggestion feature is sent in the text data of the composite or video signal to the home system . With this feature, books or authors are suggested to a subscriber based upon historical data of the subscriber's previous orders, demographics or mood of the subscriber, other indicators, and\/or by text word searches.","In a book suggestion embodiment, text word searches of preview information (such as book cover descriptions, critics reviews and biographies about the author) and\/or text of books or other titles are performed by the library unit  using databases stored in the library memory . Personalized book or author suggestions are made to the subscriber by obtaining information from the subscriber indicative of general subscriber interests. Subscriber entries are solicited from the subscriber preferably using the electronic book suggestion entries submenu . The system uses these subscriber entries either directly or indirectly to search for books or authors to suggest to the subscriber.","Generally, the book suggestion methods may be categorized into two categories, either responsive methods (which respond to a series of subscriber menu entries), or intelligent methods (which analyze data to suggest an electronic book). Using a responsive or intelligent method, the delivery system  determines a list of suggested titles or authors and creates a second or third level submenu ,  to suggest the titles for subscriber selection.","Responsive methods of suggesting titles include, for example, the use of mood questions, searching for authors, and keyword searching. Using the instruction memory  and menu generation hardware (e.g., ) of the viewer , a series of mood questions can be presented on menus to determine a subscribers interest at a particular time. For this methodology, the operations center's  processor  and instruction memory  assign each title mood indicators (and subindicators) from a group such as light, serious, violent, short, long, dull, exciting, complex, easy-read, young theme, old theme, adventure, romance, drama, fiction, science-fiction, etc. These indicators are sent to the home system  with the text data and are stored in library memory . Based upon the subscriber entries, the processor  associates a set of indicators with the subscriber's request and a set of electronic books with matching indicators are located for suggesting to the subscriber.","Responsive searches for authors or keywords (a search word provided by the subscriber) are generally performed by the library processor  and instruction memory  on data stored in the library memory . For example, a keyword given by the subscriber may be searched for a match in library memory  storing the book reviews, critics and previews databases. Thus, if a subscriber provided an entry of the word \u201csubmarine\u201d on an appropriate submenu, the title \u201cHunt For Red October\u201d may be located by the library processor  using instruction from a routine in the instruction memory .","Intelligent methods of suggesting programs include analyzing personal profile data on the subscriber and\/or historical data about the subscriber such as past books ordered by the subscriber (or buy data). This method is preferred in a book on demand system and can be performed at the distribution point or operations center  by the on-site processor  using subscriber databases stored in memory . The home system  receives the text data including program suggestion information from the distribution point or operations center  and generates the program suggestion submenus , ,  using the same text data receiving  and viewer menu generation hardware (e.g., , ) described above. Software routines and algorithms stored in instruction memories (e.g. , ) are used to analyze historical data and book ordered data to determine a line of books to suggest to the subscriber.","The algorithms for this powerful feature of suggesting books or authors to subscribers are disclosed in great detail in U.S. Pat.

The Billing And Collection System","The billing and collection system  (shown in ) utilizes the latest technology in electronic transaction and telephone switching to track orders, authorize deliveries, bill consumers, and credit publishers automatically. The telephone calls initiated by the phone connector  are received by the billing and collection system  which responds immediately without human intervention by placing the order and charging the consumers credit card account. Data is compiled periodically and publishers  are credited for sales of their books or other text. The billing and collection system  may also connect with subscribers through two-way cable connections, cellular, or other communication means.","It is preferred that the billing and collection system  communicate with the operations center  to track changes in available books and to provide statistical data to the operations center .","IV. Public Library School, and Bookstore System","The electronic book system can be modified to be used at public libraries, schools and bookstores.  shows one possible arrangement of components for a public library, school or bookstore location. The main unit at a public library, school or bookstore is the file server . The file server  is a large electronic memory unit that can store thousands of electronic books. Various electronic storage means may be used in the file servers, such as hard disks, read-write CD ROMs and read-only CD ROMs.","The system comprises five components; the file server , a converter or video connector , a controller , a viewer , and a catalog printer . The software for controlling the system is primarily located in the controller . The converter or video connector  is similar to those described above. In this configuration the controller unit  monitors the data being transferred to the file server  by the converter . The controller  is preferably provided with a viewing screen and several control buttons. When it is necessary to have a larger screen to perform more sophisticated controlling of the system a viewer  may be connected to the controller  and the viewer screen and controls  may be used.","The controller  is only able to download books to public viewers  which are authorized to receive books from the particular file server . For security reasons it is not desirable that the public viewer  have access to more than one file server . In this way, security can be maintained over the text data for books. It is preferred that the public viewer  be limited to receiving one or two electronic books at a time from the controller . When the subscriber of the public viewer  needs a new or additional electronic book, the subscriber returns the viewer  to the school or public library where the subscriber receives a new electronic book from the controller .","In order to track the electronic books that are available on the file server , the titles of the available books may be printed on a catalog printer . The catalog printer is connected to the library controller  and the titles of the electronic books are downloaded to the catalog printer . None of the coded text for any of the electronic books can be printed using the controller  and catalog printer  of this system. In order to maintain security over the data, none of the electronic book data is allowed to be downloaded to the printer . Once a complete printout of available electronic book titles, magazines, or other textual material is complete, a hard copy of the catalog  can be maintained at the file server .","The system shown may also be used at bookstores. The bookstores can rent the public viewer  to customers with the text for one or two electronic books loaded onto the public viewer . The public viewer  may be provided with an automatic timeout sequence. The timeout sequence would erase the textual data for the books after a certain period of time, for example, two weeks. It is expected that after a period of time (perhaps within two weeks) the renter would return the public viewer  to the bookstore and receive additional electronic books for viewing. Using this arrangement, it is also possible for the bookstore to (permanently) sell a viewer  to a regular customer. The customer then returns to the bookstore from time to time to receive textual data for an electronic book which the customer can then store permanently on the customer's own viewer . Various other configurations are possible for bookstores, schools and public libraries using the file server  and public viewer  described.","V. Use of a Set Top Converter","Existing set top converters such as those made by Scientific Atlanta or General Instruments are presently unequipped to handle the delivery system  of the present invention. Although set top converters may be built which include the library functions, hardware modifications are necessary in order to use the delivery system  with existing set top converter technology.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0157"},"figref":["FIGS. 16","FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"i":["a ","b ","a","b"],"b":["16","601","601"]},"A card addition  to a set top converter  is depicted in . The card  shown provides the additional functionality needed to utilize the book selection system with existing set top converter  technology. The card  may be configured to slip inside the frame of a set top terminal and become part of the set top terminal, an advanced set top terminal. The primary functions the card  adds to the set top converter  are the interpreting of data signals, generating of menus, sequencing of menus, and, ultimately, the ability of the subscriber to select an electronic book using either the television or a viewer . The card  also provides a method for a remote location, such as the cable headend, to receive information on electronic books ordered. The electronic books ordered information and control commands may be passed from the cable headend to the card  using telephone lines.","The primary components of the card  are a PC chip CPU , a VGA graphic controller , a video combiner , logic circuitry , NTSC encoder , a receiver , demodulator (not shown), and a dialer \u2032. The card  operates by receiving the data text signal from the cable headend through the coaxial cable. The logic circuitry  of the card  receives data , infrared commands , and synchronization signals (not shown) from the set top converter . Menu selections made by the viewer  on the remote control are received by the set top converter's  IR equipment and passed through to the card . The card  interprets the IR signal and determines the electronic book (or menu) the subscriber has selected. The card  modifies the IR command to send the information to the set top converter . The modified IR command contains the channel information needed by the set top converter . Using the phone line  and dialer \u2032, the card  is able to transmit electronic books ordered information to the cable headend. It is also possible to receive the electronic books over the telephone lines and by-pass the video distribution system. In this embodiment, the telephone system may be used to provide access to an Internet web site to order and receive electronic books.","These commands are passed through the interface linking the set top terminal's microprocessor with the microprocessor of the hardware upgrades. In this way, subscriber inputs, entered through the set top terminal keypad or remote control, can be transferred to any of the hardware upgrades for processing and responses generated therein can then be sent back to the set top terminal for display. In the preferred embodiment the IR commands  are transferred from set top terminal  to hardware upgrade.","Hardware upgrades may include a microprocessor, interactive software, processing circuitry, bubble memory, and a long-term memory device. In addition to these basic components, the hardware upgrade may make use of an additional telephone modem or CD-ROM device.","The information download hardware upgrade  (shown in ) allows the subscriber to download large volumes of information from the operations center  or cable headend using the set top converter . The hardware upgrade  will enable subscribers to download data, such as electronic books and magazines, to local storage. Primarily, the hardware upgrade  is an additional local storage unit  (e.g., hard disk, floppy, optical disk or magnetic cartridge and may include a microprocessor , instruction memory , and a random access memory , as shown in ). Preferably, a small portable viewer  is also provided with the upgrade  to enable downloaded text to be read without the use of a TV.","The downloadable information may be text or graphics supplied by the operations center  or cable headend. With this upgrade, electronic books may be downloaded and read anywhere with the portable viewer . Using this upgrade, books may be downloaded and stored in compressed form for later decompression. The electronic books would be decompressed only at the time of viewing. Important text that the public desires immediate access may made available through this system. Text such as the President's speech, a new law, or a recent abortion decision rendered by the Supreme Court may be made immediately available.","In the preferred embodiment, electronic book ordering information is stored at each set top terminal until it is polled by the cable headend using a polling request message format. An example of a polling request message format consists of six fields, namely: (1) a leading flag at the beginning of the message, (2) an address field, (3) a subscriber region designation, (4) a set top terminal identifier that includes a polling command\/response (or P\/F) bit, (5) an information field, and (6) a trailing flag at the end of the message.

In this way, each addressable set top converter only receives its own data. The data receiver \u2032 may receive set top converter  specific data in the information field of the signal frame described or on a separate data carrier located at a convenient frequency in the incoming spectrum.","The received data includes information regarding electronic books and menus available for selection. The subscriber may enter a series of commands  using a keypad or remote control in order to choose an electronic book or menu. Upon receipt of such commands, the microprocessor  instructs the tuner to tune to the proper frequency of the channel carrying data and subsequently instructs the processing circuitry  to begin descrambling of this data.","Upon selection of the electronic book, the microprocessor  stores any selection information in local memory (not shown) for later data transmission back to the cable headend. The microprocessor  coordinates all CATV signal reception and also interacts with various upstream data transmission components. Typically, the data transmitter  operates in the return frequency band between 5 and 30 MHZ. In an alternative embodiment, the frequency band of 10 to 15 MHZ may be used. Regardless, however, of the frequency band used, the data transmitter  sends information to the cable headend in the information field of the response frame described. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a number of variations and combinations of the above-described set top terminal hardware components may be used to accomplish upstream data transmissions.","VI. Books-On-Demand System","The electronic book system  described may also be configured in a book-on-demand style. shows one example of a configuration for a books-on-demand system. A books-on-demand system requires more powerful two-way communications between the consumer's home, bookstore, school or public library and either the operations center  or a distribution site  such as the cable headend. This type of two-way communication can be provided by the hardware shown in  and described above.","Referring to , in a books-on-demand system, the subscriber selects the electronic book to be download from an available menu of electronic books (see for example and ). The data for menus of available books is usually sent to the subscriber location by the distribution site . After the subscriber's menu selection, information about the subscriber selection (or request) is then communicated to either a distribution point  (such as a cable headend or an Internet web site) or the operations center . Upon receipt of this request, the needed textual and graphical information for the book is spooled and sent to the subscriber. In this manner, books are only sent when requested by the subscriber and are sent immediately upon demand for the book (or text).","In order to support such a books-on-demand system, the text delivery and distribution must be conducted on a strong nodal architectured distribution system, such as, a video-on-demand cable or telephone television system, an Internet web site, or through use of individual telephone access on the public telephone system.","The books-on-demand system allows for a greater selection of electronic books to the subscriber and limits the amount of communicated book data that is unnecessary or unneeded. It also provides the electronic book to the subscriber in a much timelier fashion.","In addition to a stronger distribution system, a books-on-demand system requires a distribution point  to have more sophisticated equipment to access and \u201cspool out\u201d the textual information. This can be accomplished using file server technology  for storing the electronic books and ATM  or telephone-type switching (not shown) to distribute the textual information. The file server  and distribution technology that can be used in configuring such a books-on-demand system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, cited above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0172","num":"0175"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 18"],"i":["a ","a "],"b":["282","1032","1028","1036","1040","1024","1020","1044","1020"]},"The library unit  can be connected to either a basic premium-type service cable system , a near video-on-demand type cable system (or pay-per-view (PPV) ) or a video-on-demand cable system .

To accomplish this, the distribution point  transmits a list of available electronic books through the cable delivery system to the library unit . The library unit  displays the list of available electronic books on a menu or similar format. As described earlier, it is preferred that the library unit  use menus which list categories of available electronic books to form its request from the distribution point . After selecting an electronic book, the library unit  sends a request signal on the two-way communication system  back to the distribution point . This request signal can be handled in two ways. The library unit  either initiates the request or the distribution point  polls the various libraries on to the two-way system .

In order to handle the scheduling and market research, electronic book buy data is received at the operations center  through a multiplexer . Electronic book buy information can be provided by the operation center  to the billing and collection system .","The operations center  is also equipped to insert messages or advertisements into the file server. These messages or advertisements will eventually be received by the subscribers.","The master file server  uses an output multiplexer  and ATM  as well as satellite connections to distribute digital data.

Electronic Book Link System","Electronic book links allow the subscriber to use the electronic book viewer  to traverse pre-defined paths between content in their currently viewed electronic book to related information contained either elsewhere in the electronic book, elsewhere on the viewer , or external to the viewer , including in the library unit  or in a connected Internet web site. These links provide an organized and methodical method for the subscriber to quickly access related topic areas or seek clarification of the currently viewed material.","An electronic book includes first locations, or components, such as words, phrases, sentences, sections of text, paragraphs, pages, chapters, figures, drawings, maps, video clips, and audio clips. Links to second and subsequent locations, or components, contained in the same electronic document or in another related electronic document, file, or database can be associated with each of these first components. First components with underlying links can be highlighted and displayed on the viewer display  or on the connected television  or a personal computer  (see ). First components that have underlying links associated with them may be identified by assigning them a unique identifier. The unique identifier can be a word or phrase, an alpha-numeric value, a coordinate point, or other unique identifier. In an embodiment, each such first location may be assigned an identifying index value.","The use of the index value allows the first components to maintain links with other components, even if the electronic book is altered. For example, a subscriber may use a cut and paste edit feature to move a block of text containing a first component. Cutting and pasting will not affect the status of the first component and its links to other components. Similarly, changing font style or font size will not affect the status of the links.","In the creation of an electronic book, or subsequently, the electronic book may undergo a process that maps identifying index values to each of the first components. These index values can then be accessed by software directives that drive the presentation of alternative or linked material (e.g., material at one of the second locations) once a selection is made. For each electronic book, these index values may be contained in a hidden table that maps the identifying index values of all first components with underlying links to the location of the linked material (the second location). Moreover, each such first component may be linked to one or many linked material locations. That is, the first component may be linked to a second component, a third component and so on. An example of a hidden table is presented below.","As shown in the table, a first location \u201cCezzanne\u201d has an identifying index value . \u201cCezzanne\u201d has three links. A link to a second location is to an art encyclopedia. A link to a third location is to an electronic dictionary that provides a pronunciation guide. A link to a fourth location is to an audio file that plays a short biography of the artist.

A biography of Cezzanne could include a link to the JPEG file showing PorchScene. The JPEG file PorchScene could be one of several still videos of the artist's work. This JPEG file could be linked to an appropriate section of the Cezzanne biography. Then, if the subscriber were viewing the JPEG file for PorchScene, the subscriber could display the link to the biography and, upon activating the link, have displayed that portion of the biography that discusses PorchScene. In this example, the same link is used to display either the JPEG file or text from the biography. The same hidden table can be used with the two electronic files (i.e., the biography and the JPEG file). Alternately, each electronic file may have its own hidden table. In this alternative, the same link may be referenced in each of the hidden tables.","In the discussion above, each first component is linked to one or more other components. However, the other components (i.e., the second and third components, for example) may also be linked together. In addition, other components linked to one first component may be crossed-linked to other components that are linked to a second first component (identifying secondary or tertiary cross-links). For example, the JPEG file of PorchScene referred to in  may be cross-linked to the audio file-biography shown in . Displaying the JPEG file will result in a cross-link being identified that links the JPEG file to the audio file.","The cross-link may be indicated by highlighting, underlining, outlining, using a bold or an italics typeface, using a different font, and using different color text. If the cross-linked material is selected, that material will then be displayed. In the example described above, the JPEG video file that shows the painting PorchScene can be cross-linked with Cezzanne and its identity would be displayed on the viewer . The video file could be displayed full screen or in a picture-in-picture format. The video file could also be displayed on the attached television  or the personal computer  (see ). Finally, the video file could be printed by sending the video data and a print command to a printer  attached to the home unit  or to the personal computer .","In the table previously shown, all the links for a number of electronic books were provided in one hidden table. In an alternate arrangement, many hidden tables may be provided. For example, each electronic book may be provided with a hidden table. In this alternative, the many hidden tables could form a relational database of linked material. As an example, several different electronic medical text books could each be provided with its own hidden table. An electronic general medical encyclopedia could also be provided with a hidden table. Terms that are listed in one of the several medical electronic text books could then be linked, in a relational fashion to the electronic medical encyclopedia. The several electronic medical text books could also be relationally linked to each other, to on-line databases and to other electronic files. For example, an electronic medical text book could be electronically linked to electronic books, databases and other electronic files maintained at a medical school's library.","The hidden table (either for many electronic books, or individually for each electronic book) may be provided by the central provider or distributor as an additional feature that is paid for separately from purchasing an electronic book. The distributor may offer many different levels of service, such as only linking material (components) stored on a viewer, only linking material within a particular electronic book, or linking one or more electronic books to electronic files outside the home system  (e.g., linking an electronic book to a database maintained by the distributor at an Internet web site).","Downloading the most current links table for an electronic book from the operations center  or the Internet web site  refreshes the hidden links table, that is, any new links that have been generated by the operations center , for example, are added to the hidden links table. The current links table may be downloaded in conjunction with downloading a new electronic book. Alternately, the current links table may be provided periodically by the operations center .","Subscribers can create their own links by adding new entries to the hidden links table, using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or other standard programming language or by using a simple graphical user interface, for example. In an embodiment, an on-screen, software-based, menu-driven facility is provided, accessible through the menu system  (see ), that allows the subscriber to select the desired source components to define an underlying link, to select the desired linked components and define their location, and to create the remaining table entries. Creation of table entries can be supported via either an on-screen, simulated keyboard, the attached keyboard , or the remote keyboard  (see ). To ease creation of links, default table entry items may be offered to the subscriber by the menu system  where ever possible. The desired linked components can be accessed and displayed simultaneously with the desired source components via the use of a picture-in-picture window, via a split screen, or via a screen overlay. Alternatively, if the material to be linked is to be created by the subscriber, the subscriber can create a new content file on the viewer  and link directly to components in that newly created file. This allows the subscriber to create customized annotations and notes that are directly associated with the specific components of an electronic book. Text entry into the newly created file is handled via either the on-screen, simulated keyboard, the attached keyboard , or the remote keyboard .","As noted above, links within electronic books may be self-contained in nature, where all the material to be linked to is resident within the same electronic book file. Additionally, links may also be provided between material residing on the viewer . Also, links may be provided to material that currently resides on the home system , if separate from the viewer . Finally, links may be provided to material that must be accessed through a communications network. For example, material that is ordered or downloaded from the operations center  or the Internet web site  may be linked to the electronic book. On screen menus can also be supported on the viewer  in the form of electronic book files, serving as a book or product catalog or service catalog that allows the subscriber to link to the operations center  or the Internet web site  to order additional electronic books or products and services at any time by selecting the desired component from the text.","If the content that is to be linked to is currently not available on the electronic book viewer , the viewer  may prompt the subscriber to decide whether to: 1) retrieve the corresponding material immediately from the home system , the operations center , or the Internet web site ; 2) wait until the next communication opportunity with the home system  or operations center  to retrieve the material; 3) commence direct outside communications with another communications system (e.g., a telephone in a PSTN); or 4) stop.","In one embodiment, the first components on the viewer  are a Table of Contents and List of Figures for a book. Making a selection from the Table of Contents and List of Figures automatically links to and displays the selected page within the electronic book file. In another embodiment, the first components on the viewer  may be an Index of an electronic book. Selecting the desired topic and associated page will cause that page to be displayed on the viewer . In yet another embodiment, the first component is a footnote or endnote. When the footnote is selected, the viewer  provides a display of material that further addresses the reference. In another embodiment, the first component is a word or phrase that has a further definition or clarification associated with it. By selecting the first component, the corresponding dictionary definition, foreign translation, or glossary entry will be displayed on the viewer . The dictionary definition or foreign translation may also be provided via an audio file. In this embodiment, electronic books can be bundled with other standard reference material or alternatively, stand-alone reference material like dictionaries or encyclopedias may be accessed from within multiple electronic book files.","In another embodiment, the first component is a reference to another electronic book altogether. By selecting the first component, the selected book is displayed on the viewer . In another embodiment, on-screen menu buttons will be displayed on the viewer screen  that allow for a quick link to the Table of Contents, Index, glossary, and other key electronic book sections by simply selecting the item on the viewer screen  with the cursor . In yet another embodiment, the selected first component links the subscriber to a book review or series of book reviews, providing additional information to assist in the decision of selecting a new electronic book. In another embodiment, the selected first component is a book title, chapter title, or text in the body of a book that is linked to an audio file that serves as an audio narration of the selection that is played on the viewer . In yet another embodiment, the selected first component links to a video file (JPEG or MPEG) that can be displayed on the viewer screen . Another embodiment is a first component that links to textual annotations and notes that have been created by the subscriber.","One embodiment includes first or subsequent components that are electronic book titles that, when selected, links the subscriber to the operations center  or the Internet web site  to allow for the ordering of the selected book. In a similar embodiment, the selected component consists of a product that, when selected, link the subscriber to the operations center  site or an Internet web site to allow for the ordering of the selected product. Lastly, in another embodiment, the selected component is a topic on which there is a link to an Internet-based discussion group that addresses the topic in more detail.","When a link is provided to link a word or phrase to a foreign language dictionary, the viewer  may display a foreign language selection feature. The subscriber may then indicate which language to use when activating the link. For example, an English word or phrase in the electronic book may be linked to a French, Spanish or German dictionary. The subscriber may specify which of these foreign language dictionaries to link to.","While this invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiment outlined above, it is evident that many alterations, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
