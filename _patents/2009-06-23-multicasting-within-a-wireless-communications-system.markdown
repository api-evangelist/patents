title: Multicasting within a wireless communications system
abstract: An access network determines to transmit multicast messages on a downlink shared channel. The access network receives a multicast registration message and a traffic channel request from at least one access terminal. The access network assigns a traffic channel to the at least one access terminal, and transmits the multicast messages on the downlink shared channel. In another example, the access network can determine a channel type upon which the support a multicast session, can indicate the channel type selection to the at least one access terminal in an announce message and can then transmit the multicast messages for the multicast session on the selected channel type. The at least one access terminal receives the announce message, requests a traffic channel and receives a traffic channel assignment, registers to the multicast session and monitors the downlink shared channel for multicast messages.

Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to multicasting within a wireless communications system and more particularly to multicasting to a plurality of access terminals over a dynamically selected downlink channel within the wireless communications system.","2. Description of the Related Art","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In wireless communication systems, mobile stations, handsets, or access terminals (AT) receive signals from fixed position base stations (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In wireless telecommunication systems, Push-to-talk (PTT) capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a \u201cdispatch\u201d voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures, such as CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc. In a dispatch model, communication between endpoints (ATs) occurs within virtual groups, wherein the voice of one \u201ctalker\u201d is transmitted to one or more \u201clisteners.\u201d A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call, or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group, which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information, such as group name or group identification.","Conventionally, data packets within a wireless communications network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as \u201cunicast\u201d. As mobile communications have increased, the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly, protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A \u201cbroadcast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given cell, served by a given service provider, etc.), while a \u201cmulticast\u201d refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example, the given group of destinations or \u201cmulticast group\u201d may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals (e.g., within a given group, served by a given service provider, etc.). However, it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal, similar to a unicast, or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals (e.g., within a cell or sector), similar to a broadcast.","Broadcasts and\/or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways, such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group, allocating a unique broadcast\/multicast channel (BCH) for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push-to-talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007\/0049314 dated Mar. 1, 2007 and entitled \u201cPush-To-Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x-EVDO Cellular Network\u201d, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007\/0049314, a broadcast channel can be used for push-to-talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques, the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and\/or delay and may degrade system performance.","The 3Generation Partnership Project  (\u201c3GPP2\u201d) defines a broadcast-multicast service (BCMCS) specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly, a version of 3GPP2's BCMCS specification, entitled \u201cCDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast-Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification\u201d, dated Feb. 14, 2006, Version 1.0 C.S0054-A, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","An access network determines to transmit multicast messages on a downlink shared channel. The access network receives a multicast registration message and a traffic channel request from at least one access terminal. The access network assigns a traffic channel to the at least one access terminal, and transmits the multicast messages on the downlink shared channel. In another example, the access network can determine a channel type upon which the support a multicast session, can indicate the channel type selection to the at least one access terminal in an announce message and can then transmit the multicast messages for the multicast session on the selected channel type. The at least one access terminal receives the announce message, requests a traffic channel and receives a traffic channel assignment, registers to the multicast session and monitors the downlink shared channel for multicast messages.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or packet control function (PCF). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless network  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, carrier network , the Internet, and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a base station controller\/packet control function (BSC\/PCF) . The BSC\/PCF  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a packet data service node  (\u201cPDSN\u201d) and the access terminals \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the BSC\/PCF  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC\/PCF  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network  may communicate with the BSC\/PCF  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the BSC\/PCF  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the BSC\/PCF  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple base stations (BS) or modem pool transceivers (MPT) . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the BSC\/PCF  is typically connected to the MPT\/BS by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The MPT\/BS can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals, such as cellular telephone . The MPT\/BS, BSC\/PCF  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC\/PCF  and one or more of the MPT\/BS may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the BSC\/PCF  and the MPT\/BS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["126","126","160","165","170","175","170","160","175","170","102","108","110","112","120","160","160","160","120","122","10","10"]},"Referring to , the broadcast serving node (BSN)  may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN  will be described in greater detail below. The BSN  communicates with the RAN  (e.g., the BSC\/PCF ) via a broadcast (BC) A connection, and with the application server  via the Internet . The BCA connection is used to transfer multicast and\/or broadcast messaging. Accordingly, the application server  sends unicast messaging to the PDSN  via the Internet , and sends multicast messaging to the BSN  via the Internet .","Generally, as will be described in greater detail below, the RAN  transmits multicast messages, received from the BSN  via the BCA connection, over a broadcast channel (BCH) of the air interface  to one or more access terminals .","Referring to , an access terminal , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the carrier network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d ), or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u2019)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the access terminal in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the access terminal  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), WCDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device , MPT\/BS, and BSC\/PCF . The BSC\/PCF  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, and the like, thus allowing the access terminal  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","Below, a description of multicast call-setup for multicast sessions that are carried on a downlink broadcast channel (BCH) in both target and supporting sectors will be described, followed by a description of multicast call-setup for multicast sessions that are carried on a downlink control channel (CCH) in one or more target sectors (e.g., but not necessarily in supporting sectors). As used herein, a target sector is any sector within a wireless communications system, having (or expected to have) at least one multicast group member, that carries a multicast flow for a given multicast session, and a supporting sector is any sector within the wireless communications system, that is not expected to have multicast group members, and also carries the multicast flow (e.g., to enable soft combining in target sectors for high-data rate multicast communications). Target and supporting sector behavior is discussed in more detail within co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/212,505, entitled \u201cMULTICAST COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK\u201d, filed on Sep. 17, 2008, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Accordingly,  illustrates a multicast call-setup process for a multicast session to be carried on a downlink BCH in both target and supporting sectors according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to , in , the application server  (e.g., a Qchat or Push-to-Talk (PTT) server) receives a request to initiate a multicast session (e.g., from a PTT initiator, not shown). In , the application server  forwards an announce message to the RAN  for transmission to access terminals (\u201cmulticast group members\u201d, e.g., ATs  . . . N) that belong to a multicast group of the multicast session. For example, the application server  can forward the announce message to the RAN  through the BSN  via a BCA connection. In , the RAN  receives the announce message over the BCA connection and transmits the announce message to ATs  . . . N over the air interface  (e.g., as a data-over-signaling (DOS) message addressed to the multicast group on the downlink CCH, via a standard paging of ATs  . . . N, etc.). ATs  . . . N receive the announce message and one or more of ATs  . . . N register for the multicast session,  (e.g., by transmitting a BCMCSFlowRegistration message) and send an announce acknowledgment (ACK) that the RAN  forwards to the application server .","Based at least in part on the registrations received from ATs  . . . N, the RAN  determines the initial target and supporting sectors for the multicast session, .  illustrates an example cluster (i.e., a set of target and supporting sectors) that may be formed in  of . As shown,  assumes that ATs A . . . G have registered for the multicast session, that ATs A . . . G reside in target sectors T through T, respectively, and that target sectors T through T are supported by supporting sectors S through S. Cluster origination is described in greater detail within the above-incorporated co-pending patent entitled \u201cMULTICAST COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK\u201d.","The RAN  transmits a scheduling message (e.g., a broadcast overhead message (BOM)) in the target and supporting sectors, . For example, the BOM can include an advertisement of the announced multicast session, along with information instructing ATs  . . . N on how to tune to the multicast session on the downlink BCH (e.g., an interlace-multiplex (IM) pair on the downlink BCH upon which multicast messages for the multicast session are to be transmitted). In a further example, BOMs transmitted in target sectors are configured to suppress subsequent AT registrations (e.g., to reduce traffic, except for when the RAN  wants to confirm the status of the target sectors), and BOMS transmitted in supporting sectors are configured to prompt AT registrations (e.g., so that the RAN  can transition the supporting sector to a target sector, as discussed below in greater detail). Accordingly, the ATs  . . . N that have received the BOM tune to the indicated IM pair and monitor for the multicast messages, .","In , after the application server  receives a first announce ACK for the multicast session, the application server  begins forwarding multicast messages (e.g., multicast media messages, such as video, audio, text, etc.) to the RAN  via the BSN  over the BCA connection for transmission to ATs  . . . N. In , the RAN  receives the multicast messages over the BCA connection and transmits the multicast messages to ATs  . . . N over the air interface  on the BOM-indicated IM pair of the downlink BCH, in both the target and supporting sectors. The ATs  . . . N that have tuned to the BOM-indicated IM pair of the downlink BCH receive and decode the multicast messages, .","As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, transmitting multicast messages in supporting sectors to be used for soft combining for access terminals within the target sectors helps the access terminals decode high-data rate broadcasts or multicasts. However, if the multicast has a relatively low-data rate, the access terminals may not necessarily need to soft combine with the supporting sector transmission to decode the multicast successfully. Also, if multicast group members are not geographically densely located (e.g., there are not a high number of multicast group members in any particular target sector), then the potentially large number of supporting sectors may decrease an overall spectral efficiency because many sectors are transmitting redundant information to reach only a few local multicast group members. Also, as mentioned above, after the RAN  receives a forwarded multicast message for transmission, the RAN  waits for the BOM-indicated IM pair on the downlink BCH for the transmission. Thus, delay or lag is introduced for the duration the RAN  waits before the transmission on a next IM pair.","Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention wherein supporting sectors need not be used and a multicast session is carried on a downlink control channel (CCH) instead of the downlink BCH will now be described in greater detail with respect to . While embodiments of the invention are described below with respect to carrying the multicast session on the downlink CCH, it will be appreciated that, in other embodiments of the invention, the multicast session can be carried on any downlink shared channel, and not necessarily on the downlink CCH.","Accordingly,  illustrates a multicast call-setup process for a multicast session to be carried on a downlink CCH in one or more target sectors according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to , in , the application server  (e.g., a Qchat or Push-to-Talk (PTT) server) receives a request to initiate a multicast session (e.g., from a PTT initiator, not shown). In , the application server  forwards the announce message to the RAN  for transmission to ATs  . . . N that belong to a multicast group of the multicast session. For example, the application server  can forward the announce message to the RAN  through the BSN  via a BCA connection.","In , the RAN  receives the announce message over the BCA connection and determines a channel type (e.g., BCH, CCH, etc.) upon which to support the multicast session associated with the announce message. For example, the RAN  can determine between the downlink CCH and BCH based at least in part upon estimated locations of the multicast group members for the announced multicast session. The locations of the multicast group members can be tracked during operation of the wireless communications system , and the RAN  can maintain a location table that indicates the last known position of the multicast group members based on route update reports received from the multicast group members. Location tracking of access terminals is discussed in more detail within U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/212,929, entitled \u201cTRACKING LOCATIONS OF MULTICAST GROUP MEMBERS WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM\u201d, filed on Sep. 18, 2008, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Accordingly, in this example, the information contained within the location table can be used to decide between multicasting on the downlink BCH or CCH. In an example, if the number of expected multicast group members within a given sector or other geographic partition is above a threshold, then the BCH-based multicasting discussed with respect to  can be implemented (e.g., to reduce a likelihood of overloading the CCH), in an example, and the process may advance to  of . In another example, if the number of expected multicast group members within the given sector or other geographic partition is not above a threshold, then the process may advance to  and the CCH may be used.","As will be appreciated, the CCH has a lower data rate (e.g., 76.8 kbps) then the BCH (e.g., 307.2 kbps). Thus, in another example, the determination of  can be based at least in part upon a data rate associated with the multicast session. For example, if the expected data rate of the multicast session is above a data rate threshold, then the RAN  may select or determine to carry the multicast session on the BCH. Otherwise, if the expected data rate of the multicast session is not above a data rate threshold, then the RAN  may select or determine to carry the multicast session on the CCH. In another example, if channel conditions in one or more target sectors are poor, the CCH may be selected to increase the decoding success rate of the multicast messages. In another example, if the loading on the CCH is above a threshold in one or more target sectors, the RAN  may select the BCH to avoid overloading the CCH.","In another example, any combination of data rate, loading and\/or AT-position criteria may be used to determine the channel type for the multicast transmission. Thus, in an example, if the number of multicast group members within a sector is high but the data rate for the multicast session is relatively low and the loading on the CCH is relatively low, the RAN  may apply a weighting function to the data rate, loading and sector co-location factors to make the determination of .","In yet another example, the determination of  can be RNC or subnet specific, such that different subnets can carry the multicast session on different channel types. For example, if conditions in a first subnet are better for the CCH and conditions in a second subnet are better for the BCH, the RNCs in charge of the different subnets need not synchronize the channel types, and can rather independently determine the best channel type to use on a per-subnet basis.","In another example, the determination of  can be specific to given groups of sectors within a particular subnet. For example, a first group or set of sectors within a subnet can be configured to carry a multicast session on the downlink CCH, while another group of sectors within the same subnet can be configured to support the multicast session on the downlink BCH.","Next, assume that the RAN  determines to transmit the multicast session on the CCH, and the process advances to . In , the RAN  configures the announce message to be transmitted to ATs  . . . N to indicate that the announced multicast session will be carried on the CCH. For example, the RAN can attach a StorageBlobAssignment message to the announce message that includes a flag indicating the CCH for multicast transmission (e.g., in QChat, the StorageBlobAssignment message can contain an access control message (ACM) with a \u2018transmission mode\u2019 field set to indicate CCH or BCH, in an example). After the announce message is configured to indicate the CCH, the configured announce message is transmitted over the air interface ,  (e.g., as a mobile-termination data over signaling (MT-DOS) message, or via a standard paging process). In an example, the transmission of the announce message can be based at least in part on a location table maintained at the RAN  for tracking multicast group member locations (e.g., MT-DOS announce in proximity to the ATs' expected locations, and standard paging announce in other sectors). In other words, an initial or estimated target sector set can be established to more efficiently announce the multicast session.","ATs  . . . N receive the configured announce message, , and interpret the announce message as indicating a multicast transmission on the downlink CCH. In , each of ATs  . . . N that are interested in participating in the announced multicast session requests a traffic channel (TCH), , from the RAN  (e.g., by sending a ConnectionRequest message). The RAN  assigns the requested TCHs to each requesting AT, . As will be described in greater detail below, the TCH assigned to ATs  . . . N allows the RAN  to track the precise locations of ATs  . . . N (e.g., during handoffs between sectors) based on messaging from ATs  . . . N that is transmitted on a reverse link portion of the assigned TCH. Generally, because ATs  . . . N are not necessarily floor-holders of the multicast session, the assigned reverse TCH is not used by ATs  . . . N to send media for transmission to other multicast group members. However, ATs  . . . N may transmit keep-alive packets so the RAN  does not de-allocate the TCHs, and also RouteUpdate messages for location tracking and\/or to request handoff. On the other hand, because the TCH may be assigned for purposes of location tracking and\/or handoff, it will be appreciated that the downlink portion of the TCH (F-TCH) may be substantially silent, unless the AT is engaged in a separate unicast session using the assigned TCH. Thus, the F-TCH does not necessarily consume forward link resources (i.e., timeslots), while the R-TCH permits location tracking of the AT by the RAN .","Next, in , after the TCH(s) are assigned in , one or more of ATs  . . . N register for the multicast session,  (e.g., by transmitting a BCMCSFlowRegistration message) and also send an announce acknowledgment (ACK) that the RAN  forwards to the application server . It will be appreciated that once one or more of ATs  . . . N attempt to register to the announced multicast session, the RAN  becomes aware that one or more listeners are in the sector and can begin forwarding multicast traffic on the downlink CCH, as described below with respect to  and . Also, in an example, the scheduling message or BOM need not be transmitted because each AT monitors the CCH continuously, and each AT need not be informed of a designated IM pair on the BCH because the multicast session is being carried on the CCH. In an example, while shown separately in , the TCH request of  can be bundled with the announce ACK and multicast registration requests of  in at least one embodiment.","Based at least in part on the registrations received from ATs  . . . N, the RAN  determines the target sectors for the multicast session, . In an example, step  may generate an initial set of target sectors for the multicast session. In another example, step  may update an already existing set of target sectors that are determined prior to transmission of the announce message in  (e.g., based on a location table for tracking the multicast group members, as discussed above). As will be appreciated, the RAN  need not determine supporting sectors for the multicast session because the low data-rate of the CCH is easier for ATs to decode, and as such the overhead associated with the supporting sectors can be reduced or omitted because soft combining may not be necessary.  illustrates an example cluster (i.e., with only target sectors) that may be formed in  of . As shown,  assumes that ATs A . . . G have registered for the multicast session, and that ATs A . . . G reside in target sectors T through T. In contrast to , in the example of , the supporting sectors S through S need not be included in the cluster.","In , after the application server  receives a first announce ACK for the multicast session, the application server  begins forwarding multicast messages (e.g., multicast media messages, such as video, audio, text, etc.) to the RAN  via the BSN  over the BCA connection for transmission to one or more of ATs  . . . N. In , the RAN  receives the multicast messages over the BCA connection and schedules the multicast messages on the CCH. For example, the multicast messages can be scheduled on an asynchronous control channel capsule of a given control channel cycle of the CCH, as will now be described in greater detail with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5C","FIG. 5C"],"b":["124","124","124","256","66","130","194"]},"In an example, using the asynchronous control channel capsule can result in a reduction of the delay associated with BCH transmissions, which wait for the BOM-indicated IM pair, because the asynchronous control channel capsules occur more frequently (e.g., on each non synchronous or sub-synchronous control channel capsule). Next, in , the RAN  transmits the multicast messages to ATs  . . . N over the air interface  on the CCH as scheduled in , in each target sector. The ATs  . . . N monitor the CCH and received the multicast transmissions, .","As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the number of supporting sectors can be reduced and\/or eliminated by using the CCH to carry the multicast flow for given multicast session. Below, cluster adjustments (e.g., the addition or removal of target\/supporting sectors) are described with respect to both supporting sector and non-supporting sector embodiments of the invention.","Processes for adjusting clusters within a combination target and supporting sector scenario are described in detail within co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/212,505, entitled \u201cMULTICAST COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK\u201d, filed on Sep. 17, 2008, which has already been incorporated by reference above in its entirety. Accordingly, a brief description of cluster adjustments within a combination target and supporting sector scenario will be provided below to provide context, followed by a description of a CCH-based multicast within a target-sector only embodiment.","In an example, assume that the process of  is executed and that the cluster of  is active. With these assumptions, after  of , the process advances to  of . In , AT G moves from target sector T to adjacent supporting sector S, as shown in . As is characteristic of a supporting sector, the RAN  is already transmitting the multicast flow on the downlink BCH in supporting sector S, . In , the RAN  transmits a periodic BOM, and AT G tunes to the BOM-indicated IM pair on the downlink BCH in sector S, . The BOM transmitted is also configured (e.g., RFDB=\u20181\u2019) to prompt AT G to respond with a registration message (e.g., a BCMCSFlowRegistration message), and AT G transmits the registration message, . The RAN  receives the registration message and updates the cluster based on the knowledge that AT G has left sector T and entered sector S, . In particular, target sector T is removed from the set of target sectors (i.e., because no multicast group members are present), supporting sector S is transitioned to a target sector T and added to the set of target sectors, and the set of supporting sectors is updated to account for the loss of target sector T and addition of target sector T.  illustrates an example of the updated cluster of . In , the RAN  transmits the multicast messages for the multicast session on the downlink BCH within the target and supporting sectors of the updated cluster.","In an example, assume that the process of  is executed and that the cluster of  is active. With these assumptions, after  of , the process advances to  of . In , AT G begins moving from target sector T to an adjacent non-target sector, as shown in . Because the adjacent sector is a non-target sector and this example cluster does not include supporting sectors, AT G's new cluster is not transmitting multicast messages for the multicast session. In , the RAN  continues to transmit multicast messages within sector T. In , AT G is handed off from target sector T to the new sector, which is triggered by the RouteUpdate message sent by AT G on the assigned R-TCH to the RAN . Handoff (e.g., soft handoff, hard handoff, etc.) is well known in the art. Here, the inter-sector handoff of AT G is possible because AT G was previously assigned a TCH in  of . Because the RAN  has handed off AT G from target sector T to the new sector, the RAN  is aware of AT G's new location, and can update a location table that tracks AT locations with AT G's new position. Further, the RAN  updates the cluster by ceasing transmission of multicast messages in target sector T and transitioning target sector T to a non-target sector (e.g., because no multicast group members remain in T after AT G leaves), , and transitions AT G's new sector to target sector T.  illustrates an example of the updated cluster of \/ of . In , the RAN  transmits the multicast messages for the multicast session on the downlink CCH within the target sectors of the updated cluster, which are monitored by AT G, .","In another embodiment of the invention, while not described above, it will be appreciated that the determining step of  of  may also be performed during an active multicast session, and not merely in advance of an announce message transmission. Thus, the RAN  can toggle a multicast session back and forth between the BCH and CCH based on current operating parameters, in an example (e.g., if the number of multicast group members rises above or falls below a threshold during operation, etc.). Because there is overhead associated with this type of dynamic switching, the thresholds associated with an active-session channel switch may be different than the thresholds associated with  of .","Accordingly, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the embodiments described above, a spectral efficiency of the wireless communications system  can be increased by transmitting a multicast flow primarily within target sectors on a low data-rate shared downlink channel, such as the downlink CCH. This allows fewer (e.g., zero) supporting sectors to be deployed (e.g., within a particular subnet, within all subnets carrying the session, within a subnet portion constituting a given group of sectors within the subnet while another subnet portion of the same subnet includes supporting sectors, etc.) that carry the multicast flow even though no target ATs are present within the supporting sectors. As discussed above, the RAN  can track the locations of ATs based on the assigned TCH, such that ATs do not drop the multicast session when handing off to sectors that are not yet carrying the multicast flow.","Above, embodiments are generally directed to supporting a multicast session in one or more subnets on a downlink control channel instead of a downlink broadcast channel. In general, the downlink control channel transmits at a lower-data rate than the downlink broadcast channel, and as such soft-combining is less likely to be necessary as compared to the downlink broadcast channel. However, in another embodiment, the multicast session can be supported on a downlink shared channel that can correspond to either the control channel or the broadcast channel. In this embodiment, if the downlink shared channel corresponds to the downlink broadcast channel, soft-combining via one or more supporting sectors can still be omitted so long as a traffic channel is assigned to each non-floorholder AT for location tracking during the multicast session (e.g., so the session is not dropped if an AT hands off to a non-target sector). While an error rate of the downlink BCH embodiment without supporting sectors may be higher than an error rate if the session were supported on the downlink CCH, it will also be appreciated that carrying the session on the downlink BCH reduces the load on the downlink CCH.","Those of skill in the art will appreciate that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques.
