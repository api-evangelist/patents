{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to full face masks for divers. More particularly, this invention is to a display system for a diving full face mask allowing simultaneous monitoring of information from multiple sources in a single location in the lower right corner of the facemask regardless of environmental conditions and physical constraints on the diver without obstructing normal field of view.","A diver's safety is always of paramount consideration as tasks are performed. However, divers (or firefighters and others working in extremely hazardous environments) cannot unduly add encumbrances that might overly compromise their operational effectiveness. A number of acceptable devices and procedures have been developed to improve safety. For obvious reasons, a diver must be able to monitor certain critical information such as the diver's depth, the status of the life-support breathing apparatus, and the total time of the dive under all environmental and operational conditions. Typically, the diver is supplied with separate timers, pressure gauges and\/or other displays for monitoring critical information.","These timers\/gauges\/displays are either wrist-worn devices or are mounted on a console that the diver wears or carries, or are placed on or attached to the diver's face mask. The problem with wrist-worn or console-type devices is that the diver may not be able to see or access the devices because of tasks involving the use of both of the diver's hands (e.g., operating cameras, sonar devices, navigation or other data logging device, etc.). Further, if visibility in the water is poor, the diver may not even be able to see the device. For these reasons, critical dive information should be made available at the diver's facemask.","Other considerations affecting safety and operational effectiveness are directly related to a diver's ability to communicate in real-time with topside personnel or other scuba divers. These communication issues have been addressed in the design disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,029,092 showing a separately sealed lower section that is conducive to mounting of a microphone for electronically transmitted speech or for transmitting speech diaphragmatically through the water to another diver in close proximity. The full face mask (FFM) of '092 also appeals to divers who spend extended periods underwater where there is a need for full facial coverage for warmth, protection and comfort. However, a capability for presenting readable data inside the '092 face mask is not provided for.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an integrated display capability for wearer's of FFMs to improve safety and operational effectiveness without unduly encumbering them.","An object of the invention is to increase the safety and operational effectiveness of a diver wearing a FFM by adding an integrated display capability to an existing FFM design.","Another object of the invention is to enhance proven capabilities of a FFM with proven capabilities of a face mask covering only part of the facial features to provide a further improved FFM having increased safety and operational effectiveness.","Another object is to provide a FFM system that allows a diver having an exhausted source of air or an emergency requiring ditching of the breathing apparatus, to quickly switch over to an alternate breathing system or swim freely without removing an upper portion of the FFM and consequent loss of vision due to the flooding of the viewing area.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is to a full face mask (FFM) system. A main body frame has a continuous, closed sidewall portion extending around and compliantly resting on bony contours around facial features of a diver wearing the FFM. A lateral partition extends along and rests on bony contours of a wearer's face from one side to another side of the sidewall portion between the areas of a wearer's nose and upper lip. The lateral partition separates the main body frame into a lower mask section having a lower cavity and an upper mask section having an upper cavity. The lower mask section has a round, grooved, pod-adapter opening adjacent to the lower cavity, and at least one lens defining a forward field of view is supported by the frame. Components are integrated in the frame that include a radio frequency (RF) antenna for receiving RF signals indicative of dive information, a display directly viewable in a peripheral vision area outside of the forward field of view, a controller coupled to the RF antenna and the display for processing the RF signals in accordance with predetermined programming options to generate outputs, and an input device is coupled to the controller for selecting the predetermined programming options, and passing the outputs to the display for visual display. A compliant sidewall elastomeric sealing flange is connected to and along the continuous, closed sidewall portion and extends and compliantly rests on bony contours around facial features of a wearer of the FFM system. A compliant lateral lip is connected to and along the lateral partition and extends and rests on bony contours of a wearer's face from one side to another side of the sidewall portion between the areas of a wearer's rose and upper lip. The lateral partition and the compliant lateral lip separate the main body frame into the lower mask section having the lower cavity and the upper mask section having the upper cavity. The components integrated in the frame also include a replaceable power source for supplying power to all others of the components, and a depth sensor is coupled to the controller. The controller includes timing means actuated by the input device, and the timing means generates a signal indicative of an amount of time lapsed since its actuation. The indicative signal is displayed visually on the display. The display includes a stacked combination of an optical system for providing even magnification across the display, a liquid crystal display positioned adjacent the optical system for magnification, and a light source for backlighting the liquid crystal display. The liquid crystal display can be either a transmissive or transflective liquid crystal display or other display technologies including, but not limited to electro-luminescent displays, and light emitting diode (LED) displays, and the display is located in a lower portion of the peripheral vision area.","Referring to , improve full face mask (FFM) system  of the invention gives a diver full face coverage for warmth, protection, and comfort and additionally provides an integrated display of multiple-source information. This display of information is in an area of peripheral vision that is outside of the diver's forward field of view ,  that is necessary for performance of tasks.","FFM system  has a main body frame  that can be made from a flexible neoprene material having sufficient thickness and stiffness to extend in a rugged, continuous, closed sidewall portion  having a compliant sidewall elastomeric sealing flange  connected to and along said continuous, closed sidewall portion  that extends and compliantly rests on the bony contours around the facial features of a wearer of FFM system . Continuous sidewall portion  and compliant sidewall elastomeric sealing flange  extend along areas of bony contours of the face forward of both ears, upward and across the bony contours of the temples, across the top part of the bony contours of the forehead, and downward across the bony contours of the jaw (and teeth) that extend between the chin and the mouth.","Main body frame  also has a lateral partition  provided with a compliant lateral lip  connected to and along lateral partition  that extends and rests on the bony contours of the face from one side to another side of sidewall portion  and compliant sidewall elastomeric sealing flange  of main body frame  between the areas of the nose and upper lip of a wearer of FFM system . Lateral partition , parts of continuous closed sidewall portion , and a nose bridge portion  at the bridge of the nose of a wearer of FFM system  support a flexible nose pocket  and a sealed interface for transparent lenses . Lenses  extend across a forward field of view for a wearer of FFM system . An elastic spider  has rubber straps ,  connected to main body frame  that can be adjusted to snugly pull sidewall portion  and compliant sidewall elastomeric sealing flange  and lateral partition  and compliant lateral lip  snugly against the facial features. This snug fitting maintains a sealed interface between FFM system  and the facial features of a wearer of FFM system .","Lateral partition  and compliant lip  of main body frame  separate the inside of FFM system  into a lower mask section  having a lower cavity  and an upper mask section  having an upper cavity . Lower mask section  has a round, grooved, pod-adapter opening  adjacent to lower cavity  that encompasses the area of the mouth of a wearer of FFM system . Grooved pod-adapter opening  allows the inserted attachment of a mating, correspondingly grooved fitting, or pod  (schematically shown being separated from pod-adapter opening  in ) that extends to or accommodates parts of different life support systems  such as open-circuit and closed circuit breathing apparatuses . Pod-adapter opening  can be left open (as shown in ) without any breathing system attached if the wearer of FFM system  is free-diving or swimming with no breathing apparatus other than a snorkel which can extend through it. When needed, pod  that is connected to a breathing apparatus ,  can be easily and quickly attached and sealed to or removed from adapter opening  of FFM system  on the surface or underwater.","Referring also to , pod-adapter opening  can be coupled to a breathing apparatus  such as described with respect to a prior art face mask  of the dive mask with integrated monitoring system of U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,115. Breathing apparatus  can have an interconnected sensor  that senses critical information about breathing apparatus . For example, if breathing apparatus  included a compressed air tank (or other pressurized gas flask as used in re-breather types of breathing apparatus), sensor  can be a pressure sensor. Sensor  provides its output to an RF transmitter  that transmits an RF signal  that can be detected by RF antenna  in mask . As is known in the art, short range transmission of RF signals through the water is possible. Since dive mask  and RF transmitter  will be close to one another in essentially fixed relative positions, RF communications will be reliable.","Closed sidewall portion  and lateral partition  of upper mask section  and upper cavity  of FFM system  incorporate and integrate the integrated wireless, self-contained display components of face mask  that can be transmissive or transflective liquid crystal displays, electro-luminescent displays or light-emitting diode (LED) displays. Including self-contained integrated display components of face mask  in and on closed sidewall portion  and lateral partition  of upper mask section  and upper cavity  of FFM system  allows the diver-wearer of FFM system  to simultaneously monitor information from multiple sources in a single peripheral location at monitor  in the lower right corner of upper cavity  of upper section  of FFM system . This simultaneous monitoring in FFM system  goes on regardless of environmental conditions and physical constraints upon the diver-wearer and without obstructing the forward field of view. In addition, the diver is able to perform tasks without distraction and consequent greater proficiency because of the ongoing benefits of warmth, comfort and protection across the entire facial area that the full face mask of FFM system  provides.","Closed sidewall portion  and lateral partition  of upper mask section  and upper cavity  of FFM system  incorporates and integrates the self-contained integrated display components of dive mask  of U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,115 as schematically shown in . RF signals detected by RF antenna  are passed through conductors  to a pre-programmed controller  (e.g., microprocessor) that controls the display of dive information. Selection of various programming options are made by the diver via a single control switch  (e.g., a conventional push\u2014push switch). The use of a single user control simplifies use of the present invention as the various functions implemented by control switch  are embedded in the programming of controller . Control switch  is coupled to controller  via conductors .","While information about the diver's breathing apparatus  is critical, it is not the only relevant information that a diver wants to monitor. Specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, controller  includes a timer or a software-controlled timer function that can be activated by the diver at the start of a dive to track the amount of time (\u201cbottom time\u201d) that a diver is underwater.","In addition to breathing apparatus information and bottom time, a diver needs to monitor his depth in the water. This is accomplished in the present invention, by a depth sensor  in frame  (and sidewall portion  of frame  of FFM system ). Water at depth pressure comes into contact with depth sensor  via a port  formed in frame . The signal indicative of depth generated by depth sensor  is passed to controller  via conductors .","Thus, controller  collects or generates signals indicative of the relevant status of breathing apparatus , bottom time of the dive, and depth of the diver. These signals are appropriately processed for use by display  in a manner well understood in the art. Display signals generated by controller  are passed over conductors  to directly viewable display . The term \u201cdirectly-viewable\u201d is intended to mean that the diver will view the display itself as opposed to a reflection thereof thereby eliminating display alignment issues.","Display  also is integrated in frame  (and sidewall portion  and lateral portion  of frame  of FFM system ) and is completely protected in upper cavity  of upper mask section  of FFM system . Display  is located in a peripheral vision area of the diver. Preferably, display  is located in a lower portion of the diver's peripheral vision area as illustrated in , , , and . However, regardless of its position in the diver's peripheral vision area, display  is always positioned outside field of view  through lens  (and lenses  of FFM system ). Thus, the diver will have an unobstructed forward field of view.","Display  provides a sufficiently large virtual display image  that will be easily discerned by a user's having a wide range of visual acuity and in virtually all lighting conditions. In the illustrated embodiment, display  has a liquid crystal display (LCD) element  that receives display signals from controller . LCD element  can be either a transmissive LCD or a transflective LCD, electro-luminescent displays, light-emitting diode (LED) displays or other displays. LCD element  is back lit by a light source  that can be powered via controller . An optical system  that can be multi-element or three-element lens  (or triplet lens as it is known), or a free prism, hybrid prism, curved mirror or fresnel-type lens system is positioned adjacent (i.e., in. front of) LCD element  to provide even magnification across it. That is, optical system  magnifies all portions of LCD element  evenly so that no portion is distorted relative to another portion.","With dive mask  (and FFM system ) configured as described above, virtual image  will be directly-viewable by the diver as illustrated in FIG. . Virtual image  includes a display of diver depth at , bottom time of the diver at , and pressure of the diver's air\/gas tank at . While each type of dive information is displayed in a numeric format, the dive information could also be displayed in alternative or additional formats such as a graphical format. Each type of dive information could be flashed on and off (as controlled by controller ) if they are indicative of dangerous situations.","Power for each component embedded in frame  (and sidewall portion  and lateral portion  of frame  of FFM system ) can be self-contained on each component. More typically, power for each component requiring power can be provided by a replaceable power source such as a battery  housed in a compartment  formed in frame . Compartment  is accessible\/sealable via a plug . Power is transferred to the necessary components via conductors  and the other conductors referred to above.","Protection not only provides full face coverage to assure protection, warmth, and comfort during prolonged diving operations in the harsh marine environment, but additionally gives a diver a directly viewable display of critical dive information without obstructing any portion of the diver's field of view through the viewing dive mask lens. The information is reliably brought from well protected components via a single control button and is visible regardless of surrounding water visibility.","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of FFM system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. FFM system  could have integrated displays of different inputs from other computers and other navigational systems. However, care must be taken when making such modifications since the bulk of such displays might compromise or otherwise interfere with a diver's forward field of view.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. FFM system  of the invention provides for warmth, protection and comfort for extensive diving operations and simultaneously gives a real-time display of pertinent information from multiple sources outside of the forward field of view to enable safe performance of tasks for successful completion of a mission. Therefore, FFM system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
