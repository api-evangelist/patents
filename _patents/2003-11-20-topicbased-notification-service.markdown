{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of software notifications. In particular, embodiments of this invention relate to implementing an extensible messaging framework in a web service for managing notifications.","Up-to-date information in a wide variety of areas is very important to many people. These people often desire to be alerted to time-sensitive events and information. Content providers generate content for notifications, which are then delivered to one or more user electronically (e.g., via electronic mail). For example, a news organization may provide notification content relating stock prices, breaking news, weather conditions, traffic conditions, etc. A user's expressed interest to receive electronic notifications for a particular class of content is generally called a notification subscription. Such subscriptions often are made between the end user and the content provider that sends the notifications. Event-driven notifications of this type are often referred to as alerts.","A notification generally consists of two parts: (i) the routing\/address information; and (ii) the message payload. However, different alert notification systems can have different protocols particular to the individual system. Information or content providers must then tailor the notifications to the particular systems, which complicates the delivery and management of notifications.","Accordingly, a generalized notification mechanism that allows for greater interoperability across different systems is desired to address one or more of these and other disadvantages.","Embodiments of the invention overcome one or more deficiencies in the prior art by providing a programming model for managing notification-based applications. In one embodiment, the invention implements protocols based on an extensible messaging framework such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). As such, the protocols allow for greater interoperability across disparate systems. The design of these protocols has many provisions for extensibility, which allows notification-based applications in many domains to employ the protocols as the programming model.","A web-based notifications service embodying aspects of the invention serves as an intermediary between content providers and end users. In this instance, the protocols are geared towards synchronizing the subscriptions information of the intermediary along with the publisher or content provider. Embodiments of the invention facilitate and maintain a topic web service to gather minimal information necessary to enable intelligent routing rules rather than requiring that information needed for advanced routing is present in each notification packet sent by the content provider.","The invention relieves content providers of the need to tailor the notifications to the particular systems. In one embodiment, the invention provides a generalized notification mechanism (e.g., encompassed by a SOAP-based notification protocol) that allows for greater interoperability across different systems. Content providers can more easily program their systems to send notifications.","Moreover, the features of the present invention described herein are less laborious and easier to implement than currently available techniques as well as being economically feasible and commercially practical.","Briefly described, a method embodying aspects of the invention manages notifications in a web-based notifications system. The notifications system is configured to provide notifications containing content provided by a content provider to a user via a data communication network. The content relates to one or more topics. The method includes implementing a web service responsive to requests structured according to an extensible messaging framework. The method also includes receiving, at the web service, a request from a content provider. The request specifies a selected notification management function and is structured according to the messaging framework. The method also includes extracting request information, including at least a content provider identifier and a topic identifier, from the request and executing the selected notification management function based on the extracted request information.","In another embodiment, a method for managing notifications in a web-based notifications system includes implementing a web service responsive to requests structured according to an extensible messaging framework. The method also includes receiving, at the web service, a request structured according to the messaging framework from a content provider and extracting request information from the request. The request information includes at least a content provider identifier, a topic identifier, and a user identifier. The method further includes querying a user profile store for profile information corresponding to the user identifier, determining routing information for a notification based on the profile information, and creating a subscription corresponding to the topic identifier, the user identifier, and the routing path for the notification.","Yet another embodiment of the invention relates to a web-based system for processing notifications. The notifications contain content relating to one or more topics provided by one or more content providers. The system includes a computing device to implement a web service responsive to requests structured according to an extensible messaging framework. The computing device is coupled to a data communication network and configured to receive a request from a content provider via the data communication network. The request from the content provider specifies a selected notification management function. The request is structured according to the messaging framework. The system also includes a computer-readable medium that stores computer-executable instructions to be executed on the computing device to extract request information from the request. The information includes a content provider identifier and a topic identifier associated with the request and to perform the selected notification management function based on the extracted request information. The system further includes a memory associated with the computing device to store the extracted request information in connection with the selected notification management function.","Another web-based system for processing notifications embodying aspects of the invention includes a computing device to implement a web service responsive to requests structured according to an extensible messaging framework. The computing device is coupled to a data communication network and configured to receive a request from a content provider via the data communication network. The system also includes a user profile store that is associated with the computing device to store information representative of a plurality of users and a computer-readable medium that stores computer-executable instructions to be executed on the computing device to extract request information from the request. The request information includes a content provider identifier, a topic identifier, and a user identifier associated with the request, to query the user profile store for profile information corresponding to the user identifier, to determine routing information for a notification based on the profile information, and to create a subscription corresponding to the topic identifier, the user identifier, and the routing path for the notification.","In yet another embodiment, a web service that manages notifications in a web-based notifications system includes a computing device to implement the web service. The computing device is coupled to the data communication network and configured to receive requests structured according to an extensible messaging framework from one or more content providers via the data communication network. The service also includes a computer-readable medium that stores computer-executable instructions to be executed on the computing device to provide the extensible messaging framework to the content providers to create requests. The requests when structured according to the messaging framework each specify a selected notification management function and contain request information. The request information for each of the requests includes a content provider identifier and a topic identifier associated therewith. The computer-readable medium further stores computer-executable instructions to be executed on the computing device to extract the request information for each of the requests and to perform the selected notification management function based on the extracted request information.","Computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions for performing methods of notifications management embody further aspects of the invention.","Alternatively, the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring first to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates one example of a suitable alerts service environment in which the invention may be implemented.  illustrates the communication flow between a content provider  such as content provider # through content provider #N, an alerts service , and a user device  such as user device # through user device #M. The content provider , the alerts service , and the user device  are coupled to a data communication network such as described with reference to . The content provider  sends a notification to the alerts service  for delivery to one or more of the user devices . Alerts service  accesses a subscription database  storing subscription information and user routing preferences  to determine which user device(s)  should receive the alert. Alerts service  then delivers the alert to the determined user device . In one example, the alerts service environment is referred to as a notification pipeline and database (NPD).","The alerts service  illustrated in  transcends any one particular transport medium for delivery of notifications. The invention may use any of a plurality of transport mediums such as electronic mail, instant messaging, mobile short-message-service messaging, wireless communications, etc.","Aspects of the present invention provide a generalized notification mechanism for greater interoperability across different systems. In general, a web-based notifications system (i.e., alerts service ) operating in accordance with embodiments of the invention sends a message, often referred to as a notification or alert, to a subscribing user via his or her specified user device . The message contains event-driven information from content provider  relevant to a topic of interest to which the user has signed up. In other words, a subscriber is a user or other entity that expresses an interest in a topic and receives notifications related to the topic from content provider . In one embodiment, the combination of a subscriber and a topic constitutes a subscription. Exemplary topics for alerts include news, weather, sports, finance, traffic, hobbies, bargains, and so forth. As described above, the notifications are usually driven by events such as breaking news, changes in weather or traffic conditions, auction outbid notices, etc.","The invention includes protocols for notification-based applications, which center on generating and sending notifications. In one embodiment, a set of protocols for this class of applications is based on Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). The protocols provide the basis for a programming model for managing notification-based applications and serve as building blocks for a platform for such applications. Inasmuch as the protocols are based on SOAP, for example, they allow for greater interoperability across disparate systems. The design of these protocols has many provisions for extensibility, which allows notification-based applications in many domains to employ the messaging framework of the invention as the programming model.","Notification-based applications may also be referred to as publisher\/subscriber applications. In this instance, subscribers create subscriptions for the topics of interest to them. When an event occurs, a notification-based application matches the topic corresponding to the event with the subscriptions. The notification system then sends the appropriate notification to each subscriber for the matches.","Referring further to , alerts service  processes notification or alert information received via the data communication network from content provider . An interface component  receives a data packet representing the notification and alerts service  stores it in a memory area. In one example, the memory area includes a plurality of databases (not shown). The notification includes routing information and content. One or more computing devices associated with the alerts service  enable delivery of the stored notification to one or more subscribing users based on the routing information.","The user device  may be a computer such as computer  described with reference to . Further, user device  may execute an alerts application (e.g., an instant messaging application) that receives and processes alerts. The alerts application executes on user device , which may also be, for example, a cellular telephone (e.g., a Smartphone device), a pager, or a handheld computing device (e.g., a personal digital assistant or a Pocket PC device). Moreover, user device  may include any of the above exemplary devices enabled with an information service such as a SMART PERSONAL OBJECTS TECHNOLOGY (SPOT) brand of telecommunication service and\/or devices. The information service comprises a computing infrastructure (e.g., a telecommunication service) for sending data and information to personal and home devices via computer networks, wireless networks and the Internet. User devices  that may be enabled with the information service include, but are not limited to, the following devices: clocks, alarm clocks, radios incorporating clocks, watches, billfolds, wallets, checkbook and passbook wallets, purses, pens, metal key rings, key holders, wireless devices, computer hardware (e.g., peripherals, monitors, and displays), electronic calendar devices, and refrigerator magnets. Further, magazines, books, and user manuals relating to computers, computer programs, personal information devices and wireless communications may also incorporate the information service. The information service enables billions of devices to communicate with each other. For example, customers select the type of information and services they want to receive on the enabled devices via a configuration web page. This content is subsequently beamed to and displayed on the device. Information available to users on devices using the information service includes personal messages, calendar updates, and customized news, weather, financial and sports information.","In one embodiment, the system shown in  is implemented as a web service and functionality associated with alerts service  may be distributed among one or more computers. For example, alerts service  may include a distributed processing system. When content provider  posts an alert such as in the form of an extensible markup language (XML) document, alerts service  parses the alert and validates the packet. Alerts service  may also asynchronously process the alert by queuing it into an NPD queue or other memory area. The NPD queue represents an internal queue of work items that are acted upon by any one of the multiple threads in the thread pool, but only one thread processes the item at any given time. The alerts service  then retrieves information regarding, for example, a specific broadcast list specified in the alert, such as the number of members or users, and an internal 32-bit row identifier from a database such as a broadcast list database (BLDB) (see ).","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of alerts service . One or more computer-readable media have computer-executable instructions for performing the method illustrated in . The invention software or other computer-executable instructions implements a web service responsive to requests structured according to an extensible messaging framework (e.g., SOAP) at . In the SOAP example, content provider  sends a SOAP request to the web service (e.g., an alerts topic management web service as shown in ). At , the web service receives a request from content provider . In this embodiment, the request specifies a selected notification management function, such as creation or deletion of a topic or enumeration of topics. The request is structured according to the messaging framework. At , request information is extracted from the request. The request information in the illustrated embodiment includes at least a content provider identifier CPID and a topic identifier TopicID. Other request information may include a topic name and a topic language. Alerts service  extracts the CPID from, for example, a header of the SOAP request. As part of the generalized messaging framework, embodiments of the invention create a response object in response to the received request. The response object is also structured according to the messaging framework and contains information regarding the success or failure of the request. Computer-executable instructions at  call for executing the selected notification management function (e.g., creation or deletion of a topic) based on the extracted request information.","Referring now to , alerts service  hosts an implementation of protocols for notification-based applications as web services to which content providers  may program using the protocols. In the illustrated embodiment, alerts service  includes a topic management web service  and a subscription management web service . The topic management web service  implements a topic management protocol to allow the creation, updating, and enumeration of topics. Similarly, the subscription management web service  implements a subscription management protocol according to embodiments of the invention to allow content provider  to create, delete, or update subscriptions. Although described separately, the topic management service  and the subscription management service  may be implemented together. Another component of alerts service , namely, a notification web service , allows content providers  to submit notifications for delivery to subscribers.","A web services component (e.g., an ASP.NET web service), for example, embodies subscription management web service . The subscription management service  of  manipulates a user profile database (UPDB) or user profile store (UPS)  with, for example, a .NET dynamic-link library (DLL) assembly , to obtain information regarding the subscribing user based on the notification information received from content provider . The web service  further accesses the UPDB or UPS , a BLDB , a profile service , an instant messaging service , and the notification web service . As an example, MSN\u00ae Messenger or .NET\u2122 Messenger provides a suitable instant messaging service  for use in connection with the invention. Also, a multi-site user authentication system, such as Microsoft\u00ae.NET\u2122 Passport single sign-in service, is suitable for the profile service .","According to embodiments of the invention, messaging service  is one of the endpoints to which alerts service  can deliver notifications. When a user signs up to receive notifications through alerts service , the user specifies whether he or she wants to receive notifications through messaging service . When the user signs up to receive notifications with respect to some content change (e.g., stock\/news), he or she specifies information about how the notifications are to be routed. In this instance, the routing information is captured in UPS  as well. When notification web service  receives a notification that needs to be delivered, it looks up the routing information in UPS  and delivers it the appropriate endpoints. Messaging service  is one exemplary endpoint.","In one embodiment of the invention, subscription information in alerts service  is stored in the user profile service and in a broadcast list database (e.g., UPDB\/UPS  and BLDB , respectively). When an affiliated content provider  sends a subscription management request to subscription management web service , the web service implementation queries\/updates the information in UPDB\/UPS  and BLDB .","Advantageously, the web service implemented by alerts service  takes the load off of subscription mirroring because the SOAP variant is less user interface intensive. Based on this service profile, one embodiment of the invention calls for a deployment scenario of running the web service on the web front ends. A throttling mechanism may be implemented in the web service to assert that the web service does not bog down the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4C","b":["304","304","102","104"]},"In general,  illustrates an exemplary sign-in process for content provider . Following sign-in, the invention in this embodiment executes a web service boundary for subscription management. Depending on the outcome of the boundary function, alerts service  collects consent, routing, and confirmation information.  is an exemplary flow diagram illustrating aspects of the subscription management web service boundary. In general, alerts service  implements the web service responsive to requests structured according to an extensible messaging framework such as SOAP. Alerts service  queries a user profile store (e.g., UPS ) for profile information corresponding to a user identifier (e.g., PUID) extracted from the request. Based on profile information returned by the query, alerts service  further determines routing information for the notification. In turn, the invention in this example performs a selected management function such as creating a subscription for each TopicID in the request message.  provides additional detail regarding smart routing to determine the routing information for the notification.

The topic ID will be extracted from the SOAP message. Each request is handled differently depending on the type of request. During the processing of the request, an object derived from Response is built. This is then sent back to content provider  as the response. The different requests are described below:","CreateTopic: 1) Content provider  makes a CreateTopic request to the alerts topic management service ; 2) alerts topic management service  extracts request information, namely, CPID from HTTP header; 3) service  creates a CreateTopicResponse object; and 4) for each <Topic> in <CreateTopic>; 4) alerts topic management service  extracts the topic information (e.g., topic ID, name, and language from SOAP message); Set information (from 4a) in npdBroadcastList object, c) Create topic, and d) Call CreateTopicResponse.GetResponsePart( ) with the results; and 5) Return CreateTopicResponse back to content provider .","UpdateTopic: 1) Content provider  makes an UpdateTopic request to the alerts topic management service ; 2) alerts topic management service  extracts request information, a) CPID from HTTP header; and 3) creates an UpdateTopicResponse object. 4) For each <To> in <Target>, service  extracts the topic information, including Topic ID, from the SOAP message, and calls UpdateTopicResponse.GetResponsePart( ) with the results; and 5) returns UpdateTopicResponse back to content provider .","In one embodiment of the invention, alerts service  provides performance monitoring with one or more of the following counters:","CreateTopic Requests In Total","CreateTopic Requests Per Second","Successful CreateTopic Requests In Total","Successful CreateTopic Requests Per Second","Failed CreateTopic Requests In Total","Failed CreateTopic Requests Per Second","UpdateTopic Requests In Total","UpdateTopic Requests Per Second","Successful UpdateTopic Requests In Total","Successful UpdateTopic Requests Per Second","Failed UpdateTopic Requests In Total","Failed UpdateTopic Requests Per Second","EnumerateTopic Requests In Total","EnumerateTopic Requests Per Second","Successful EnumerateTopic Requests In Total","Successful EnumerateTopic Requests Per Second","Failed EnumerateTopic Requests In Total","Failed EnumerateTopic Requests Per Second",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["70","70","104"]},"In the illustrated embodiments, computer  has one or more processors or processing units  and a system memory .

The first and second modules include, in one example, application programming interfaces (APIs) such as provided by operating systems, component object model (COM) interfaces (e.g., for peer-to-peer application communication), and extensible markup language metadata interchange format (XMI) interfaces (e.g., for communication between web services).","The interface may be a tightly coupled, synchronous implementation such as in Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE), COM, or distributed COM (DCOM) examples. Alternatively or in addition, the interface may be a loosely coupled, asynchronous implementation such as in a web service (e.g., using the simple object access protocol). In general, the interface includes any combination of the following characteristics: tightly coupled, loosely coupled, synchronous, and asynchronous. Further, the interface may conform to a standard protocol, a proprietary protocol, or any combination of standard and proprietary protocols.","The interfaces described herein may all be part of a single interface or may be implemented as separate interfaces or any combination therein. The interfaces may execute locally or remotely to provide functionality. Further, the interfaces may include additional or less functionality than illustrated or described herein.","In operation, computer  executes computer-executable instructions such as those described herein for implementing a web service responsive to requests structured according to an extensible messaging framework (e.g., SOAP). The web service implemented by computer  receives a request from content provider  that specifies a selected notification management function. In this instance, the request is structured according to the messaging framework. Computer  further executes computer-executable instructions to extract request information, including at least a content provider identifier and a topic identifier, from the request and to execute the selected notification management function based on the extracted request information.","The order of execution or performance of the methods illustrated and described herein is not essential, unless otherwise specified. That is, elements of the methods may be performed in any order, unless otherwise specified, and that the methods may include more or less elements than those disclosed herein.","Information in this document, including uniform resource locator and other Internet web site references, is subject to change without notice.
