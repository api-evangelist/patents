"],"p":["The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC07-05ID14517, between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Battelle Energy Alliance.","The present invention relates to the in-situ monitoring of Uranium and Plutonium content of an alloy, preferably a nuclear fuel during processing or reprocessing.","As new methods of processing nuclear fuel or reprocessing spent nuclear fuel are researched and eventually deployed, new methods for monitoring the fuel composition during a particular process are required for safety and to reduce proliferation risks. For example, during the reprocessing of spent fuel using a pyroprocessing technology, whereby the Pu in the spent fuel is collected together with some U as ingots of Uranium-Plutonium (U\u2014Pu) alloy. The Pu content within the alloy may vary over a wide range depending on process conditions. Nevertheless, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other regulating entities need to verify the amount of Uranium and Plutonium precisely and in a timely manner. In addition, the real-time information of Pu content in the U\u2014Pu alloy ingots is important for special nuclear material control and accountability. Current methods require sample extraction followed by expensive and time consuming analysis, which are plagued by sampling and analytical errors.","Therefore, there is a need for the real-time, in-situ monitoring of Plutonium content in U\u2014Pu Alloys.","A method and device for the real-time, in-situ monitoring of Plutonium content in U\u2014Pu Alloys comprising providing a crucible. The crucible has an interior non-reactive to a metallic U\u2014Pu alloy within said interior of said crucible. The U\u2014Pu alloy comprises metallic uranium and plutonium. The U\u2014Pu alloy is heated to a liquid in an inert or reducing atmosphere. The heated U\u2014Pu alloy is then cooled to a solid in an inert or reducing atmosphere. As the U\u2014Pu alloy is cooled, the temperature of the U\u2014Pu alloy is monitored. A solidification temperature signature is determined from the monitored temperature of the U\u2014Pu alloy during the step of cooling. The amount of Uranium and the amount of Plutonium in the U\u2014Pu alloy is then determined from the determined solidification temperature signature.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","3","5","7","9","11"]},"The crucible is any container having a melting point greater than the melting point of the U\u2014Pu alloy. The crucible has an interior made of materials that are non-reactive to the metallic U\u2014Pu alloy. A material non-reactive to the U\u2014Pu alloy is any material that does not chemically, electrochemically or in any way which would degrade, change or reduce the amount of the material of the crucible. Preferably, the crucible is made of or has an interior surface comprising yttria. Preferably, the crucible comprises a configuration of one or more thermocouples that allows for continuous monitoring of temperature during the heating and cooling steps on the U\u2014Pu alloy. The thermocouples are positioned to detect changes in alloy phases by either placement of the thermocouples in the melt or near the melt on the crucible. If placement of the thermocouples is on the crucible, then a correlation with the melt thermocouples is inferred, preferably accounting for any thermal losses and delays in heat transfer.","The U\u2014Pu alloy comprises metallic uranium and plutonium, but may contain other elements, for example further comprising various amounts of Am, Np, Cm or combinations thereof, as well as other elements as impurities. The U\u2014Pu alloy forms a continuous liquid-solid phase. The U\u2014Pu alloy preferably consists essentially of Pu and U, whereby the amount of impurities does not significantly alter the thermal characteristic of the alloy. In one embodiment, various amounts of Am, Np, and Cm are present which may add an amount of uncertainty to the Pu and U measurements.","The steps of heating and cooling are performed in an inert or reducing atmosphere to prevent the oxidation of the U\u2014Pu Alloy. For example, if the atmosphere was air, the U\u2014Pu Alloy would be oxidized to uranium oxide and plutonium oxide, which would not only substantially increase the melting temperature, but would also change the composite melting point of the molten material. An inert atmosphere is any atmosphere which will not oxidize or reduce the U\u2014Pu alloy within the normal operating temperatures of the U\u2014Pu alloy. The normal operating temperatures of the U\u2014Pu alloy are the various temperatures that the U\u2014Pu alloy are normally exposed to within the crucible, preferably at least the melting and solidification temperatures of the U\u2014Pu alloy, more preferably at least the melting and solidification temperatures of the U\u2014Pu alloy plus or minus 50 degrees Celsius.","The U\u2014Pu alloy is heated to a liquid in an inert or reducing atmosphere. As the exact melting point of the U\u2014Pu alloy is not known, the alloy is preferably heated to a temperature at least 50 degrees Celsius greater than the melting point of pure uranium (1135\u00b0 C.). The crucible is heated using one or more heat sources, preferably Joule heating, one or more burners, or a combination thereof. The heat sources are thermally connected to the U\u2014Pu alloy, preferably through the crucible. Thermally connected means any connection which is capable of transferring heat, preferably a metal. In a preferred embodiment, one or more heat sources are placed around the crucible, which is thermally conductive.","The U\u2014Pu alloy is cooled to a solid. Preferably, the U\u2014Pu alloy is cooled by at least a partial removal from one or more heat sources, or an application of one or more cooling sources. A cooling source is any means of cooling the U\u2014Pu alloy, preferably one or more heat exchangers, heat pump, or combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the cooling source is the natural dissipation of heat from the system while the heat sources are disabled. The cooling sources are thermally connected to the U\u2014Pu alloy, preferably through the crucible. Thermally connected means any connection which is capable of transferring heat, preferably a metal. In a preferred embodiment, one or more cooling sources are placed around the crucible, which is thermally conductive.","During the step of cooling the heated U\u2014Pu alloy to a solid, the temperature of the U\u2014Pu alloy is monitored. Preferably, the temperature of the U\u2014Pu alloy is measured directly using one or more temperature sensors, preferably one or more thermocouples. Preferably, one or more temperature sensors are used, preferably comprising one or more thermocouples. In other embodiments, one or more lasers, ultrasound detectors, thermometers, or other temperature measurements devices are employed to monitor the temperature of the U\u2014Pu alloy directly or indirectly. In one embedment, one or more heat conductors are used to transfer heat to the one or more temperature sensor, thereby monitoring the temperature indirectly. In this embodiment, thermal losses between the U\u2014Pu alloy  and the temperature sensors are accounted for in the subsequent calculations. This embodiment may be preferred depending on the heat of the U\u2014Pu alloy and the maximum temperature of the temperate sensor.","As shown in , the monitoring of the U\u2014Pu Alloy occurs during the cooling of the U\u2014Pu alloy. Although, the monitoring of the temperature may be preferred in various embodiments for reasons other than the determination of the amount of U and Pu in the U\u2014Pu alloy, it is not necessary for the determination of the amount of U and Pu in the U\u2014Pu alloy.","A solidification temperature signature is determined from the temperature of the U\u2014Pu alloy during said step of cooling. The temperature signature is data relating to the temperature of the U\u2014Pu alloy over time recorded during at least one cooling step. Preferably, a plurality of the heating and cooling steps is performed to generate data including a plurality of cooling to solidification cycles, thereby increasing accuracy.","Once the solidification temperature is determined, the amount of Uranium and the amount of Plutonium in the U\u2014Pu alloy is determined from the determined solidification temperature signature. As the U\u2014Pu alloy will produce heat in its transition from a liquid to solid phases, the solidification signature can be used to determine the concentration of U and the concentration of Pu.","In one embodiment, a table of solidification temperatures and corresponding amount of Uranium and the amount of Plutonium is used. In this embodiment, the amount of Uranium and the amount of Plutonium that are in the U\u2014Pu alloy are determined using known analysis techniques, preferably inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).","In a preferred embodiment, one or more inflections or plateaus in the solidification signature, produced by heat given off by the liquid to solid phase transition differing from the normal heat dissipation of the system, is used to determine the amount of Uranium and the amount of Plutonium in the U\u2014Pu alloy. Preferably, in this embodiment, the first derivative of the temperature versus time of the U\u2014Pu alloy during cooling is used to determine the inflection point, thereby determining the solidification temperature. Preferably, the solidification temperature is the temperature at which the first derivative of the temperature of the U\u2014Pu alloy shows significant deviations, more preferably the temperature at which the first derivative is closest to zero. It should be noted that depending on the frequency of data, the first derivative may not actually hit zero.","Once the solidification temperature is determined, the U\u2014Pu phase diagram is used to determine the amount of Uranium and the amount of Plutonium in the U\u2014Pu alloy. Preferably, the phase diagrams are produced experimentally or from existing sources such as from ASM International, for example Pu\u2014U phase Diagram (1994 Okamoto Y.); ASM International Diagram 905419, Am\u2014Pu\u2014U Phase Diagram (1993 Ogawa T.)

Alloy Comp., 213\/214 (1994), 372 describes an investigation of the Pu\u2014U phase diagram, as well as a phase diagram generation technique that could be used for other alloys, hereby fully incorporated by reference.","Preferably, any calculations, lookups or other steps necessary to determine the amount of Uranium and the amount of Plutonium in the U\u2014Pu alloy is performed by a control system without user calculation. In this embodiment, the control system comprises a computer, ASIC (application specific integrated circuit), microcontroller or other electronic device.
