{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","System Architecture"],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/264,368, filed on Oct. 31, 2005, and assigned to assignee of the present application. Accordingly, this application claims benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/264,368 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/264,368 is hereby incorporated in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to privacy and security of users' data provided to on-line services.","2. Description of the Related Art","To make online transactions more efficient and convenient, certain online services store users' personal information, such as name, address, credit card information, and other confidential user information, on servers for later retrieval and re-use. During retrieval, an on-line service must ensure that users can retrieve only their own information in order to protect privacy and security of other users' information.","Typically, to access their personal information, users need to provide a user name and password in a form. If the user's name and password are correct, the server authenticates the user and provides access to the user's data. If the provided user name and password are incorrect access is denied to a user.","This approach has the well-known problem that users often forget their user name or password for a particular service. Most services provide a way for a user to retrieve a user name and\/or password by verifying their identity in other ways, such as answering specific questions. This approach still requires the user to remember particular information to access each different service, or alternatively (and less securely) use the same user name and password with every service.","Many online services do store a limited amount of information on a user's client computer in the form of a \u201ccookie.\u201d However, this information is typically used to authenticate the user, and not to provide transactional or other complex or large bodies of data. This is because existing browsers typically limit the cookie size to 4 k of data, which is significantly less that would be used for storing complex data files.","User data used or generated by an online application is stored by the online application on the client device, rather than entirely on the system hosting the online application. Storing the user data on a client device avoids the complexity of user authentication to the online application, puts a user in control of where and how his data is stored, enables the user to share the user data with other parties, and permits a user to copy or send the data to any other device for subsequent use or storage.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a user accesses an online application on a server system using a web browser and enters user data into the online application; other user data may be generated by the online application. At any point, the user may request to store the entered data on a client device, for example, as part of pausing or terminating use of the online application. Upon the user's request, the user data is encrypted and embedded into a file (e.g., a web page or equivalent). The file with the embedded user data is then stored on a user-selected client device. A user can choose location of where the file will be stored on the client device. In one embodiment, the encryption is performed locally on the client device using an encryption application or browser plug-in. In another embodiment, the user data is transmitted to the server system, where it is encrypted and then transmitted back to the client device for storage.","When a user requests to restore the saved data (e.g., to continue use of the online application), a user opens the file stored on the client device. A user may open a link in the file and the encrypted data is transmitted to the server system. At the server system, the user data is decrypted and loaded into the online application with which the user was working. Alternatively, the local application may also be used to decrypt the user data and transmit it to the online application for loading. The online application generates a page with some or all of the loaded user data, which is then sent to the client device, where it is provided to a user. The application is restored to the same page or location where the user left off. As a result, a user can continue working with the online application where he or she left off. Unlike existing authentication mechanisms, a user does not need to provide a user name and password to restore the saved data. Authentication is provided instead by whatever existing authentication services are resident on the user's client device.","A system in accordance with one embodiment includes a server system in communication with a plurality of client devices via a network. The server system comprises a web server for servicing user requests, and an online application in communication with the server. The server system also includes a data saving module adapted to receive data provided by a user of an online application, invoke the encryption module to encrypt the user data, embed the data into a file, and send the file with the embedded data to the client device for storage. The server system also includes a data restoring module adapted to receive encrypted user data from the client device, in response to a user's request to restore the data. The data restoring module invokes a decryption module to decrypt the data, and then loads the decrypted data into the online application. The online application with the loaded user data is provided to the client device to be presented to a user of the online application.","The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all-inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims hereof. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in this disclosure has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter, resort to the claims being necessary to determine such inventive subject matter.","The figures depict one embodiment of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","110","110","130","120"],"i":["a ","n "]},"As used herein, the term \u201cserver system\u201d  simply denotes those aspects of a collection of software programs associated with a remote computer system, as well as underlying operating system and hardware support that provides an online application service to the client devices . As will be understood by those of skill in the art, a server system  within the context of the present invention can comprise components of the software program, as well as components of the operating system of a remote computer and hardware components of a remote computer. In one embodiment, the server system  executes a tax-preparation application, such as SnapTax\u2122 provided by Intuit, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., or other software that assists a user in the preparation of tax information to be submitted to a taxing authority. The server system  may comprise one or more computers for implementing functionality of the present invention.","Users (not shown) access an online application executed on server system  using client devices . An online application comprises an application server  (shown in ), a plurality of web pages (including both static and dynamically generated), classes, application data, and associated logic for handling user inputs, processing the input data, storing the input data, and retrieving additional data. A web page may use a variety of definitional and programming languages to control how information is presented. The application server  generates or retrieves various web pages based on user input, and provides the pages to the system server , which transmits them to the client device . Client device  loads web pages received from server system  and displays the web pages to a user. Client device  can be a personal computer, cellular telephone, personal digital assistant and other handheld device that employs web-browsing functionality. Client devices -execute a web browser -respectively for interpreting HTML or other display instructions in the web page and displaying the content accordingly. Web browser  includes additional functionality, such as a Java Virtual Machine, for executing JAVA\u00ae applets, ActiveX\u00ae, Flash\u00ae, and\/or other applets or scripts technologies as available now or in the future.","Client device  also includes, for example, a storage device, like a hard drive, fixed or removable storage device, a processor, and an input device. Within the context of the present invention, client device  does not locally execute application programs adapted to process the data in the same manner as the online application provided by the server system . For example, where the server system  provides an online tax preparation application, then the client device  would not have a locally executable tax preparation application that can read and process the same user data. Similarly, if the online application is a financial management application (e.g., accounting, checkbook, trading, portfolio manager, etc.), then the client device  does not locally execute a similar financial management application. In some embodiments, as further described below, the client device  does not locally execute an encryption\/decryption application as well. In other words, as least in some embodiments, the client device  can be a very minimally equipped computing device, providing access to the server system  and some other functionality substantially unrelated to the functionality of the online application, (e.g., telephony in a cell phone device).","Communication network  can be the Internet, and particularly, the World Wide Web portion thereof. However, it will also be appreciated that communication network  can be a LAN, WAN, intranet of any size, or any other communication that is capable of supporting communication between a client device  and a server system .","Referring now to , a block diagram of the server system  is shown. Server system  includes a web infrastructure, such as a web server  and an application server . The web server  is an application for serving content across the communication network , such as for example Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), Apache, or any other system capable of presenting web content to a user. The web server  receives user requests from client device  to provide web pages and forwards the requests to the application server . The application server  processes the requests and returns a response via the web server  to the client device  in the form of web pages using any form of display programming across the communication network . The application server  provides the application processing logic for handling the user provided, application specific data for the desired functionality, such as tax preparation, online banking, portfolio management, scientific data analysis, accounting, just to name a few of the many different possible hosted application types.","Application server  executes data saving module , data restoring module , encryption\/decryption module , and XML transformation module . The term \u201cmodule\u201d refers to computer program code and\/or hardware adapted to provide the functionality attributed to the module, and which may have any type of implementation, for example, as a library file, script, object code, class, package, applet, and so forth.","Data saving module  is adapted to invoke the encryption\/decryption module  to encrypt the user data used by an on-line application and store the data on the currently used client device (or any other network attached client device, such as another computer on the client's local network).","Data restoring module  is adapted to invoke the encryption\/decryption module  to decrypt the user data and load the data into the on-line application with which a user was previously working, thereby restoring its state to the point at which the user left it.","Encryption\/decryption module  is adapted to encrypt the user data. In one implementation, a symmetric encryption is used. Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption in which the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data. In one embodiment, encryption\/decryption module  is adapted to generate a key using an application programming interface (API) provided by IBM Corporation, of Armonk, N.Y., and use the key to encrypt the received data. In one embodiment, XSS4J algorithm provided by IBM Corporation is used to encrypt the data. However, one skilled in the art would understand that any possible API or application can be used to carry out the encryption function. Encryption\/decryption module  is also adapted to decrypt the encrypted data using the same key. Other symmetric key algorithms can be used as well. Alternatively, asymmetric encryption methods may be used as well. Here, user data could be encrypted with a public key for the server system , and then decrypted using the complementary private key.","In an alternative embodiment, the client device  includes local equivalents of one or more of the data saving module , data restoring module , data encryption\/decryption module , and XML transformation module , so that various operations described above are performed locally and\/or in conjunction with server system .","Example Methods of Operation","1. Saving User Data",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["110","130"]},"Initially, a user at the client device  accesses via the communication network  an on-line application executed at the server system . The online application can be an online banking, portfolio management, scientific data analysis, accounting, just to name a few of the many different possible hosted application types.","To facilitate understanding of the operation of this embodiment of the present invention, event diagrams shown in  will be described in conjunction with the screens shown in , which are presented to a user working with the online application.","While working with the online application  executed on the server system  (e.g., as shown in ), a user enters data into various data fields. In the illustrated example of , the data is tax-related data, including taxpayer's identification information (name, date of birth, and address), wages, salaries, taxable interest, and other tax-related information. The provided user data is stored in memory (not shown) of the client device . At some point, a user may choose to save the entered data so that the user can return to the online application  at a later time, for example, if the user does not have time to complete the application, or to back up the data, or simply move to another client device. To this end, at step , the user selects \u201csave\u201d feature  on a screen where the application  is displayed. Referring now to , in one embodiment, screen  is presented to a user that allows a user to save the user data. In one embodiment, when a user presses a \u201csave\u201d button , user-provided data is sent  to server system  and web browser  sends the user provided data to the server system  via, for example, the HTTP POST, HTTP GET, or any other protocol capable of transmitting data between the client device  and the server system .","Server system  receives  the data and optionally formats the data into an XML format. Server system  also encrypts  the data using any encryption algorithm.","Once the user data is encrypted, server system  embeds  the encrypted data into a file, such as an HTML, XHTML, a PDF file, or any file format capable of storing the encrypted data. The resulting file is provided to the web server .  is a portion of an exemplary source file  showing a portion of the embedded encrypted data. The embedded encrypted data  on  may include user-provided information such as taxpayer's address, social security number, wages, and other tax-related information. The file  with embedded user data may optionally include an unencrypted summary of the user data such as a user's name and the amount of refund calculated by server system  based on the data provided by the user. The file  also includes instructions  on how to restore the saved data. Referring now to , server system  sends  the file to client device  for storage.","At step , client device  receives the file  with the encrypted user data. A user is allowed to select a destination for storing the file. Referring now to , a \u201cSave As\u201d dialog screen  is presented to a user prompting a user to choose a location for file storage. The user may be offered a default name  for the file  to be stored, but may choose any name. A user may choose to store the file on a storage device, like a hard drive, compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), DVD, some other form of fixed or removable storage device, or on any networked attached device, including other computers on the user's local network (or even on remote networks). A user can also copy or send the file  to any other computing device for subsequent use or storage. At step , client device  stores the file .","2. Restoring User Data",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["110","130","110"]},"At some point, a user decides to complete the application . To this end, at step , a user opens the saved file . The web browser  retrieves the data file  and displays the file  as a web page. Referring now to , file  is shown in a form of a web page. The file  includes instructions on how to restore the encrypted user data. For example, the file instructs a user: \u201cSelect Resume button to continue your work\u201d . As was previously described in reference to , the file  also includes hidden encrypted user data that was provided to the online application . Referring again to , when a user clicks on \u201cResume\u201d button , web browser transmits  the data file to the web server . Web server  forwards the file  to the data restoring module . The data restoring module  invokes  encryption\/decryption module  to decrypt the data.","Once the user data is decrypted at step , server system  loads  the decrypted data into the online application  that is executed on the server system  and with which a user was previously working, thereby restoring its state to the point at which the user left it. The online application  generates a page with some or all of the loaded user data, which is then sent  to the client device , where it is provided  to a user. The application  is restored to the same page or location where the user left off. As a result, a user can continue working with the online application where he or she left off.  illustrates a page with all of the loaded user data after the data has been restored. As shown in , all the data provided by the user to the on-line application  is displayed to the user so that the user can continue working with the application  from where the user left off.","Thus, storing on a client device data provided by a user to an online application puts a user in control of where and how their data is stored, enables the user to share the online application data with other parties, and permits the user to copy or send his data to any other device for subsequent use or storage. Unlike existing authentication mechanisms, the user does not need to provide a user name and password to the online application or system server to restore the saved data, thereby reducing the burden of existing authentication mechanisms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIG. 13"],"b":["510","600","1100","1200","1210","115","1300","1310"]},"Referring again to , when a user chooses  the file from a stored location, the encrypted data is sent  to server system . Server system  receives  the encrypted data, decrypts  the data, and loads  the decrypted data into the online application  executed on the server system . The online application  generates a page with some or all of the loaded user data, which is then sent to the client device , where it is provided  to a user. The application  is restored to the same page or location where the user left off. Referring again to , application page  is displayed to a user with the previously entered user data. The user can continue working with the application  from where the user left off.","The present invention has been described in particular detail with respect to several embodiments.
