{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present application relates to call management systems and, more particularly, to methods and systems for establishing calling preferences for individual users of such systems.","Users of communication devices often have multiple communication devices. For example, such users may be associated with wireless devices such as a Smartphone, analog or digital telephones such as a network phone or a home phone, soft phones operating on computers, such as Skype\u2122, etc.","A caller trying to reach a desired recipient may not reach that recipient on the communication device associated with the dialed number used by the caller. For example, the desired recipient may be away from that communication device at the time the call is received.","Thus, there remains a need for improved systems for managing calls.","Similar reference numerals may have been used in different figures to denote similar components.","In one aspect, the present application provides a method of establishing calling preferences for a user. The method comprises: a) defining a user profile containing an association between the user and two or more communication devices, each device having an associated device type; b) assigning the user to at least one group; c) obtaining group preferences associated with one or more of the user's groups; d) determining user preferences for the user based on the group preferences and the device types of the communication devices associated with the user; and e) storing the user specific preferences in a user profile associated with the user.","In another aspect, the present application provides a system for establishing calling preferences for a user. The system includes at least one memory storing group preferences. The memory is also for storing a user profile for the user. The user profile associates the user with two or more communication devices and at least one group. Each device has an associated device type. The system further includes a user profile configuration module connected to the memory, the configuration module is configured to: a) obtain the group preferences associated with one or more of the user's groups from the memory; b) determine user preferences for the user based on the group calling preferences and the device types of the devices; and c) store the user preferences in the user profile.","In yet another aspect, the present application provides a method of ringing one or more communication devices associated with a user, the method comprising: a) receiving a call; b) determining that the call is associated with the user; c) obtaining a user profile associated with the user, the user profile containing an association between the user and two or more communication devices and an association between the user and at least one group, the user profile including user preferences, the user preferences being based on group preferences associated with the user's group; and d) ringing the user's devices according to the user preferences.","In yet another aspect, the present application provides a method of ringing one or more communication devices associated with a user. The user is associated with a group. The method comprises: a) receiving a call; b) determining that the call is associated with the user; and c) ringing the user's devices in an order associated with the user's group.","Other aspects of the present application will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.","Embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system, mobile device architecture, server architecture, or computer programming language.","The present application relates to the control and management of communications. Although reference may be made to \u201ccalls\u201d in the description of example embodiments below, it will be appreciated that the described systems and methods are applicable to session-based communications in general and not limited to voice calls. It will also be appreciated that the systems and methods may not be limited to sessions and may be applicable to messaging-based communications in some embodiments.","Reference is now made to , which shows, in block diagram form, an example system, generally designated , for the control and management of communications. The system  includes an enterprise or business system , which in many embodiments includes a local area network (LAN). In the description below, the enterprise or business system  may be referred to as an enterprise network . It will be appreciated that the enterprise network  may include more than one network and may be located in multiple geographic areas in some embodiments.","The enterprise network  may be connected, often through a firewall , to a wide area network (WAN) , such as the Internet. The enterprise network  may also be connected to a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  via direct inward dialing (DID) trunks or primary rate interface (PRI) trunks.","The enterprise network  may also communicate with a public land mobile network (PLMN) , which may also be referred to as a wireless wide area network (WWAN) or, in some cases, a cellular network. The connection with the PLMN  may be made via a relay , as known in the art.","The enterprise network  may also provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) featuring wireless access points. Other WLANs  may exist outside the enterprise network . For example, WLAN may be connected to WAN .","The system  may include a number of enterprise-associated mobile devices  (only one shown). The mobile devices  may include devices equipped for cellular communication through the PLMN , mobile devices equipped for Wi-Fi communications over one of the WLANs , or dual-mode devices capable of both cellular and WLAN communications. WLANs  may be configured in accordance with one of the IEEE 802.11 specifications.","It will be understood that the mobile devices  include one or more radio transceivers and associated processing hardware and software to enable wireless communications with the PLMN  and\/or one of the WLANs . In various embodiments, the PLMN  and mobile devices  may be configured to operate in compliance with any one or more of a number of wireless protocols, including GSM, GPRS, CDMA, EDGE, UMTS, EvDO, HSPA, 3GPP, or a variety of others. It will be appreciated that the mobile device  may roam within the PLMN  and across PLMNs, in known manner, as the user moves. In some instances, the dual-mode mobile devices  and\/or the enterprise network  are configured to facilitate roaming between the PLMN  and a WLAN , and are thus capable of seamlessly transferring sessions (such as voice calls) from a connection with the cellular interface of the dual-mode device  to the WLAN  interface of the dual-mode device , and vice versa.","The enterprise network  typically includes a number of networked servers, computers, and other devices. For example, the enterprise network  may connect one or more desktop or laptop computers  (one shown). The connection may be wired or wireless in some embodiments. The enterprise network  may also connect to one or more digital telephone sets  (one shown).","The enterprise network  may include one or more mail servers, such as mail server , for coordinating the transmission, storage, and receipt of electronic messages for client devices operating within the enterprise network . Typical mail servers include the Microsoft Exchange Server\u2122 and the IBM Lotus Domino\u2122 server. Each user within the enterprise typically has at least one user account within the enterprise network . Associated with each user account is message address information, such as an e-mail address. Messages addressed to a user message address are stored on the enterprise network  in the mail server . The messages may be retrieved by the user using a messaging application, such as an e-mail client application. The messaging application may be operating on a user's computer  connected to the enterprise network  within the enterprise. In some embodiments, the user may be permitted to access stored messages using a remote computer, for example at another location via the WAN  using a VPN connection. Using the messaging application, the user may also compose and send messages addressed to others, within or outside the enterprise network . The messaging application causes the mail server  to send a composed message to the addressee, often via the WAN .","The relay  serves to route messages received over the PLMN  from the mobile device  to the corresponding enterprise network . The relay  also pushes messages from the enterprise network  to the mobile device  via the PLMN .","The enterprise network  also includes an enterprise server . Together with the relay , the enterprise server  functions to redirect or relay incoming e-mail messages addressed to a user's e-mail address within the enterprise network  to the user's mobile device  and to relay incoming e-mail messages composed and sent via the mobile device  out to the intended recipients within the WAN  or elsewhere. The enterprise server  and relay  together facilitate \u201cpush\u201d e-mail service for the mobile device  enabling the user to send and receive e-mail messages using the mobile device  as though the user were connected to an e-mail client within the enterprise network  using the user's enterprise-related e-mail address, for example on computer .","As is typical in many enterprises, the enterprise network  includes a Private Branch exchange (although in various embodiments the PBX may be a standard PBX or an IP-PBX, for simplicity the description below uses the term PBX to refer to both)  having a connection with the PSTN  for routing incoming and outgoing voice calls for the enterprise. The PBX  is connected to the PSTN  via DID trunks or PRI trunks, for example. The PBX  may use ISDN signaling protocols for setting up and tearing down circuit-switched connections through the PSTN  and related signaling and communications. In some embodiments, the PBX  may be connected to one or more conventional analog telephones . The PBX  is also connected to the enterprise network  and, through it, to telephone terminal devices, such as digital telephone sets , softphones operating on computers , etc. Within the enterprise, each individual may have an associated extension number, sometimes referred to as a PNP (private numbering plan), or direct dial phone number. Calls outgoing from the PBX  to the PSTN  or incoming from the PSTN  to the PBX  are typically circuit-switched calls. Within the enterprise, e.g. between the PBX  and terminal devices, voice calls are often packet-switched calls, for example Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls.","The enterprise network  may further include a Service Management Platform (SMP)  for performing some aspects of messaging or session control, like call control and advanced call processing features. The SMP  may, in some cases, also perform some media handling. Collectively the SMP  and PBX  may be referred to as the enterprise communications platform, generally designated . It will be appreciated that the enterprise communications platform  and, in particular, the SMP , is implemented on one or more servers having suitable communications interfaces for connecting to and communicating with the PBX  and\/or DID\/PRI trunks. Although the SMP  may be implemented on a stand-alone server, it will be appreciated that it may be implemented into an existing control agent\/server as a logical software component. As will be described below, the SMP  may be implemented as a multi-layer platform.","The enterprise communications platform  implements the switching to connect session legs and may provide the conversion between, for example, a circuit-switched call and a VoIP call, or to connect legs of other media sessions. In some embodiments, in the context of voice calls the enterprise communications platform  provides a number of additional functions including automated attendant, interactive voice response, call forwarding, voice mail, etc. It may also implement certain usage restrictions on enterprise users, such as blocking international calls or 1-900 calls. As will be described in greater details below, in some embodiments, the communication platform  may implement advanced ringing schemes which provide for simultaneous and\/or sequential ringing of multiple communication devices. In many embodiments, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) may be used to set-up, manage, and terminate media sessions for voice calls. Other protocols may also be employed by the enterprise communications platform , for example, Web Services, Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) protocol, Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), and various custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as will be described in greater detail below.","One of the functions of the enterprise communications platform  is to extend the features of enterprise telephony to the mobile devices . For example, the enterprise communications platform  may allow the mobile device  to perform functions akin to those normally available on a standard office telephone, such as the digital telephone set  or analog telephone set . Example features may include direct extension dialing, enterprise voice mail, conferencing, call transfer, call park, etc.","Reference is now made to , which show example embodiments of the enterprise communications system . Again, although references are made below to \u201ccalls\u201d or call-centric features it will be appreciated that the architectures and systems depicted and described are applicable to session-based communications in general and, in some instances, to messaging-based communications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["16","18","60","60","16","18"]},"In this embodiment, the SMP  assumes control over both call processing and the media itself. This architecture may be referred to as \u201cFirst Party Call Control\u201d. Many of the media handling functions normally implemented by the PBX  are handled by the SMP  in this architecture. Incoming calls addressed to any extension or direct dial number within the enterprise, for example, are always first routed to the SMP . Thereafter, a call leg is established from the SMP  to the called party within the enterprise, and the two legs are bridged. Accordingly, the SMP  includes a digital trunk interface  and a digital signal processing (DSP) conferencing bridge . The DSP conferencing bridge  performs the bridging of calls for implementation of various call features, such as conferencing, call transfer, etc. The digital trunk interface  may be implemented as a plurality of telephonic cards, e.g. Intel Dialogic cards, interconnected by a bus and operating under the control of a processor. The digital trunk interface  may also be partly implemented using a processor module such as, for example, a Host Media Processing (HMP) processor.","The SMP  may include various scripts  for managing call processing. The scripts  are implemented as software modules, routines, functions, etc., stored in non-volatile memory and executed by the processor of the SMP . The scripts  may implement call flow logic, business logic, user preferences, call service processes, and various feature applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["16","18","18","18"]},"The call control server  is coupled to the PBX , for example through the LAN, enabling packet-based communications and, more specifically, IP-based communications. In one embodiment, communications between the PBX  and the call control server  are carried out in accordance with SIP. In other words, the call control server  uses SIP-based communications to manage the set up, tear down, and control of media handled by the PBX . In one example embodiment, the call control server  may employ a communications protocol conforming to the ECMA-269 or ECMA-323 standards for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["14","18","74","74","18","72","76","72","76","72","74"]},"The SIP server  interacts with the media server  using SIP-based media handling commands. For example, the SIP server  and media server  may communicate using Media Server Markup Language (MSML) as defined in IETF document Saleem A., \u201cMedia Server Markup Language\u201d, Internet Draft, draft-saleem-msml-07, Aug. 7, 2008. The media server  may be configured to perform Host Media Processing (HMP).","Other architectures or configurations for the enterprise communications system  will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art.","Reference is now made to , which shows another embodiment of the enterprise communications system  with a Third Party Call Control architecture. In this embodiment, the SMP  is a multi-layer platform that includes a protocol layer , a services layer  and an application layer . The protocol layer  includes a plurality of interface protocols configured for enabling operation of corresponding applications in the application layer . The services layer  includes a plurality of services that can be leveraged by the interface protocols to create richer applications. Finally, the application layer  includes a plurality of applications that are exposed out to the communication devices and that leverage corresponding ones of the services and interface protocols for enabling the applications.","Specifically, the protocol layer  preferably includes protocols which allow media to be controlled separate from data. For example, the protocol layer  can include, among other things, a Session Initiation Protocol or SIP , a Web Services protocol , an Application Programming Interface or API , a Computer Telephony Integration protocol or CTI , and a Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions or SIMPLE protocol . It is contemplated that the interface protocols - are plug-ins that can interface directly with corresponding servers in the enterprise network , which will be further described below.","For the purposes of this disclosure, SIP  will be utilized, although it is appreciated that the system  can operate using the above disclosed or additional protocols. As known by those of ordinary skill in the art, SIP is the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standard for multimedia session management, and more specifically is an application-layer control protocol for establishing, maintaining, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions between two or more endpoints. As further known by those of ordinary skill in the art, the SIP protocol  includes two interfaces for signaling: SIP-Trunk (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-T\u201d) and SIP-Line (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSIP-L\u201d). Specifically, the SIP-T interface is utilized when the endpoint is a non-specific entity or not registered (i.e., when communicating between two network entities). In contrast, the SIP-L interface is utilized when the endpoint is registered (i.e., when dialing to a specific extension). The specific operation of the system  utilizing SIP  will be described in further detail below.","The SMP  also includes a plurality of enablers, among other things, a VoIP enabler , a Fixed Mobile Convergence or FMC enabler , a conference services enabler , a presence enabler  and an Instant Messaging or IM enabler . Each of the enablers - are used by corresponding services in the services layer  that combine one or more of the enablers. Each of the applications in the application layer  is then combined with one or more of the services to perform the desired application. For example, a phone call service may use the VoIP or PBX enabler, and an emergency response application may use the phone call service, an Instant Messenger service, a video call service, and email service and\/or a conference service.","The application layer  may include a conference services application  that, together with the conference services enabler , enables multiple communication devices (including desk telephones and personal computers) to participate in a conference call through use of a centralized conference server . As seen in , the conference server  is provided in the enterprise network  and is in communication with the conference services enabler  preferably through the SIP protocol , although it is recognized that additional protocols that control media separate from data may be appropriate, such as the Web Services protocol  or the CTI protocol . The conference call server  is configured for directing media and data streams to and from one or more communication devices (i.e., mobile devices , telephones , and computers ).","As discussed above, the specific functions of the SMP  will vary based on the particular system within which it operates. Referring still to , in some embodiments, the SMP  is adapted to establish and implement calling preferences for users of the enterprise network . The users can include any users which have at least one communication device which may receive calls through the enterprise network . For example, the users may be users of the analog telephones  connected to the PBX , users of the digital telephone sets , users of soft phones operating on computers  connected to the enterprise network, or users of the mobile devices .","Users may be associated with multiple communication devices. For example, a user may be associated with devices of different device types, such as digital telephone sets , analog telephone sets , soft phones operating on computers , or mobile devices . Some users may be associated with multiple communication devices of the same type. For example, a user may be associated with an analog phone  at a first location, such as the user's desk, and another analog phone  at a second location, such as a laboratory in which the user often works. For the purposes of this disclosure, \u201cdevice types\u201d may refer to either the communication technology of the device (i.e. analog telephone, digital telephone, mobile device, etc. . . . ) or the location of the device (i.e. home, office, laboratory, meeting room, reception, etc. . . . ). \u201cDevice type\u201d may also refer to any combination of these identifiers. For example, the device type for a first device may be \u201chome phone\u201d and the device type of the second device may be \u201ccellular phone.\u201d","At least one of the devices associated with the user is a device which is controlled by the enterprise network . Alternatively, multiple devices may be controlled by the enterprise network . A controlled device is a device for which the enterprise network  is engaged when the user receives a call directed to that device. However, in some embodiments, the devices which are associated with the user and managed by the system  may include devices which are outside of the enterprise network , such as devices connected to the PSTN . Devices such as these, which are outside of the enterprise network  may be devices to which a received call is directed in a call forwarding or advanced ringing scheme.","Reference is now made to , which shows an example of a service management platform . While the specific hardware required to implement the SMP  will vary based on the particular network within which it operates, typically, the SMP  will include one or more processor  and at least one memory . The processor  operates under stored program control and executes computer code, such as scripts  stored in memory  such as persistent memory, for example, in flash memory. The scripts  may include scripts for configuring user preferences  for users  of the system. While the memory  has been illustrated as a single component, it will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the memory  will typically be comprised of multiple memory components. For example, the memory  may include any one, or a combination of: random access memory, flash memory, a hard disk drive, an optical storage medium, etc.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the scripts  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as RAM. The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions may be described for various types of memory, this is merely an example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The SMP  may include an incoming call management module  for routing calls to one or more devices. The SMP  may also include a user profile configuration module  which is configured to determine user preferences  for the users of the enterprise network  of . Since some users  may be associated with multiple devices, in some embodiments, the user preferences  may define a ringing scheme for the user. Such ringing schemes may be referred to as ring profiles . The ringing scheme may establish a relative ringing priority for the plurality of devices associated with the user . When the user  is called through the enterprise network  (thereby engaging the enterprise network ), the ringing scheme may be implemented, and devices rung according to their priority.","The user profile configuration module  may be implemented on the processor , which may be configured to perform the configuration functions described herein.","In some embodiments, a user  may be associated with one or more groups , in a user profile  stored in memory . For example, in the embodiment illustrated in , the user  is associated with a single group  (i.e. sales). The groups  indicate at least one characteristic or common feature of users associated with that group. In some embodiments, the groups  may indicate the user's occupation. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in , a sales group  may be associated with salespeople. In some embodiments, the groups  may indicate a team associated with group members. For example, the teams may include a safety team, a hazardous materials team, etc. In other embodiments, the groups  may indicate the amount of travel associated with group member's jobs. For example, such groups  could include groups defining the approximate amount of time that a user spends away from the office, such as, for example, a group  for members who travel very little; another group for members who travel a lot; and another group for members who do not travel. In other embodiments, the groups  may characterize how essential it is that the group member be reachable on at least one communication device. For example, users may be grouped as either\u201cessential\u201d or\u201cnon-essential.\u201d Other groups may classify group members as either \u201cprofessionals\u201d or \u201cnon-professionals.\u201d It will be understood that the groups listed above are only illustrative and that other groups are also possible.","In some embodiments, when a user  is added to the system by a system administrator, the system administrator may assign the user  to one or more groups  in their user profile . In some embodiments, a default group may be automatically generated for a user by the SMP . For example, in some embodiments, all users may initially be assigned a \u201cdefault\u201d group. The default group may define common preferences for an average user. In other embodiments, the SMP  may assign the user a specific group based on other information about the user  in the user's profile . For example, the SMP  may be configured to parse other information in the user's profile which describes one or more characteristic of the user  to determine which groups  the user is associated with. By way of example, the system may examine a field in the user's profile which lists the user's title. Similarly, a field which lists a department to which the user belongs may be used by the SMP  to determine an appropriate default group for the user.","The user profile  may also include a listing  of devices which are associated with the user . For example, in the example shown in , the user  is associated with cellular, desktop, home, and softphones in the user's profile .","The user profile  may also include other information about the user  such as, for example, the name of the user , an identification number associated with the user , the user's department, the user's job title, etc.","As will be explained in greater detail below, in some embodiments the user profile configuration module  may be configured to establish calling preferences  for a user  based on the user's associated group  or groups . Based on characteristics of the user, which are defined by the user's associated groups , user preferences , such as a ring profile  may be established for that user.","Since the user preferences  are related to the user's group(s) , which are related to characteristics of the user , appropriate user preferences  may be established for users  based on preferences  defined for one or more group  corresponding to the user's group . For example, some users, such as salespeople, may travel more than other users. Accordingly, mobile devices  may be given a higher priority  for such people than they would otherwise be given. That is, mobile devices  may be given a higher priority  for user's who tend to travel a greater amount.","Similarly, some users, such as those deemed \u201cessential\u201d may be expected to be reachable at all times. Accordingly, for such users, their home phone may be included in their ring profile . Other users may have a job in which it is inappropriate or unnecessary for them to receive calls at home. The home phones for such users may not be included in their ring profile , or may be assigned a priority , such as zero, which indicates that the number is not to be called.","In some embodiments, group preferences  for groups  that users  may be associated with are stored in the memory . The group preferences  may be group calling preferences which establish a ring priority  for a plurality of device types . The group preferences  may be established, for example, by a system administrator.","As will be explained in greater detail below, the user profile configuration module  may be configured to use the group preferences  for a group  which corresponds to the user's group  in order to establish user specific preferences , such as a ring profile  and\/or rules  for ringing the user.","Referring now to , a block diagram is shown illustrating a further example of the service management platform . As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the memory  will typically contain group preferences , for multiple groups , . By way of example, in , group preferences , are defined for a first group , which is a \u201cSales\u201d group, and a second group , which is an \u201cEngineering\u201d group. The group preferences , for each of the groups , may define ringing priorities , for group members. In the example shown, the ring priority level associated with a salesperson's cellular phone is one (1), while the ring priority level associated with an engineer's cellular phone is two (2).","Similarly, the memory  will also typically contain user profiles , for more than one user , . In the example shown in , there is a first user and a second user . It will be appreciated that the SMP  may be configured to support any number of users  and that the maximum number of users  may, in some embodiments, be constrained only by resource limitations.","In some embodiments, users  may be associated with multiple ring profiles , . For example, in the example of , a first user is associated with both a first ring profile and a second ring profile . Similarly, groups  may be associated with multiple ring profiles . For example, in the example of , the second group is associated with both a first ring profile and a second ring profile . The group  may also be associated with group rules  and the user  may be associated with user rules  which define the circumstances under which each of the ring profiles , may be used. Where a user  is associated with multiple ring profiles , , the user preferences  may include rules  defining a process for applying the profiles , in order to resolve or avoid any potential conflicts.","Referring now also to , a flowchart is shown illustrating a method  of configuring a user's calling preferences  in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. At step , the user profile configuration module  detects an event which suggests that the profile for a user  should be configured. This event may include, for example, detecting the creation of a new user profile . In other embodiments, the user profile configuration module  may initialize a user's preferences  if it detects that a user  is associated with one or more groups , but the user preferences , or ring profile  for the user  have not yet been set up. For example, referring still to , a user profile is shown for the second user . In this example, the ring profile  has not yet been configured. The SMP  may be configured to interpret this as an event which requires user preferences  to be configured for that user ","Next, at step , the user profile configuration module  may obtain the group preferences  associated with one or more of the user's associated groups  from the memory .","Next, at step , the user profile configuration module  determines user-specific calling preferences  from the group preferences  associated with one or more of the user's associated groups .","Where the user  is only associated with one group , the user's calling preferences , such as the ring profile  and\/or the user rules , may be determined from the group preferences  for the group  corresponding to the user's group .","In some cases, the user's devices  may not include a device of each device type  listed in the group preferences  for the group  corresponding to the user's group . That is, the group preferences  for the group  corresponding to the user's group  may include a device type  which the specific user does not have; such as, for example, a cellular phone. In such cases, the user profile configuration module  may determine the user's calling preferences  based on the group preferences  for the group  corresponding to the user's group , and the available device types  for the user. If the specific user  is not associated with a device of a device type  included in the group preferences  for the group  corresponding to the user's group , the user profile configuration module  may increase the priority  assigned to all devices allocated a lesser priority than the non-included device in the group preferences . In the example illustrated in , the group preferences for the second group , which is an engineering group, includes priorities for a desktop phone, which is ranked priority one (1); a cellular phone, which is ranked priority two (2); and a home phone, which is ranked priority three (3). If the specific user  was not associated with a cellular phone, then the home phone may be bumped a priority level and assigned priority two (2) instead of priority three (3). Alternatively, in some embodiments, when a user  is not associated with a device of a device type  included in the group preferences  for the group  corresponding to the user's group , the user profile configuration module  may not adjust the priority level. In such embodiments, any gaps in priority levels may be accounted for when calls are routed. That is, the incoming call management module  may be configured to skip any such gaps when routing calls. For example, if the preferences  for a user  include a device  which is assigned a priority of one (1), and a device  which is assigned a priority of three (3), but no devices  assigned a priority of two (2), the incoming call management module  may be configured to first ring the priority one (1) device and, immediately thereafter, ring the priority three (3) device.","Similarly, if the specific user  has devices of a device type  which is not prioritized in the group preferences  for the group  corresponding to the user's group , those devices may be allocated a lesser priority  than the devices which are included in the profile. In the example of , the user profile for the second user is associated with the engineering group and the user has devices which include a cellular phone, a desktop phone, a home phone, and a softphone. The group preferences for the engineering group do not include a priority for softphones. Accordingly, the softphone could be allocated the next available lowest priority. In the example given, the softphone could be allocated priority four (4). In other embodiments, where the user  has devices of device types  which are not prioritized in the group preferences  for group  associated with the user's group , those devices may be allocated a priority which indicates that they will never be called by the enterprise network , such as priority zero (0).","In some embodiments, users  may be associated with multiple groups . In the example shown in , the user profile for the first user associates the user with two groups : sales and engineering. The groups  themselves may be ranked and the user profile configuration module  may be configured to determine the user specific preferences  based on the group preferences  for the highest ranking group. That is, the groups  may be ranked based on their order of importance, and the user specific preferences  determined from the group with the greatest importance. The ranking of the groups  may be user-specific, or it may be absolute. That is, the groups associated with each user may be ranked in the user profile  and the ranking may define the group  that corresponds most closely to the characteristics of the specific user . For example, where a user  is an engineer who is more involved in sales than engineering, the user  may be associated both with the sales and engineering groups. However, since the nature of the user's work is more sales-oriented than engineering-oriented, the sales group may be ranked higher than the engineering group for the user . This ranking may be specified in the user's profile .","In other embodiments, group rankings may be absolute, and may establish relative levels of importance for groups  which may be applied for all users . For example, the group rankings may specify that one group  (i.e. sales) will always take precedence over another group  (i.e. engineering).","In other embodiments, the user profile configuration module  will determine user specific preferences  based on the group preferences  for more than one group  which the user is associated with. For example, the group preferences  may include multi-group preferences which define group preferences to be used where the user  is associated with a combination of groups . For example, the group preferences  may include preferences for a first group , such as engineering, preferences for a second group , such as sales, and multi-group preferences (not shown) for the combined group of sales and engineering. Where a specific user  is a member of only the first group (i.e. sales), the group preferences associated with the first group may be used to establish the user-specific preferences . Similarly, where the user is a member of both the first group (i.e. sales) and the second group (i.e. engineering), the group preferences associated with the combined sales and engineering group may be used to establish user preferences .","While the group preferences  have been illustrated using ordered lists defining relative ring priorities  associated with various device types , it will be appreciated that group preferences  may take other forms. For example, the group preferences  may be computer executable instructions which establish a process by which user-specific preferences , such as ring profiles , may be established. In such cases, where a user  is associated with multiple groups, an algorithm associated with each group  may be applied to the user's preferences . For example, the group preferences  may each alter default preferences in a predetermined manner established by the group preferences . For example, if a user  is part of a group associated with a relatively large amount of travel, the user's mobile device  may be given a higher priority level than it would otherwise be given. This may be accomplished, for example, by increasing the priority level  associated with that user's mobile device  by a predetermined amount or by allocated a specific predetermined priority to that device. Similarly, if a user  was associated with an \u201cessential\u201d group which indicates that it is important that the user  be reachable at all times, the user's home phone could be added to the user's ring profile .","Users  may have multiple ring profiles  in some embodiments. An example of such an embodiment is shown in where the first user has multiple ring profiles , . In some embodiments, the user preferences , may include user specific rules  which define conditions for using the ring profiles , . For example, the rules  may specify a range of time where one of more of the ringing profiles , applies. A user  may have a different ringing scheme for various times throughout the day. For example, a user may have preferences which apply during working hours and different preferences which apply during non-working hours.","In other embodiments, the user's rules  may define a process for selecting the appropriate ring profile , based on the identity of the calling party. For example, the user  may have a first ring profile for calls originating from devices within the enterprise network  and a second profile for calls from devices outside the enterprise network . In some embodiments, Automatic Number Identification (ANI) information from the call may be used to determine the identity of the caller.","In other embodiments, the user's rules  may define a process for selecting the appropriate ring profile , based on Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) information for the call. That is, an appropriate ring profile , may be selected based on the number that the calling party called.","The user's rules  are part of the user's preferences  and may be obtained, in the manner specified above, from group rules  in the group preferences .","Referring still to , at step , after user specific preferences  are determined, the user preferences  are stored to the user's profile  in the memory .","After user preferences , such as a ring profile  for the user  have been established, which define a ringing scheme for that user, calls to that user may be routed to any one of the user's devices based on the rules  and\/or ring profile(s)  in the user's preferences . That is, devices may be rung in increasing order of priority until the user answers the call on a device associated with the user  or until the calling party terminates the call. Accordingly, by prioritizing devices in this way, a sequential ring system may be established.","In some embodiments, multiple devices may be assigned the same priority . In such embodiments, devices with the same priority  may be rung at the same time, thereby implementing a simultaneous ring system. Accordingly, by prioritizing devices in the manner described herein, a hybrid simultaneous and sequential ring system may be implemented. That is, devices may be rung in order of increasing priority and, where a plurality of devices share the same priority , they may be rung simultaneously.","Referring now to , together with , an example method  of routing calls according to the user preferences  is illustrated. The method may be performed by the incoming call management module  of the SMP .","At step , a call is received from a calling party. The received call is directed to a device or number associated with the enterprise network ; thus, the enterprise network  is engaged in managing and\/or directing the call. At step , when the call is received, the call management module  attempts to determine the user  which the calling party is trying to reach. This may be done, for example, by examining dialed number identification service (DNIS) information. DNIS information identifies what phone number the caller dialed. Other methods of determining which user the call is directed to are also possible. For example, in some embodiments, the determination may be based on an extension number.","Next, at step , the call management module  determines whether there is a profile  for the user  which the calling party is trying to reach. If the user  does not have a profile  or if the user's profile does not establish user preferences , the call management module  rings the device associated with the number which the calling party has called (step ). This number may be, for example, a DNIS number or an extension number associated with a specific device.","If the user  who is the desired recipient of the received call has a profile  establishing user preferences , at step , the user preferences  are obtained for that user . The user preferences  may define at least one ring profile  for the user  and may define rules  for ringing the user .","The call management module  then rings the devices  in order of their priority , as specified in the user preferences . In some embodiments, this may include a step  in which the call management module  identifies all devices at the highest available priority level  and a step  in which the call management module  rings all of the identified devices. \u201cRinging devices\u201d describes the process where a call or alert is sent to a device to indicate that the device has an incoming call. It will be appreciated that \u201cringing\u201d a device does not, necessarily, require that an audible alarm will be heard from that device. Typically, a user  of a device may set the type of alarm, if any, which will be heard when the device is rung. Audible alarms may not be heard, for example, where a user has turned the device off or put it in a \u201cquiet mode\u201d where a vibratory alarm may indicate a ring. Typically, when a device is rung, the calling party hears an audible ring.","If the recipient user  answers the call (step ), the process ends. Otherwise, the ringing may continue for a predetermined period of time (step ). The predetermined period of time may be specified in the user's preferences . When the predetermined period of time expires, the device(s) with a next lowest priority level  are identified (step ), if there are any such devices in the user's profile (step ). Each of the identified devices may then be rung (step ). This process may be repeated until the user  answers the call on a device (step ) or, in some embodiments, until there are no lower priority devices listed in the user's preferences  (step ). When the user preferences  contain no other lower priority devices, the call may be routed to a voicemail box associated with the user  (step ). In other embodiments (not shown), the lowest priority devices may be rung indefinitely; that is, until the caller hangs up or the receiving device of the called party disconnects the call.","Referring now to , in some embodiments, the user profile configuration module  may further configure the user preferences  based on the user's communication habits. This method  may be implemented after default group preferences are established. For example, this method  may be utilized after calling preferences  are initialized based on group preferences  according to the methods discussed previously herein.","In the method  of , at step , calls are routed according to user-specific preferences  defined in the user's profile , . This may be done, for example, using the method  discussed above with respect to .","In the method  of , at step , data regarding the user's communication habits is collected and analyzed. The user profile configuration module  may monitor the user's usage data for the devices associated with the user in order to predictively determine the best ringing scheme for the user. To this end, the user profile configuration module  may consider a variety of statistics, such as, for example, the frequency with which a user answers received calls on each device, the frequency with which a user makes calls from various devices, presence data relating to the availability of each device, the most recently used device(s), time based patterns, such as usage trends for each device on specific days of the week or usage trends for each device at various times throughout the day, etc. The user profile configuration module  may use any combination of these statistics to predict a ringing scheme which is best suited for the specific user.","Next, at step , the user profile configuration module  may update the user's calling preferences  based on the usage data.","This process  may be repeated to continually update the user preferences associated with the user.","The example embodiments discussed above described an embodiment where the user profile configuration module  and the memory  are implemented in the SMP . However, in some embodiments, the user configuration module  may be implemented, in whole or in part, in other locations and on other systems. For example, user profiles may be configured on a separate device and stored to memory which is accessible by the SMP . Furthermore, the memory  may be external to the SMP .","It will also be appreciated that, in some embodiments, the user profile configuration module  may permit users to override any preferences  established by the system. That is, a user may be permitted to establish their own ringing scheme for ringing their associated devices.","While the present disclosure is described, at least in part, in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to the various components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods, be it by way of hardware components, software or any combination of the two, or in any other manner. Moreover, the present disclosure is also directed to a pre-recorded storage device or other similar computer readable medium including program instructions recorded thereon for performing the methods described herein.","Certain adaptations and modifications of the described embodiments can be made.
