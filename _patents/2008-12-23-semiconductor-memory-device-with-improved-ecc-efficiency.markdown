Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly to a NAND flash memory capable of storing multilevel data into a single memory cell using a plurality of bits.","2. Description of the Related Art","In a NAND flash memory, a plurality of cells arranged in the column direction are connected in series, thereby constituting a NAND cell. The drain side of the NAND cell is connected via a select gate to the corresponding bit line. Each bit line is connected to a write latch circuit and a read latch circuit. A read operation or a write operation is performed on all or half of the cells (e.g., 2 to 4 kB of cells) arranged in the row direction. The writing or reading unit is termed a page. In an erase operation, the threshold voltage of a memory cell is set to a negative voltage and electrons are injected into, for example, the floating gate of the memory cell by a write operation, thereby setting the threshold voltage to a positive voltage.","With the recent increase in the storage capacity, a multilevel memory which sets a plurality of threshold levels (threshold voltages) in a single cell and stores a plurality of bits of data has been developed (e.g., Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2004-192789). For example, when 4 threshold levels have been provided, 2 bits of data can be stored in one cell. When 8 threshold levels have been provided, 3 bits of data can be stored in one cell. When 16 threshold levels have been provided, 4 bits of data can be stored in one cell. When multilevel data is stored, a cell is composed of a plurality of pages. For example, when 4 threshold levels are provided in one cell, the cell is composed of 2 pages. When 8 threshold levels are provided in one cell, the cell is composed of 3 pages. When 16 threshold levels are provided in one cell, the cell is composed of 4 pages. Each page is specified by an address. The memory cell is written into, beginning with the first page.","When data is stored in a memory cell, the threshold level of a cell already written into might vary due to the influence of erroneous writing or the writing of data into an adjacent cell. As a result of a variation in the threshold level, the accuracy of the read-out data goes down. To improve the accuracy of the data, an Error-Correcting Code (ECC) is added to the data and a write operation or a read operation is carried out. Previously, when an ECC was stored, pages or sets of bits into which a page was divided were used as ECC processing units (hereinafter, referred to as ECC units).","The relationship between the threshold levels in a memory cell which stores 4-level, 8-level, and 16-level data and data written into the memory cell is as follows. For example, in a 4-level memory (4LC) which stores 2 bits in a cell, on the first page, if the threshold level is lower than read level (R Level) \u201c2, \u201d its data is \u201c1\u201d and, if the threshold level is higher than read level \u201c2, \u201d its data is \u201c0. \u201d However, on the second page, if the threshold level is lower than read level \u201c1\u201d or higher than read level \u201c3, \u201d its data is \u201c1\u201d and, if the threshold level is higher than read level \u201c1\u201d and lower than read level \u201c3, \u201d its data is \u201c0. \u201d Accordingly, the defect percentage of the second page is greater than that of the first page (second page>first page).","Furthermore, in an 8-level memory (8LC) which stores 3 bits in a cell, the defect percentage of the third page is greater than that of the second page and the defect percentage of the second page is greater than that of the first page (third page>second page>first page), meaning that the defect percentage of the third page is much greater than that of the first page. Moreover, in a 16-level memory (16LC) which stores 4 bits in a cell, the defect percentage of the fourth page is greater than that of the third page, the defect percentage of the third page is greater than that of the second page, and the defect percentage of the second page is greater than that of the first page (fourth page>third page>second page>first page), meaning that the defect percentage of the fourth page is much greater than that of the first page.","Accordingly, when a plurality of bits stored in a single cell are used as one ECC unit, this increases the ECC efficiency. However, the specifications of a conventional NAND flash memory are as follows: data is input to or read from cells page by page, starting with the beginning column address toward the end column address. Therefore, writing or reading data into or from the memory cells in ECC units has been desired.","According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device comprising: a plurality of memory cells which store k bits of data (k is a natural number not less than 2) into a single cell; a number n (n is a natural number not less than 2) of data storage circuits which store externally supplied k bits of data temporarily to write data into the memory cells; and a control circuit which selects the k bits of data bit by bit as a first page, a second page, . . . , a k-th page and which, when inputting first data, externally inputs the data on the first page, second page, . . . , the k-th page to h1 (h1\u2266n) of the data storage circuits, when inputting second data, externally inputs the data on the first page, second page, . . . , the k-th page to h2 (h2\u2266n) of the data storage circuits, and when inputting i-th data, externally inputs the data on the first page, second page, . . . , the k-th page to hi (hi\u2266n) of the data storage circuits, and which stores data into the memory cells on the basis of the k bits of data stored in the n data storage circuits.","According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device comprising: a plurality of memory cells each of which stores k bits of data (k is a natural number not less than 2); data storage circuits which temporarily store k bits of data read from the memory cells; and a control circuit which, in a read operation, reads data from n of the memory cells simultaneously, stores the data into n of the data storage circuits temporarily, selects data bit by bit from the k bits as a first page, a second page, . . . , a k-th page, and outputs data at the data storage circuits to the outside and which, when outputting first data, outputs the data on the first page, second page, . . . , k-th page at h1 (h1\u2266n) of the data storage circuits to the outside, when outputting second data, outputs the data on the first page, second page, . . . , k-th page at h2 (h2\u2266n) of the data storage circuits to the outside, and when outputting i-th data, outputs the data on the first page, second page, . . . , k-th page at hi (hi\u2266n) of the data storage circuits to the outside.","According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device comprising: a number n (n is a natural number not less than 2) of memory cells connected to the same word line, m (m\u2266n) of the n memory cells constitute one ECC unit, the n memory cells include a number i (=n\/m) of ECC groups, and in each of the i ECC groups, memory cells having column addresses near one end of the word line and memory cells having column addresses near the other end of the word line exist uniformly.","According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device comprising: a first memory which stores k bits (k is a natural number equal to 1 or more); and a second memory cell which is adjacent to the first memory cell and into which dummy data is written, when no data is written into the second memory cell.","Hereinafter, referring to the accompanying drawings, embodiments of the invention will be explained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"A memory cell array  includes a plurality of bit lines, a plurality of word lines, and a common source line.

Therefore, in the block, when the next page is not written into, dummy data is written, thereby raising the threshold level through the coupling between floating gates to secure a data retention margin. From the viewpoint of data retention, it is desirable that data which enables the threshold level of the highest threshold distribution to rise should be used as the dummy data.
