No. 12\/799,252 entitled \u201cComputing Systems And Methods For Electronically Indicating The Acceptability Of A Product\u201d filed Apr. 20, 2010 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to computing systems and methods for electronically indicating the acceptability of a product.","Medical and health care products are usually marked with a \u201cshelf life expiration\u201d or \u201cuse by\u201d date to enable medical practitioners, healthcare workers, patients and the public to determine whether or not to use a medical or healthcare product. The expiration date is generally marked prominently displayed on the product label. The label may also contain a variety of additional information, including product name, manufacturer name, location and date of manufacture, lot\/batch number, and storage conditions. Meats, fish and other food products obtainable at a supermarket are usually marked with a \u201csell by\u201d or \u201cuse by\u201d date to help customers to consume or otherwise use the food products while it is still acceptably fresh. In the case of fresh or frozen meats and fish, the \u201csell by\u201d or \u201cuse by\u201d date is generally marked on a label which is prominently displayed on the product. The label can also contain a variety of additional information, including a product description, price information, weight information, and nutritional information. Other perishable products including various personal care products and industrial products can also bear a \u201cuse by\u201d date.","Monitors are devices used to track the exposure of a host product to one or more particular conditions, such as, temperature. Monitors, such as environmental monitors, may be calibrated to indicate the presence of certain environmental conditions, or when certain environmental conditions surpass pre-set limits. Some monitors provide a visual or electronic signal to make such indications.","Use of monitors in product labels can give consumers, patients or other end users some assurance that a given product is acceptable for use by providing some degree of protection against using products that may be ineffective or spoiled because of aging or adverse conditions.","Other factors can also detract from the acceptability of commercial products. For example, a product may be counterfeit and have little or no acceptability. Some measures taken to prevent or identify counterfeit products include various track-and-trace methods which can trace the movement of a product from its manufacturer or other legitimate source to a consumer or other user to assure authenticity. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) and barcodes are two technology methods which can be used to help implement traceability.

The label in  includes additional details as indicated in the region of the label  below the monitors ,  and authentication element . In one embodiment, the information shown in region , a subset thereof, additional information or different information can be displayed as an acceptability report as described herein. The monitors may be environmental history monitors. An environmental history monitor may indicate one or more conditions of the environmental history of the host product with which it is associated, for example, the environmental history monitor may indicate past exposure of the host product to one or more environmental conditions. The environmental history monitor's appearance may change with time to indicate the changing value of a monitored condition.","One example of an environmental condition which can be monitored by the environmental history monitor is heat exposure. The environmental history monitor can monitor heat exposure, either as an average cumulative temperature or as the occurrence of a temperature either above or below a specific temperature for a particular duration. Examples of such heat monitoring environmental history monitors may include cumulative time-temperature indicators, freeze indicators, thaw indicators and threshold indicators which can indicate a single event of past exposure to a temperature above ambient, or above another predetermined temperature.","Other environmental conditions which environmental history monitors may monitor include humidity, mechanical shock, gas exposure, oxygen exposure, toxin exposure, chemical exposure, biological agent exposure, actinic radiation exposure, x-ray exposure, and\/or microwave exposure.","Various environmental monitors, and various constructions of time-temperature indicators, that display a capturable indicator image, or other capturable indication of a monitor state, can be employed in the practice of the invention will now be described. A monitor, can include a time-temperature indicator (\u201cTTI\u201d herein) comprising one or more colorless, or light-colored diacetylene monomers that develop color as they polymerize. The progressive color development can occur at a rate that increases with temperature. Some examples of suitable time-temperature indicators employing various diacetylenic compounds are disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,999, 946; 4,189,399; 4,384,980; 5,045,283; 5,053,339, and 5,254,473; to Patel, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,789,637 and 4,788,151 to Preziosi et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008\/0004372 by Prusik et al., 2009\/0131718 by Baughman et al. and 2011\/0086995 by Castillo Martinez et al., the disclosures of each of which patents and patent publications are incorporated by reference herein.","A monitor can include a multifunctional time-temperature indicator which integrates two indicator types into a single device. For instance, such a multifunctional time-temperature indicator can include a primary indicator, which can develop a color change as a result of a particular cumulative time-temperature exposure, and a secondary indicator, which can be set to trigger at a predetermined temperature. Some examples of such multifunctional time-temperature indicators are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,434 to Prusik et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 7,490,575 to Taylor et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.","A monitor can include an activatable time-temperature indicator system that includes a color-forming time-temperature indicator system that may be affixed to a product label so that the indicator composition is coextensive with a barcode. Upon expiration of the useful shelf life of a host product, the color density may reach a level which obscures the barcode sufficiently to register in a barcode reading system, for example, a retail market computer system, as a failed or unsafe product. Some examples of such activatable time-temperature indicators are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,544,925 to Prusik et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","A monitor can include a temperature-activatable time-temperature indicator that includes an optically readable, thermally sensitive indicator element that is intrinsically thermally responsive at or above an activation temperature and employs an indicator element that includes a synthetic polymeric material such as a side-chain crystallizable polymer, for example, as disclosed in patent application Ser. No. 13\/238,686 by Huffman et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","A monitor can include a combination radio frequency identification device (\u201cRFID\u201d herein) and environmental condition indicator tag. Information supplied by the RFID, for example, product ID and related data, may be machine read by interrogation of the RFID at an inspection station and the visual condition indication may be optically read by machine at the same station. The signals can be utilized locally at the inspection station or may be used at locations remote therefrom. Some examples of such a combination RFID and environmental condition indicator tag are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,209,042 to Martin et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Alternatively, the environmental condition indicator may have electrical properties that may be read by the RFID device. For example, such an indicator could be an environmental indicator based on the etching of an aluminum film by an acid, such as is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009\/0301382 by Patel et al.","The solid-state polymerization of diacetylene monomers and co-precipitated monomers to polymers are useful as, and in, time-temperature indicators. The monomers can be prepared as active agents on a substrate, or could be activated on demand by a number of methods including solvent evaporation, melt recrystalization, acid formation, metal formation, salt formation or the associated removal of the acid, metal or salt. Some examples of such methods and devices are disclosed in the patent publications referenced previously herein as disclosing time-temperature indicators employing various diacetylenic compounds.","Time-temperature indicators can include an immobilized enzyme which can react with the substrate to produce a color change in time and temperature dependent manner. Photo induced coloration by radiation of spiropyrans having a temperature dependent decoloration can be used as a time-temperature indicator.","Time-temperature indicator s can include an upper layer carrying a first reactant and a base layer carrying a second reactant adapted to react with the first reactant upon triggering. TTIs can be formed from thermal paper and an activating film placed on the thermal paper. An indicator can be mixed with a portion of a food product and detects food spoilage directly, for example, pH change, through, for instance, detecting m-nitrophenol, p-nitrophenol and litmus changes from green to red\/pink.","A time-temperature indicator may have two surfaces that remain adhered when brought together: an acid-base indicator in one and an activator in the other. A time-temperature indicator can be based on an azo coupling reaction between a capped diazonium component and a coupling component. An enzyme based time-temperature indicator including urease to consume urea to generate ammonia and carbon dioxide, which may cause a pH change causing color change in a pH indicator.","Time-temperature indicators can be prepared from a free radical-sensitive dye and peroxide on a carrier. Time-temperature indicators can include a diffusion layer capable of transition above a defined temperature. An indicator film can be placed on one side of diffusion layer and be separated from a reactant material capable of producing a color change when in contact with the indicator film.","Time-temperature indicators can be produced using vapor permeation techniques. Activatable time-temperature indicator can include an oxygen-sensitive dye coating and a removable oxygen barrier over the coating. In one embodiment, the environmental marker can include a threshold temperature indicator with a delayed color change. In one embodiment, a DEGMARKER is an environmental marker that is configured as a threshold temperature indicator to indicate a temperature excursion above a threshold (e.g. above 40\u00b0 C.). In addition, a vaccine vial monitor is a time-temperature indicator that is shaped and otherwise configured for use with vaccine vials. Some of the environmental monitors described herein have a reflective coating or cap such as a bubble, laminate layer, substantially hemispherical cap, or other surface which can cause glare or other unwanted optical effects. A human viewer can overcome such adverse optical effects using various perceptual skills However, when a machine or camera is used to capture image data with respect to a color sensitive indicator, glare or other optical effects can lead to incorrect results or cause the processing system to fail.","In part, such problems can occur because detection algorithms used to identify a circular environmental monitor or other regularly shaped monitor may attempt to find a master shape which encompasses the regular shape as it appears when viewed from different perspectives. For example, in the case of a circular monitor, the image data collection system is configured to implement an ellipse tracking routine because from a non-top down viewing angle, the circle is seen as an ellipse. Various processor-based methods for addressing this are described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in some embodiments, the environmental monitors can include a matte finish or an anti-glare layer to improve monitor detection during optical processing. In addition, given a set of known issues, such as expected color changes or colors that are difficult to resolve, or color ranges associated with various monitor configurations, the software modules configured to process image data can be sensitized to certain colors or otherwise pre-configured based on monitor-specific characteristics. For example, some cameras may have difficultly detecting a red state associated with an expired condition. Accordingly, the software module can specify a low red threshold or window to improve the likelihood that such a monitor state will be detected when it exists.","In one embodiment, the authentication element  may establish or verify the authenticity of the host product with which the monitor is associated. The authentication element may be readable by a human or a machine. For example, the authentication element can include an area printed with a special ink, a symbol, or an object which is difficult to reproduce and which, in other embodiments, may also visually change with time. The authentication element may be incorporated into the identification element and\/or monitor. The identification element may include information referencing the authentication element. If such information, for example, fails to verify the authentication element , a person or a computer scanning or reading the element can determine that the label and possible the product to which it is applied is counterfeit.","In one embodiment, the authentication element  can provide capturable information enabling the host server, or another suitable remote entity, to verify, or evaluate the authenticity of the host product. Some embodiments of the invention can enable the host server, or another suitable remote entity, to interpret information from the authentication element to determine that the host product is authentic, or is counterfeit and does not originate from a supplier of the authentic host product, or is diverted, or parallel traded, and originates from the supplier of the authentic host product, but has been distributed through an unauthorized distribution channel. Some or all of this information can be included in an acceptability report, if desired. The host server, or another suitable remote entity, can use information captured from the authentication element and the identification element, if employed, to help determine authenticity, for example, by consulting a database to determine whether a combination of information captured from the authentication element and the identification element is a valid combination of information indicating an authentic host product. Information captured from the environmental monitor can also be employed to help evaluate the authenticity of the host product, if desired.","In one embodiment, the identification element indicates the identity of the host product. For example, an identification element may include a one-dimensional barcode, a two-dimensional barcode, a three dimensional barcode, or an RFID device. The identification element can be printed and be visible to a human and\/or machine-readable. For example, the identification element can be printed with an ink that reflects primarily in the near-infrared and can be read with a digital camera that is sensitive to near infrared light. The identification element can be accompanied by a human readable equivalent of the identification element, for example a string of text, icons, pictographs or other human-recognizable graphics or symbols.","By way of further example, an authentication element or identification element employed in the practice of the invention can include an optically readable graphic, symbol, indicia, mark, character, alphanumeric character, or pattern, or a combination of any individual one, or multiple ones, of the foregoing optically readable elements. The optically readable element, or elements, can be rendered in any suitable medium, or media, for example, an optically variable diffractive device, or other device, that creates a change in appearance when viewed from different angles, a color-shifting ink, a hologram, a microlens array, iridescence, luminescence, a guilloche, a thermochromic ink, infrared ink, machine-readable optical information, microtext, nanotext, microscopic graphics, pen revealable marking, laser authentication, watermarking, digital watermarking, metamerism, embossing, intaglio printing, or a combination of two or more of the foregoing media. The authentication element can be overt, which is to say, apparent and visible to the human eye, unaided by special viewing equipment such as a microscope not normally employed by the viewer for reading, or covert, which is to say having a concealed or hidden feature, or features, that is, or are, not apparent, and can only be viewed with special reading, or viewing, equipment.","The identification element may be unique and identifies the host product with which it is associated. The identification element may include an item identifier that indicates the identity of a specific individual host product for example a stock-keeping unit.","In one embodiment, the identification element may include a serial global trade identifier number (SGTIN). For example, a \u201cSGTIN-96\u201d tag. A SGTIN-96 tag data specification provides six fields that are to be set for each tag and the combination of all six fields ensures each tag's uniqueness. The six fields are as follows: a header comprising 8 bits; a filter, comprising three bits which can specify if the tagged object is an item, case or pallet; a partition, which is three bits and indicates how the subsequent fields are divided to get the correct data for each; a company prefix, which comprises 20-40 bits (depending on the partition); an item reference, comprising 24-4 bits (depending on the partition) which can comprise the item's global trade identification number \u201cGTIN\u201d; and a serial number, which is 38 bits and contains the item's unique serial number.","The identification element may be compatible with an e-pedigree code used for pharmaceutical tracking. In one embodiment where the identification element includes an RFID or other electronic device, the identification element may include an electrical or optical device to read the other elements of product label , such as one or more monitors  and  and\/or authentication element . Monitors, such as environmental history monitors, may generate both electrical and visual signals indicating exposure to one or more environmental conditions. Such electrical signals may be output to an associated RFID that otherwise acts as an identification element.","The information from monitors  and , authentication element , and identification elements  and  of product label  may be accessible by photocapture, scanning, pattern recognition, image comparison, such as by using image capture and communication devices ,  and , or by human recognition.","As shown in  according to one embodiment of the present invention, product label  may be configured for attachment to a case containing one or more sales units of a pharmaceutical product. Product label  may be self-adhesive or otherwise attachable to the case. Product label  may be printable in a single pass or in multiple passes. The entire label  may be printable. One or more monitors, authentication elements, and\/or identification elements may be separately fabricated and then attached or applied to label . It is noted that product label  may include one or more monitors, authentication elements, and\/or identification element that are not physically embedded or otherwise located on the same surface or housing; however, in such an embodiment, the monitors, authentication elements, and\/or identification elements would be associated with the same one or more host products.","As shown in  according to one embodiment of the present invention, label  may include in a header row at the top of the label, identification element , a two-dimensional barcode , and monitor . Beneath the header row, the label has the drug name and strength, prominently displayed. Beneath the drug name appear additional data, such as, a product or list number, for example, 1 55Z5555 555 555; a batch or a lot number, for example, F 66666; an expiry date for the drug or other host product; a notation as to the case contents, for example, 10 units per case; a sales unit description, for example, 2 syringes per carton; a date of manufacture of the drug; storage conditions such as a permissible range of temperature variation and a storage type, for example, refrigerated storage; the name of the supplier; the location of the manufacturing plant; and the date and time of dispatch and a case number, for example, 72\/1000. Identification element  may include a product number which may be the same as or different from the product\/list number. The identification element  may be the same as or different from the product expiration date and a batch or lot number. Some or all of the information in identification element  may be encoded into identification element . Identification element  can include one or more authentication elements, for example, a serial number or a code correlated with other information on label , which uniquely identifies the host product unit, for example, a case, and hinders counterfeiting. Authentication element  may include one or more identification elements. In another aspect, monitors  and\/or  may include one or more identification and\/or authentication elements.","In one aspect, monitor  is an environmental history monitor that operates as a time-temperature indicator. The monitor  can be read once a subset of image data associated with it is determined to provide a monitor state such as whether the monitor was or was not exposed to an unacceptable temperature range. In addition, the identification element  can be an identifier, such as a barcode or other symbol or code that contains information therein or contains links to a database to identify a file and related information associated with an entity, person, or object. In one embodiment, the identifier can include a patient identifier, a biological specimen identifier, such as an identifier of an organ for transplant or of other biologic material, package shipping, tracking, rejection, delivery or other similar information, a clinical trial participant related identifier or a candidate drug identifier, or other source of information suitable for encoding or using the identifier or accessing a database using the identifier. A patient identifier can include biometric information, such as a finger print, a retinal image, or other patient specific biological features suitable for imaging using a mobile or fixed camera or imaging system.","In one embodiment, monitor  is an environmental history monitor that operates as a time-temperature indicator. Monitor  can include two or more color regions, such as, an active zone  and an optional reference zone , which zones can have any suitable shape. For example, active zone  can be rectangular, as shown, square, polygonal, circular, strip-like, or have another regular shape or an irregular shape, and reference zone , if employed, can have a circular outer periphery and extend around, or surround, active zone , as shown, or can have another shape and\/or disposition.","Active zone  can change color. For example, active zone  can darken in response to cumulative temperature exposure over time that is outside of acceptable limits for the host product. This color change can be a monitor state. If active zone  appears as dark as or darker than reference zone , monitor  is indicating, by visual signal, that the host product with which it is associated is no longer acceptable for use, or may no longer be acceptable for use. The degree of darkening can relate quantitatively to the cumulative time-temperature exposure experienced by monitor . An appearance of active zone  that is less dark than reference zone  can indicate that an associated host product may have an acceptable condition.","In another embodiment, active zone  can lighten in response to cumulative temperature exposure over time that is outside of acceptable limits for the host product. In such an embodiment, if active zone  appears lighter than reference zone , monitor  is indicating, by visual signal, that the host product with which it is associated is no longer acceptable for use, or may no longer be acceptable for use.","In a further embodiment, any suitable color parameter, or combination of color parameters, detectable in active zone  can be compared with the corresponding color parameter or color parameters detectable in reference zone , for example, grayscale reflectivity, grayscale density, color optical density, RGB values, Lab values, brightness, hue and\/or color intensity. Any of these comparisons can indicate a monitor state. In a further embodiment of the invention, reference zone , can include multiple sections for example from two to six sections, with different appearances corresponding with different cumulative time-temperature exposures, which can indicate different conditions the host product may have, for example, \u201cfresh\u201d, \u201cstill fresh\u201d, \u201cuse now\u201d, and \u201cnot acceptable\u201d.","An acceptability report can include a corresponding indication of the probable condition of the host product derived from information imaged from active zone  and, optionally, from reference zone . These zones can be stored in memory of a device such as a mobile device and processed as subsets of a set of image data. Any of the color parameters or other optical parameters associated with an environmental monitor disposed on a product label can be analyzed with respect to reflectance parameters, dynamic range, ambient light levels and other parameters using image data captured on a per frame basis by a camera.","Further, an identifier, such as a barcode, graphic symbols, indicia, or other marks can be used as supplemental label data to help process the image data with greater accuracy or speed. Supplemental label data can inform the software performing the image data processing about the shape of an object upon which the label is disposed, about the type and characteristics of the environmental monitor on the label, about the relative spatial positions of elements on the label, about tracking information relating to when the identifier was previously scanned, and\/or about any other parameter relating to the elements on the label.","With respect , a given label  can include a substrate which may be paper, plastic or another material. The substrate may be part of a box, vessel, parcel, package, or other container, and label  can be disposed thereon. The container can contain one or more host products or host product items. The elements , , , , , and , variously, can be disposed on or in the substrate and positioned adjacent to each other, or at predetermined distances from one another, such that a given element serves as a fiducial relative to another element or elements, or to a border or a boundary of the label. A given label can include a border, a boundary shape or shapes or other geometric elements that can be resolved relative to a given background and elements disposed on the label while image data is being captured by the camera. Such geometric elements or borders can be used by a detection or a processing module to identify which element is a barcode, text, a monitor or another element. These geometric elements can also be configured to serve as authentication elements.

By way of example, and not limitation, such a computer readable medium can comprise flash memory, RAM, ROM, electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to store digital information on a mobile device.","It is to be appreciated that  illustrates software that can act as an intermediary between a user and the basic resources described in mobile device . Such software preferably includes an operating system and one or more software modules configured to process labels  and other features of the invention. The operating system, which can be resident in storage , can act to control and allocate resources of mobile device .

Additional details relating to the software architectures and software modules suitable for use in an embodiment of the invention are shown in .","The computer readable medium tangibly embodies a program, functions, and\/or instructions that cause the mobile device or other suitable image capture and communication device to operate in a specific and predefined manner as described herein. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, however, that the process described below may be implemented at any level, ranging from hardware to application software and in any appropriate physical location. For example, the present invention may be implemented as software code to be executed by mobile device  using any suitable computer language and may be stored on any of the storage media described above, or can be configured into the logic of mobile device . Such software code may be executed by mobile device  using any suitable programming language, such as C, and using a graphic processing unit and a central processing unit in parallel.","Prior to discussing some of the software components in more detail it is informative to consider the general operation of a mobile device relative to an exemplary interaction with a label  such as shown in , A and B.  shows an exemplary mobile device \u2032 that can include all or a subset of the components shown in  or additional features or embodiments relating to the present invention as described herein.","More specifically,  shows a mobile device \u2032 having a flash-equipped camera  in communication with a network  and disposed in juxtaposition to a product label  to image the product label . A non-product label or another product label  is also shown. For the purposes of explanation the product label  includes the information shown in label  in . The camera can be a video camera or a non-video camera such as a still camera. The camera is configured to capture one or more image frames imaging a part of product label , or the entire label. In one embodiment, a user can inspect label  and manually hold the camera in the juxtaposition shown to capture information on the label including information relating to the authentication, the identifier, and a monitor, as shown in .","Although the label  is shown as one continuous label, in one embodiment, one or more labels or imageable elements can be provided, optionally from different sources. Thus, a second label or other object  can also be imaged before or after label  is imaged as a first label. The second label or other object  can include identifiers, monitors and other elements as described herein relative to label ,  and otherwise. In one embodiment, the second label or other object  can include an identifier such as a barcode or other scannable or imageable element associated with a patient, such as a hospital bracelet with a barcode, a tracking or shipping company label, an organ transplant tracking device, or other type of label or tracker that relates to the use, storage, consumption, transport of the product having label .","In response to capturing one or more frames of image data of the label  from one or more positions, a report  such as an acceptability report can be displayed on the mobile device  using its display or touch screen as applicable. For example, report  can be an acceptability report on the acceptability of a host product associated with label  and\/or second label or object . Report  can be in human-comprehensible format for example in text or other written characters, optionally accompanied by graphics, icons or the like. Usefully, report  can be comprehended, or read, without undue difficulty, by an average literate adult, without using special equipment. If desired, report  can be output from mobile device \u2032 to a printer, for example via an IR interface, and printed on paper, or an equivalent. Further, report  can be output audibly, if desired, for example, from an audibilizing component of mobile device \u2032. In one embodiment, to simplify the user experience, when data is being captured, data capture can occur over time and, optionally, multiple frames can be captured from one or more viewing angles relative to the label . In one embodiment, the best frames are used and others are dropped. While in another embodiment, frames of image data can be compared to one another and the results used to compensate for glare and to identify the different elements present in or on a given label.","In one embodiment, the process starts with a user selecting an application on the device \u2032 relating to scanning a label or evaluating a product identifier or another process. In response to that selection, a graphic user interface can present the user with various options and instructions. In some cases, the instructions can address lighting considerations, optionally based upon information obtained by device \u2032 from detection of ambient lighting conditions. The instructions may indicate that the ambient lighting conditions are such that the label cannot be imaged and can initiate one or more light pulses from the flash during image data collection. Alternatively, device \u2032 can instruct the user to use an external light source such as a lamp or sunlight. Since color perception depends on the color balance of the incident light, it may be advantageous in some cases to employ light of known color balance using a lighting source which may be available for taking pictures with the image capture and communications device. In one embodiment, the flash can be controlled to supply light having a predetermined color balance.","Alternatively, by using a standard light source, external to the imaging device, enhanced measurement of color levels may be obtained. A user interface can display instructions to a user relating to whether or not external light is needed. However, in some embodiments of the invention, the mobile device and camera can collect desired label data without employing external lighting, simplifying the data collection process for a user. Data collection can be handled using multiple frames of data as outlined below in one embodiment.","As shown in , mobile device \u2032 is positioned relative to a label  having various elements disposed therein as described herein with respect to , B, and elsewhere. Image data can be collected using the camera  in the presence of light \u03bb which can be ambient light, one or more flashes from mobile device \u2032, an external light source or other types of light. In one embodiment, one frame of image data captured using the camera  with respect to the label , and\/or label , may be sufficient to perform one or more of: authenticating of element , identifying monitors  and , obtaining a reading or exposure level from monitors  and , identifying and processing an identification element , such as a 2D barcode, and capturing any other text or information such as the product information shown in , namely, product name \u201cVaccine A,\u201d reference number \u201c51220\u201d and the date \u201cDec. 1, 2014.\u201d Once these processes are performed or the data is collected, the image data can be relayed to a host server for processing or storage or processed on the device \u2032. A report , such as an acceptability report, can be displayed on the mobile device as shown.  show examples of possible acceptability reports. These reports can be generated remotely using captured image data or on the mobile device.","As noted herein, glare, blur and other unwanted optical effects can interfere with a device's ability to resolve a barcode, an environmental monitor, or find the ellipses or other shapes used by a detection module to find the relevant locus for a given environmental monitor or other element on a label. In addition, activating a mobile device application and capturing video or a plurality of frames as stills or video is easier for a user than having to position a label relative to an overlay or use an external light source.","To help address these issues, in some embodiments, the image data can be collected as a plurality of frames, such as video for example, captured from device \u2032 as it moves along a suitable trajectory relative to the label. Thus, moving the device \u2032 from position A to B and from B back to A and\/or moving the mobile device \u2032 from position C to D and\/or moving the mobile device \u2032 back from position D to C, as indicated by the arrows in , can be helpful. In addition, instructions for executing such a movement or movement pattern or an appropriate freeform movement of the mobile device, can be communicated to a user on the device's display. During the movement, multiple or continuous frames of image data can be collected from the label  and\/or from the label  from various differing imaging angles. In one embodiment, the location (GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular, or otherwise) and phone number information of the mobile device \u2032 is transmitted using the mobile device \u2032 and, optionally, stored in a database with respect to one or more frames of image data or for each image data capture session. This information can be used in various reports and to confirm and\/or record the device and location of a label processing event.","Capturing multiple frames of data can allow data frames with errors, such as high glares to be ignored. In addition, by time indexing frames and\/or tracking accelerometer readings, using an accelerometer-equipped mobile device \u2032, or using other parameters, frames of image data can be differentially analyzed to better identify the elements on a label and better resolve readings. Also, correlations between image data frames can be used to effectively filter out glare or otherwise determine correlations that increase the accuracy of the algorithm, such as a detection module, executing on a server or the processing unit to accurately distinguish an environmental monitor from another region of a given label. For vials with curved surfaces, monitors with low intensity material but hard to read color changes, smeared barcodes, and other hard to resolve label elements, differential analysis and additional sets of data frames can improve the reading and processing of labels.","In addition, the flash can be triggered in all data frame captures or in some and not others such that an additional known change in the data set can be used to improve imaging accuracy. Similarly, when barcode or other symbols are used on the label, black and white regions (or other patterned or colored regions) can be used to evaluate the dynamic range of the image data captured by the camera, i.e. the limits of one or more of the various optical parameters that are exhibited by the particular captured image data set.","Special symbols can also be placed around monitors or other elements on which an algorithm can key to improve a detection process for a given element on the label or a reading process for a given label element. Examples of special symbols that can be employed include small L-shaped corner brackets that can provide a distinct image under a variety of lighting conditions and can demark an image area within which the algorithm can locate a monitor image, barcode image or other element image to be recognized. The mobile device can include information regarding possible images that may be present in the image data captured by the camera and which are to be recognized by, and can be accessed by the algorithm. In addition, an element on the label such as a barcode or a number can include information or index information in a database that specifies what other elements are on the same label and which positions should be interrogated to obtain an environmental exposure level in a given set of image data. Because the indicator, barcode, monitor have different appearance and optical properties that can all be individually identified, having additional data to process or ignore as well as making use of predetermined known features of a given label can facilitate image data processing that results in accurate acceptability reports.","In one embodiment, an application programming interface (API) is used to control or otherwise use the camera and\/or the flash in the mobile device. Embodiments of image processing software according to the invention can modify the API or override it such that software modules pre-installed on the device to facilitate label  imaging and processing receive raw image data. By controlling the camera, application programming interface, or other software or hardware component used to control the camera, one embodiment of image processing software according to the invention prevents the image data captured using the camera from being pre-processed. For example, some mobile devices generally pre-process the image data in various ways, such as by performing a white balance filter or red eye reduction or other processing steps. The software described herein can override such preprocessing and permit acquisition of raw camera data. In this manner, the image data collected can be free of color correction modifications, and can include an indication of the exposure level of incoming light to the mobile device and the label under inspection. Under some circumstances, if image data pre-processing is not prevented, the application of a contrast, white balance, or other filter can result in errors when trying to identify or read an element on a given label, for example, an environmental monitors.","In order to quantify the colors of the reference zone, color reference zone, and active areas of a monitor, it may be necessary to calibrate the image with knowledge of the color values of black and white in the image. These values can be obtained by measuring the color values of the black and white components of the bar code. Other known or predetermined label components can also be so used.","As shown, in , an imaging device such as a mobile device \u2032 has captured image data which has been processed to generate a report  which is displayed on the device. In one embodiment, this report can be an acceptability report. In another embodiment, report  can include any data suitable for populating a record management system generated during, or derived from, capturing and processing image data with respect to a product having a label. For example, the interactions and events that occur between a first entity and a second entity relative to a host product associated with a product label, such as label , can be tracked and recorded in one or more databases using a mobile device. The tracking and recording can be enabled by scanning a second label , associated with the second entity, which label  has one or more identifiers, monitors, text, authentication elements, and other elements as described herein.","In one embodiment, the report  can include medical data such as patient data. Thus, if the product label  was affixed to a vaccine vial, or other vaccine container, a record of a possible vaccination of the particular patient, can be generated as a result of the mobile device scanning the label and a patient identifier, such as from a second label  or object, as part of the image data capture shown in . If the conditions of use are known, for example, a medical professional may be known to be performing the scanning in conjunction with the administration of the vaccine, the vaccination event can be recorded with a high degree of confidence. A data file can be pre-processed or analyzed using a rules engine or other logical system such that transactions are interpreted and routed to a database of a medical record management system, thus providing a record of the procedure for the patient. In this case, a patient identifier scanned in the same session as the scan of a vaccine container for the patient can be interpreted by the software to indicate that the patient was vaccinated. The date and location of the vaccination can automatically be generated using the time stamp of the mobile device and its GPS reading. Thus, an acceptability report can contain such transactional information as well as information revealed by the product label as to whether the associated host product is acceptable or unacceptable for use. Shipping and tracking information associated with the label  can also be included in the report  and can enhance the report with information regarding the start and end of the distribution itinerary for the host product bearing label  and . Shipping and tracking information can be supplied to the report  by a host server and\/or by mobile device \u2032. For example, mobile device \u2032 can provide delivery information derived from label  and\/or label , which can optionally include addressee information derived from a patient identifier, a written address or another label element. If the user scans label  and\/or label  just prior to a use of the host product mobile device \u2032 can also provide information as to the likely date of use and\/or time of use provided by a date\/time clock on mobile device \u2032 as well as location information if mobile device \u2032 has a GPS functionality or another location providing functionality. In another example, label  can be scanned to yield medical product serial number information and label  can be scanned to yield patient information enabling a host server to link the patient to that particular serialized medical product item.","Examples of acceptability reports are shown in . As shown in , an acceptability report indicates that the product associated with the label may be used because the authenticity, environmental conditions, (in this case, temperature) and expiration date checks performed relative to the label were all marked to indicate they were within acceptable limits. In contrast, as shown in , the acceptability report indicates that the product associated with the label with respect to which image data was captured should not be used. This conclusion and the associated instruction to the user (\u201cDo Not Use Product\u201d) can be easily understood by the user because although the authenticity and expiration date checks are marked as acceptable, the temperature exposure as checked via one or more environmental monitors was marked to indicate it was not within acceptable limits. For example, if the product having the label was exposed to excessive heat or cold conditions or exposed to unsuitable conditions for too long, the indicator read from a monitor, the relevant monitor state reflects these events. In turn, the monitor image data provides evidence that a software application can interpret to make an acceptability decision.","Verification of acceptability of host products, e.g. biological pharmaceuticals, that have a preferred cold storage requirement, but that can be exposed at room temperature e.g. for transport, for a limited time period is possible using the software-based system described herein. The environmental monitor(s) may be responsive to different types of environmental stimuli. Examples of such stimuli can include, without limitation, cumulative temperature exposure, exposure to a temperature above a threshold, or exposure to a temperature below a threshold. For example, an environmental monitor that measures time above a threshold temperature can be used for verification of acceptability of host products, e.g. biological pharmaceuticals, that have a preferred cold storage requirement, but that can be exposed at room temperature e.g. for transport, for a predetermined time period. The image data associated with scanning such a label can be used to automatically identify the relevant environmental monitor and determine a color change indicative of whether or not such a predetermined time period has been exceeded.","As shown in  at step , in one embodiment of the present invention, an image capture and communication device may analyze a product label  (as shown in , A, and B) for a host product. Based on its analysis, for example, by scanning for visual or electronic signals indicative of one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements present on product label , the image capture and communication device determines a type and one or more features for each of the one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements, as shown at step .","In one embodiment, the type of an authentication element, monitor, or identification elements indicates to the image capture and communication device how the image capture and communication device may retrieve data from the authentication element, monitor, or identification element. For example, the type of an identification element may be a one-dimensional barcode, which may indicate to the image capture and communication device to scan the barcode and interpret the barcode data. In another example, the type of a monitor may be an environmental monitor with an active zone and a reference zone, which may indicate to the image capture and communication device to capture an image of the two zones for comparison. In another example, the type of an authentication element may be RFID, which may indicate to the image capture and communication device to send an interrogation signal and retrieve the data from the RFID.","The one or more features for each of the one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements are features associated with the type of authentication element, monitor, and identification element that are used to provide data stored in the authentication element, monitor, and identification element. For example, if the type of identification element is a one-dimensional barcode, the features may be the lines and\/or numbers associated with the barcode. In another example, if the type of monitor is an environmental monitor that includes an active zone and a reference zone, the features of the monitor may be the color of the active zone and the color of the reference zone. In another example, if the type of authentication element is RFID, the features of the authentication element may be the data stored in the RFID.","As further shown in  at step  according to one embodiment of the present invention, the image capture and communication device may access the one or more host servers  (as shown in ). The image capture and communication device may accomplish such access by connecting to host servers  through network  (as shown in ) and\/or cellular network  (as shown in ). In other embodiments, the image capture and communication device may connect to host servers  through a direct satellite link. Once the image capture and communication device is either directly or indirectly connected to the host server, the image capture and communication device may transmit the type and features for each of one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements present on product label , as shown at step . The image capture and communication device may transmit the type and features to the host servers  (as shown in ) via short message service (SMS) text message, TCP\/IP messaging, email, FTP, PIN email, and\/or instant message.","The image capture and communication device may receive an acceptability report from host servers  (as shown in ) based on the type and features for each of one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements present on product label , as shown at step . The image capture and communication device may receive the acceptability report from host servers  (as shown in ) via SMS text message, TCP\/IP messaging, email, FTP, PIN email, and\/or instant message. In further embodiments, the image capture and communication device may receive the acceptability report from the host servers  (as shown in ) by the host servers  providing a uniform resource locator (URL) to a website for the image capture and communication device to access through cellular network  (as shown in ) or network  (as shown in ). In such embodiments, host servers  (as shown in ) post the acceptability report to the website available at the URL.","As further shown in  at step  according to one embodiment of the present invention, the image capture and communication device may display the acceptability report. For example, image capture and communication devices , , and\/or  may output a text-based and\/or graphical-based acceptability report on display devices such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), light emitting diode (LED) display, or cathode ray tube (CRT) display.","The acceptability report may include text, symbols, and\/or graphics indicating any of the following: whether the host product is acceptable to use, whether the host product is authentic; product identification data; product history data, including the environmental history of the host product; instructions on how the user should proceed based on the host product's acceptability; pedigree detail, such as, a SGTIN and\/or pedigree verification; and whether a new expiration or use-by date is provided based on the environmental exposure. If the host product is a pharmaceutical product, a link to download a patient information sheet may be included. In addition, late breaking warnings as to possible adverse reactions, product recall information, directions, or requests, or a link to such information, may also be included in the report. The acceptability report may include a link for the holder of the host product to re-order or return the host product. Such information may be triggered by data received from the one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements.","The acceptability report may be output audibly by the image capture and communication device. For example, the image capture and communication device may use text-to-speech routines or speech libraries located on either the host servers or image capture and communication device. Such embodiments may help vision-impaired users understand whether a host product is acceptable to use.","As shown in  at step , according to one embodiment of the present invention, one or more image capture and communication devices , , and  (as shown in ) may analyze a monitor with a type and one or more features based on the type for a host product. The one or more image capture and communication devices may take a still picture or image of the monitor. At step , the one or more image capture and communications devices may determine the type of monitor and the one or more features based on the type. At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may determine whether the one or more features and\/or type indicate that the monitor contains a color reference zone, which has a reference area and an active area, such as are included in monitor  (as shown in ).","If the features and\/or type indicate that the monitor contains a color reference zone, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may measure one or more first pixel locations of the reference area or reference color area on the label or as part of the monitor and one or more second pixel locations of the active area. In one embodiment, the measuring at step  is done through executing pattern recognition routines. At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may derive a first RGB value of the reference area or reference color area based on the one or more first pixel locations and a second RGB value of the active area based on the one or more second pixel locations. At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may convert the first RGB value to a first color space value and the second RGB value to a second color space value. At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may compare the first color space value to the second color space value. For example, color space values may be grayscale, which is obtained by calculating the average of the RGB values. Another color space value example may be cyan OD, which can be obtained by calculating the negative of the logarithm to the base  of the R value expressed as a fraction of its full-scale value.","At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may determine whether, for example, the still image or picture contains sufficient color resolution for the one or more image capture and communication devices or the one or more host servers  (as shown in ) to derive color space values accurate enough to provide all available product information from the monitor. For instance, it is possible that if the lighting conditions are poor and the an image capture or communication device may not have created enough light, the image capture and communication device may still have retrieved sufficient data to determine whether the active zone is darker or lighter than the reference zone, but not sufficient data to accurately determine the degree of darkness and lightness necessary to derive more data from the comparison.","Thus, if the one or more image capture and communication devices determine that the still image or picture does not contain sufficient color resolution, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may determine whether, based on that comparison (at step ), the host product is acceptable for use. In further embodiments, because of the lack of sufficient color, any acceptability data generated downstream may indicate whether the host product is acceptable, but may not accurately indicate the degree of acceptability, for example, the degree of exposure to a particular condition. In such an embodiment, the degrees of acceptability may be omitted from acceptability reports.","In one embodiment, if the color resolution at step  is not sufficient to obtain an accurate color measurement and accurate determination of the degree of acceptability, it may still be sufficient to place the color value in a region of acceptability. For example, in one embodiment four regions of environmental exposure can be defined, with boundaries at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of permissible environmental exposure. Other examples can employ a different number of exposure regions and different permissible boundaries. The color measurement may have sufficient accuracy and resolution to determine in which of the regions the exposure occurs. These regions can in turn be used to calculate whether or not the environmental exposure of a given label and associated product warrant that it can be reported as acceptable for use or require it to be reported as unacceptable for use.","If the one or more image capture and communication devices determine that the still image or picture does contain sufficient color resolution, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may determine whether, based on that comparison (at step ), the host product is acceptable for use and may indicate the degree of acceptability of use in any acceptability report generated downstream. In one embodiment if the active zone's color may darken in response to cumulative temperature exposure over time outside of acceptable limits for the host product. If the active zone's color is as dark as or darker than reference zone, the monitor may be indicating by visual signal that the host product with which it is associated is no longer acceptable for use. In another embodiment, the active zone's color may lighten in response to cumulative temperature exposure over time outside of acceptable limits for the host product. In such embodiments, if the active zone's color is lighter than reference zone's color, the monitor may be indicating by visual signal that the host product with which it is associated is no longer acceptable for use.","If, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices determines that the features and\/or type indicate that the monitor does not contain a color reference zone, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may measure one or more first pixel or color locations of the active area. In one embodiment, the measuring at step  is done through executing pattern recognition routines. At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices determines, based on the type and\/or features of the monitor, whether the monitor provides information, such as environmental condition, by color. If the monitor provides information by color, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may derive a first RGB value of the active area based on the one or more first pixel or color locations. At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may convert the first RGB value to a first color space value. At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may compare the first color space value to a set of values based on the type and\/or features of the monitor in order to determine if the color space value is less than, equal to, or greater than the set of values. Based on the comparison (at step ), the one or more image capture and communication devices, at step , may determine whether the host product is acceptable for use.","If the monitor does not provide information by color, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices determines whether information is provided by determining a particular visual pattern on the monitor. For example, in one embodiment, if certain environmental conditions are present, a symbol may appear in the active area, such as a check mark as shown in monitor  in . At step , if the visual pattern is present on the monitor, the one or more image capture and communication devices may determine, based on the visual pattern, whether the host product is acceptable for use. Depending on the type and features of the monitor, the existence of a visual pattern may indicate that a host product is or is not acceptable for use; or, the visual pattern may need to be interpreted in light of other data, such as other data from other monitors, authentication elements, and\/or identity elements, in order for the image capture and communication device and\/or host servers to determine whether the host product is acceptable for use.","At step , the one or more image capture and communication devices determines whether the image capture and communication device is directly or indirectly connected to one or more host servers  (as shown in ) through network  (as shown in ). If the one or more image capture and communication devices determines that it is connected to one or more host servers through network , the image capture and communication device may, at step , transmit data including the type, features, comparison results (at steps  and\/or ), and\/or determination results (at steps , , , and\/or ) to the one or more host servers. At step , the image capture and communication device may receive data from the host server that is associated with the one or more host product that is associated with the monitor and output the data in the form of an acceptability report (as described in step  in ). Such data may include the host product's name, strength, presentation (for example, pre-filled syringe, vial, ampoule, etc.), quantity, product identification number, serialized numeric identifier (SNI), SGTIN, numeric drug code (NDC), lot number, expiration date, location of manufacture, date of manufacture, storage conditions, date\/time and condition of unit from each reading including identification, authentication and monitor, site of reading or GPS information, identity of reading device or person or entity making the reading, product specific information (for example, specifications, package insert, use instructions, etc.), recall status, warranty information, product coupons for discounts, notice of product status change (for example, if the product is subject to a recall or other action, notice could be automatically sent to the last entity reading the acceptability device), notice to reorder product, information and emergency call or e-mail addresses.","If the one or more image capture and communication devices determine that it is not connected to one or more host servers through network , at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices determine whether they can transmit a message, such as SMS, through cellular network  to the one or more host servers. If the one or more image capture and communication devices determine that they can transmit a message, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may receive data from the host server that is associated with the one or more host products that are associated with the monitor. In one embodiment, the data may be in the form of a link, such as a URL, that references a webpage that hosts an acceptability report that the one or more host servers have generated (as described in step  in ).","If the one or more image capture and communication devices determine that they cannot transmit a message, at step , the one or more image capture and communication devices may output to the user an acceptability report based on the results of the comparisons and determinations at steps , , , , , and\/or .

Based on its analysis, the image capture and communication device determines a type and one or more features for each of the one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements, as shown at step .","At step , the image capture and communication device may access the one or more host servers  (as shown in ). Once the image capture and communication device is either directly or indirectly connected to the host server, the image capture and communication device may transmit the type and features for each of one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements present on product label , as shown at step . The image capture and communication device may receive an acceptability report from host servers  (as shown in ) based on the type and features for each of one or more authentication elements, monitors, and\/or identification elements present on product label , as shown at step . In addition, the acceptability report may also take into account historical information about the host product, including the data collected at the site of manufacture, inbound and outbound at the supply chain intermediary user's location, and at the end-user location or place the end-user used the host product.","In a further embodiment, any data collected by any image capture and communication devices from product label  may be taken into account as historical information for the product acceptability report. The image capture and communication device may receive the acceptability report from host servers  (as shown in ) via SMS text message, TCP\/IP messaging, email, FTP, PIN email, and\/or instant message. In further embodiments, the image capture and communication device may receive the acceptability report from the host servers  (as shown in ) by the host servers  providing a uniform resource locator (URL) to a website for the image capture and communication device to access through cellular network  (as shown in ) or network  (as shown in ). In such embodiments, host servers  (as shown in ) post the acceptability report to the website available at the URL.","At step , the image capture and communication device may output the acceptability report. At step , based on the outputted acceptability report, either the user of the image capture and communication device\u2014or the device itself\u2014may determine whether the host product is acceptable for use. At step , if the host product is not acceptable for use, it may not be re-stocked or repackaged and may be sent for destruction. In a further embodiment, the acceptability report may include instructions transmitted or generated by the manufacturer about what the manufacturer should do with an unacceptable product. If the product is acceptable for use, at step , the host product may be restocked, repackaged, and\/or re-issued to a supply chain intermediary user and\/or end-user.","In steps -, the one or more image capture and communication devices may be the same image capture and communication devices, different image capture and communication devices, or the same device for some steps and different devices for other steps. In one embodiment, a mobile device or a host server can correlate information from an environmental monitor with known product item history information, for example, distribution information, an e-pedigree, and\/or environmental monitor information from other comparable product items, to evaluate credibility of the environmental monitor information, and use the evaluation to help determine authenticity. The outcome can be included in the acceptability report.","In one embodiment, the invention includes providing an image capture and communication device with contact information or security tokens or information to permit secure communication with an authentic supplier-approved host server and, optionally, to prevent security breaches or to prevent communication with a counterfeit or unsecured host server. For example, authentic supplier contact information or security features can be embedded in the software application installed on the image capture and communication device for imaging labels and processing the image data.","In one embodiment, the invention relates to software modules or executable code configured to transmit high resolution images of a product label and\/or individual label elements to host server. In one embodiment, a resolution-reducing procedure, such as a compression scheme used to reduce image file size is overridden or by-passed, if such a procedure is used by the device for remote communication. With high resolution data thus preserved, software modules such as automated image data filters can process a high resolution image received at a remote site to effectively magnify the image, or localize areas of the image that contain pixels of interest, such as the pixels that constitute the patterned region of a bar code or the colored pixels indicative of monitor state for an environmental monitor. In turn, the software can be configured to automatically interpret elements not visible to normal human inspection of a product label. This interpretation can verify authenticity, for example, by reading microtext, or other information not readily apparent to a human viewer unaided by special viewing equipment, such as a microscope, can determine color changes in a monitor that can be compared to a database of optical values, or can convert a barcode into the data it contains or to links to or in a database.","In one embodiment, the invention relates to executable code or software modules that can generate a viewing frame to frame a product label area or areas to be captured, optionally with cooperative markings on the label. This process or method can include providing a viewing frame geometrically adapted, along with an appropriate user instruction, to cause the image to be captured while viewed at a particular viewing angle, optionally with two or more such viewing frames providing two or more viewing angles. These viewing angles allow for imaging an optically variable device such as an authentication element or a portion of same, from different perspectives to facilitate reading the optically variable device. Accordingly, by obtaining multiple frames of image data the software can selectively ignore unwanted frames or analyze a common feature, such as an authentication element, across multiple image data sets. The executable code can include user instructions to position the viewed image in relation to the viewing frame so that the viewed image is positioned at a predetermined distance from the image capture and communication device for image capture, if desired, optionally with a predetermined orientation, such as parallel to the label, or another positioning parameter.","Additional Computer and Mobile Device Based Embodiment Details","The present invention may be embodied in many different forms, including, but in no way limited to, computer program logic for use with a processor (e.g., a microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor, or general purpose computer), programmable logic for use with a programmable logic device, (e.g., a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or other PLD), discrete components, integrated circuitry (e.g., an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)), or any other means including any combination thereof.","In one embodiment of the invention, some or all of the image data and subsets thereof are processed and transformed using a set of computer program instructions or software instructions that is converted into a computer executable form, stored as such in a computer readable medium, and executed by a microprocessor under the control of an operating system.

Alternatively, if the mobile device lacks sufficient processing power or if a large number of labels are being processed, or for another reason, a compressed version of the image data can be relayed to a remote server such as a host server for processing of the image data. In turn, an acceptability report or other data derived from the image data can then be returned to the mobile device by the server.","In one embodiment, an image capture and communication device is programmed with, or otherwise has, one or more executable software applications installed thereon, or accessible therefrom, that exchange label data, patient data, entity data, image data, and\/or other types of data with a detection process software module, optical compensation software module, report generating software module, data processing software module, user interface software module, scripting instruction software module, other software modules and\/or one or more host servers.","Computers and computer systems described herein may include operatively associated computer-readable media such as memory for storing software applications, or instruction sets, used in obtaining, processing, storing and\/or communicating data.
