title: System and method for updating dataset versions resident on a wireless device
abstract: A system and method for selectively updating the versions of stored datasets on a wireless device that selectively communicates to a wireless network and downloads datasets, such as software applications and information, from download servers on the wireless network. The wireless device has a resident dataset version summary file that identifies the version of each resident dataset, and upon the wireless device attempting to communicate with the download server, the wireless device compares the version of each specific resident dataset listed in the resident dataset version summary file with the version of downloadable datasets resident on the download server to thereby determine if the version of a wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of a download server resident dataset. If the download server resident dataset is more recent, the wireless device can download it to overwrite the wireless device resident dataset.

Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to wireless networks and computer communications across wireless networks. More particularly, the invention relates to the updating of the version of an application or data resident on a wireless device when the wireless device connects to a download server that has a more recent version of the wireless device resident application or data.","II Description of the Related Art","Wireless devices, such as cellular telephones, communicate packets including voice and data over a wireless network. Cellular telephones themselves are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held personal digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d). Some wireless devices, such as select cellular telephones, may have an installed application programming computer platform that allows software developers to create software applications that operate on the wireless device.","It is anticipated that systems and methods will be developed to download applications to a wireless device. Accordingly, it is desirable to have a system and method by which applications and data on a wireless device may be updated efficiently, taking into account the environment, constraints and impacts of transferring information in a wireless network.","Embodiments of the invention include systems and methods for selectively updating the versions of stored datasets on a wireless device that selectively communicates to a wireless network and downloads datasets, such as software applications, information and other data, from download servers on the wireless network. One system includes one or more wireless devices where each wireless device has a computer platform with at least one data file resident thereon, and the wireless device is in selective communication to a wireless network and downloads datasets from download servers across the wireless network. The computer platform of the wireless device further has a resident dataset version summary file that identifies the version of each resident dataset, and the version summary file is updated whenever a resident dataset is updated. This system also includes one or more download servers that are in selective communication to the wireless network and are each selectively in communication with the one or more wireless devices and selectively downloading datasets thereto, with each download server updating its resident datasets that are selectively downloadable to wireless devices and recording the version of each specific updated downloaded server resident dataset.","In one embodiment, when the wireless device attempts to communicate with a download server across the wireless network, the computer platform of the wireless device compares the version of each specific resident dataset listed in the resident dataset version summary file with the version of the downloadable dataset resident on the download server to thereby determine if the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset. The stored record indicating the version of the download server resident dataset can be held in a update summary file resident on the download server, and upon a wireless device attempting to communicate with at least one download server across the wireless network, the computer platform of the wireless device comparing the update file of the download server to the version summary file of the wireless device to thereby determine if the versions of the wireless device resident datasets are different from the versions of the download server resident datasets. The simple comparison of the update summary files will inform the wireless device if a more recent version of any of the wireless device datasets is present on the download server without needing to make the comparison sequentially, i.e., comparing dataset to dataset.","After the wireless device determines the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset, the computer platform of the wireless device downloads the download server resident dataset to supplant the wireless device resident version and be executable on the wireless device. To download the more recent version of the dataset from the download server, the computer platform of the wireless device can prompt the user of the wireless device to communicate with the download server to download the different version of the download server resident dataset to be executable on the wireless device. This function is especially useful if the owner of the wireless device will be charged for the network connection time to download the new version of the application or data from the download server. Otherwise, the computer platform of the wireless device can automatically download the different download server resident dataset to be executable on the wireless device once the newer version of the dataset is detected on the download server.","A method for selectively updating the versions of stored datasets on a wireless device includes communicating from the wireless device to the download server across the wireless network, comparing, at the computer platform of the wireless device, the version of each specific resident dataset listed in the resident dataset version summary file with the version of the downloadable dataset resident on the download server; and determining if the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset based upon the comparison. The method may include, upon determining the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset, downloading the different download server resident dataset to the computer platform of the wireless device from the download server to be executable on the wireless device. To download the new version on the download server, the method can include prompting the user of the wireless device to communicate with the download server to download the different version of the download server resident dataset to be executable on the wireless device or such downloading can be done automatically upon determining the download server resident dataset is a different version than the wireless device resident dataset.","If the stored records indicating the version of the download server resident dataset is held in a version update summary file resident on the download server, comparing the wireless device and download server datasets may be performed by comparing at the computer platform of the wireless device the version update summary file of the download server to the version summary file of the wireless device to thereby determine if the versions of the wireless device resident datasets are different from the versions of the download server resident datasets.","The above method may include a wireless device that can perform the above functions in creating and comparing wireless device version summary file with an update summary file of the download server to determine if the versions of the wireless device resident datasets are different from the versions of the download server resident datasets. Further, because the method is executable on the computer platform of the wireless device, the method may include a program, in a computer readable medium, that directs a wireless device having a computer platform to perform the steps of the method.","Systems and methods are anticipated that provide for the downloading of software applications to a wireless device. Software applications can come pre-loaded at the time the wireless device is manufactured, or the user may later request that additional programs be downloaded over cellular telecommunication carrier networks, where the programs are executable on the wireless device. As a result, users of wireless devices can customize their wireless devices with programs, such as games, printed media, stock updates, news, or any other type of information or program available for download from application download servers through the wireless network.","In one scenario, if the user of the wireless device desires to download and use a software application or other data using a wireless network, the user will typically either call a service provider or contact the service provider through other means, such as through an Internet access, and the service provider will either transmit the application or data to the wireless device across the wireless network or allow the user access a network site where the application or data is downloadable or accessible. To connect to the application download server, the wireless device bridges a communication connection to the wireless network, such as a cellular network, and then attempts to contact an application download server where the desired software application is resident. Once the wireless device contacts the application download server, an initial connection is made and the application download server determines what applications and data are available to the wireless device and sends the appropriate information, such as a menu, for display on the wireless device so the user can learn of the available applications and data. After access is provided to the downloadable applications, the user of the wireless device can download any of the available applications or data.","A problem that may arise is that the version of the application or data that the wireless device downloads to be resident thereupon can be updated or altered at the application download server, and the wireless device resident application or data has no simple manner to be likewise updated. The update problem is exacerbated as the wireless device does not always communicate with the application download server every time the wireless device bridges a communication to the wireless network. Because the communication connection from the wireless device to the application download server can be expensive (especially in a cellular network), it is otherwise very expensive for the wireless device to periodically connect to the application download server and check for more recent version of application or software. Furthermore, while each wireless device resident application or data can be checked against its parallel version resident on the download server every time a connection is made to the download server, such checking would lengthen the connection time and cause more expense to the wireless device owner.","Accordingly, systems and methods consistent with the present invention include updating applications and data resident on a wireless device with the most recent version stored on a download server that the wireless device is connected to. Such systems and methods should be able to determine if more recent versions of the wireless device resident applications and data are present on the download server without significantly lengthening the connection duration in order to effect a full comparison of all wireless device resident applications and data. It is thus to the provision of such a system and method of checking and updating wireless device resident applications and data that the present invention is primarily directed.","It is an object to provide systems and methods whereby the datasets, such as applications, information and other data, resident on a wireless device can be updated with the most recent version of the dataset resident on a download server that the wireless device is connected to. The present invention allows a rapid determination as to whether more recent versions of the wireless device resident datasets are present on the download server, and such determination does not significantly lengthen the connection duration between the wireless device and download server. The present invention thus provides an advantage in that it gives a wireless device the ability to quickly execute a full comparison of dataset versions with a download server and download any newer version of a wireless device resident dataset.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates an embodiment of a system  for providing subscribed software applications to one or more wireless devices, such as cellular telephone , in communication across a wireless network  with at least one network server, such as application download server , that selectively downloads or provided access to software applications or other data to the wireless devices across a wireless communication portal or other data access to the wireless network . As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone , a personal digital assistant , a pager , which is shown here as a two-way text pager, or even a separate computer platform  that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection  to a network or the Internet. The system  can thus be performed on any form of remote computer module including a wireless communication portal, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, access terminals, personal computers, access terminals, telephones without a display or keypad, or any combination or sub-combination thereof.","The application download server  is shown here on a local server-side network  with other computer elements in communication with the wireless network , such as a database  with stored applications and data that contains software applications and data that are accessible and downloadable to the wireless devices , , , . There is also shown other network servers, such as server  and stand-alone network server . The servers  and  can be application or data download servers, or other types of servers that interact with the wireless devices , , ,  as are known in the art. The servers , ,  may have software applications, patches, files, keys, graphics data, compression algorithms, and any type of general data, collectively referred to hereinafter as \u201cdatasets,\u201d resident thereupon that can be accessed by the wireless devices , , ,  as is further described herein. It should be noted that server-side functions as described herein can be performed on one server, such as application download server . Further, a computer server-side computer platform can provide separate services and processes to the wireless devices , , ,  across the wireless network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["14","10","14","12","18","20","22","14","16","28","30","32","16","30","32","40","40","42","40","42","40","42","42","44","42","44","44","12"]},"The wireless device, such as cellular telephone , has a computer platform  that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from the application download server  or other network servers , . The computer platform  may also include an application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) , or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) layer  that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  also includes a local database  that can hold the software applications, file, or data not actively used in memory , such as the software applications or downloaded from the application download server . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","The wireless device, such as cellular telephone , can access and download many types of applications, such as games and stock monitors, or simply data such as news and sports-related data. The downloaded data can be immediately displayed on the display or stored in the local database  when not in use. The software applications can be treated as a regular software application resident on the wireless device , , , , and the user of the wireless device can selectively upload stored resident applications from the local database  to memory  for execution on the API . The end-user of the wireless device , , ,  can also selectively delete a software application from the local database  whereby other applications and data can be downloaded into the cleared storage space.","With reference to , the computer platform  of the wireless device (such as cellular telephone ) will have a data or file structure resident thereon. The category Files  within it the API file called BREW , representing the API in the platform, in this case the BREW\u2122 API developed by QUALCOMM\u00ae, Incorporated, and BREW  contains an applications file  with a specific chess game held in a chess folder . All of these files can be \u201cversioned\u201d wherein updates to the data in each file give the file a different version to identify what changes have been made in the data. The server, such as application download server , will keep its own resident copy of the application and data files such that a wireless device , , ,  contacting the server can download copies of the applications and data to selectively overwrite the wireless device resident copy.","The present invention allows the creation of \u201csummary files\u201d of the versions of some or all datasets resident on the wireless device , , ,  or download server, such as application download server . As shown in , the download server , ,  preferably maintains a download server dataset update summary file , and the wireless device , , ,  will maintain wireless device dataset version summary file  that contain or reference some or all files on the server or computer platform  respectively.","The system  thus selectively updates the versions of stored datasets on a wireless device , , ,  attempting to communicate with at least one download server (application download server ) across the wireless network , through the computer platform  of the wireless device comparing the version of each specific resident dataset listed in the resident dataset version summary file  with the version of the downloadable dataset resident on the download server, preferably stored in a download server dataset update summary , to thereby determine if the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset. And upon determining the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset, the computer platform  of the wireless device can download the download server resident dataset to overwrite the old version of the application or data resident and be executable on the wireless device , , , . Other methods can be used on the download server , ,  to provide version information to wireless devices , , , , such as a header for each dataset file, a direct comparison of the dataset after a predetermined duration since download, or a command can be present in the wireless device-download server handshake that informs the wireless device to compare a specific dataset to determine if the wireless device has the most recent version.","The download server dataset update summary file  can identify the versions of files or datasets resident on the download server, such as a graphics data that is present in a welcome screen file, device drivers such as a graphics driver file, and the chess file . The wireless device dataset version summary file  has parallel files to those resident on the download server dataset update summary file  and can compare each version of the datasets through a simple file comparison between the download server dataset update summary file  and the wireless device dataset version summary file  and locate different version numbers. The summary files  and  are shown here as having a greater number indicating a more recent version of the dataset. Other systems and method could be used to indicate the version difference as would be known in the art, such as an alphanumeric or other symbolic system that is predefined such that the computer platform  of the wireless device , , ,  can determine if an individual download server resident dataset is a newer version than the wireless device resident dataset.","In the structure shown in , if a version number of the download server resident dataset is greater than the version number of the wireless device resident dataset, then the computer platform  of the wireless device , , ,  will download the newer version of the dataset from the download server , , . After it has been determined that a newer dataset version is on the download server, the computer platform  of the wireless device , , ,  can prompt the user of the wireless device , , ,  to communicate with the download server to download the different version of the download server resident dataset to be executable on the wireless device. The prompting of the user to make the communication may be important in certain circumstances, such as if the owner of the wireless device , , ,  will be billed for the communication connection. Otherwise, upon the determination that the version of the wireless device resident dataset is different from the version of the download server resident dataset, the computer platform  of the wireless device , , ,  can automatically download the different download server resident dataset to overwrite the wireless device resident dataset.","The specific process executing on the wireless device, such as cellular telephone , is shown in the flowchart of .

If the download server keeps track of changes to resident dataset versions in a manner other than an update summary file , then decision  would be made in accord with the other method. If there is not a download server dataset update summary file  present at decision  (or other version comparison method present), then the connection to the application download server  is otherwise completed step , and the version update process is terminated. If there is a download server dataset update summary file  present at decision , then the download server dataset update summary file  is retrieved by the wireless device ,,, as shown at step , and the first parallel dataset version for which the wireless device has a resident copy of is fetched, as shown at step .","A determination is then made as to whether the download server resident dataset is a more recent version than the wireless device resident dataset, as shown at decision .
