{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The disclosed embodiments relate in general to an aerial delivery system, and more particularly to providing aerial delivery while mitigating a risk of injury.","Natural disasters often result in a lack of food or clean water for the first 48-72 hours after the disaster occurs as a result of infrastructure damage, for example, power plants, water treatment plants, roads, ports and runways. Airdrops of humanitarian aid supplies such as medical supplies, food and clothing provide needed relief in these situations. In a related area, forestry fire fighters are generally resupplied with food and water by aerial delivery of multiple 50 pound bundles. Various military ground operations may require resupply of ammunition, clothing and rations through aerial delivery, and both military and commercial organizations may seek to provide information to a population through aerial delivery.","Present airdrop capabilities, in particular, humanitarian food and water drops, suffer from drawbacks including a lack of ability to deliver water and a large injury risk posed by delivery mechanisms including containers, skid boards and large food items, for example, Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) or Humanitarian Daily Rations (HDRs). The U.S. and British armies and private industry have used impact attenuators in several forms for aerial delivery. For example, external struts comprised of inner and outer cylinders that force hydraulic fluid through an orifice to dampen impact have been used on spacecraft capsules as well as on aircraft main landing gear. These systems provide great control over the force\/time curve, however they are expensive, complicated, and beyond the expertise of the average rigger. Airbags have also been used in several military applications. The British have used a specially designed platform, the Medium Stress Platform (MSP), with recesses to house deflated airbags for cargo airdrop. Upon exit from the aircraft, the airbags inflate and attenuate the load during impact. This system utilizes a fixed venting area, resulting in a peaked force\/time curve, where a \u201crectangular\u201d profile is desired. The rectangular force\/time curve can be obtained with airbags using variable venting areas, adding to the cost and complexity of the system. As much of the stroke of the airbag is used to build the pressure, the system is often excessively large, leading to possible hazards on the ground, including re-inflation of the airbag and payload roll over. In addition, the aircraft-platform interface has to be modified to accept these platforms.","Present delivery systems also suffer from clumping, where items have a tendency to clump together and fail to disperse over the drop zone. Furthermore, items that clump together generally fall faster and experience a much harder impact, reducing their survivability and usefulness after landing and creating a danger for those on the ground in the drop zone.","It would be advantageous to utilize an airdrop system that overcomes these and other problems and safely disperses various items directly over a population.","The disclosed embodiments are directed to an aerial delivery system including at least one container mounted on a platform, an impact attenuator initially interposed between the container and the platform, an activation tether arranged to cause contents of the container to disperse, and rigging material attached to the impact attenuator, the platform and the activation tether and configured to rotate the platform to face upward and the impact attenuator to face downward during aerial delivery.","The disclosed embodiments are also directed an aerial delivery system having a plurality of containers mounted on a platform, an impact attenuator initially interposed between the containers and the platform, a rigging arrangement passing through the impact attenuator and the platform, the rigging arrangement including an activation tether arranged to cause contents of the containers to disperse, and a suspension point attached to an end of the activation tether, the rigging arrangement configured to rotate the platform to face upward and the impact attenuator to face downward during aerial delivery.","These and other aspects and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. Moreover, the aspects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","Referring to , one embodiment of an aerial delivery system  incorporating aspects of the disclosed embodiments is illustrated. The aspects of the disclosed embodiments are generally directed to an aerial delivery system that allows for dispersion of items directly above an active population while mitigating the risk of injury. The disclosed embodiments at least provide for releasing items in tiers for improved dispersion and to avoid clumping, reconfiguration of impact attenuator material after deployment, and retention of all delivery components to avoid injury to the active population.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","108","104","106","110","100","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","106","106","106","202","204","206","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["106","108","106","108","108","310","312","108","302","306","202","206","106","304","302","108","202","204","106","308","306","108","206","208","106"]},"As shown in , each piece of rigging material ,  may be laced so that ends  of the first piece of rigging material , and ends  of the second piece of rigging material , extend from the impact attenuator  and exit through a side of the platform  facing away from the impact attenuator .

The rigging material ,  and suspension point  may then be draped over the impact attenuator and the suspension point  may be attached to the activation tether .","As shown in , enclosure net  is placed over the impact attenuator  with at least the activation tether  extending through and operating to retain the enclosure net . In some embodiments, the suspension point  may also extend through the enclosure net . Additional rigging (shown in ) may secure the enclosure net  to the impact attenuator  or the platform . The containers  are stacked on the impact attenuator over the enclosure net  in alternating tiers with each tier oriented lengthwise perpendicular to the next. The containers  may be filled before assembling the aerial delivery system  or may be filled as each tier is assembled. In at least one embodiment, lanyards  are attached to adjacent containers  in each tier and then to one of the tiered attachment points  of the activation tether , as shown in . While the lanyards  are shown attached to the bottom of the containers , it should be understood that the lanyards may be attached to any portion of the containers so long as the contents of the containers are effectively emptied from the containers during deployment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","100","910","110","915","112","920","102","112","915","920","112","915","920","608","600","920","606","600","910","110","112","104","900","608","600","920"]},"In a HALO deployment, the parachute  inflates upon exit from an aircraft and descends with the enclosure net  and containers  as shown in . Upon reaching a prescribed altitude or exceeding a prescribed time duration, the release mechanism  releases the enclosure net  and containers from the parachute  as shown in . As the separation distance increases, the still attached activation tether  extends and the lanyards  attached to each tier of containers  cause the containers  to change orientation, for example to invert, and their contents  are dispersed tier by tier as shown in . Advantageously, the tiered release reduces clumping of the contents and provides for improved dispersion over the drop area. All the components of the delivery system , including the parachute , containers , enclosure net , platform  and impact attenuator  remain attached to activation tether  and lanyards  as shown in . As the activation tether  extends, the suspension point attachment  of the activation tether  pulls on the rigging suspension point  (), causing the platform  and impact attenuator  to rotate and change orientation with the platform  facing up and the impact attenuator  facing downward before touching down. The down facing impact attenuator operates to reduce or eliminate injury to ground personnel from the delivery system during touch down.","In a direct deployment, the enclosure net  and containers  separate from the parachute  upon exiting the aircraft. Similar to the embodiment above, as the separation distance increases, the still attached activation tether  extends and the lanyards  attached to each tier of containers  cause the containers  to change orientation and their contents  are dispersed tier by tier. In direct deployment, the containers  also remain attached to the lanyards  and activation tether .
