{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/065,284 filed Feb. 10, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to the field of applications for Internet based websites. Moreover, it pertains specifically to a method and system for ranking a plurality of artists using a popularity profile generated for each artist from data gathered among sources accessible via the Internet. In the preferred embodiment, the popularity profiles will provide music artists with the ability to track and view their ranking and popularity.","2. Description of Related Art","Numerous online companies exist that purport to gauge the popularity of artists, particularly music artists. One famous example is Billboard.com, the online version of the long-standing purveyor of song and album charts, which ranks top-selling artists. A more recent example is last.fm, which provides music artist rankings based on song plays. The major problem with Billboard and its ilk is that the rankings are too limited. These companies highlight the top few hundred musicians at best, which is only a tiny portion compared to the hundreds of thousands of musicians that play to U.S. listeners. Moreover, they rank the musicians using only one or two criteria such as retail store sales and online song downloads. The same criticism can be said of rankings for other artists, such as authors. Only a relative handful of authors are ever showcased because the rankings are generally no more than best-seller lists.","The emergence of mashup sites combined with social networking tools has begun to address the limitations of the more conventional ranking sites. iLike.com, for example, provides lists of popular music based on the recommendations of listeners. Some sites like indiecharts.com provide a mashup of top artist lists (mainly from last.fm) along with rankings generated from voting by the listeners on the site. These are incremental improvements, but they still focus only on a narrow range of criteria as well as ignore the vast majority of artists who will never make it onto a \u201ctop 100\u201d or \u201ctop 500\u201d list.","In this sense, these tools are no more effective than sites like Billboard.com in showcasing the many artists whose sales or media presence may not be strong enough to lead the conventional top-seller lists but who nevertheless provide desired content for particular genres or niches\u2014the \u201clong tail\u201d of the market.","In view of the limitations now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new and useful Internet based method and system for ranking artists using a popularity profile, which is simpler in use, more universally functional and more versatile in operation than known applications of this kind. It is also a purpose of the present invention to provide a new Internet based method and system for ranking artists using a popularity profile which has many novel features not offered by the prior art applications that result in a new Internet based method and system for ranking persons using a popularity profile which is not apparent, obvious, or suggested, either directly or indirectly by any of the prior art applications.","The goal of present invention disclosed herein, otherwise referred to as \u201cThe Popularity Profiling System,\u201d is to create a profile of an artist's popularity which he can track and view via a website or Internet-connected device. Artists may include musicians, book authors, filmmakers, painters, and other creators of art and content. The popularity of a music artist, for example, would be gauged not merely on music sales or song downloads but would also include a plethora of additional data available via the Internet\/world wide web. The key motivation of the invention is the notion that what artists want most is to see the fruits of their creativity and effort enjoyed by others and to achieve some measure of appreciation, perhaps fame, however small or great their sphere of influence in the world. This is a far more powerful desire than merely making money (and most artists make little or no money from their craft). And what fans want most is to enjoy a variety of content as well as to be able to spot trends and artists that interest them, especially within particular niches and music genres. No other tools or companies exist which adequately serve these needs. The \u201csecret sauce\u201d of the company is the power of the PPS to capture and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data from any number and variety of sources and to translate that data into a meaningful set of scores with which to rank artists.","The Popularity Profiling System disclosed herein provides bands and musicians with the ability to track and view their ranking and popularity. This is achieved, in part, by amalgamating data about a band or musician's online presence and activity, including their participation and reception on social networking sites, as well as music plays and downloads from web sites such as a personal web page, a blog, a MySpace page, a FaceBook page, a YouTube page, or online stores like iTunes and CD Baby, among numerous other sites for which a band or musician has listed their information and\/or provided their music for streaming or downloading. Music enthusiasts can quickly see which bands and musicians truly are the top artists as well as identify the up-and-coming artists in the world. Ranking may be broken down into particular niches (e.g. location, socio-economic and demographic characteristics of listeners, etc.) and music genres, while bands and musicians can see how they rank amongst other artists in their particular genre, as well as within the entire music industry. Moreover, music artists can use the Popularity Profiling System to help them promote their music more effectively.","The Popularity Profiling System aims to help musicians determine where their music ranks within a particular niche or music genre, as well as within the entire music industry, so as to help them find better ways to promote their music. This is achieved in part by The Popularity Profiling System's use of web crawlers, spiders, and\/or scrapers to circumnavigate the Internet looking for data about a particular band or musician (e.g. how many MySpace friends, how many downloads on iTunes, how many plays on last.fm, how many blog posts, etc.). The information or data that is gathered is then processed utilizing proprietary software to achieve, in part, a relative point system as well as other factors to determine the positioning of the band or musician within the ranking system, placing them either above or below other artists that have also been profiled. As such, the ranking system is fluid and changes continually, providing a more holistic and accurate representation of an artist's popularity.","The metrics for determining the popularity profile of an artist include, but are not limited to: online sales, retail sales, file sharing, peer-to-peer network metrics such as number and frequency of files of artist content shared, number and frequency of online song plays (or content views), number and frequency of radio station song plays, social network (e.g. MySpace, FaceBook, etc.) metrics such as number of friends\/fans, number of videos (and their plays) on YouTube and similar video-sharing sites, total page views of websites showcasing the artist, music fan and enthusiast voting related to the artist, reviews of the artist or his content, blog posts related to the artist, number of songs published by the artist, non-music merchandise sales and other factors not referred to herein which may represent a scalable or measurable factor for determining popularity ranking and is therefore to be considered apparent and obvious to the disclosure contained herein.","The Popularity Profiling System also provides artists with the ability to incorporate widgets and badges on their websites (including their MySpace page, Facebook page and the like), allowing them to display their ranking(s). In one embodiment, a musician can place a widget or badge on his website and his fans can vote for the musician by interacting with the widget or badge (typically by clicking on a button), which effectively provides for user-generated input into the profiling system. Additionally, music critics, journalists, enthusiasts and the like can write reviews of each ranked band, which are then analyzed, ranked by readers, or otherwise scored and incorporated into the calculation of the musicians' popularity profile and ranking. Further, The Popularity Profiling System also allows bands, musicians and artists to create surveys and allow their fans, listeners and music enthusiasts to take these surveys either on the company's web site or through third party web sites, blogs and online applications. As with reviews written by music critics and enthusiasts, the surveys are analyzed and incorporated as part of the popularity profile data utilized by The Popularity Profiling System.","It is to be understood that the present invention may embody a method and process for conducting and hosting a variety of internet based contests through the main service website that will allow bands or individuals to compete against each other in a variety of goal, ranking, vote, popularity, sentiment or other type of result-based competition, including but not limited in use to, \u201cThe Most Improved Band or Individual\u201d, \u201cThis Month's Hottest Band\u201d, \u201cAmericas Hottest Band or Individual Musician\u201d, \u201cNext Big Thing\u201d, \u201cWorlds Most Popular\u201d, and a variety of other contest embodiments not referred to herein which can result from use of the present invention disclosed herein of The Popularity Profiling System.","It is to be further understood that the main service website disclosed herein may offer users a method of advertising to other members or users of the website including offering a main community members advertising page whereon a user can solicit or search for artists or band members or other services in a manner which displays free or paid ads to website users.","The website may further offer each user or artist a web page which is specific to that user which can then be advertised, promoted, linked to, or otherwise utilized by the band or user as their own web page specific to the parameters set forth by the main service website, whereby the band or user would pay a periodic or one time fee for the webpage, or will be allowed use of the web page as part of a paid membership to the main service website.","Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purposes of illustration, anyone of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following embodiments of the invention are set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon, the claimed invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","102","103","104","100"],"i":"a, b "},"All systems , , and communicate using a document transfer protocol such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or any other document transfer protocol known in the art, such as FTP, Gopher, WAIS, XMLP, etc. The client  includes a browser program, such as an HTML browser, capable of submitting requests using the HTTP protocol in a manner known in the art. If the client  requests the URL for the PPS Server , then the PPS Server  would return an HTML page in which the user at the client may make further requests.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","101","200","210","220","230","240","101"]},"1. Agent Framework ","PPS Agents are organized into five categories as follows.","1.1 Data Retrieval Agent ","A Data Retrieval Agent  retrieves predefined data from an information server  using either a third-party API or via extraction from HTML scripts using a web scraper. A Retrieval Agent generally focuses on accessing one source and extracting the criterion data from that source. The criterion data is passed through the Popularity Profile Engine so that it can be processed\u2014and any relevant scoring can be updated\u2014before the data is stored in the database.","A Retrieval Agent  can execute on the same server as other components of the Popularity Profiling System or it can execute on a separate server. In the preferred embodiment, one or more Retrieval Agents  reside on a separate sever and store data they retrieve into a local database existing on the same server. When a Retrieval Agent completes a retrieval task, it reports its status to the Agent Manager , seeks permission from the Agent Manager  to copy the data in its local database to the central database , and writes that data if permission is granted. The Agent Manager  is responsible for coordinating the activities of the Retrieval Agents , including what criteria data or portion thereof an agent  will attempt to retrieve. Hence, several Retrieval Agents  can be executed simultaneously in order to retrieve data from an information server , wherein each agent  requests a subset of the data from the server .","Retrieval Agents  are customized for their particular data sources. A MySpace Retrieval Agent, for example, would be coded with specific instructions on how to access MySpace web pages from an information server  containing relevant band information (or how to employ a 3party service to do it), and it would extract that information from the retrieved web page(s) and place it into the database .","Further, the availability of application programming interfaces (APIs) for accessing data is rapidly increasing. Facebook recently unveiled an API for accessing its member data. Most of the other large social communities, including MySpace, LinkedIn and Orkut, have joined a consortium organized by Google to offer a common API referred to in industry as the OpenSocial API. A brief examination of the OpenSocial API, as well as Facebook API, suggests that access to member data is very limited for the time being, most likely to concerns over privacy and abuse by spammers and advertisers. last.fm has also announced that it is in beta testing for its API but it is not known at the time of this document the extent to which the company will provide access to artist data, esp. song play and download stats.","In short, over the long term it is expected that APIs will make data access much faster and easier from a variety of sources, but web scraping may still be needed over the short term to harvest the data needed.","Anyone of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations exist involving data mining and web scraping. It is intended that the use of other methods and variations of data mining and web scraping not specifically mentioned in this document but known in the art are within the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","103","301","212","211","302","212","240","212","103","103","304","212","305","212","306","212","103","240","307","212","220","221","224","308","220","225","309","240"],"sup":"rd "},"Commonly, data is retrieved in the form of an XML file that is parsed by the Retrieval Agent to extract relevant data that is then inserted into the database for later use by other objects, notably data visualization tools. Many sources offer APIs with which to access data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","103","300","306","401","212","103","402","212","103","403","103","212","103","404","212","405","212","240","406","212","211"]},"Data retrieval from sources lacking an established API can be facilitated by the use of 3rd party web scrapers available from KapowTech.com (or OpenKapow.com) and Dapper.com. These web scrapers are tools for easily defining the data to be extracted from HTML code and converting the extracted data to XML files for download and insertion into the database. The web scrapers can be used in two ways. The first way is to utilize the scrapers as a web application, requiring an online account with either Dapper.com or OpenKapow.com. The method for finding and extracting the desired criterion data is defined using the scraper's tools and thereafter accessed through the scraper as a service call.","The second way is to integrate Kapow Technologies's Mashup Server as an integrated component of the PPS . The benefit to integration in this manner is more control over the scraper and less dependence on 3party web services like OpenKapow.com which may experience service interruptions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","103","300","306","501","212","502","503","212","504","212","505","212","506","212","240","507","212","211"],"sup":["rd ","rd "]},"Whether data is retrieved via an established API or a web scraper, the Retrieval Agent  makes only N attempts to connect to the source for a given session (where N is set through the Agent Manager  configuration and a session is defined as a period of relatively uninterrupted time where the Retrieval Agent  attempts to connect to the source on a periodic basis). Upon failure to access after N attempts, the Retrieval Agent  reports this failure to the Agent Manager  and terminates its instance. Upon a successful connection and retrieval of data, the Retrieval Agent  verifies that the data is a complete and accurate response to the request before parsing the resultant XML file.","In one embodiment, the Retrieval Agent  utilizes a 3party tool such as the java-based Apatar Engine from www.apatar.com. The Apatar Engine is an open-source tool that facilitates data mapping transformation between different data formats and databases. Alternatively, the Retrieval Agents  can be employed to parse XML files using tools such as XPath and XQuery.","1.2 Maintenance Agent ","A Maintenance Agent  is simply the name given to a process that cleans up, indexes and otherwise maintains the database. This class of agent is responsible, for example, in ensuring that scoring is recalculated and updated properly and efficiently when new criteria data is added to the database as well as ensuring that data can be accessed quickly by the web server  through appropriate caching and indexing. The Maintenance Agent  will typically launch and monitor 3rd party applications to facilitate these tasks.","1.3 Widget Agent ","A Widget Agent  monitors a widget application, such as a widget that displays the current ranking of an artist associated with it. The Widget Agent  is responsible for maintaining communication with the Agent Manager , database , and\/or any other component of the PPS  in order to update the data utilized and presented by the widget. It can also be used to push data to the database (e.g. reporting activity from users who interacted with the widget, such as voting for an artist).","Widgets may include:\n\n","1.4 Agent Manager ","The Agent Manager  is responsible for monitoring the various Agents and ensuring that tasks are initiated and terminated as scheduled. The Agent Manager  also logs the results of tasks such as whether a Retrieval Agent  successfully retrieved data. Schedules and parameters for the agents can be set by a user with Administrator privileges by accessing the Agent Manager  through the Administrator web page presented by the web server .","1.5 Other Agents","Other agents will be developed as needed. For example, an agent may be the preferred way to facilitate requests and transmissions of RSS feeds, such as an RSS feed to artists to let them know their current ranking and stats.","2. Popularity Profiling Engine (PPE) ","The Popularity Profiling Engine (PPE)  processes criteria data retrieved by the Data Retrieval Agent(s)  before it is stored in the database . Criteria data is that which is used to determine an artist's scoring and, subsequently, an artist's ranking compared to others.","The PPE  distinguishes between quantitative criteria data and qualitative criteria data. Quantitative data is already in the form of a number that can be directly employed for scoring. Examples include the number of books an author has sold on Amazon or the number of times a musician's song has been downloaded from a music repository. Qualitative data, on the other hand, cannot readily be used for scoring. It includes things like written song reviews, blog entries, articles and user comments. In order to be useful for scoring, such data must be translated into a number.","As shown below, the PPE  employs both a Quantitative Data Analyzer (QNDA)  and a Qualitative Data Analyzer (QLDA)  to process criteria data. The PPE  also employs a Score Keeper  to calculate artists' score(s) used for ranking and popularity profiling.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","220","212","601","220","212","220","212","240","212","602","224","603","221","604","603","604","605","220","603","604","225","606","240"]},"2.1 Quantitative Data Analyzer (QNDA) ","The QNDA  receives quantitative (numerical) criteria data and performs any necessary processing on the data before making it available to the Score Keeper . Processing may include formatting or mathematical transformations. In many cases, the data may need no processing.","QNDA  will multiply criterion value by a transform function as follows:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0068"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"c","mo":"=","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"i"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["r","i"]},{"mi":["\u03d5","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}},"br":{},"sub":"i ","sup":"rd "},"2.2 Qualitative Data Analyzer (QLDA) ","The QLDA  receives qualitative criteria data and performs the necessary processing to transform it into a number or set of numbers that can be used by the Score Keeper .","One means to transform the qualitative data into a number is to use sentiment analysis. In the preferred embodiment, the Natural Language Parser  and the Sentiment Classifier  are employed to determine whether the qualitative data is favorable, unfavorable, or undetermined (or neutral) in regard to the artist. The Sentiment Classifier  accepts the qualitative criteria data (generally in the form of text) passed to the QLDA , ordinarily after processing it through the Natural Language Parser . As such, the Sentiment Classifier  generally is employed in conjunction with the Natural Language Parser , and the Natural Language Parser  separates natural language text into parts of speech for use by the Sentiment Classifier . The classifier , in turn, analyzes the text and its parts-of-speech structure in order to determine the sentiment of the writer in regard to the subject of the text.","The sentiment of the writer can be gauged in a number of ways known to one of ordinary skill in the art. One reference for the mathematical workings of the Sentiment Classifier  is the paper produced by a group at Cornell titled \u201cThumbs up? Classification using Machine Learning Techniques\u201d (available at http:\/\/www.cs.cornell.edu\/home\/llee\/papers\/sentiment.home.html).","In the preferred embodiment, the sentiment of the writer is gauged as favorable, unfavorable, or undetermined (neutral). A favorable sentiment, for example, would entail a song review wherein the reviewer praised the song. Likewise, an unfavorable sentiment would entail a song review wherein the reviewer disparaged the song. An undetermined (or neutral) item is simply one where favorable or unfavorable status cannot satisfactorily be determined by the classifier  using methods known in the art.","Anyone of ordinary skill in the art will understand that many variations and alterations exist involving sentiment analysis. As mentioned, one embodiment of the present invention employs sentiment analysis to classify text into one of three categories: favorable, unfavorable and undetermined (neutral). Further embodiments may employ sentiment analysis to classify text into different and\/or additional categories, or to form determinations of writer's sentiment other than mere classification into categories.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","212","701","221","212","221","702","703","704","222","705","223","706","707"]},"In the preferred embodiment, the counters are a means of determining a numerical metric for popularity based on the number of favorable and unfavorable items encountered. It is anticipated that three counters will be used: number of favorable items, number of unfavorable items and number of undetermined\/neutral items\u2014the sum of which yields the total number of items processed. A number of metrics also may be utilized such as the ratio of favorable to unfavorable, the percentage of favorable items to all items, and the like.","An example of a natural language parser and classifier that may work well in this capacity is LingPipe (see www.alias-i.com\/lingpipe\/index.html), a suite of open source Java libraries that provide the following features:\n\n","Anyone of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the QLDA  has tremendous capacity for expansion beyond mere determination of favorable versus unfavorable sentiment. As the \u201csemantic web\u201d becomes more of a reality and the tools for textual analysis (particularly sentiment analysis) improve, the use of sentiment analysis will expand into a more sophisticated analysis of the qualitative data. This has the potential of providing more feedback regarding the mood and sentiment of artists' fans as well as to better pinpoint the context within which the fan is expressing an opinion. For example, distinctions can be made between the sentiments of different types of fans as categorized by education (whether college educated, whether currently in college, etc.), geographic location, socioeconomic level, and particular interests\/hobbies. This will provide a more insightful and targeted popularity profile. And it will be extremely useful in providing feedback for targeted advertising on the website as presented by the web server .","Another alternative is that this data can be analyzed (and may also be combined with the aforementioned quantitative data), and packaged for sale to market research and advertising firms. It will also greatly enhance the value of the invention to 3rd party developers.","2.3 Score Keeper ","What users of the website presented by the web server  generally want to see is the ranking of artists relative to one another. Ranking is determined by the relative score(s) of an artist compared to others, whether overall or within a particular grouping of artists (such as by a niche or music genre) or by a particular grouping by category of criteria. The Score Keeper  is a component of the PPE  that computes the various scores associated with an artist. In the preferred embodiment, there is one overall score as well as at least one score per information source (e.g. a score for MySpace). There may also be separate scores for categories of criteria (e.g. downloads).","An artist's popularity profile consists of all the processed criteria data and score(s) (points) associated with the artist. It can also include rankings where score(s) can be compared with other artists in the proper context.","In the preferred embodiment, an artist's score(s) is (are) calculated as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0091"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"Score","mo":"=","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["c","n"]},{"mi":["m","n"]},{"mi":["w","n"]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}}}}},"br":{},"sub":["n ","n ","n "],"sup":["th ","th ","th ","th "]},"Alternatively, an artist's score(s) is (are) calculated as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0093"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"Score","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["c","n"]},{"mi":["w","n"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}}},"br":{},"sub":["n ","n "],"sup":["th ","th "]},"Further, an artist's score(s) could be measured by adding, subtracting, multiplying and\/or dividing one criterion (with or without the product of the criterion with its momentum and weighting factors as shown above) by another rather than simply taking the sum as shown above. In this sense, the criteria essentially could be used within a mathematical formula in order to calculate a score. Further still, scoring may be achieved by multiplying a weighting factor not only to an individual criterion but also to a grouping of criteria.","The weighting factor serves to enhance or diminish the importance of a given criterion. If set to 0, the weighting factor will effectively turn off a given criterion by negating its contribution to the total points. In the preferred embodiment, the weighting factor is preset but may be modified to a value between 0 and 1 by a user manipulating a slider or similar graphical user interface tool on a webpage as presented by the web server . In another embodiment, the weighting factor is preset and cannot be modified by a user.","Alternatively, the weighting factor may be a mathematical equation, such as a logarithm. In the preferred embodiment, the momentum factor mfor the nth criteria measures its acceleration; that is, its rate of change over a period of time. Values for the nth criterion computed over a period of time constitute a one-dimensional discrete-time function c=\u0192[k], where cis real and k is a natural number (k=1, 2, . . . , l) representing one to l samples at which the criterion value cwas calculated over a period of time. Anyone of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a variety of methods are available to calculate acceleration of a discrete-time function and that the employment of one method over another does not depart from the scope of this invention.","One way to calculate this momentum factor is to take gradient (or its approximation) of \u0192[k]. Anyone of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a variety of methods are known to calculate the gradient (or its approximation) of \u0192[k]. Another way to calculate the momentum factor is to transform the discrete-time function \u0192[k] into a continuous function \u0192(k) using a curve-fitting approach, such as cubic-spline-based interpolation or Fourier-approximations, and then computing momentum from its second derivative:\n\n=\u0192\u2033().\n\nThe momentum factor may also be normalized or bounded within a numerical range (e.g. 0.0 to 2.0) by further mathematical operations known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n","In the preferred embodiment, the momentum factor is a real number within a range (e.g. 0.0 to 2.0) and is calculated over a moving time window using \u0192[k]=(c, c, . . . , c) where k is a natural number (k=1, 2, . . . , l) representing one to l samples, j is the window size, and j\u2266l. The momentum factor is greater than 1.0 when the value of the criterion over the time window is positively accelerating, less than 1.0 when the value of the criterion over the time window is positively accelerating, and is equal to 1.0 when no significant momentum is determined. The momentum factor effectively rewards more recent surges in popularity measures while diminishing the contribution of popularity measures that are further in the past and are waning. It may be normalized or limited to restrict its value (or else very large numbers may result in times of rapid change in the criteria values).","In the preferred embodiment, the quantitative score criteria for music artists include one or more of the following:\n\n","Some examples of qualitative criteria for music artists include:\n\n","The database  stores most of the information utilized by the PPS . One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the database  can be implemented using a variety of open source and commercial products and tools. In one embodiment, the database  is implemented using MySQL software.","4. Web Server ","The Web Server  generates one or more web pages  which may utilize data from the database . A typical web page  is a document composed in languages including but not limited to HTML, DHTML, Java, Javascript, JSP, ASP, PHP and XML; it may be implemented with other computer protocols, languages, and techniques known in the art. A web user may register on the website, providing personal and\/or login information, in order to procure a website-based user account and gain access to restricted web pages  and\/or features.","In the preferred embodiment, a client computer  requests a web page  from the Web Server  via a web browser by navigating to the web address IndieRankings.com. The Web Server  may respond to other web addresses as well.","In the preferred embodiment, the fundamental goal of the website presented by the Web Server  is to provide a simple, easy to use tool for assessing the popularity of a music artist or band. A data visualization tool provided via the web page is an interactive table displaying rows of artists and scoring criteria in rank order. This tool is referred as the Board . It lists artists and bands in ranked order starting with 1 (highest ranking). As discussed, ranking is determined by a weighting of selected criteria as calculated by the Score Keeper . Whether a band appears on the Board depends on ranking and music genre. The Board  will list the top x bands based on ranking from 1 (highest points) to x. The default setting is that the top bands are listed without respect to genre. However, the user can select a particular genre and the Board  will then refresh to show only bands which belong to the selected genre (in the order of ranking).","While the Board  will display at most x bands at a time, the user can select to see another page of rankings which would display another x number of bands that follow the previous list in order of ranking (i.e. bands ranked x+1 to 2x, then 2x+1 to 3x, and so on).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","801","803","802","803","225","804","225"]},"The Board  also displays the numerical value of one or more criteria  with which the Points  were calculated by the Score Keeper . The Board adjusts its columns and width to the number of active criteria, using a scrollable panel if helpful.","The Board  provides some interactive tools for the web user. First, Favorites  displays an icon indicating whether an artist shown in the same row is marked in the database  as a favorite of the web user and allows the web user to click on it to add or remove the artists from the web user's list of favorite artists (assuming the web user has registered an account with the website). Second, a web user can click on a column header to prompt the Board  to sort the rows by the ascending or descending order of the data in that column. A click on the band name column  will display the list of bands in alphabetical order. A click on the rank column  will always return the Board to the original order. Third, sliders  within each column heading for criteria  provide the web user a tool for increasing or decreasing the weighting factor of each criterion used by the Score Keeper  by moving the slider right or left, respectively. Moving a slider  completely to the left would elicit a value of 0 and effectively turn off the associated criterion as a contributor to Points . Moving the slider completely to the right would elicit a value of 100 and allow the full contribution of the criterion value. Anyplace in between would elicit a partial contribution.","The basic features of the Board  and related webpage  tools include:\n\n","Advanced features (requiring user registration) of the Board  and related webpage  tools include:\n\n","The webpage  may provide a search box wherein the web user types the name or partial name of an artist\/band in order to prompt the webpage  via the Board  to display artists whose names  significantly contain or match the search term(s).","The webpage  may provide one or more comboboxes, or other web browser user interface device(s), that will allow a user to select one or more music genres in order to prompt the webpage  via the Board  to display artists whose names  significantly contain or match the search term(s). Selecting \u201cjazz\u201d and \u201crap,\u201d for example, will limit the Board  to display only those artists whose genres include \u201cjazz\u201d and\/or \u201crap\u201d. The operation of the Board  would then conform to the results of the limitations under the music genre(s) selected.","The webpage  may provide one or more comboboxes that will allow a user to select one or more geographical locations (city, state and\/or region). As with music genres, the selection acts as a filter for the list of artists (by row) displayed via the Board . Selecting \u201cSoutheast\u201d for example, will limit the Board  to display artists in the list whose location is principally in the Southeast. The operation of the Board  would then conform to the results of the limitations under the location selected. Location may be defined as the principal address of the band, but location also may be defined by other concepts such as where the artist's music is most popular. It will be clear to one skilled in the art that limitations other than location can be utilized in order to display on the Board  artists within a particular niche and that use of such other limitations are within the scope of the invention. In the layout of the Board , an artist\/band's logo or picture could be shown beside its name .","In one embodiment of the Board , when a user clicks on an artist\/band name  a popup window (or a simulated popup window utilizing DHTML) displays the profile of the artist\/band. A popup window or \u201ctip tool\u201d may also appear when the mouse pointer hovers over the name . An alternative is to incorporate a tool such as the SmartLink technology from Adaptive Blue, Inc. (at www.adaptiveblue.com), whose popup windows display background information on the artists\/bands.","It will be clear to one skilled in the art that the above embodiments may be altered in many ways without departing from the scope of the invention.","Accordingly several advantages and objects of the present invention include but are not limited to:","A principal object of the present invention
