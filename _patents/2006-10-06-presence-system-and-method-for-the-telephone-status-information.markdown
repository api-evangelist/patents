{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY ","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION ","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION ","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION "],"p":["The present invention relates to network communication technologies, and more particularly, to a system and a method for presenting telephone state information.","Presence service refers to a service that makes the state of a service presence client visible to a selected presence contact, so as to make it possible for the contact to choose appropriate communication means, time and communication service of his\/her own. Presence information refers to the current state of a presence client, including online\/offline, busy\/idle, etc. The state, e.g., online or offline, can be obtained through detecting a network connection between a presence server and a presence client end. The state can also be configured by a client who uses the presence client end, e.g., be configured to be in a meeting, etc. The state still can be obtained through detection by a presence client end software. For example, if the client end software has not detected any information inputted by the client for a period of time, it sets the presence information of the client as leaving. A Presence contact refers to a presence client who has subscribed presence information of another presence client. For the presence client whose presence information has been subscribed by other presence client, the other presence client is called a \u201ccontact\u201d. The presence service has been integrated into various Instant Messaging (IM) software programs.","As shown in , a conceptive model of a presence system includes three components: a presence server, a presence client end and a presence contact end. The presence server includes a hardware device and software for providing a presence service. The presence client end includes a terminal equipment and software used to log in the presence system for a presence client. The presence contact end includes a terminal and a software program, used to log in the presence system for a presence contact. It should be noted that, to make the description convenient, the presence client end and the presence contact end are described separately. Whereas in practical presence services, the presence client and the presence contact tend to be contacts to each other, and they run the same software program.","Before obtaining the presence information of a presence client, a presence contact must subscribe for the presence information of the presence client from the presence server. The presence server adds the presence client to a presence information subscription list of the presence contact after authentication. When the state of the presence client changes, the presence server can obtain the state information of the presence client through various methods, including:","1) monitoring a communication interface between the presence server and the presence client end by the presence server, e.g., monitoring whether the presence client has logged on the client end software, etc.;","2) configured by the presence client his\/her own, e.g., configured to be in a meeting, and reported to the presence server by the presence client;","3) monitored by the presence client, e.g., if the client software has not detected any input from the presence client for a period of time, the client end software configures the presence information of the presence client as leaving, and reports the state information to the presence server through the presence client end.","Upon detecting the change of the presence state of the presence client, the presence server distributes presence information to the presence contact who has subscribed for the presence information of the presence client. Upon receiving the presence information, the presence contact end correspondingly changes the presence information of the presence client displayed on a terminal interface, e.g., changes the presence information from \u201conline\u201d to \u201cbusy\u201d.","Through the above mentioned techniques, in the current presence system, a client can make it convenient for his\/her contact to see various state information configured by the client or detected by a computer. So that the contact can arrange communication manner and communication time according to the state information.","Whereas, traditional telephone still plays a very important part in people's everyday life and work, and it is a main communication means for people. A telephone client also expects to let his\/her telephone state information known by his\/her contact, therefore the contact can choose a corresponding communication mode and time according to the telephone state of the client when calling the client. Thus, the contact may not call the client when the client is busy according to the telephone state of the client.","If the presence system does not have the ability of providing telephone state information, a presence contact cannot know the telephone state of a presence client. Thus, when needs to call the client, the contact often encounters a busy telephone line. If the contact does not know when the client's telephone will be idle, he can only dial for many times, which wastes a lot of time and energy.","To solve this problem, a solution on basis of a telephone switch is proposed to implement the presence service of the telephone state information. As shown in , the solution is implemented through modifying the program of the telephone switch. Upon detecting a change on the telephone state, the telephone switch sends a notification of telephone state change information to the presence server. And the corresponding presence server has been configured with data related to the telephone state information. Upon receiving the notification of the telephone state change information, the presence server looks for the presence client information corresponding to the telephone number, modifies the presence information related to the telephone state, and distributes the telephone state change information to the contact who has subscribed for the presence information of the client.","Whereas, the solution has the following problems:","1) the cost is high.","In this solution, the program of the telephone switch needs to be modified, that is to say, to implement a presence service of the telephone state information, a large scale telephone switch reconstructions must be performed by telecommunication operators or vendors.","2) the solution depends on the ability of a telephone switch","The reconstruction of the switch cannot be implemented in a short time, so that a client can only enjoy the service in an area where the reconstruction is finished, once leaving the area, the client cannot use the service any more, i.e., the client cannot present the telephone state to his\/her contact.","The present invention provides a system and a method for presenting telephone state information, so as to implement a telephone state presence service which is independent of a telephone switch; therefore there is no need to reconstruct the telephone switch, which brought out a lower cost.","The present invention provides a system for presenting telephone state information, including: a presence server ;

otherwise, returning to the step of monitoring the state of the user telephone line.","Wherein, the state of the user telephone line comprises an electronic feature of the user telephone line.","Therefore, a presence client can transmit his\/her telephone state information to his\/her contact, when a contact initiates a call to him\/her, a corresponding communication mode and time can be chose to save time and energy.","In addition, the user telephone line monitoring device connected with the user telephone line does not depend on the telephone switch. Compared with the reconstruction of the telephone switch, the cost can be greatly reduced. Besides, since the monitoring of the user line does not depends on the telephone switch, the problem that the client cannot use the presence service once he\/she leaves the reconstructed area can be solved. The present invention can be applied in any area whether it has been reconstructed or not.","The present invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to accompanying drawings and embodiments of the present invention.","Referring to , a system for presenting telephone state information in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention includes: a presence server , connected with a presence client end  and a presence contact end  respectively, and implements interconnection for the presence client end  and the presence contact end ; the presence client end ; the presence contact end ; a user telephone line monitoring device , connected with the presence client end , and provides telephone state information for the presence client end ; and a user telephone line , refers to a user line provided by a telephone switch for accessing the telephone, connected with the user telephone line monitoring device , and its state is monitored by the user telephone line monitoring device .","Referring to  at the same time, the presence server  includes: an information processing device ; a state information database , used for storing user telephone state information; a presence information subscription database , used for storing a presence information subscription relationship between the presence client end  and the presence contact end ; and a communication interface , connected with the presence client end  and the presence contact end .","The information processing device  is used for performing the following tasks: receiving state information of a monitored telephone from the presence client end  via the communication interface ; searching, modifying or storing telephone state information corresponding to a client logging in the presence client end  in the state information database ; searching the presence information subscription database  for a contact corresponding to the client logging in the presence client end ; storing a subscription relationship in the presence information subscription database ; distributing telephone state information to the presence contact end  which has subscribed the telephone state information of the client via the communication interface .","The state information database  can be implemented by relation database technology.

The presence contact end includes: a communication interface , connected with the presence server ; and a presence information processing device , used for receiving telephone state information related to the presence client end  from the presence server , displaying the telephone state information on a terminal interface provided by the client.","Wherein, the communication interfaces , ,  between the presence server  and the presence client end  and the presence contact end  generally adopt interfaces on basis of an Internet Protocol (IP) network, and have their respective IP address. The presence server  opens a service interface based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The presence client end  and the presence contact end  are connected to the service interface provided by the presence server  through the corresponding TCP or UDP, and establish connections with the presence server  after a necessary authentication. After the establishment of the connections, the presence server  can send data to and receive data from the presence client end  or the presence contact end  via the corresponding connection. The detailed implementation of this type of IP-based communication interface belongs to existing technologies in the computer network communication field, which will not be described herein.","In practical applications, a client end is usually required to have the function of the presence client end  and that of the presence contact end  simultaneously, i.e., the client subscribes a presence service and being subscribed by other clients at the same time. The client not only receives his\/her described presence information, but also sends presence information to the presence server , and then the presence server  forwards the presence information to other subscribers. In addition, the presence client end  and the presence contact end  can be computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), mobile phones or other devices. Computer is taken as an example in a preferable embodiment of the present invention.","Other modules also can be added to the presence server , the presence client end  and the presence contact end  according to practical requirements. For example, when used for Instant Messaging (IM) services, modules for implementing an IM function can be added.","Referring to  at the same time, the user telephone line monitoring device  refers to an electronic device connected with the telephone line, it includes: a telephone interface , connected with the user telephone line ; a monitoring device , used for monitoring the state of the user telephone line; a state signal processing device , used for processing the telephone signal monitored by the monitoring device ; and a monitoring interface , connected with the presence client end .","The state signal processing device  determines the type of the change of the user telephone line state monitored by the monitoring device , generates telephone state information, and sends the telephone state information to the presence client end  through the communication interface  between the presence client end  and the state signal processing device .","The monitoring interfaces ,  between the presence client end  and the user telephone line monitoring device  can be implemented on basis of computer interface technologies. When the user telephone line monitoring device  is a separate device outside the presence client end , the interfaces ,  can be a wireline interface, such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, parallel interface, serial interface,  interface, or can be a wireless interface, such as infrared, Bluetooth, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), etc. When the user telephone line monitoring device  is a module (e.g. an inserted card) inside the presence client end , the interfaces ,  can be a computer bus interfaces, such as Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) interfaces, Peripheral Computer Interconnect (PCI) interfaces, or can be other interfaces on computer, such as USB interfaces, parallel interfaces, serial interfaces, etc. Besides the interfaces between the presence client end  and the user telephone line monitoring device , corresponding drivers are required to implement communication through the interfaces. The implementation of the interfaces and their drivers are existing technologies in the computer field, there are a large number of practical product applications and hardware components, which will not be described herein. Through the interfaces between the presence client end  and the user telephone line monitoring device  and the drivers of the interfaces, the presence client end  and the user telephone line monitoring device  can communicate with each other, thereby implementing transmission and reception of the user telephone line state change signal.","The user telephone line monitoring device  has the telephone interface  connected with the user telephone line . The telephone interface  can be a RJ11 interface. Through the telephone interface , the user telephone line monitoring device  is connected to the user telephone line .","The user telephone line monitoring device has a function of monitoring the state of the user telephone line . The principle is that, the electronic feature of the user telephone line  is different under different states. Therefore, the user telephone line monitoring device  can determine the state of the user telephone line . Taking the telecommunication network in China based on a digital program controlled switch as an example, corresponding relationships between the states and the electronic features of a user telephone line include:","(1) Idle","i.e. a state without an incoming call or an outgoing call and the telephone being hang on normally. In a common telephone system, a switch provides approximate 48V direct current for a user telephone line in the idle state, and the current is less than 5 \u03bcA.","(2) Calling","i.e., a state when the user initiates a call or receives a call. In a common telephone system, a telephone switch provides a direct current of approximate 10 to 20V for a user telephone line in the calling state. And an audio signal, behaves as a large fluctuating current, is added on the voltage.","(3) Connected","To meet the requirement of a charging telephone, such as a public coin telephone, a modern telephone switch may provide a \u201cconnected\u201d state for a user telephone line.","A polarity reversal signal is a charging signal provided by a switch, when a call is connected and the called party picks up the phone, the positive and the negative polarities in the user telephone line are reversed.","In addition, an electronic line with a more powerful function is developed to monitor various states as follows:","(4) Dialling","When a user picks up the phone, the switch will send a dialling indication tone of a certain frequency to the phone of the user, indicating the user to input a telephone number.","(5) Ringing Back","After the user finishes inputting the telephone number, the switch will send a ringing back tone with a certain frequency and interval to the calling party when ringing the called party.","(6) Ringing","When a user is called, an alternating current signal with tens of volts is added to the user telephone line, then the telephone is ringing.","According to the above mentioned different electronic features of a user telephone line in different states, an electronic device for monitoring the state of a user telephone line can be developed. This kind of electronic devices is popularly applied and have a lot of products, e.g., SS173K222AL produced by the TDK company, it is a highly integrated Single Chip Machine (SCM) programming MODEM chip, and possesses functions of call procedure, carrier, response tone and long loop detection; it can also generate Double Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF) signals by programming. The SS173K222AL chip has four 8-bit registers for monitor, which are CR0, CR1, DR, TR. Wherein, the DR is used for monitoring working state. And the current state of the user telephone line can be obtained by monitoring the content of the DR Register.","An implementation based on a USB interface in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is given hereinafter:","The user telephone line monitoring device  is a device with three interfaces, the monitoring interface  connected between the user telephone line monitoring device  and the presence client end  is implemented by a USB interface. Two RJ11 telephone interfaces  are set, one of them is connected to a telephone socket connected with the switch, and the other is connected to the telephone. Inside the user telephone line monitoring device , the above mentioned SS173K222AL chip is adopted to implement an SCM-based control program, the monitoring device  and the state signal information processing device  which are based on telephone chips. When a presence client uses the telephone, the DR register in the SS173K222AL chip changes, and sends an interrupt to the SS173K222AL chip. And the SS173K222AL chip drives the USB interface  to send a data packet of a user telephone line change notification to the presence client end .","Correspondingly, based on the telephone state information presence system in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, an implementation method for providing telephone state information is also provided, the process of a presence client providing telephone state information for his\/her contacts includes the following steps:","(1) the electronic feature of the user telephone line  changes;","(2) the user telephone line monitoring device  detects the change of the electronic feature of the user telephone line , e.g., a change from a electronic feature corresponding to the \u201cidle\u201d state to that corresponding to the \u201cconnected\u201d state;","(3) the user telephone line monitoring device  generates corresponding telephone state information, e.g., \u201cstate=calling\u201d, according to the current electronic feature of the user telephone line ;","(4) the user telephone line monitoring device  sends the generated telephone state information to the presence client end  via the communication interfaces ,  connected between the user telephone line monitoring device  and the presence client end ;","(5) upon receiving the telephone state information, the presence client end  sends the received telephone state information to the presence server  via the communication interfaces ,  connected between the presence client end  and the presence server ;","(6) upon receiving the telephone state information, the presence server  searches the state information database  for the telephone state information corresponding to the client logging on the presence client end , if the telephone state information of the client logging on the presence client end  is existed, modify or update the telephone state information of the client logging on the presence client end , otherwise, store the telephone state information of the client logging on the presence client end  in the state information database; at the same time, search the presence information subscription database  for the contact who has subscribed the presence information and logged on the presence contact end ;","(7) the presence server  distributes the telephone state information to the discovered one or more contacts via the communication interfaces ,  connected between the presence server and the presence contact end .","(8) upon receiving the telephone state information, the presence contact end  displays the telephone state information on a terminal interface; Wherein, various presence state information can be expressed with different icons or colours for the presence information shown in , the icon marked with 100 expresses that the telephone is in a idle state, the icon marked with 200 expressed that the telephone is in a \u201cconnected\u201d state. And the icon marked with 100 can be coloured with blue, while the icon marked with 200 can be coloured with red."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS ","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
