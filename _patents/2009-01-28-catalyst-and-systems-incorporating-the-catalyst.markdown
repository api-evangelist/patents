The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued, but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysis is a current technology used for industrial chemical synthesis with a potential for improved feed stock efficiencies, environmental impact, and energy savings. In particular, the first step of oxidative dehydrogenation of short-chain alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane) is a process which, in its current form, tends to have less than ideal energy consumption and specific conversion.","Given that short chain alkenes represent a primary feedstock for the large scale production of a wide range of industrial materials, this step (and the oxidative dehydrogenation process in general) has a particular interest for development of new catalytic materials.","A catalyst includes a carrier body and a catalytic portion carried by the carrier body. The catalytic portion includes a plurality of distinct layers of catalytic material, which layers may be formed through atomic layer deposition techniques. Exemplary catalytic materials include catalysts comprising layers of transition metal oxides. The transition metal oxides could include one or more of vanadium oxide, niobium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, titanium oxide, and zirconium oxide. The catalytic material may also (or alternatively) include one or more other metal oxide materials such as magnesium oxide and aluminum oxide.","The catalyst may be used to catalyze an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, such as the conversion of alkanes (e.g., short-chain alkanes) to alkenes. The reaction using the catalyst may have a selectivity for the conversion of alkanes to alkenes of over 35%.","The catalyst could additionally (or alternatively) be used in an ammoxidation reaction, such as the conversion of alkanes (e.g., short-chain alkanes) to nitriles.","The catalyst may be incorporated in a reactor such as a fluidized bed reactor or a single pass reactor.","Various aspects of the invention are described hereinafter; and these and other objects of improvements are described in detail hereinafter, including the drawings described in the following section.","Referring to , new catalysts  for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), ammoxidation, and\/or other processes may include a carrier body  which is configured to carry a catalytic material .

The layers - may be continuous, complete layers as depicted, or they may be discontinuous, incomplete layers comprised of isolated particles. In some embodiments, some layers may be deposited by ALD while other layers are deposited using some other technique, such as wet impregnation.","The carrier body  may be formed as a membrane, as a particle (e.g., a bead or powder), or as some other structure.

The catalytic material  may be configured to conform to the shape of carrier body  (e.g., the catalytic material  may have roughly the same shape as the carrier body  onto which the catalytic material  is deposited). For example, the catalytic material  may form a second porous structure over the porous structure of a porous carrier body  such that the porous shape formed by the catalytic material  is based on and\/or similar to (e.g., follows the shape of) the porous structure of the carrier body .","The catalytic material  may include any catalytic material. In some embodiments, the catalytic material  may be a metal oxide material such as a transition metal oxide. For example, the catalytic material  may be a Vanadium-based catalytic material (e.g., VO), a Tungsten-based catalytic material (e.g., WO), a Molybdenum-based catalytic material (e.g., MO), a Niobium-based catalytic material (e.g., NbO), a titanium-based catalytic material (TiO), an aluminum-based catalytic material (AlO), a magnesium-based catalytic material (MgO), and\/or a Zirconium-based catalytic material (ZrO)","The catalytic material , may include multiple layers -. In some multi-layer embodiments, the catalytic material  may include at least 2 layers, at least 3 layers, at least 4 layers, at least 5 layers, at least 7 layers, at least 9 layers, at least 11 layers, and\/or at least 13 layers.","In some embodiments, one or more (e.g., a plurality, at least half, substantially all, and\/or all) of the layers - may have an average and\/or maximum thickness, incrementally, of up to about 100 microns, 50 microns, 25 microns, 10 microns, 5 microns, 1 micron, 500 nm, 100 nm, 50 nm, 25 nm, 10 nm, 5 nm, and\/or 1 nm. In some embodiments, one or more (e.g., a plurality, at least half, substantially all, and\/or all) of the layers - may have an average and\/or maximum thickness of at least about 0.01 nm, 0.05 nm, 0.1 nm, 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, and\/or 500 nm. In some embodiments, one or more of the layers - may meet one set of dimensions listed above, while one or more other layers - may meet a different set of dimensions listed above. Additionally, individual layers - may or may not be continuous. In some embodiments, one or more layers - may consist of isolated atoms or clusters of atoms that are spaced apart from one another such that the average thickness of the layer - is much less than the thickness of an atom.","In some embodiments, the catalytic material  may have an average and\/or maximum thickness of up to about 100 microns, 50 microns, 25 microns, 15 microns, 10 microns, 5 microns, 1 micron, 500 nm, 250 nm, 100 nm, 75 nm, 50 nm, 25 nm, and\/or 10 nm.

For example, one layer  may be a VOlayer, while another layer  may be a NbOlayer. Two or more of the multiple layers , may be formed from the same material (e.g., VO) while at least one other layer  (e.g., a layer between the two layers , formed from the same material) is formed from a different material (e.g., WO). Each of the layers - may be essentially pure such that at least 90% and\/or at least 95% of each individual layer - is formed from a common type of material. In some embodiments, the catalytic material  includes at least two, at least three, and\/or at least four layers - that are compositionally distinct from each other.","In some embodiments, the catalyst  may be configured to catalyze a dehydrogenation reaction (e.g., an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction) and\/or an ammoxidation reaction. In some embodiments, the catalyst  is configured to catalyze a dehydrogenation and\/or ammoxidation reaction of an alkane; particularly a short chain alkane (e.g., C\u226610, C\u22667, and\/or C\u22664) such as ethane, propane, and\/or butane. The catalyst  may have a good selectivity for conversion of an alkane to an alkene. For example, the catalyst may have a selectivity for conversion of an alkane to an alkene, incrementally, of at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, and\/or at least about 90%. In some embodiments, the catalyst may have any of the above listed selectivities while facilitating a conversion rate of reactants to products, incrementally, of at least about 5%, at least about 7%, at least about 10%, at least about 12%, at least about 14%, at least about 16%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%, and\/or at least about 90%.","The catalyst  may be formed by any number of methods. In many exemplary embodiments, the catalyst can be formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD utilizes alternating exposures between precursors (e.g., in a gaseous form) and a solid surface to deposit materials in a monolayer-by-monolayer fashion. This process can provide uniformity of the coatings in many embodiments, including on nanoporous substrate materials (e.g., nanoporous carrier bodies ). In many embodiments, this process also allows good control over the thickness and composition of the coatings.","Referring to , to form a catalyst  by ALD, the carrier body  substrate (e.g., particles, membrane, etc.) is first exposed  to a chemical vapor precursor containing the desired metal atom (e.g., trimethyl aluminum). Second, the substrate is purged  with an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) to remove any unreacted precursor as well as gaseous reaction byproducts. Third, the substrate is exposed  to a vapor of an oxygen-containing chemical precursor such as water. Finally, the carrier body  substrate is again purged  with inert gas.","This four-step procedure is referred to as an \u201cALD cycle .\u201d For catalysts  having multiple layers - of catalytic material, the ALD cycle  can be repeated multiple times to deposit a multilayer film of catalytic material  (e.g., metal oxide) which may be used to precisely control the film thickness. In some embodiments, the layers - of the catalytic material  may have quantized thickness (the thicknesses of the layers - are essentially integers of each other). A majority of the layers - may have quantized thicknesses, essentially all of the layers - may have quantized thicknesses, and\/or all the layers - may have quantized thicknesses. Moreover, ALD cycles for different catalytic materials (e.g., metal oxide materials such as VOand NbO) can be combined in specific sequences to deposit mixed-catalytic (e.g., metal oxide) layers - to control the atomic composition of the catalytic material .","If multiple ALD cycles  are used to deposit multiple layers -, the multiple layers may be provided in a binary manner such that at least some (e.g., at least half) of the layers have a different composition than the adjacent layers.","Referring to , a fluidized bed catalytic reactor  includes a solid catalyst  fluidized in an upper portion  of a fluid  contained in a reactor tank . The tank  also includes a distributor  which may be configured to prevent substantially any amount of the catalyst  from entering a lower portion  of the fluid .","An input source  (e.g., a container such as tank) contains a material to be catalyzed that is pumped by a pump  under the control of a control circuit . The material contained in the input source  may be any of a variety of materials. The material may be a fluid (e.g., a gas)\u2014in particular a short chain alkane (e.g., C\u226610, C\u22667 and\/or C\u22664) fluid material such as ethane, propane, and\/or butane. The input source  may also include one or more other materials such as a material to promote oxidation (e.g., Ogas) and\/or an inert diluent (e.g., N). Of course, these additional materials (if used) could also be provided from a separate input source (not illustrated).","The reactant contained in the reactant source  is pumped through a channel  into a lower portion  of the fluid . The pumping of the reactant into the fluid  may serve to maintain the catalyst  in a fluidized state. The reactant pumped into fluid  contacts the catalyst , and is reacted in a reaction catalyzed by the catalyst  in the fluid . In some embodiments, catalyst  may be configured to catalyze a dehydrogenation reaction (e.g., an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction) and\/or an ammoxidation reaction. Reacted (and also possibly unreacted) material exits the tank  through an output port .","The reactor  may be configured to maintain the same catalyst particles in the reaction tank , or may be configured to refresh the catalyst in the tank with supplemental catalyst particles. For example, the reactor  may include a catalyst source  configured to provide supplemental catalyst to the fluid  in the tank  through a channel . The catalyst amount and\/or timing of material provided by the source  may be controlled by any control structure (e.g., a valve, a belt that transports catalyst, etc.) which may be under the control of a control circuit (e.g., control circuit ). The reactor  may also be configured such that some of the catalyst  that is in the fluid  is removed from the tank . For example, the tank  may include a catalyst exit port . The fluid surface  may be maintained at a level that is at least partially above the starting edge  of the exit port  such that some of the fluid  and the catalyst  in the fluid  exits through the exit port .","The reactor  may include any number of other components configured to facilitate reaction of the reactant contained in the reactant source . For example, the reactor  may include a heater  configured to heat the tank  and\/or the components contained in the tank . The heater  may also be operated under the control of the control circuit .","In some embodiments, the reactor  is configured to have, incrementally, at least about 10 g, at least about 50 g, at least about 100 g, at least about 250 g, at least about 500 g, at least about 1 kg, at least about 10 kg, at least about 100 kg, at least about 250 kg, at least about 500 kg, at least about 750 kg, at least about 1000 kg, at least about 5000 kg, at least about 10,000 kg, and\/or at least about 25,000 kg of the catalyst  in the fluid  and\/or in the entire system of the reactor . In other embodiments, the reactor  may have less than 10 g of the catalyst  in the fluid  and\/or in the entire system of the reactor .","Referring to , a single pass reactor  includes a reactant source  configured to provide reactant under the control of a control structure  (e.g., valve, pump, etc.) which is controlled by a control circuit . Reactant enters a reaction chamber  through a channel  connected to an inlet  of the reaction chamber . The reactant pumped into the chamber  contacts the catalyst  (and\/or catalyst ) which is fixed to an interior surface of the chamber . The reactant is reacted in a reaction catalyzed by the catalyst . In some embodiments, the catalyst  may be configured to catalyze a dehydrogenation reaction (e.g., an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction) and\/or an ammoxidation reaction. Reacted (and also possibly unreacted) material exits the chamber  through an output port . The reactor  may include any of the other components of the reactor  of , such as the heater , the fluid , etc.","The following non-limiting examples are presented to illustrate the present invention and to assist one of ordinary skill in making and using the same. The examples are not intended in any way to otherwise limit the scope of the invention.","As a substrate material, we are using commercial silica gel powder (Silicycle S10040M) with a specific surface area of 100 m\/g, a primary particle size of 75-200 microns, and a nominal pore diameter of 30 nm.","The high surface area silica gel powder was contained in a fixed-bed powder fixture. The bottom tray of this fixture is constructed from 304 stainless steel with dimensions 143 mm\u00d729 mm\u00d73.2 mm deep. The top of the powder fixture is comprised of a 200\u00d7600 mesh stainless steel wire cloth cover with 40% open area supported by a perforated stainless steel plate. The fine mesh cover prevents convective gas currents from disturbing the flat powder layer at the bottom of the powder tray while allowing efficient diffusion of reactant and product gases in and out of the powder bed. The dimensions of the powder tray were selected such that the thickness of a silica gel powder layer with a mass of 1.0 g would be \u02dc0.5 mm or \u02dc8 particle diameters while leaving \u02dc2.7 mm of clearance between the powder layer and the cover. By spreading the silica gel powder into a thin layer, we ensure that diffusion of the ALD reactant gases between the silica gel particles is rapid.","The catalysts consist of a mixed oxide of NbO, VOand WO. Each of these oxide materials is deposited by ALD using different precursor combinations, exposure times, and substrate temperatures. These parameters are given in table 1. The quantities in table 1 are applicable to coating 1-gram quantities of the Silicycle S10040M powder substrate.","For example, the procedure for WOgiven in table 1 deposits metallic tungsten to coat the powder substrate.
