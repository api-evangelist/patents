{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","APPENDIX"],"p":["This application is related to, and claims the benefit of the earlier filing date under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/714,674, filed Sep. 7, 2005, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Supporting Media Services,\u201d and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/311,903, filed Feb. 13, 2003, entitled \u201cDatabase System, Particularly for Multimedia Objects,\u201d which is a national stage application of PCT\/GB01\/02857 filed Jun. 27, 2001; and is related to, and claims the benefit of the earlier filing date under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(b) of foreign application Serial No. 0504675.0, filed Mar. 7, 2005, entitled \u201cVideo Editing Systems\u201d; the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The media or broadcast industry has traditionally been confined to technologies that are expensive and an inflexible with respect to editing, production and delivery of media (e.g., video). By contrast, the communications affords great flexibility in terms of providing users with alternative networks and rich communication and entertainment services. In addition, the cost of equipment, from networking elements to end user equipment, follows a downward trend as advancements are made; for example, cellular phones are ubiquitous because of their affordability. The capabilities of these devices continue to evolve at a rapid pace; e.g., cellular phones are now equipped with high resolution displays and advanced processors to support sophisticated applications and services. Further, broadband data communications services have enabled transmission of bandwidth intensive applications, such as video broadcasts (e.g., web casts). The transformation of the communications industry has in turn influenced the media industry to rethink their business models and technological approaches.","However, in adopting these advances in communication technologies, the media industry faces a number of challenges. For instance, the issue of convergence of a broadband rich media experience and live television production and delivery needs to be addressed. Also, the demands of supporting real-time news, video on demand, user personalization, and continuing creative additions to initial systems pose additional engineering challenges. Further, delivery of interactive media (which describe real events in the real world in real-time) requires the capability to quickly acquire, store, edit, and composite live and other descriptive media by numerous users, e.g., editors, artists, and producers.","Based on the foregoing, there is a clear need for approaches that enable rapid processing and delivery of digital media.","An apparatus, method, and software for managing digital assets over a data network are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Although the various embodiments of the present invention are described with respect to the Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG) standards and Group of Pictures (GOP) technologies, it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to other equivalent video encoding standards and technologies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","101","102","102"]},"The platform  also supports remote proxy editing using a proxy editing application as executed by a proxy editor server , thereby permitting fast-turnaround broadcast productions. The editing application utilizes low-resolution version of the video content for the purposes of editing; hence, the editing application is referred to as a \u201cproxy editor.\u201d To support the above features and functions, the media services platform  enables multi-channel distribution of digital content to any variety and number of devices and networks\u2014e.g., wireless mobile devices, broadband, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), and traditional TV platforms\u2014thereby, reducing costs and increasing revenue over conventional systems. The architecture of the media services platform , according to one embodiment of the present invention, supports compact to enterprise-scale deployments, and ensures that storage and processing capabilities are robust and scalable, suitable for mission-critical broadcast operations.","It is recognized that there is an increasing need for professional, cost-effective editing of video feeds, such as television coverage of news or entertainment events, wherein the edited files can be provided over different alternative networks. For example, a user of a video enabled mobile cellular telephone might subscribe to a service that provides highlights of selected sporting events. Similarly, a user might subscribe to a sports headlines service, and receive files on a computer connected to a public data network, such as the global Internet. The real time delivery of events such as sports footage, interviews and edited highlights presents problems in such contexts, where it is necessary to produce compressed files to reduce the bandwidth for transmission over a cellular telephone network or a data network. Video files for such purposes need to be produced in an encoded format using, for instance, Group of Picture (GOP) technology, otherwise the raw digital stream would render timely transmissions and file storage impractical.","Thus, a video stream is created to include a sequence of sets of frames (i.e., GOP). By way of example, each group, typically 8 to 24 frames long, has only one complete frame represented in full. This complete frame is compressed using only intraframe compression, and thus is denoted as an I frame. Other frames are utilized and include temporally-compressed frames, representing only change data with respect to the complete frame. Specifically, during encoding, motion prediction techniques compare neighboring frames and pinpoint areas of movement, defining vectors for how each will move from one frame to the next. By recording only these vectors, the data which needs to be recorded can be substantially reduced. Predictive (P) frames refer to the previous frame, while Bi-directional (B) frames rely on previous and subsequent frames. This combination of compression techniques is highly effective in reducing the size of the video stream.","With GOP systems, an index is required to decode a given frame. Conventionally, the index is only written at the end of the file once the file has completed the encoding process. As a result, no index is available until the recording is completed. The implication is that the production of an edited version of the file, for example to transmit as highlights over a cellular phone network, cannot commence until the recording is completed and this index file produced. The media services platform  addresses this drawback by creating a separate index file, which can be supplemental to the routinely generated index file, during the recording and encoding process; this mechanism is detailed with respect to .","Accordingly, the platform , in an exemplary embodiment, can provide remote editing over any data network (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP)-based) that can support connectivity to the proxy editor server , whereby editing can commence without having to wait for completion of the recording. The proxy editor application resident on the server  enables developers to build professional-level desktop video editing applications using, for example, the Microsoft Windows Media 9 Series platform.","The platform  also provides significant scalability due to decoupled storage. Conventional editing systems required direct disk access to the video file. This poses a severe scalability issue, as every editing function (e.g., play, scrub, etc.) from the editing client creates disk traffic. If the storage cannot timely respond, a conventional editing application often freezes or crashes, such a scenario is unacceptable for real time feeds. With the media services platform , the content is downloaded once on each client cache; thus, the centralized storage requirements are reduced by a very significant factor (depending on editing type).","As seen in , the media services platform  utilizes a shared repository  that stores media (e.g., digitized video) content ingested from one or more video servers . Ingesting involves obtaining content into the media services platform , and can be accomplished locally or from a remote location. In one embodiment of the present invention, the repository  is deployed as a shared Storage Area Network (SAN) or NAS (Network Area Storage), which has the capability for high-performance video ingest and playback. The shared SAN  can utilize scalable Fibre Channel switch fabric to interface with a Fibre Channel disk array and nearline tape libraries. The video servers , as will be more fully described in , can interface any type of content sources, such as a media archive , a live feed , or a digital feed .","The media services platform  includes a workflow system , which comprises a workflow engine  and one or more resource servers  to support editing and distribution of digital media. The automated workflow provides the ability to automate and orchestrate repetitive workflows. In particular, the workflow system  offers users an overview of their work and associated events; that is, the system  supports an application that shows the status and progress of each job and links to relevant applications that enable the users to perform their tasks and advance the project towards completion. The workflow engine  controls workflow jobs and dispatches them to the resource servers . Communication among the resource servers  is facilitated by, for example, Microsoft Message Queuing.","In addition to providing individual users a central point for managing their work, the workflow system  is also useful as a monitoring system. For example, the system  can support a graphical user interface (GUI) on the user side, such that users can quickly determine through visual indicators whether tasks have been completed or error conditions exist. The users (e.g., administrators) can \u201cdrill down\u201d to view more detail. Also, jobs can be paused, restarted (from any stage), aborted and deleted from the workflow application. This capability provides users with full control over the priority of the jobs. Additionally, the system  can record timing information for every step of a task, thereby enabling generation of reports on delivery turnaround etc.\u2014e.g., for Service Level Agreement (SLA) reporting.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the media services platform  can be implemented with a pre-configured, standard set of common workflows. For instance, these workflows can support generic delivery of files, rendering of edits and delivery of content from the video server . Moreover, customizable workflows are supported, wherein the users can integrate new services.","As shown, the media services platform  comprises core servers, such as an object store , a media server , and an application server . In an exemplary embodiment, the object store  contains configuration information for the workflow system . Configuration information include, in an exemplary embodiment, parameters of every service, the capabilities of every resource server , the definition of workflows, and the real time status of every job. The object store  supports the various applications that interface with it through an object store Application Program Interface (API). According to one embodiment of the present invention, the object store  has an object-based database schema (e.g., Microsoft SQL (Structured Query Language) Server, for example. The media server  receives stream broadcasts and serves the stream on to individual user workstations using, for example, Microsoft Windows Media. The stream contains, for example, Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) timecode, enabling the stream to be used as a frame-accurate source for live logging.","The application server  provides dynamic web site creation and administration functions, such as a search engine, and database capabilities. In an exemplary embodiment, the application server  executes Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), and can be configured for high availability and load-balancing based on industry standard components.","The media server  and the application server  interface with the data network , which can be a corporate network or the Internet. The application server  is thus accessible by a workstation , which can be any type of computing device\u2014e.g., laptop, web appliance, palm computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), etc. The workstation  can utilize a browser (e.g., web-based), generally, to communicate with the media services platform , and a downloadable applet (e.g., ActiveX controls) to support distributed video editing functionality. The browser in conjunction with the applet is referred to an editing (or editor) interface\u2014e.g., the proxy editor player . The workstation  can also be equipped with voiceover microphone and headphones to facilitate the editing process. The proxy editor player  communicates with the proxy editor server  to enable the viewing and editing of content, including live video, remotely. Editing functionalities include immediate access to frame-accurate content, even while being recorded, full audio and video scrubbing of source clips and edit timelines over the network , and generation of Advanced Authoring Format\/Edit Decision List (AAF\/EDL) files for craft edit integration.","To connect to the media services platform , the workstation  need not require special hardware or software. As mentioned, the workstation  need only be configured to run a browser application, e.g., Internet Explorer, for communication over the data network . With this user interface, changes or upgrades to the workstation  are not required, as all the applications are hosted centrally at the platform .","In addition to the video server  within the media services platform , a remote video server  can be deployed to ingest content for uploading to the platform  via the data network . The video servers ,  include, in an exemplary embodiment, a longitudinal timecode (LTC) reader card as well as other video interfaces (e.g., RS-422 control card, Windows Media 9 Encoder and Matrox DigiServer video card). Video editing relies on the use of timecodes to ensure precise edits, capturing all in \u201cin points\u201d and \u201cout points\u201d of the edits. An edited video can be characterized by an edit decision list (EDL), which enumerates all the edits used to produce the edited video. LTC timecodes are recorded as a longitudinal track, analogous to audio tracks. With LTC, each frame time is divided into 80 bit cells. LTC timecodes are transmitted serially in four-bit nibbles, using Manchester codes.","The video servers ,  can be remotely controlled by the workstation . Also, these servers ,  can connect to the shared SAN  via Fibre Channel and a file system by, e.g., ADIC\u2122.","A syndication (or distribution) function  can then distribute content over various channels, such as a wireless network  (e.g., cellular, wireless local area network (WLAN)), a television network , and a broadband Internet Service Provider (ISP) network . Depending on the capabilities supported by the wireless or wired access network (e.g., networks  and ), rich services, such as presence, events, chatting\/instant messaging (IM), voice telephony, video, games and entertainment services can be supported.","Although the video server , the workflow engine , the object store , the media server , and the application server  are shown as separate components, it is recognized that the functions of these servers can be combined in a variety of ways within one or more physical component. For example, the object store , the application server , and the workflow engine  can reside within a single server; and the video server  and the media server  can be combined into a common server.","As mentioned above, the media services platform  enables media asset management, rapid production, and robust, cost-effective proxy editing capabilities. By way of illustration, management of media assets to support broadband video on demand (VOD) is described. One of the first tasks involved with VOD applications is ingesting full length movies into the video servers  for mastering and editing (e.g., removing black, stitching tapes together, adding legal notices etc). The masters are then stored on the shared SAN . The content is then transcoded to a high quality media stream format, such as Microsoft Windows Media 9 Series, and delivered automatically with metadata to their broadband video pay-per-view portal (e.g., any one or more of the networks ,  and ).","Additionally, the media services platform  can offer video archiving services. For instance, customers can extend their online storage with nearline tape and manage content seamlessly across multiple storage devices using add-on archive modules. Online storage can be backed up and\/or migrated to tape according to automated policies. Advantageously, this archival approach can be transparent to the users; that is, the users are never aware that the master video is no longer stored on expensive disk-based storage. In one embodiment, a library application can be implemented with the media services platform  to provide seamless integration with offline video and data tape archives. Further, the media services platform  provides high integration with existing production workflows through its capability to transcode and deliver any content contained in the archive to, for example, popular non-linear editors (e.g., AVID\u2122 editor).","Furthermore, the media services platform  enables flexible, cost-effective content aggregation and distribution, which is suitable for content service providers. Typical workflows involve aggregation of content from owners in such formats as Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG)-2 or Windows Media 9, along with metadata in extensible Markup Language (XML) files, using pre-configured File Transfer Protocol (FTP) hot folders. \u201cHot folders\u201d are predefined folders that trigger a workflow event (e.g., file conversion, compression, file transfer, etc.) upon movement of files into the folder. These owners can submit content directly to the workflow system  for automatic transcoding, Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection and syndication to multi-channel operators.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the media services platform  utilizes a unified user interface (e.g., web browser) for accessing applications supported by the platform . It is recognized that typical production and content delivery workflows often involve the use of multiple separate applications: one application for logging, a second application for encoding, a third one for editing, a fourth application for asset management, and so on. Consequently, the challenge of effectively managing workflows is difficult. The task is even more daunting in a multi-channel production and distribution environment, as greater elements need to coordinated and more applications have to be learned over traditional television environments.","The media services platform  advantageously simplifies this task by permitting access to the multitude of applications via a single unified user interface as part of a coherent workflow. In this manner, although various technologies are involved, the user experience is that of a single, user-friendly suite of tools, which shield non-technical users from the complex integration of applications and technologies.","The applications supported by the platform  include the following: media asset management and search, video editing, video server services, workflow, syndication, upload of media, library service, administration, quality assurance, copyright protection, music cue sheet services, and reporting. In addition, the users can develop their own applications within the unified user interface. Asset management permits users to manage the location of content within organized folder structures and categories. This capability is more fully described with respect to . The asset search function offers a generic search capability across the entire object store .","The media services platform  also provides a flexible and cost-effective approach for proxy logging and editing of live and archive material. Such editing services can be in support of news and sport editing, archive browsing and editing, mobile, broadband and IPTV production and mastering, and promotion production. The editing application provides viewing and logging of live feeds, frame-accurate proxy logging and editing, and remote proxy editing (e.g., utilizing Windows Media 9 Series proxy format). In addition, the editing application can support instant logging and editing while the feed is recording, as well as audio and video scrubbing. This editing application includes the following capabilities: edit timeline with effects; voiceover (while editing remotely\u2014which is ideal for translation workflows); save edit projects with versions; generate thumbnail and metadata from within the editing user interface; and export EDL's or render finished edits ready for transcoding and delivery. With this application, a user, through an inexpensive workstation , can efficiently master a movie for VOD distribution, rough-cut a documentary, or create a fully-finished sports highlight video with voiceover and effects.","The media services platform , in an exemplary embodiment, utilizes a Windows Media 9 Series codec, which allows high quality video (e.g., DVD-quality) to be logged and edited across the data network . Further, the platform  employs intelligent caching to ensure that the applications are as responsive as editing on a local hard drive, even over low-bandwidth connections; the caching architecture is described below with respect to .","The syndication application automates the creation and delivery of content and metadata to very specific standards for a range of target systems without manual intervention.","The upload application allows users to ingest digital files into the media services platform  and submit them to any permitted workflow. The users (with administrative responsibilities) can control which file types are allowed, which workflows are compatible, and the way in which different types of content are processed. The upload application can facilitate submission of the files to automatic workflows for hands-off end-to-end processing as well as to manual workflows that require manual intervention.","The upload application is complemented by a hot folder system, wherein workflow activities are automatically initiated upon movement of files into and out of the hot folders. The file system folders can be pre-configured to behave like the upload application and pass files of particular types to the workflows. Metadata for each asset provided in accompanying XML files can be acquired and mapped directly into the object store .","The reporting application enables users to create \u201cprinter-friendly\u201d reports on any information stored in the object store . The reporting application is pre-configured with a number of default reports for reporting on content delivery. Users can filter each report by selecting a desired property of the data, e.g., subscription name, or start and end date. Through the API of the media services platform , users (and system integrators) can create new report templates and queries.","The library application offers the ability to manage physical media that contain instances of assets managed in the media services platform . Even with continuing expansion in the use of digital media, traditional media continue to play an important role. Typical production environments possess a number of video tapes, DVDs or other physical media for storing content and data. Some environments utilize large established archives.","In mixed media environments, it is beneficial to manage digital and physical instances of content in an integrated manner. Accordingly, the library application provides the following capabilities. For example, the application permits the user to generate and print barcodes for the physical media and shelves, with automatic naming as well as bulk naming (with configurable naming conventions). Also, barcodes are employed for common actions, thereby allowing completely keyboard-free operation for checking in\/out and shelving of the physical media. The library application additionally can manage items across multiple physical locations, e.g., local and master libraries. Further, the application supports PDA-based applications with a barcode scanner for mobile checking in\/out and shelving. The library application advantageously simplifies management of multiple copies of the same asset on several physical media and storage of multiple assets on the same tape or DVD. The library application can further be used in conjunction with robotic tape libraries to track tapes that have been removed and shelved.","Moreover, the media services platform  provides an administration function to tailor system configuration for different customers. It is recognized that a \u201cone size fits all\u201d configuration for all users is non-existent. That is, each user, department, organization and customer has its own set of requirements. Therefore, the media services platform  supports concurrent use of multiple configurations. For example, each deployment can configure to its own user groups, create new workflows, integrate new services, support new content types, and specify new output media formats. The customer can also change and add metadata structures and fields, and integrate existing web-based applications into the user interface. The above capabilities can be executed, via the administration application, with immediate effect without shutting down the platform . Additionally, in a multi-department deployment scenario, multiple logical instances of the media services platform  can be configured with their own unique configurations.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the media services platform  can be implemented as a turn-key system within a single box\u2014e.g., in-a-box flight case. Under this configuration, there is no need for a costly and time-consuming IT (information technology) integration undertaking to rack the components or integrate them into the customer's network. Under this arrangement, the platform  is be configured as a plug-and-play system, connecting to the network automatically.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","201","203","205","207","211","101","101"]},"Ingestion, as performed by the ingest process , is the process by which the asset is incorporated into the Digital Asset Manager . In other words, ingesting involves capturing content into the media services platform  and can occur locally or remotely with respect to the platform . For example, the assets may be sourced from pre-existing digital files or encoded from tape. The asset can be ingested as part of an XML envelope containing important meta-data and links to supporting files (collateral). The productize process  provides a process by which a user (e.g., product manager) tags the asset with additional meta-data, pricing rules, rules for digital rights management and assigns the asset to one or more distribution channels (e.g., wireless network , TV network  and broadband ISP network ).","Once productized, the music videos can be offered as a managed service to content owners and content distributors. Such managed video service advantageously provides quick time-to-market, ease-of-use and flexibility for these owners and distributors; in this respect, the video service can be described as a \u201cbusiness enabler.\u201d As mentioned, music videos will be used to illustrate the retail content life-cycle and value chain. Users may browse any available music video. Revenue will be generated by advertising: advertisements will be streamed before each music video is streamed.","Via the transcode process , the original asset is proliferated into additional versions targeting various end-user devices. The rules for transcoding can be based upon the distribution channels selected for the asset. Once the asset has been transcoded into versions appropriate for the desired distribution channels, the transcoded versions are encrypted (e.g., Digital Rights Management) to prevent unauthorized use via the protect process .","After the asset is protected, the asset is distributed, per the distribute process , to the edge of the network where it may be staged for delivery and subsequent consumption (consume process ). For example, consumption options for the asset include personal computers (e.g., PC\/Mac), mobile phone, Windows Media Center PC, TV set top box, web-enabled devices, etc. Each of these distribution channels involves a different interface for interacting with the media services platform . The platform  can match advertisements to the amount of playback user consumes, and thus does not force the user to watch all advertisements. An exemplary delivery process utilizing templates is detailed below in .","As earlier explained, the media services platform  provides a video editing application with a rich set of features and capabilities. Specifically, the asset can be manipulated prior to distribution, for example, to include advertisements. By way of example, the user, utilizing the proxy editor player  (which is the counterpart software to the proxy editor supported by the media services platform ) on the workstation , can select and log the feed (assuming a live feed which is always visible), either marking in and out points manually or using an auto-clip feature for rapid logging. The user can also insert commentary and assign a rating to the video for determining which segment of the content is the most compelling content, thereby providing an indication of the selected clips that should be edited. During or after logging, the user can select clips from the log and use the proxy editor player to trim the selection. For example, the user can jog and shuttle along a timeline, or utilize a mouse wheel to scroll frame by frame to the desired cut point. The user can then preview the selection before placing it on the edit timeline. Thereafter, the user can manipulate the clips on the timeline, reorder and trim the selections. The proxy editor player  can permit the user to apply zoom and crop effects to close in on areas of interest; this capability is particularly valuable for broadband or mobile outputs where detail is important. The user can record a voiceover directly onto the timeline, thereby completing the edit.","The edit is then rendered as part of a workflow. In an exemplary embodiment, the edit is rendered using a high-resolution MPEG-2 master. Alternatively, an associated EDL is delivered to an integrated craft edit for completion. The media services platform  can support various workflows for craft editor integration, such as, store and forward, and instant editing. As for the store and forward approach, the content can be viewed, logged and edited using the proxy editor into packages for automated transcoding (from master MPEG-2) and delivery to popular non-linear editing systems (e.g., AVID Unity and AVID Media Composer, Adobe Premiere, Apple Final Cut Pro, Media 100, iFinish, Pinnacle Liquid and Vortex). With respect to instant editing, using the proxy editor player , the user can execute an ingest of a tape or a live feed, which can be viewed, logged and edited. The user can then export an EDL to a craft editor, which can be a third party craft editor (e.g., Incite Editor E3) that is integrated with the media services platform . When imported into Incite, the timeline is rebuilt frame-accurately, pointing to the MPEG-2 master on the shared SAN . Once the edit is complete, the craft editor creates a new MPEG-2 digital master, which is automatically re-ingested back into the platform  when dropped in an appropriate Hot Folder.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["221","101","102","223"]},"The digital asset manager  checks, as in step , whether the user that requested the digital media is a target for an advertisement. If indeed an advertisement has been designated for the user based on predetermined target parameters (e.g., user profile, etc.), the advertisement can be delivered to the user, per step . This delivery coordinated with the delivery of the digital asset. As shown, the digital asset is delivered according to the template, as in step . The platform  tracks usage of the digital asset  for accounting purposes.","As evident from the above process, the digital asset manager  can permit convenient delivery of digital media through the use of templates (exemplary templates are explained with respect to ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["102","301","301","303","305","303","303","303","303","301","303","305","305","305","305","305","301"],"i":["a ","b ","c ","d ","a","b","c ","d"]},"The manage asset function in conjunction with the manage portal function permits the asset manager  to enable frame-accurate remote browsing, logging and selection of thousands of hours of archive content from anywhere on the Internet or a private corporate WAN (e.g., data network ). The asset manager  allows users to manage the location of content within organized folder structures and categories. Content can be modified, deleted, copied, pasted and added through this application. Folders can store any asset type configured by administrators, from audio and video to ring-tones, images and documents.","The asset manager  also offers a flexible search capability for the object store . Users can search across their own work and that of others, thus facilitating sharing and simple retrieval of content. Further, other applications within the media services platform  can utilize this asset search capability, as to provide a consistent and recognizable function (i.e., common dialog) across these applications.","The object store  enables the asset management capability of the media services platform , permitting users (e.g., administrators) to change the fields and forms associated with an asset at any point by utilizing the proxy editor player . Under this approach, adapting the platform  to satisfy changing user requirements does not require expensive database administrators.","In this example, the virtual digital asset manager  accumulates content from a variety of content databases  and , and thus is considered \u201cvirtual.\u201d A customer can generate its own content, which can be stored in the original content database . In addition, the content of one or more third party content providers can be offered by the asset manager . Accordingly, the VDAM  enables tying of business partners (e.g., third party content providers), thereby enhancing the distribution of digitized assets. In an exemplary embodiment, the content owner can push content into the virtual digital asset manager  over the world wide web (e.g., network ). The virtual digital asset manager  can also provide private storage of asset data, and facilitate publishing of the content. In addition to being configured as an asset manager, the VDAM  can act as a directory server of all the assets provided by the users.","The users can create playlists for delivery of the assets. Also, these playlists can be generated base on a pre-defined list of \u201cthemes.\u201d Exemplary themes include: birthday party, dance party, cookout, wine tasting, romantic dinner, and bachelor party. Further, the playlists can be shared with other users across various devices.","Furthermore, it is contemplated that the virtual digital asset manager  can provide advertisement and transaction support. That is, a user can produce a video file that includes the stored content as well as advertisements; the manager  then tracks transactions relating to the retrieval and\/or viewing of the edited video file. In this manner, the customer has the capability to charge or otherwise account for such services; the pricing can be specified and updated via the manage pricing function . In an exemplary embodiment, the platform  can stream an advertisement before each music video is played and stream another advertisement at the conclusion of a playlist.","Advertisements are treated as digital assets and are ingested and managed in the system in a similar manner. However, advertisement meta-data is likely to contain different fields than other content; the meta-data can conform such standards as SMPTE, CableLabs, and MPEG7 (Multimedia Content Description Interface).

The live media stream module  communicates with the user interface  to provide logging and monitoring functions. The media proxy file module  supports the capability to perform editing functions during recording of the video. The video format module  converts a raw video stream into a standardized format\u2014MPEG-2, for example. The modules  and  interface the repository  to store the ingested contents.","As shown, the server  can support various input sources: an LTC time code source , a Serial Digital Interface (SDI) source , and a VDCP slave source . The video server  can generate multiple outputs in real-time from the SDI source , in contrast to conventional video servers which generate only a single output. The modules , ,  generate three types of outputs. One output is that of MPEG-2, in which the user can select between long-GOP and I-frame for each server, ranging from DVD-quality 5 Mbps long-GOP to 50 Mpbs I-frame only. The audio is captured at 48 kHz, for instance. The live media stream module  can generate a live media stream (e.g., Windows Media 7 Series) for broadcast over a network (e.g., networks - of ) to one or more media servers (e.g., media server ), which serve the stream on to individual user workstations. The stream can include SMPTE timecode, thereby providing a frame-accurate source for live logging.","Finally, the media proxy file module  can produce a file (e.g., Windows Media proxy file) for storage in the SAN . The proxy editor permits this file, according to one embodiment, to be opened for viewing and editing while the file is still being written. Thus, in conjunction with the proxy editor, the video server  supports fast-turnaround production of live events without the need for dedicated high-bandwidth networks and expensive edit suites, and without sacrificing quality or functionality.","In addition to the robust video editing functionality, the media services platform  provides management of the digital assets, as next explained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"81"},"In step , video signals are received by the platform ; namely, through the video server . The video signals are then recorded and encoded, as in step . In step , the first index file is generated during the recording. This first index file is updated during the encoding process (step ). In other words, while the video file is being recorded and subjected to encoding (e.g., GOP encoding), a separate index file is created and updated at regular intervals during the encoding process. Typically, the updating of the index file can occur every half a second. If the encoding process is complete (as determined in step ), then a second index file (i.e., conventional index file) is generated, as in step . Otherwise, the update of the first index file is continued.","If the editing application attempts to connect to a video file and cannot locate the index at the end of the file, the application will look automatically for the separate index file. The index file could be assigned the same name as the basic video (or media) file, but with a different extension\u2014although mapping to any name of file could be used. If an appropriate index file (which can indicate a different file extension than the video file) is found, the editor uses this external index to play\/render the file, which is still being recorded. This results in the editor being able to access content rapidly (e.g., within a one second maximum of the content being recorded). Once recording stops and the conventional index is added to the end of the video file, the external index file can be deleted as no longer necessary.","The above process can be applied to any GOP based video format (including Windows Media).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["901","901","101"]},"The architecture of the intelligent video cache system  has a number of layers: a video file content layer ; a non-sequential, compressed video file cache ; and a decompressed frame cache .

This cache  is non-sequential so that only parts of the video file (at GOP resolution) can be cached. In one embodiment, the cache  is maintained in main memory (e.g., Random Access Memory (RAM)) of the workstation , but can be aged by the player software to local disk. Also, within the client player, the decompressed frame cache  is provided in video memory (VRAM).","In this example, the cache  is filled by asynchronous proactive caching threads , which follow and predict user behavior patterns as well as fill the different layers ,  and  of the cache  as required to provide the best editing experience (within the constraints of the local workstation resources in terms of Central Processing Unit (CPU), RAM, disk and VRAM). The asynchronous aspect of the system is significant, and provides the user with an immediate response when scrubbing throughout a file or editing. If the system has not yet cached the desired frame, the player software can show the closest cached\/decompressed frame and display a status symbol indicating to the user that the current frame is not the correct frame. If the user waits, eventually that frame will render into the correct frame. The user interface is not locked by the caching mechanism\u2014i.e., the user can always choose to scrub somewhere else, play, etc. Furthermore, cache requests can be configured to have an expiry timeout, enabling cancellation to avoid building long queues of caching requests (which could no longer be relevant).","The following modes of operation of the editor player  are considered: idle, scrubbing, and playing. In idle mode, when the player has not changed state within a predetermined period of time (e.g., such as in the last 2 seconds), a playback caching thread first ensures that it has cached the next few seconds forward and backward from the playback head position. The thread ensures that the content is cached in decompressed VRAM cache . In this manner, if the user suddenly decides to play, the system can respond immediately. Once the playback caching thread is satisfied that the content is cached for immediate playback, the riddling thread is started.","The job of the riddling thread is to proactively download frames throughout the video in case the user starts scrubbing. The thread first downloads a GOP in the middle of the file, then every third of the file, then every ninth of the file, etc. This continues until the VRAM is full (it always leave the playback thread immediate playback content, but can replace other frames which have been cached and are no longer relevant). Once the VRAM is full, the thread continues\u2014but only to the compressed RAM cache and disk cache. If enough resources exist on the workstation  and time is left in idle mode, the full video can be cached in the compressed cache.","The scrubbing mode is triggered by fast \u201cplayback head\u201d movement, by a user operating an on screen editing tool (when not in play mode). The playback caching thread is disabled and all resources are given to the riddling thread to provide the best scrubbing experience.","When a play \u201cbutton\u201d is selected by a user within the proxy editor player , the playing mode is triggered. In this mode, the playback caching thread, and the riddling thread are disabled. A look-ahead caching thread is started which decompresses into VRAM the content ahead, and faster (if there are sufficient system resources) than the playback head.","The processes described herein for managing digital assets may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1000","1001","1003","1001","1000","1005","1001","1003","1005","1003","1000","1007","1001","1003","1009","1001"]},"The computer system  may be coupled via the bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display, active matrix display, or plasma display, for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for controlling cursor movement on the display .","According to one embodiment of the invention, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the present invention. Thus, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in , multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the present invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the present invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.","While the present invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the present invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.","The following patent applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties: pending U.S. patent application Ser.
