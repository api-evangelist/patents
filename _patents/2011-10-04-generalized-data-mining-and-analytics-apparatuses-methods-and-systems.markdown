The respective owners of such intellectual property have no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the disclosure by anyone as it appears in published Patent Office file\/records, but otherwise reserve all rights.","The present innovations are directed generally to information retrieval, and more particularly, to GENERALIZED DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS.","Search engines have come about, allowing users to enter search tokens into one or more text fields. Those search tokens may then be formed into query statements, which may be used to query a database and return search results to the user. The tokens may be sent to a server that forms the query statements and returns a static and selectable list of results to the user, allowing the user to select a desired link and navigate to a desired search result.","The rapid adoption of data collection technologies coupled with the reduction of data storage costs have led to an exponential growth in the size of enterprise and consumer databases and the increasing need for novel approaches to extract meaningful and actionable insights from these corpora. Furthermore, often the analyst or researcher who is attempting to extract emerging trends or insights from a corpus is not aware of exactly what they are looking for. Therefore there is a need for data mining apparatuses that can find meaningful insights from massive corpora consisting of both structured and unstructured data.","The GENERALIZED DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS (hereinafter \u201cGDMA\u201d) returns to the analyst, researcher, and\/or other user novel insights from a corpus and discovers insights from the data that the user may not have known to look for.","In various embodiments, the GDMA may leverage a data structure comprising a series of term tensors, where terms such as entities, phrases, numeric units, and\/or the like are associated with vectors comprising data of a specific type determined to be contextually related to the terms. Such term tensors and vectors may be used to identify what is new and interesting in the corpus, even when domain-specific ontologies are unknown, and presents results to the user via GDMA outputs which, in various embodiments, may include numerical results and\/or statistical relationships among entities or terms as determined based on analysis of a corpus of electronic documents. In one embodiment, the GDMA may recognize novel trends, relationships, clusters, outliers, phrase occurrences, deviations from historical baseline, and\/or the like to automatically present to the user what is new and\/or different in the corpus. In one implementation, such results may be presented to a user via a summary dashboard. In some implementations, such results may be determined automatically from the corpus with no user input, or from a predefined list of terms provided by the user which may be automatically run as queries by the GDMA at a time frequency determined by the user.","In another embodiment, a corpus query processor-implemented method is disclosed, comprising: receiving an electronic query comprising at least one query term; identifying a query type associated with the at least one query term; selecting at least one computer-searchable index based on the query type, comprising a plurality of searchable index entries associated with related occurrences of query terms in a corpus of source documents; querying the at least one searchable index based on the at least one query term to retrieve at least one term tensor comprising a plurality of type vectors, wherein each type vector comprises a collection of type values collected from a corpus of analyzed electronic documents for types correlated with the query term in the corpus of analyzed electronic documents; and providing at least one collection of type values from the term tensor for display.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed.

In various embodiments, the GDMA may facilitate a wide variety of different uses, such as but not limited to: retrieving numerical and\/or non-numerical data, trends, relationships, and\/or the like from a corpus of structured and\/or unstructured electronic documents; identifying similarities and\/or differences for selected characteristics related to query terms; pattern-based searching and\/or query refinement based on graphical interface selections; open-ended and\/or endpoint-constrained traversal-mode searching; highlighting and\/or suppressing outliers and\/or deviations from trends, averages, means, external data, and\/or the like; alerts and\/or associated actions based on occurrence of data points, trends, patterns, and\/or the like; discrimination of relationships, trends, patterns, and\/or the like; quantitative sentiment analysis; anonymization; automated optimization and\/or refinement of search results based on result trends and\/or patterns; and\/or the like. It is to be understood that, depending on the particular needs and\/or characteristics of a GDMA user, document corpus, data resource, system architecture, processor capability, data transmission capability and\/or network framework, and\/or the like, various embodiments of the GDMA may be implemented that facilitate a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments primarily within the context of electronic document analysis and information retrieval. However, it is to be understood that the systems described herein may be readily configured and\/or customized for a wide variety of other applications and\/or implementations. For example, aspects of the GDMA may be configured for analyzing form inputs, data feeds, images, detected and\/or recorded sounds, and\/or the like; facilitating natural language queries; result quality analysis and\/or diagnostics; and\/or the like.

For example, if the query term received at  is the anticoagulant drug \u201cWarfarin,\u201d the GDMA may identify data types related to and\/or correlated with that term in the corpus of analyzed documents, such as \u201cgram second^\u22121\u201d (which may be indicative of a dosage rate for the drug), \u201cgram\/m^3\u201d (which may be indicative of a density associated with the drug), and\/or the like.","In one implementation, a GDMA server may configure retrieved results as a term tensor, which may comprise a plurality of type vectors, wherein each type vector may comprise a collection of type values collected from a corpus of analyzed electronic documents for types correlated with the query term in the corpus of analyzed electronic documents. In one implementation, such a term tensor may be provided to a client terminal device, where further display configuration may take place. In another implementation, some or all of the display configuration may occur at the GDMA server, and the term tensor and display configuration instructions may then be supplied to the client terminal for user display.","The GDMA may further identify one or more phrase variants of the query term (e.g., \u201cwarfarin group,\u201d \u201cwarfarin therapy,\u201d \u201coral warfarin,\u201d and\/or the like), which may, in one implementation, be indicative of phrases containing the query term that occur in the corpus of analyzed documents. In one implementation, only those data types and\/or phrase variants having the greatest correlation with the query term (e.g., greater than a lower cutoff) and\/or occurring most frequently in association therewith may be identified and\/or otherwise included by the GDMA at . In one implementation, a correlation may be established as a weighted sum of occurrences of the data type and\/or phrase variant in association with the query term in the document corpus, where each occurrence is weighted according to weighting factors, such as, but not limited to: the proximity between the query term and type\/variant; presence of punctuation or other delimiting characters between the query term and type\/variant; presence of other query terms, types, variants, and\/or the like between the query term and the type\/variant; presence of prepositions or other parts of speech indicative of a relationship (e.g., based on natural language processing or \u201cNLP\u201d techniques) that occur between the query term and the type\/variant; frequency of occurrence of a given type value and\/or phrase variant; presence of an intervening phrase or other syntactic structure between the query term and the type\/phrase; and\/or the like. Further details surrounding the identification of data types, phrase variants, and\/or the like as they relate to query inputs, query terms, search terms, and\/or the like is provided below and in co-pending application Ser.

Such a term tensor may comprise vectors of different categories and\/or types of data related to the query term, where each vector may contain all values of that data type determined to be contextually related to the query term.","The GDMA may determine the relevance of all terms and\/or discovered data types to the received query inputs . In one implementation, relevance may be determined as and\/or based on the correlation between the query term and the discovered data type and\/or phrase variant, as described above. The GDMA may then sort results of data types (e.g., the vectors that comprise the term tensor generated in response to the query) by relevance  (e.g., such that a term of a specific data type that occurs near the query term in many documents, without intervening punctuation, noun phrases, and\/or the like will be ranked higher than a term of a data type that occurs near the query term only in a few documents, and often with punctuation separation, noun phrase separation, and\/or the like). The GDMA may then configure the query results , which may include values, numerical or otherwise, for one or more of the discovered data types and\/or for phrase variants (e.g., in one implementation, phrase variants may be the default selection, and the GDMA may retrieve correlation values for different phrase variants for display). The GDMA may further configure the list of discovered data types and\/or phrase variants themselves for display in conjunction with the display of values for the default and\/or selected types\/variants. In one implementation, correlated types\/variants may be configured as an ordered list, where the position of each type\/variant in the list is determined according to the relative correlation values associated with each type\/variant. In various other implementations, the GDMA may present relevance and\/or correlation information for discovered data types and\/or phrase variants in any of a wide variety of other ways, such as, but not limited to, by shading the types\/variants; by color; by size of type\/variant identifiers and\/or icons; by position of type\/variant identifiers and\/or icons (e.g., distance from a central point, where the type\/variant identifiers are arranged on concentric circles having radii dependent on the relevance and\/or correlation values); and\/or the like and\/or any combinations thereof. In one implementation, the GDMA may further associate additional information, metadata, document source information, and\/or the like with one or more displayed data values. For example, for each data point corresponding to a value of the displayed default and\/or selected data type and\/or phrase variant, the GDMA may access and\/or provide for display a collection of information (e.g., a snippet), such as global information associated with the document source from which the data point was derived (e.g., title, date of creation, date of last edit, author, document size, document rating, and\/or the like), local information associated with the document source (e.g., a portion of the text from which the data point was derived and\/or extracted), statistical information characterizing the data point with respect to other similar and\/or related data points and\/or statistical quantities derived therefrom, and\/or the like.","The configured results are then displayed and\/or provided for display to the user . A determination may be made as to whether any display reconfiguration commands have been received , such as may include a change in display parameters, display ranges (e.g., range of values for data types and\/or phrase variants, range of values for occurrence counts, correlation values, relevance values, and\/or the like), data representation format (e.g., histogram representation, timeline representation, correlated data representation, and\/or the like), data type and\/or phrase variant sorting (e.g., by count of occurrences, correlation value, relevance value, alphabetically, chronologically, according to dates associated with the earliest and\/or latest source documents, and\/or the like), and\/or the like. If such a display reconfiguration command has been received, the GDMA may return to  to reconfigure the query results and discovered data types and\/or phrase variants for display. Display reconfiguration may include any combination of server-side and\/or client-side processing activities.","In another configuration, the results, and in at least one implementation the entire term tensor associated with the query term, are exportable to a relational database and\/or may be employed to seed a predictive analytics package (e.g., IBM SPSS Statistics, Modeling, and\/or Deployment packages; GNU R and\/or Comprehensive R Archive Network packages; and\/or the like). In an alternative implementation, the entire term tensors and\/or some fraction thereof may be exported to one or more data visualization interfaces (e.g., the Mondrian data visualization package, GGobi, and\/or the like) via corresponding APIs.","If no display reconfiguration command is received at , the GDMA may determine whether a new data type and\/or phrase variant selection has been received. If so, then the GDMA may return to  to reconfigure query results based on the data type selection. For example, in one implementation, selection of a new data type may trigger the querying and\/or accessing of data type values associated with the selected data type from the term tensor and\/or from other GDMA data resources, and configuration of retrieved values for display based on default and\/or selected display configuration parameters. In one implementation, data type selection may further cause reconfiguration and\/or generation of other displayed data types and\/or phrase variants, such as based on their relationship with and\/or correlation to the selected data type and\/or the original query terms. Thus, for example, whereas the original list of data types may include those most correlated with the original query terms, selection of a data type may cause the GDMA to determine and\/or provide a list of other data types and\/or phrase variants that are associated in the document corpus with both the original query terms and the first data type. If no new data type selection is received at , a determination may be made as to whether a new query input has been received . If so, then the GDMA may return to . Otherwise, the operation may conclude .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","305","310"]},"If one or more subsidiary display configuration options are available, the GDMA may configure the statistical distribution representation in accordance with a default subsidiary display configuration format , and may present one or more subsidiary display configuration option selection UI elements (e.g., drop-down menu, radio buttons, switches, control knobs, dials, and\/or the like) for display . The statistical display representation may then be provided for display to the user, and may further include one or more representation format selection UI elements , which may allow a user to specify a desired representation format such as histogram, timeline, correlated and\/or XY plot, and\/or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4B","FIGS. 4A-B","FIGS. 4A-4B","FIGS. 4A-4B","FIGS. 4A-4B"]},"The techniques and\/or metrics illustrated in  include:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5D","FIG. 5A","FIGS. 4A-4B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5A"],"b":["501","505","505","510","515","515","510","520","510","520","521","522","521","523","524","524"]},"The GDMA may perform a variety of operations utilizing term tensors. In one implementation, the GDMA may allow for comparison of two or more term tensors along one or more data type constraints.  shows a first term tensor  having a type vector corresponding to data type A, and a second term tensor  also having a type vector corresponding to data type A. The GDMA may evaluate an inner product , convolution, cross-spectral density, pair-wise comparison, and\/or the like between the corresponding data type vectors for each term tensor , , such as to obtain a measure of the similarity  between the term tensors as reflected in the data type values. Thus, in one example, two companies may be compared according to a \u201cprofits\u201d data type in order to determine the similarities between associations of those company names in the document corpus with profit values. In another example, two individuals can be compared according to a \u201cmeters\u201d data type to evaluate, perhaps, the similarities in their heights, or in other characteristic length values associated with those individuals. In one implementation, the GDMA may re-bin, normalize, crop, perform unit conversion on, and\/or the like one or both type vectors prior to similarity determination in order to facilitate the evaluation of the inner product.","The GDMA may also be configured to admit comparisons of two or more term tensors along more than one data type constraint. In , both a first term tensor  and a second term tensor  include type vectors corresponding to data types A and B. The GDMA may determine an inner product  for each of the data types, as discussed above with reference to , and may store, publish, provide, and\/or the like a list of type-specific inner products . In one implementation, the GDMA may further combine type-specific inner product values via one or more combination operations  to yield an overall overlap or similarity between the terms corresponding to the term tensors. For example, in one implementation, the GDMA may sum type-specific inner products across all selected types to determine an overall similarity.","The GDMA may also be configured to compare different data type vectors from a single term tensor and\/or across two or more term tensors. In , a single term tensor is shown  having type vectors corresponding to data types A and B. The GDMA may first execute one or more normalization operations  on the type vectors, in order to render them suitable for comparison, inner product determination, and\/or the like. For example, the GDMA may convert units, scale, extrapolate, interpolate, re-bin, multiply by one or more coefficients, convert type values to new type values based on a conversion table lookup, and\/or the like. Normalized type vectors may then be subjected to one or more inner product operations  in order to determine a projection  of one data type vector on to the other. Thus, in one example, a \u201cmeters\u201d type in a term tensor drawn from demographic data (e.g., such as may correspond to heights) may be compared to a \u201cU.S. dollars\u201d type vector (e.g., such as may correspond to wages\/salaries) in the same or another term tensor by, for example, first converting the meters values to dollars by reference to a lookup table correlating heights to salaries drawn from external data sources and\/or from the GDMA-analyzed document corpus itself.","The GDMA may admit a wide variety of data representation formats in order to reflect and\/or highlight various aspects of trends, relationships, dynamics, outliers, and\/or the like of document corpus data.  shows an implementation of logic flow for histogram data representation in one embodiment of GDMA operation. The GDMA may be configurable to restrict and\/or regulate the size and\/or scope of the document corpus, term tensors, inverted index query, and\/or the like depending on system settings, default values, user selections, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the GDMA may access a default document sample size  and identify one or more data type values occurring in association with query terms within that collection of documents . In one implementation, an association between a query term and a particular data type and\/or type value may be registered whenever the query term is detected within a specified distance (e.g., number of characters) from the data type and\/or type values in any document in the corpus. The GDMA may also determine weighting factors  for each association detected at , such as may be based on one or more weighting heuristics such as those illustrated in . Display values may then be determined  as a sum of the number of associations identified at , where each association is weighted by the corresponding weighting factor determined at . The GDMA may then generate a histogram, presenting for each data type value, and\/or range thereof, corresponding display values . An example of such a histogram representation is provided in . In one implementation, the GDMA may package data type values and corresponding display values for a given query term as a term tensor similar to that shown in the examples of .","A determination may be made as to whether a sample size change (e.g., a change in the number of analyzed documents in the corpus) has been entered or requested .

If not within allowed bounds, the GDMA may undertake one or more error handling procedures , such as providing an error message to the requesting user, requesting reentry of the size request, setting a default and\/or limiting sample size, and\/or the like.

Such a time series may also be provided to a predictive analytics package, such as to evaluate its correlation with other data patterns, as discussed herein.","Quantitative sentiment analysis such as that described above and\/or with reference to , may be employed by the GDMA within a wide variety of different application contexts. For example, in one implementation, the GDMA may employ quantitative sentiment analysis to correlate quantitative pricing information for consumer goods with qualitative consumer entries in consumer satisfaction surveys. Such correlations may be employed to inform future product pricing, such as by assigning prices based on focus group comments for new products. In another example, the GDMA may correlate pricing information for financial securities with various cues in financial analyst commentary, and evaluate subsequent commentary to predict future price values for securities to which that commentary is pertinent. In yet another example, the GDMA may establish an automatic grading system by analyzing graded, rated, ranked, and\/or the like documents to correlate those grades with the qualitative and\/or unstructured content of those documents. The GDMA may then analyze the content of future documents in order to automatically assign a grade, rating, rank, and\/or the like thereto. In yet another example, the GDMA may establish an intellectual property and\/or creative content valuation tool by correlating sale prices for patents, copyrighted materials, manuscripts, plays, poems, songs, contracts, and\/or the like with the content of those documents. A subsequent patent, copyrighted material, manuscript, play, poem, song, contract, and\/or the like may then be valued based on the analyzed content of the documents in view of correlated pricing information. It is to be understood that the applications of the GDMA's quantitative sentiment analysis features discussed herein are for illustrative purposes only, and the GDMA's quantitative sentiment analysis features may be configured for a wide variety of other applications as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIGS. 5A-5D"],"b":["1401","1405","1410","1415","1420","1425","1430","1435","1440","1405","1445"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 12","FIG. 15"],"b":["1501","1505","1510","1515","1520","1525","1530","1555"]},"If the comparison is determined to not be type-specific at , the GDMA may access term tensors corresponding to each of the entities to be compared  and may identify all common data types between the two tensors .

In turn, computers employ processors to process information; such processors  may be referred to as central processing units (CPU). One form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative circuits to pass binary encoded signals acting as instructions to enable various operations. These instructions may be operational and\/or data instructions containing and\/or referencing other instructions and data in various processor accessible and operable areas of memory  (e.g., registers, cache memory, random access memory, etc.). Such communicative instructions may be stored and\/or transmitted in batches (e.g., batches of instructions) as programs and\/or data components to facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction codes, e.g., programs, may engage the CPU circuit components and other motherboard and\/or system components to perform desired operations. One type of program is a computer operating system, which, may be executed by CPU on a computer; the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Some resources that may be employed in information technology systems include: input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer; memory storage into which data may be saved; and processors by which information may be processed. These information technology systems may be used to collect data for later retrieval, analysis, and manipulation, which may be facilitated through a database program. These information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.","In one embodiment, the GDMA controller  may be connected to and\/or communicate with entities such as, but not limited to: one or more users from user input devices ; peripheral devices ; an optional cryptographic processor device ; and\/or a communications network .","Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients, servers, and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term \u201cserver\u201d as used throughout this application refers generally to a computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting \u201cclients.\u201d The term \u201cclient\u201d as used herein refers generally to a computer, program, other device, user and\/or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that facilitates, processes information and requests, and\/or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a \u201cnode.\u201d Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a \u201crouter.\u201d There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs), Pico networks, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Networks (WLANs), etc. For example, the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.","The GDMA controller  may be based on computer systems that may comprise, but are not limited to, components such as: a computer systemization  connected to memory .","A computer systemization  may comprise a clock , central processing unit (\u201cCPU(s)\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor(s)\u201d (these terms are used interchangeable throughout the disclosure unless noted to the contrary)) , a memory  (e.g., a read only memory (ROM) , a random access memory (RAM) , etc.), and\/or an interface bus , and most frequently, although not necessarily, are all interconnected and\/or communicating through a system bus  on one or more (mother)board(s)  having conductive and\/or otherwise transportive circuit pathways through which instructions (e.g., binary encoded signals) may travel to effectuate communications, operations, storage, etc. The computer systemization may be connected to a power source ; e.g., optionally the power source may be internal. Optionally, a cryptographic processor  and\/or transceivers (e.g., ICs)  may be connected to the system bus. In another embodiment, the cryptographic processor and\/or transceivers may be connected as either internal and\/or external peripheral devices  via the interface bus I\/O. In turn, the transceivers may be connected to antenna(s) , thereby effectuating wireless transmission and reception of various communication and\/or sensor protocols; for example the antenna(s) may connect to: a Texas Instruments WiLink WL1283 transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 3.0, FM, global positioning system (GPS) (thereby allowing GDMA controller to determine its location)); Broadcom BCM4329FKUBG transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, FM, etc.); a Broadcom BCM4750IUB8 receiver chip (e.g., GPS); an Infineon Technologies X-Gold 618-PMB9800 (e.g., providing 2G\/3G HSDPA\/HSUPA communications); and\/or the like.

The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. It should be understood that in alternative embodiments, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests. Often, the processors themselves will incorporate various specialized processing units, such as, but not limited to: integrated system (bus) controllers, memory management control units, floating point units, and even specialized processing sub-units like graphics processing units, digital signal processing units, and\/or the like.

The CPU may be a microprocessor such as: AMD's Athlon, Duron and\/or Opteron; ARM's application, embedded and secure processors; IBM and\/or Motorola's DragonBall and PowerPC; IBM's and Sony's Cell processor; Intel's Celeron, Core (2) Duo, Itanium, Pentium, Xeon, and\/or XScale; and\/or the like processor(s). The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and\/or transportive conduits (e.g., (printed) electronic and\/or optic circuits) to execute stored instructions (i.e., program code) according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the GDMA controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and\/or capacity, distributed processors (e.g., Distributed GDMA), mainframe, multi-core, parallel, and\/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be employed.","Depending on the particular implementation, features of the GDMA may be achieved by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST's R8051XC2 microcontroller; Intel's MCS 51 (i.e., 8051 microcontroller); and\/or the like.

Alternately, some implementations of the GDMA may be implemented with embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal processing.","Depending on the particular implementation, the embedded components may include software solutions, hardware solutions, and\/or some combination of both hardware\/software solutions. For example, GDMA features discussed herein may be achieved through implementing FPGAs, which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable logic components called \u201clogic blocks\u201d, and programmable interconnects, such as the high performance FPGA Virtex series and\/or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx. Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the GDMA features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the GDMA system designer\/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or mathematical operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the GDMA may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate GDMA controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the \u201cCPU\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor\u201d for the GDMA.","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like.

However, memory is a fungible technology and resource, thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the GDMA controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the operation of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; however, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  will include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage.

These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the GDMA controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Nan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems.

The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the GDMA controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the GDMA database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the GDMA database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the GDMA. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the GDMA as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, capabilities, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces.

Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Also, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar operations of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the GDMA enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POP), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the GDMA.","Access to the GDMA mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash operation), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the GDMA may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the GDMA component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the GDMA and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The GDMA database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the GDMA database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the GDMA database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the GDMA database  may be integrated into another component such as the GDMA component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A user accounts table may include fields such as, but not limited to: user_ID, name, login, password, contact_info, query_history, settings, preferences, and\/or the like. The user accounts table may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on a GDMA. A data corpus table may include fields such as, but not limited to: corpus_ID, document_ID(s), document_name(s), document_type(s), source, author, date, document_content, document_metadata, and\/or the like. A data feeds table may include fields such as, but not limited to: data_feed_ID, data_feed_name, data_feed_type, data_feed_content, source, author, date, data_feed_metadata, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the data feed table may be populated by a market data feed (e.g., Bloomberg's PhatPipe, Dun & Bradstreet, Reuter's Tib, Triarch, etc.), for example, through Microsoft's Active Template Library and Dealing Object Technology's real-time toolkit Rtt.Multi. An indices table may include fields such as, but not limited to: index_ID, index_type, corpus_ID, document_ID(s), data_feed_ID(s), term(s), data_type(s), data_type value(s), snippet(s), source(s), author(s), date(s), and\/or the like. A display table may include fields such as, but not limited to: display_ID, display_configuration, settings, preferences, user_ID(s), and\/or the like. A weights\/scores table may include fields such as, but not limited to: weight_ID, weight_value, document_ID(s), correlation, relevance, similarity, and\/or the like. A term tensor(s) table may include fields such as, but not limited to: term_tensor_ID, term, data_type(s), data_type_value(s), snippet(s), document_ID(s), data_feed_ID(s), document_metadata, data_feed_metadata, and\/or the like, correlation, relevance, similarity, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the GDMA database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search GDMA component may treat the combination of the GDMA database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the GDMA. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the GDMA may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The GDMA may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The GDMA database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the GDMA database communicates with the GDMA component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The GDMA component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the GDMA component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the GDMA that was discussed in the previous figures. As such, the GDMA affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The GDMA transforms electronic documents, user query inputs, and data type selections via GDMA input processing component , query component , index component , display configuration component , weighting\/scoring component , and type vector processing component  into term tensors, query results, data type value representations, alerts, entity comparisons, quantitative sentiment analysis scoring schemes, transaction instructions, and\/or the like outputs.","The GDMA component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the GDMA server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The GDMA component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the GDMA component communicates with the GDMA database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The GDMA may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the GDMA node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the GDMA controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.","For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and\/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like. Again, the desired configuration will depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment.","For example, in some implementations, the GDMA controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) socket server via the information server, which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data, e.g., data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication, the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device, parse the received JSON-encoded text data to extract information from the JSON-encoded text data into PHP script variables, and store the data (e.g., client identifying information, etc.) and\/or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language (\u201cSQL\u201d). An exemplary listing, written substantially in the form of PHP\/SQL commands, to accept JSON-encoded input data from a client device via a SSL connection, parse the data to extract variables, and store the data to a database, is provided below:\n\n","Also, the following resources may be used to provide example embodiments regarding SOAP parser implementation:","http:\/\/www.xav.com\/perl\/site\/lib\/SOAP\/Parser.html","http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v2r1\/index.jsp?t","opic=\/com.ibm.IBMDI.doc\/referenceguide295.htm","and other parser implementations:","http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v2r1\/index.jsp?t","opic=\/com.ibm.IBMDI.doc\/referenceguide259.htm","all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.","In order to address various issues and advance the art, the entirety of this application for GDMA (including the Cover Page, Title, Headings, Field, Background, Summary, Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description, claims, Abstract, Figures, Appendices, and otherwise) shows, by way of illustration, various embodiments in which the claimed innovations may be practiced.
