title: Method and apparatus for region sampling and estimation in location based networks
abstract: Various embodiments provide a method and apparatus for obtaining a representative sample set of venues (i.e., places) within a geographic region in a location based network using a low cost and efficient sampling and estimating algorithm. In particular, a dynamic random region sampling algorithm randomly selects a target location within a geographic region and then determines a sub-region containing the target location within the geographic region based on venue density prediction. Venue density prediction is based on a weighted average of venue densities of two or more comparable locations within the geographic region.

In particular, venue databases  provide a list of venues in a given geographic region to DRRS server . Moreover, at least one of venue databases  impose a return limit (e.g., no more than 50 venues per query are returned) and optionally a rate limit (e.g.,  API queries per hour per authorized user) to restrict the query capacity of the venue search.","The term \u201cvenue\u201d as used herein means a physical location. The term \u201clocation based information\u201d as used herein includes any data associated with a particular venue. For example, location based information may be the number of people checked in at the venue, venue category (e.g., Arts & Entertainment or Pharmacy), a venue name (e.g., \u201cCVS\u201d), address, contact information, creation time, location rating, or the like.","It should be appreciated that in some embodiments, one or more of venue databases  may not provide all venues in geographic region response to a query. For example, there may be: (1) a small error rate (e.g., in some embodiments the error rate is one percent or less) in the return due to, for example, removed venues, new venues, duplicated venues, incorrectly entered venues, or the like; (2) venues sharing the same location such as, for example, planes or taxis; or (3) venues subject to privacy controls such as, for example, venues identified as \u201cprivate\u201d (e.g., \u201cHome (Private)\u201d venues in Foursquare are obfuscated by assigning them a common location).

In particular, stopping conditions are the conditions that indicate exhaustive venue collection within the identified geographic region is complete. Exhaustive venue collection is a method designed to retrieve a complete set of in-venues from a given geographic region.","In the method , the step  includes dividing the search region. In particular, search regions are divided to a size that does not violate the return limit or the smallest resolution of the venue database (e.g., one of databases  of ).","In the method , the step  includes performing a venue search for the regions divided in step . In particular, a query of the venue database to retrieve the set of in-venues within the divided geographic region is performed.","In some embodiments, the method  is smallest resolution search. In some of these embodiments, the geographic region is divided in a grid of smallest resolution search regions and a venue search is performed on each reason. In these embodiments, the stopping conditions may be the completion of searching each of the smallest resolution search regions in the grid. It should be appreciated that many search algorithms may specify a minimum defined search region or the observed results of searches in regions smaller than a threshold minimum size may return the same venue results. In some of these embodiments, the imposed minimum defined search region or threshold minimum size is the smallest resolution search region. For example, we have observed that in results returned from Foursquare, when the latitude or longitude of the bounding box is as small as 4.8828\u00d710, queries on any sub-boxes return the same set of venues as the bounding box. This indicates that the smallest resolution handled by the Foursquare API is equivalent to roughly 4.8mat the equator and 2.4mat 60\u00b0 latitude.","In some embodiments, the method  is a two dimensional binary division algorithm. In some of these embodiments, method  is as described in .","In some embodiments, step  occurs after step .","Referring to , the Insearch algorithm is explained below.","In line 1, InSearch receives G, V(G) and V(G) as inputs. Where Gis a geographic region with a size less than a threshold \u0101, V(G) is a set of venues, and V(G) is a set of in-venues.","In line 2, InSearch outputs V(G), V(G) and B. Where V(G) is a set of venues, and V(G) is a set of in-venues, and Bis the cost of the algorithm specified in the number of queries performed.","In line 3, the variables are initialized: V(G) to an empty set and Bto zero.","Optionally, in line 4, if the size of the geographic region Gis less that a smallest resolution s, then the method returns in line 5.","In line 6, geographic region Gis divided into four (4) regions; in line 7 four (4) searches are performed on the divided regions to return in-venues; and in line 8 venue set V(G) is set to include the in-venues returned in line 7. It should be appreciated that since four (4) searches have been performed, the cost Bis incremented by four (4) in line 7.","In line 9, current in-venue set V(G) is compared to previous in-venue set V(G) to determine whether any new in-venues have been collected and total previous venue set V(G) is compared to a return threshold  to determine whether the returned set of venues is less threshold. It should be appreciated that comparing the set of new in-venues against previous in-venues protects against instances where a returned set of venues is less than the return threshold , but the actual number of venues in the geographic region is more than the return threshold . For example, we have observed that in some instances in Foursquare, a query on a geographic region may return less than 50 venues (e.g., the return limit), when there are actually more than 50 in that geographic region. This observation indicates that a return with less than  venues may not be sufficient to indicate the completeness of the return.","In line 10, if the test in line 9 is satisfied then the method returns.","In line 12, if the test in line 9 is not satisfied, then the method recursively performs an InSearch call for the four (4) divided regions (line 13) and increments the cost Bby the cost of the respective InSearch algorithm (line 14).","In line 15, V(G) is set to the union of the four (4) InSearch calls for the in-venues of the divided regions in step  and V(G) is set to the four (4) InSearch calls for the venues of the divided regions in step .","In line 16, the method returns.","In some embodiments, line 9 may be replaced by a test whether the venues in V(G) is less than a return threshold . In some embodiments, line 4 may further include a test comparing whether the venues in V(G) is less than a return threshold  and line 9 and 10 may be removed.","In some embodiments of line 9, the return threshold  may be the return limit of the venue database. In other embodiments, the return limit  may be the return limit less a buffer threshold.","In the some embodiments of the algorithm of , the stopping conditions are: (1) (a) the number of returned venues being less than the return threshold ; and (b) the returned in-venue set obtained by going one level further does not add any new in-venues; (line 9) or (2) the smallest resolution has been reached (line 4).","Referring to , the exhaustive search algorithm of  is illustrated. The density of the shading within geographic region  is depicted in venue density colorbar . As illustrated, darker shaded areas of geographic region  have higher venue densities. At level 0, the InSearch routine of  is called. At level 1, two dimensional binary division is applied to geographic region  to create the four first division regions separated by division line - and four API searches are performed on the four (4) first division regions. As illustrated in the InSearch algorithm of , the four first division regions are subdivided by division lines --- until the stopping conditions are met. It should be appreciated that the less dense of the regions will be subdivided less (e.g., the upper right quadrant of geographic region  is not sub divided further while the upper left quadrant of geographic region  is further subdivided by division lines -, - and -.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","150","100","520","595","530","540","520","550","550","550","560","570","520"]},"In the method , the step  includes determining whether a sampling budget is exceeded. Based on the determination, the method either proceeds to steps  or returns (step ). In particular, a budget identifies a threshold amount of resources to use in determining the venue distribution within the identified geographic region and if the threshold is exceeded, the method returns. A budget may be any suitable parameter. For example, in some embodiments the budget is a threshold number of venue retrieval requests that may be performed.","In the method , step  includes selecting a target location within the geographic region. In particular, a location \u201cIl\u201d is randomly chosen from within the identified geographic region.","The method  optionally includes step . Step  includes determining whether the target location is contained in a geographic region where the included venues has already been determined. Based on the determination, the method either proceeds to steps  or returns to step . In particular, if a previously valid and determined geographic sub-region of the identified geographic region exists, the method may determine that the set of venues in that previously determined geographic sub-region does not need to be determined again. Any suitable method may be used to determine that a geographic sub-region is valid such as, for example, (1) using a time stamp and a valid time threshold to determine whether the sub-region has been determined within the valid time threshold period; or (2) using the existence of the geographic sub-region to indicate that the sub-region is valid. In some of these embodiments, older sub-regions may be removed.","In the method , step  includes determining comparable locations based on the target location. In particular, two or more locations within the identified geographic region are determined based on: (1) the locations having known venue densities; and (2) the comparable locations being determined to be of the highest relevance to the target location when compared to other known comparable locations. Highest relevance may be determined using any suitable method. For example, highest relevance may be determined by selecting the two more comparable locations that are geographically in closest proximity to the target location.","In the method , step  includes determining a search region based on the target location and the comparable locations. In particular, the coordinates of the search region are based on the target location and the area of the search region is based on the venue densities of the comparable locations.","Advantageously, by taking venue density distribution into consideration, the dynamic random region sampling algorithm may adaptively adjust the sizes of the sampled regions based on the comparable locations, providing accurate estimation results under efficient query budget constraints.","In the method , step  includes determining venue(s) in the search region. In particular, an exhaustive search algorithm (e.g., method  of ) is performed to determine the set of in-venues within the search region.","In some embodiments of the step , boundary coordinates may be used as initial comparable locations. For example, a north-east corner and a south-west corner of a rectangular region may be used as initial comparable locations for the first randomly chosen location.","In some embodiments of the step , data from previous DRRS sampling executions may be utilized. For example, if the DRRS server (e.g., DRRS server  of ) performs the method  daily, saved parameters such as: previous set(s) of {locations, venue} density pairs, previous set(s) of sample regions, or previous set(s) of in-venues may be utilized in the current execution of the method . In some of these embodiments, previous set(s) of data may be determined to be valid based on a data collection timestamp. It should be appreciated that the method  may decline to use invalid (e.g., aged) dataset(s). For example, in step , the determination of comparable locations may be based on valid and known locations. It should be appreciated that by using prior datasets the efficiency and accuracy of the method  may be improved.","In some of these embodiments, the method may further include a dataset cleanup step. In particular, dataset(s) that are no longer valid may be periodically purged from the system.","In some embodiments of the step , the venue density association is based on weights given to a number of determining factors as described herein.","In some embodiments of the step , the highest relevance is based on geographic terrain. Geographic terrain may be any suitable characteristic such as: (a) a characterization of an area (e.g., rural, suburb, or urban); (b) an indication of the traffic in the area (e.g., as reported by Google maps); (c) an indication of the population density of the area; (d) an indication of the density of establishments in the area; (e) an indication of the terrain (e.g., mountainous, forest or water); (f) a zoning characteristic (e.g., zoned as residential or business); or (g) the like. For example, a target density that is located within an urban area will more likely (e.g., higher weight) be associated with comparable locations that are also in urban areas as opposed to those in rural areas or located within terrain such as a body of water or a mountainous region. In some of these embodiments, the apparatus performing the method maintains a map of the identified geographic region. In some of these embodiments, the apparatus performing the method retrieves a map of the identified geographic region via a query to a mapping service (e.g., Google maps).","In some embodiments of the step , the highest relevance is based on the orientation of the comparable locations. For example, if a first highest relevant comparable location is located due west of the target location, a weight will be given to choose a second comparable location that is located to the east of the target location. It should be appreciated that a second comparable location may not exist due east and that the orientation of the second comparable location may be used in weighting the determination.","In some embodiments of the step , the search region is centered around the target location.","In some embodiments of the step , the search region is trimmed so as not to include areas from previously determined search regions. It should be appreciated that in some of these embodiments, the initial determined search region will be centered on the target location, but the resulting trimmed search region may no longer be physically centered. In these embodiments, the centering of the search region will be based on the initial determined search region.","In some embodiments, step  may be performed after another step such as after step . In this embodiment, steps  and  may return to step .","In some embodiments, the method  is a dynamic random region sampling algorithm. In some of these embodiments, method  is as described in .","Referring to , the DRRS algorithm is explained below.","In line 1, input parameters are defined. Where B is the budget (e.g., search limit) of the resources to be used by the DRRS algorithm;  is the return limit specifying the maximum number of venues that will be returned in a query; and G is the objective search region defined by: Il, and Ilthe upper right and bottom left corners; and s, is the initial side length of the initial search region inside G. It should be appreciated that though while the initial search region is a square in this illustration, the initial search region may be any shape. As such, computed parameters such as area may be computed in any suitable manner. It should be further appreciated that an initial side length may be determined from the bounding coordinates Iland Iland thus may not be an input into the DRRS algorithm.","In line 2, outputs are defined. Where X is the set of in-venues returned. Obtained from the exhaustive venue search on sampled regions.","In lines 3 and 4, parameters are initialized. Where Gcontains the set of sample regions, c represents the capturing cost, m represents the number of sample regions obtained, and M contains the set of {locations, venue} density pairs. As illustrated, X is initialized to a null set and M is initialized with estimated venue densities for bounding locations Iland Il.","In lines 6-8, a location Il is chosen randomly and if location Il is within any of the regions Gthat are a member of the set of Gregions, then Gis considered sampled again and the set X is updated based on the prior in-venue search of region Gand no sampling budget is spent. In some embodiments, the in-venues determined to be in region Gare used to populate the set of venues in X.","In lines 10, at least two comparable locations (e.g., Iland Il) contained in set M with the highest relevance to the target location are selected. In this illustration, the highest relevance is based on the smallest distance between the locations in the set M and the target location.","In lines 11-13, a new region, G, is created based on the target location Il and the comparable locations Iland Il. In particular, comparable locations Iland Ilare used to predict the venue density of the chosen location Il (line 11). Where the function \u201cdis\u201d returns a distance weighting between two locations and d\u2032 is the predicted density of the new region centered on target location Il. In line 12, the predicted density d\u2032 and the return limit  are used to calculate a side length that defines the area of the new region (e.g., as illustrated, a square region). It should be appreciated that the use of the return limit  in the side length calculation may keep the expected number of venues returned in this new region close the API return limit . In line 13, new region Gis centered on the latitude and longitude coordinates of target location Il. In some embodiments of line 12, a threshold may be subtracted from the API return limit  (e.g., s=\u221a{square root over (( \u2212threshold)\/d\u2032))}. It should be appreciated that the threshold may reduce the number of instances where the venue search returns a number of venues equally in the API return limit.","In lines 14 and 15, the DRRS algorithm trims Gso that Gdoes not overlap with any other stored region in G.","In lines 16 and 17, an exhaustive search (e.g., method  of ) is performed on region Gto obtain the set of venues (e.g., V) and in-venues (e.g., V) within region Gas well as the cost (e.g., B) associated with obtaining the sets of venues and in-venues.","In line 18, the set X is updated with the set of in-venues Vobtained in line 17 and the actual density is determined for region G. Where a (G) represents the area of region G.","In lines 19-20, the algorithm variables are updated.","Referring to , the DRRS algorithm of  is illustrated using a portion of New York City. The density of the shading within geographic regions (a)-(d) is depicted in venue density colorbar . As illustrated, darker shaded areas have higher venue densities. In (a), location Ilrepresents the current randomly chosen location and Il(ne)  and Il(sw)  represents the bounding coordinates of the search region . The calculated region  is centered on location Iland is sized based on the weighted average of the venue densities associated with comparable locations Il(ne)  and Il(sw) . In (b), second region  is generated based on randomly chosen location Iland highest relevant (e.g., \u201cnearest\u201d) locations Iland Il(ne) . Similarly in (c), the fifth region  is generated based on randomly chosen location Iland highest relevant locations Iland Il. It should be appreciated that fifth region  is trimmed to eliminate overlap between itself and neighboring previously generated regions (e.g., regions  and ). In (d), after a number of iterations a sequence of sample regions are formed. It should be appreciated that as more sample boxes are formed the predicted densities estimation may improve. Note that some locations falling into already sampled boxes (e.g., ) will trigger the corresponding boxes to be re-sampled.","Although primarily depicted and described in a particular sequence, it should be appreciated that the steps shown in methods  and  may be performed in any suitable sequence. Moreover, the steps identified by one step may also be performed in one or more other steps in the sequence or common actions of more than one step may be performed only once.","It should be appreciated that steps of various above-described methods can be performed by programmed computers. Herein, some embodiments are also intended to cover program storage devices, e.g., data storage media, which are machine or computer readable and encode machine-executable or computer-executable programs of instructions, wherein said instructions perform some or all of the steps of said above-described methods. The program storage devices may be, e.g., digital memories, magnetic storage media such as a magnetic disks and magnetic tapes, hard drives, or optically readable data storage media.
