{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["REFERENCE TO PENDING PRIOR PATENT APPLICATIONS","This is a continuation of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/619,104, filed Jul. 19, 2000 by Daniel F.X. O'Reilly et al. for SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE INTEREST OF SUBJECTS, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,853,950, which in turn claims benefit of prior U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/144,688, filed Jul. 20, 1999 by Daniel F.X. O'Reilly et al. for APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRACKING NEWS TOPICS. The above-identified patent applications and patent are hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention relates generally to data analysis systems and, more particularly, to data analysis systems for tracking the volume, and changes in the volume, of news articles related to particular subjects.","In the past, tracking changes in the volume of news articles regarding particular subjects required a significant investment of time by an analyst. The analyst would research publications related to the particular subject, such as a company or companies, and make a subjective assessment as to the importance of the articles discovered. However, manual tracking of information related to a subject is rather imprecise and time consuming. Any results obtained are contingent on the expertise of the individual analyst and may vary significantly over a period of time.","One object of the invention is to measure, compare, and report the volume of news articles related to a subject and any changes in that volume from a predetermined volume.","Another object of the invention is to provide a signal to alert the user when the change in the volume of news articles for a particular subject is greater than a predetermined amount.","And another object of the invention is to measure the frequency of news articles related to a subject.","Still another object of the invention is to measure the changes in frequency of news articles related to a subject.","Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method for comparing the frequency of news articles.","Another object of the invention is to compare the changes in frequencies of news articles related to multiple subjects.","And another object of the invention is to provide a method for allowing comparison of data collected from a server having different numbers of news sources at different periods of time.","Still another object of the invention is to measure and compare the changes in frequency of news articles related to particular subjects, such as company names, company stock ticker abbreviations, people, products and topics.","These and other objects are addressed by the present invention, which comprises a system for determining changes in the volume of news articles related to a subject over a time period. The invention includes measuring the volume of news articles for the subject over a recent time period. Next, a comparison is made of the volume of news articles over the recent time period relative to the volume of news articles for a prior time period. When the comparison yields a difference greater than a predetermined amount, a signal is generated to notify users that a significant change has occurred in the volume of news articles related to the subject.","Preferably, the system is configured to measure and compare multiple subjects over a time period. The invention includes measuring the volume of the news articles for each respective subject over the time period. A comparison is made, for each respective subject, of the volume of news articles over the time period relative to the volume of news articles over a prior time period. When the comparison for a particular respective subject yields a difference greater than a predetermined amount, an appropriate signal is generated to notify users of the significant change in volume.","The system may also be configured to measure and compare multiple subjects over multiple time periods. In this configuration, the system measures the volume of news articles for each respective subject over a recent time period. Next, for each subject, comparisons are made of the volume of news articles over the recent time period against a weighted measure of news articles over previous time periods. When the comparison for a particular subject yields a difference in volume greater than a predetermined amount, an appropriate signal is generated notifying users of the significant change.","In another form of the invention, a computer server receives news articles from various news sources, holds the news articles for a set amount of time, and then automatically purges articles based on the age and relevance of each article.","In another form of the invention, a tagging mechanism is provided to analyze and code each article. More particularly, the tagging mechanism codes a particular article for the names of one or more companies, stock ticker symbols, names of people, and other topics of interest.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a server reconfiguration factor is determined to compensate for the addition or deletion of news sources from the server configuration. This reconfiguration factor is retrospectively applied to stored data, so as to permit accurate comparison between data derived from the present news source configuration and data derived from previous news source configurations.","In another embodiment of the invention, the frequency of news articles for a subject is calculated based on the volume of news articles for that subject over a selected time period. The frequency of news articles published for each subject may be substituted for the volume of news articles in the comparisons discussed above. When the frequencies for a particular subject are cyclical or display a seasonality, this may be factored into the data analysis.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a weighted average of the measured volume, or frequency, of the news articles relating to the recent, and previous, time periods may be used for the comparison.","Still other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description, wherein only the preferred embodiments of the invention are shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated of carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Referring first to , a system  is disclosed for determining changes in interest of one or more subjects over single and multiple time periods. In order to facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, several preferred embodiments are discussed below. One embodiment tracks one subject over one time period. Another embodiment tracks multiple subjects over one time period. A third embodiment tracks multiple subjects over multiple time periods.","Still referring to , in the simplest case, the system  can be configured for determining changes in the interest of a selected subject over a recent time period. In this first embodiment, system  receives news articles from one or more news sources  and stores the news articles in a computer server .","Server , or other computer processors in communication with server , perform the following functions.","A query engine  is in communication with server  and is programmed to generate queries related to the selected subject over the recent time period. Each query polls the news server  to determine which news articles relate to the selected subject over the recent time period.","A counter  is in communication with server  and receives data generated in response to the queries from query engine . Counter  generates a count of the news articles relating to the selected subject over the recent time period.","A database  is in communication with counter  and stores information. Database  stores (1) the count of news articles relating to the selected subject over the recent time period, and (2) the previous count(s) of news articles relating to the selected subject over at least one other previous time period.","A comparator  is in communication with counter  and with database . Comparator  receives the count of news articles over the recent time period from counter , and the previous count(s) of news articles over at least one other previous time period from database . Comparator  evaluates the relationship between the counts of news articles for the selected subject over the recent time period and over the at least one previous time period.","When the count for the recent time period differs from the count for the at least one previous time period by a predetermined amount, a report  is generated. The report  may include a signal to identify that the selected subject has had a significant increase in the number of news articles about that subject. Alternatively, the report  may include textual, graphical or other output identifying the subject, the count of news articles over the recent time period, the duration of the recent time period, the count(s) of news articles over the at least one previous time period, and the duration of previous time period(s).","The system  shown in  can also be configured to determine changes in the interest in multiple selected subjects over a recent time period. Again, system  receives news articles from one or more news sources  and stores the news articles in computer server .","Server , or other computer processors in communication with server , perform the following functions.","Query engine  is in communication with server  and is programmed to generate queries related to each of the selected subjects over the recent time period. Each query polls news server  to determine which news articles relate to each of the selected subjects over the recent time period.","Counter  is in communication with server  and receives data generated in response to queries from query engine . Counter  generates, for each of the selected subjects, a count of the news articles over the recent time period.","Database  is in communication with counter  and stores information. Database  stores, for each selected subject, (1) the count of the news articles relating to the selected subject over the recent time period, and (2) the previous count(s) of news articles relating to the selected subject over at least one previous time period.","Comparator  is in communication with counter  and database . Comparator , for each of the selected subjects, receives the count of news articles over the recent time period from counter , and receives the previous count(s) of news articles over at least one other previous time period from database . Comparator  evaluates, for each selected subject, the relationship between the counts of news articles over the recent time period and over the at least one previous time period.","A report  is generated, for each of the selected subjects, when the count for the recent time period differs from the count for the at least one previous time period by a predetermined amount. Report  may include a signal to identify that the selected subject has had a significant increase in the number of news articles about that subject. Alternatively, report  may include, for each subject, textual, graphical, or other output identifying the subject, the count of news articles over the recent time period, the duration of the recent time period, the count(s) of the news articles over the at least one previous time period, and the duration of the previous time period(s). Alternatively, the relative magnitudes of changes in news volume across all subjects can be sorted and a report identifying the subjects with the most significant change in news volume can be generated.","The system  shown in  can also be configured to determine changes in the interest in multiple selected subjects over multiple recent time periods. Again, system  receives news articles from one or more news sources  and stores the news articles in computer server .","The server , or other computer processors in communication with server , perform the following functions.","Query engine  is in communication with server  and is programmed to generate queries related to each of the selected subjects over each of the recent time periods. Each query polls news server  to determine which news articles relate to each of the selected subjects over each of the recent time periods.","Counter  is in communication with server  and receives data generated in response to queries from query engine . Counter  generates, for each of the selected subjects, a count of the news articles over each of the recent time periods.","Database  is in communication with counter  and stores information. Database  stores, for each of the selected subjects, (1) the count of the news articles relating to the selected subject, over each of the recent time periods, and (2) the previous count(s) of news articles relating to the selected subjects over at least one previous time period.","Comparator  is in communication with counter  and database . Comparator , for each of the selected subjects, receives the count of news articles over each of the recent time periods from counter , and receives the previous counts of news articles over corresponding previous time periods from database . The comparator  evaluates, for each selected subject, the relationship between the count of news articles over each of the recent time periods and between the count of news articles over corresponding previous time periods.","A report  is generated for each of the selected subjects, and for each of the recent time periods, when the count of news articles differs from the count for a corresponding previous time period by a predetermined amount. Report  may include a signal to identify those time periods in which the subject has had a significant increase in the number of news articles. Alternatively, report  may include, for each subject, and for each of the recent time periods, textual, graphical, or other output identifying the subject, the count of news articles over the recent time period, the duration of the recent time period, the count(s) of news articles over the at least one previous time period, and the duration of the previous time periods. Alternatively, the relative magnitudes of changes in news volume across all subjects can be sorted and a report identifying the subjects with the most significant change in news volume can be generated.","In as much as it is anticipated that the number of news sources  will change over time, a method is provided for determining a news source reconfiguration factor. The reconfiguration factor is a measure of the relative change in the volume of news articles received due to the change in the number of news sources. The reconfiguration factor allows presently measured volumes of news articles to be reliably compared with volumes of news articles measured over other time periods with dissimilar numbers of news sources .","System  is substantially the same as the system  described above, except that it is configured to generate and utilize the reconfiguration factor.","More particularly, query engine  is also programmed to generate queries related to the count of news articles for all subjects over a recent time period, i.e., having a different number of news sources than a previous time period.","Counter  receives data generated by server  in response to queries from query engine . Counter  generates a count of the news articles for all subjects over the recent time period.","Database  stores this count of news articles for all subjects over the recent time period, and stores the reconfiguration factor as calculated below.","Comparator  receives, from counter , the count of news articles for all subjects over the recent time period, and receives from database  the count of news articles for all subjects over the previous time period. Comparator  calculates the reconfiguration factor by comparing the count for the recent time period with the count for the previous time period.","Several different methods may be used to calculate the reconfiguration factor.","A simple method for calculating the reconfiguration factor is to divide the count of the recent time period by the count of the previous time period when the periods are of equal duration. Once the reconfiguration factor has been obtained, all previous counts of news articles over the previous time periods stored in database  are converted to a new count corresponding to the present news source configuration by multiplying the previous counts by the reconfiguration factor.","In another method for calculating the reconfiguration factor, the logarithmic values are determined for the count, or for the frequency of the count, of news articles for the recent and previous time periods. These logarithmic values are then used in place of the respective count, or frequency, to calculate an additive reconfiguration factor. The logarithmic values are also stored in the database and used to reconfigure data stored in the database.","In another preferred embodiment of system , a weighted moving average is used to compare the volume of news articles for a subject over a recent time period with previous time periods. The weighted moving average provides a means for comparing data over longer periods of time so as to permit greater accuracy in determining changes of volume.","Such a system is substantially the same as the system  described above, except that it is configured to generate and utilize the weighted moving average. More particularly, query engine  queries server  for news articles relating to a subject over several time periods including a most recent time period, one or more previous time periods, and a most previous time period.","Counter  receives data relating to the queries and determines the count of news articles for each of the time periods involved.","To compile the weighted average, comparator  computes the value of the counts of news articles for the most recent and one or more previous time periods, not including the most previous time period, and the counts of news articles for the one or more previous time periods and the most previous time period, not including the most recent time period. These values are compared to one another to determine if there is a large difference between them, which would signal a significant change in the volume of news articles for a particular subject.","In order to illustrate this concept, the following example shows the weighted moving average for the previous week measured against the week beginning a day earlier in order to determine the value of change for the previous day.","Query engine  queries server  for news articles relating to a subject over each of the past eight days. Counter  receives data relating to the queries and determines the counts of news articles relating to the subject for each of the days.","Database  stores the counts of news articles, and comparator  receives the counts of news articles. Comparator  then computes the value of the counts of news articles for the most recent seven days and the value of the counts of news articles for the seven days prior to the most recent day. These values are compared to one another to determine if the values are similar or have a relatively large difference.","This method may be used for a wide range of time periods, such as days, weeks and months, and including relatively short intervals, such as half-hour increments, so as to closely track when a change has occurred.","Additionally, incremental changes over a period of time may be used to forecast total volume for an entire period. This technique can be useful to identify significant changes in volume before the end of the period. For example, if there are two news stories about company X on average per day and we have observed 50 news stories by noon, it is clear that the current day will exhibit unusual volume even though there are 12 hours left in the day.","It is also possible to configure the system to report those subjects having the highest change in news article volume for a given time period. For example, the system might report, for a ticker alert, the top 40 companies having the highest change in news article volume over their typical levels of news volume.","When the counts are converted to frequencies, the weighted moving average method can be used by substituting the frequency value for the count value.","Another method to perform the weighted moving average is to convert the frequency values to logarithmic values. Comparison of the logarithmic values can be helpful to highlight the relative change in news counts for a given subject.","Still looking now at , a tagging mechanism  may be provided to analyze and code each news article. Tagging mechanism  adds a reference code to each relevant article so as to permit rapid searching of server  by query engine . This reference code can relate to the names of companies, related stock ticker symbols, names of people, and other topics of interest.","Furthermore, tagging system  may be configured to prevent system  from counting articles with multiple parts or \u201cchange\u201d messages more than once. Tagging mechanism  prevents redundant counting by grouping these messages with corresponding electronic tags. Counter  recognizes the reference code relating to a single message with multiple parts or \u201cchanges\u201d and counts it accordingly.","In another embodiment, and looking now at , tagging mechanism  may be located in series between news sources  and server . In such a construction, news articles are tagged before they are stored in the server  to permit subsequent querying and purging (see below).","In a preferred embodiment, computer server  has adequate memory to store news articles received from the various news sources for at least a given time period. News articles older than the given time period are automatically purged from the memory of the server, as represented by the reference numeral .","In another preferred embodiment, the computer server  has adequate memory to store news articles received from the various news sources  for at least a given time period. However, news articles are not automatically purged from the news server. The news articles may be manually purged or reside on the server until the memory is full.","In yet another preferred embodiment, the computer server  automatically purges all articles not tagged, as represented by reference numeral . Using this method, only subjects of interest are retained on server .","In still another preferred embodiment, only the electronic tag and date information is stored on the computer server ; this technique conserves database memory and permits more rapid searching.","System  can also be configured to assemble historical statistics. Historical statistics are assembled by analyzing data acquired over long periods of time to determine past trends and changes in the volume of news articles for specific subjects. These historical statistics are constructed by comparator  from counts or frequencies stored in database  and may also be included in report .","System  is also configured so that, for a subject having counts of news articles displaying a periodicity with respect to a time period, seasonality is factored into the system. This is done by comparing the counts over similar periods. Comparator  analyzes the previous counts stored in database  for signs of seasonality. When seasonality is detected, the period of seasonality is determined and seasonally adjusted counts are stored in database . The period of seasonality is used to compare similar periods using the methods previously described.","In this disclosure, there are shown and described only the preferred embodiments of the invention, but as aforementioned, it is to be understood that the invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","One Subject, One Time Period","Multiple Subjects, One Time Period","Multiple Subjects, Multiple Time Periods","Reconfiguration Factor","Weighted Moving Average","Tagging Mechanism","Computer Server","Historical Analysis","Cyclical Or Seasonal Volume"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
