{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the U.S. Government for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to the launching of small projectiles, and more specifically is directed to an assembly and method for launching such projectiles from firearms, such as rifles.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Launchers which facilitate the firing of a projectile such as, for example, a rifle grenade, from a rifle are generally known and in use.","However, in non-combat situations, as in training, or the like, the launch assemblies, which may be readily recoverable, are not reusable. That is, even on a practice range the launch assemblies are adapted only for one-time use.","It will be apparent that economies could be realized if launchers which are readily recoverable could be used multiple times before discarding.","An object of the invention is, therefore, to provide a projectile launch assembly which is suitable for providing a projectile launch capability for a rifle, and which can be used, for the most part, time and time again.","A further object of the invention is to provide a method for launching a projectile from a firearm, including providing a launch device capable of multiple reuses.","With the above and other objects in view, a feature of the present invention is the provision of a projectile launch assembly including a launch tube having distal and proximal ends and an inwardly extending dimple structure therebetween, the proximal end being adapted to receive a muzzle of a firearm. A receiver is disposed on the distal end of the launch tube, the receiver having connector structure at a distal end thereof for connection to a projectile. An energy absorbing plug is disposed in the launch tube and is provided with a proximal end portion adjacent the dimple and is provided with a body portion extending distally. An energy transfer piston is disposed in the launch tube and is provided with a proximal end configured complementarily to the plug and with a distal end configured complementarily to a proximal end of the receiver. A bullet leaving the firearm muzzle is absorbed by the plug which is thereby moved with the piston distally in the tube. The piston engages the receiver to propel the assembly and the projectile from the firearm muzzle.","In accordance with a further feature of the invention, there is provided a method for launching a projectile from a firearm, the method comprising the steps of providing a projectile launch assembly comprising a launch tube having distal and proximal ends and an inwardly extending dimple therebetween, a receiver disposed on the distal end of the launch tube, the receiver having connector structure at a distal end thereof for connection to a projectile, an energy absorbing plug having a proximal end portion adjacent the dimple, a body portion extending distally, and an energy transfer piston adjacent the plug and having a proximal end configured complementarily to the plug and having a distal end configured complementarily to a proximal end of the receiver; manipulating the receiver connector structure to connect a selected projectile to the receiver; sliding the launch tube onto a muzzle portion of a firearm until a distal end of the muzzle portion engages the dimple; and firing the firearm. A bullet leaving the firearm muzzle is absorbed by the plug which is thereby moved with the piston distally in the tube. The piston engages the receiver to propel the assembly and the projectile from the firearm muzzle.","The above and other features of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts and steps, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular assembly and method embodying the invention are shown and described by way of illustration only and not as limitations of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring to , it will be seen that an illustrative embodiment of projectile launch assembly includes a cylindrically-shaped elongated launch tube  having a distal end  and a proximal end . An inwardly extending dimple  is disposed between the launch tube distal and proximal ends , . The dimple  may be a continuous single annular dimple, as illustrated, or a plurality of dimples arranged in annular fashion.","A collar  is mounted, as by threads or press-fit, on the distal end  of the launch tube . The collar  is provided with connector structure , such as screw threads.","The assembly further includes a receiver  which is provided at its proximal end  with connector structure , such as screw threads, for connecting engagement with the collar connector structure , to affix the receiver  to the launch tube distal end . The receiver , at a distal end  thereof, is provided with further connector structure , such as a threaded bore, for connection to a stem  of a projectile. One such projectile for which the launch assembly described herein is well suited is a grappling hook generally of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,079,761, issued Jun. 27, 2000, in the name of James E. Sedeck, and incorporated herein by reference.","Mounted in the launch tube  is a circular plug  configured to fit snugly in the launch tube  abutting the dimple . The plug  includes a frusto-conical portion  extending from a planar portion . At a distal end  of the frusto-conical portion  there is disposed an end disc portion , or other such protuberance.","Connected to the plug  is a piston  provided with a proximal end  adjacent the planar portion  of the frusto-conical portion  and having a recess  therein in which is disposed the frusto-conical portion  of the plug . The piston  is further provided with a relief cut  which receives the end disc portion  of the plug . The relief cut , in cooperation with the end disc portion , serves to interconnect the piston  and the plug , both of which are slidably movable in the launch tube .","The receiver proximal end  is provided with a recess  shaped complementarily to a distal end  of the piston .","The proximal end  of the launch tube  may be provided with stabilizing fins .","Referring to , it will be seen that in an alternative embodiment, the plug  includes an end portion  which includes opposed frusto-conical shaped portions ,  received in a complementarily shaped relief cut .","A sealing ring  seals a joint between the receiver  and the collar , preventing leakage of air from inside the launch tube  during movement of the piston . Similarly, sealing rings  and  are seated in annular grooves ,  in the piston  to prevent leakage of air between the piston and the launch tube .","In this embodiment, the receiver recess  is of a curved configuration and the piston distal end  is complementarily shaped, providing for an even distribution of compressive force over the two surfaces ,  and dissipation of heat in operation of the assembly.","In operation, the proximal end  of the launch tube  receives in a cavity  the muzzle and flash suppresser of a rifle (not shown) such that the flash suppresser is essentially flush with the plug planar portion . The butt of the rifle is placed against the ground or other support and inclined at a selected launch angle. The rifle is fired in the usual manner.","A bullet leaving the rifle impacts the plug  which is of a selected material such as a polymer, lead, soft aluminum, copper, brass, and composites or alloys thereof, or other material adapted to receive and appreciably slow the bullet. The bullet embedding in the plug  drives the plug  and the piston , which preferably is of hardened or cold-rolled steel, distally, such that the piston distal end  impacts the receiver  in the receiver recess  and compresses air in the recess , such that the bullet is dynamically decelerated. The compressed air, and expanding powder explosion gases from the rifle cartridge, and the violent impact of the piston on the receiver proximal end recess , serve to lift the launch assembly and the projectile  off of the rifle.","If the launch assembly is recovered, the receiver  can be unscrewed from the collar  and the piston  and plug  removed. The plug  can then be withdrawn from the piston , the relative softness of the plug permitting withdrawal of the plug end disc portion  from the relief cut  in the steel piston. A new plug  is then inserted in the piston recess . The piston  and new plug  are then slid down the launch tube  until the plug planar portion  is disposed adjacent the dimple . The receiver  is threaded back onto the collar  to place the launch assembly in condition to receive another projectile for launch.","Referring to , it will be seen that in a further alternative embodiment, the plug  includes an end portion  which includes a frusto-conical portion  which, in turn, projects distally from a cylindrical portion  provided with a planar proximal end portion .","The plug  is of a high-density metallic, polymeric or cellulose material and in this embodiment is held in the piston  by screws  disposed in bores , the screws  projecting radially inwardly and engaging the plug cylindrical portion  to interconnect the plug  and the piston . A circular rubber or polymer washer  is held on the proximal end  of the piston  by the plug planar portion .","A circular bulkhead  is slightly oversized diameter-wise and is press-fitted into the launch tube  proximate the dimple structure . The bulkhead  is provided with a central aperture  which is slightly larger than the caliber of bullet fired from the rifle being used for launch.","As shown in , the collar  may be sufficiently elongated to extend proximally on the launch tube  to slightly beyond the dimple structure . The collar  may be provided with dimple structure  complementary to, and engageable with, launch tube dimple structure .","Upon firing of the rifle, the bullet (not shown) passes through the aperture  and embeds in the plug , and moves the plug  and the piston  distally in the launch tube . The washer  moves with the plug  and piston . The distal movement of the piston  compresses air between the piston and the receiver  and dynamically decelerates the bullet movement. Gas from the bullet powder charge enters the growing volume between the bulkhead , which remains stationary, and the washer , which moves distally with the plug . The gas expansion in the space between the bulkhead  and the washer  exerts pressure on the washer, creating an improved seal between the washer and the interior sidewall of the launch tube . The aforesaid space develops into a safety chamber which traps unburned powder particles and debris from the plug and the bullet.","Upon retrieval of the used launch assembly, the receiver  may be unscrewed from the collar  and the piston , plug  and washer  removed from the launch tube . The plug  and washer  are removed from the piston  by loosing the screws . A new plug  and washer  are connected to the piston  and the piston, plug, and washer assembly is moved through the launch tube  to the position shown in . The receiver  is screwed onto the launch tube distal end  to complete the reassembly. The launch assembly is then in condition for re-use.","There is thus provided projectile launch assemblies suitable for providing a projectile launch capability for a rifle and which can be used multiple times with replacement of only a portion thereof, thereby realizing significant economies. There is further provided a method for launching a projectile from a rifle, including use of a launch device which is for the most part reusable.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent.","In the drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
