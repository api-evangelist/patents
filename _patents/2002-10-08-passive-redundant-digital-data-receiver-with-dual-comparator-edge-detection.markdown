title: Passive redundant digital data receiver with dual comparator edge detection
abstract: A passive coupling structure constructed using printed circuit board traces is used to separate the low and high frequency components of an incoming digital signal. The low and high frequency components of the signal are sent to separate receivers on an integrated circuit. The low frequency receiver may be a conventional level based receiver. The high frequency receiver is a Schmitt-trigger with hysteresis around a DC level or two comparators with separate reference voltages. The outputs of these receivers are combined to produce a receiver output that has increased reliability and noise immunity.

This related application is Hewlett-Packard Ser. No. 10\/267,156, and is titled \u201cPASSIVE REDUNDANT DIGITAL DATA RECEIVER WITH SCHMITT-TRIGGER.\u201d","This invention relates generally to digital communication and more particularly to the communication of digital signals between integrated circuits.","Digital signals carried on printed circuit board (PCB) traces are often used to carry digital data between or to integrated circuits. As the capability of modern integrated circuits has increased, so have the demands made upon the systems that communicate data between these devices. Factors such as speed, size, power dissipation, and electrical noise have combined to make it difficult to communicate digital data between integrated circuits at the speeds and with the reliability demanded of today's modern electronic systems.","A passive coupling structure constructed using printed circuit board, package, microstrip, or integrated circuit traces is tuned to separate the low and high frequency components of an incoming digital signal. The low and high frequency components of the signal are sent to separate receivers on an integrated circuit. The low frequency receiver may be a conventional level based receiver. The high frequency receiver is comprised of two comparators that detect negative and positive pulses on the high frequency component. The outputs of the level based receiver and the comparators are combined to produce a receiver output that has increased reliability and noise immunity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["130","104","106","104","106","104","106","130","130","130","104","106","130","130","130","104","102","130","106"],"sub":["0","oe","oo"]},"The end of line  carrying this output of the output of coupling structure  is shown as point . Another output of the passive coupling structure  is the end of line  shown as point .","Connected to the end of line  at point  is the input of level based receiver . The output of level based receiver , LV, is connected to an input of logic block . The end of line  is connected to terminating\/bias resistors  and  and the input of Schmitt-trigger . The other end of terminating\/bias resistor  is shown connected to a negative supply voltage. The other end of terminating\/bias resistor  is shown connected to a positive supply voltage.

The crossover frequency between the low and high frequency components is determined by the geometry of the passive coupling structure.

The high frequency component of the incoming digital signal is propagated along line  to  to be received by Schmitt-trigger . Terminating\/bias resistors ,  provide two functions. The first is to terminate the end of line  so that no reflections of the high frequency component of the input signal are propagated back into the coupling structure. The second is to bias the DC level present at the input of the Schmitt-trigger to a point that is between the two trigger points of the Schmitt-trigger. In one embodiment, terminating\/bias resistors  and  are both chosen to be twice the characteristic impedance of line . In other words, they are chosen to be 2*Z.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["102","122","102","120","102","122","110","112","108","120","108","120","108","120"],"sub":["M ","IH ","IL ","IH","IL","IH ","IL "]},"Vand Vrepresent voltage levels around Vthat trigger changes on the output of Schmitt-trigger . For example, if Schmitt-trigger  is outputting a high logic level on signal PLS, then the voltage at point  would need to go below Vto cause Schmitt-trigger  to trip and switch to outputting a low logic level. Likewise, if Schmitt-trigger  is outputting a low logic level on signal PLS, then the voltage at point  would need to go above Vto cause Schmitt-trigger  to trip and switch to outputting a high logic level. Accordingly, as shown in , at point A, when the voltage at the input to Schmitt-trigger  exceeds V, the output of Schmitt-trigger  would switch from a low logic level to a high logic level. Then, at point B in , the voltage at the input to Schmitt-trigger  goes below V, Schmitt-trigger  switches from a high logic level to a low logic level. Finally, at point C in , Schmitt-trigger  switches back to a high logic level as the voltage at point  once again exceeds V. Accordingly, since Schmitt-trigger  is receiving the high frequency component, the Schmitt-trigger changes state whenever an appropriately fast edge occurs in the appropriate direction. In other words, Schmitt-trigger  in combination with the passive couple structure  serves to detect edges that are occurring in the state change direction, but not in the direction that serves to maintain the current state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["118","118"]},"In , the output of Schmitt-trigger , signal PLS is connected to a first input of two input AND gate  and a first input of two input NOR gate . The output of level based receiver , signal LV, is connected to the second input of AND gate  and the second input of NOR gate . The output of AND gate  is connected to the SET (or S) input of set-reset flip-flop  (SR flip-flop ). Accordingly, when LV and PLS are both at high logic levels, SR flip-flop  is set thereby causing signal OUT to go to a high logic level. The output of NOR gate  is connected to the REST (or R) input of SR flip-flop . Therefore, when LV and PLS are both at low logic levels, SR flip-flop  is reset thereby causing signal OUT to go to a low logic level.","The circuit in  when used with the circuit of  provides a passive redundant digital data receiver. The low frequency component of the input signal is sent to the low frequency receiver that is level based receiver . The high frequency component of the input signal is sent to the high frequency receiver that is Schmitt-trigger  with hysteresis around a DC level V. Accordingly, when a transition occurs on the input signal from a low logic level to a high logic level, both the low frequency receiver (because a level change from below Vto above Voccurs on its input) and the high frequency receiver (because its input at least momentarily exceeds V) change from a low logic level to a high logic level. This causes AND gate  to set SR flip-flop . Likewise, when a transition occurs on the input signal from a high logic level to a low logic level, both the low frequency receiver (because a level change from above Vto below Voccurs on its input) and the high frequency receiver (because its input at least momentarily drops below V) change from a high logic level to a low logic level. This causes NOR gate  to reset SR flip-flop . Thus, the redundancy of this system provides noise immunity because many noise events would not have the appropriate energy and duration to trip both the low and high frequency receivers at the same time thereby changing the state of SR flip-flop .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["430","404","406","404","406","404","406","430","430","430","404","406","430","430","430","404","402","430","406","406","430","422","430","404","420"],"sub":["0","oe","oo"]},"Connected to the end of line  at point  is the input of level based receiver .
