title: Systems and methods for linking items to a matter
abstract: Disclosed herein are systems and methods for linking items into common matters. Some embodiments of the systems and/or methods may retrieve an electronic document from a source, determine whether the electronic document is associated with a predetermined first matter, and in response to determining that the electronic document is associated with the predetermined first matter, link the electronic document to the predetermined first matter. Similarly, in some embodiments, the systems and methods may further create a second matter and may link the electronic document to the second matter, such that accessing the electronic document can provide other documents linked to the second matter, receive a request for the electronic document, and in response to receiving the request for the electronic document, provide a user option to provide access to the other documents linked to the predetermined first matter.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C.\u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/363,027 filed on Jul. 9, 2010, the content of which is relied upon and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Field","Embodiments provided herein generally relate to linking electronic items into matters, and particularly to linking electronic legal documents and other legal and non-legal electronic data.","Technical Background","As electronic systems retrieve and store electronic documents for searching, many electronic documents pertaining to an event (such as a legal matter) may be obtained from a plurality of different sources. Additionally, as each of the sources may organize and\/or label their documents differently, the electronic systems that retrieve these documents may be unable to associate documents from different sources to the common event. Accordingly, when attempting to organize the documents for later indexing, there may be no indicated relation of the documents. Thus, a user who attempts to locate all documents in the event may be forced to independently search for each document.","More specifically, many current electronic research systems may be configured to acquire electronic versions of legal documents from a plurality of sources. While one document may be retrieved from a court reporter, other documents may be received via public access to court electronic records (PACER) and\/or from other sources. Consequently, the documents retrieved may be formatted in such a way that one cannot easily determine whether the documents are part of a common legal matter or whether they are unrelated. As such, in many current solutions, if an end-user of the electronic research system is searching for a complaint and a brief associated with that legal dispute, the search may become cumbersome due to the fact that two independent searches must be performed.","As disclosed herein, embodiments of a method for linking items to a matter may include retrieving an electronic document from a source, determining whether the electronic document is associated with a predetermined first matter, and in response to determining that the electronic document is associated with the predetermined first matter, linking the electronic document to the predetermined first matter, such that accessing the electronic document will provide access to other documents linked to the predetermined first matter. Similarly, in some embodiments, the method further includes, in response to determining that the electronic document is not associated with the predetermined first matter, creating a second matter and linking the electronic document to the second matter, such that accessing the electronic document will provide other documents linked to the second matter, receiving a request for the electronic document, and in response to receiving the request for the electronic document, providing a user option to provide access to the other documents linked to the predetermined first matter.","In another embodiment, a system may include a computing device that includes a memory component that stores a content master that causes the computing device to retrieve an electronic document from a source and a linking component that causes the computing device to determine whether the electronic document is associated with a predetermined first matter. The linking component may additionally, in response to determining that the electronic document is associated with the predetermined first matter, link the electronic document to the predetermined first matter, such that accessing the electronic document will provide access to other documents linked to the predetermined first matter, and in response to determining that the electronic document is not associated with the predetermined first matter, create a second matter and link the electronic document to the second matter, such that accessing the electronic document will provide other documents linked to the second matter. In some embodiments, the memory component further stores search logic that causes the computing device to receive a request for the electronic document and, in response to receiving the request for the electronic document, provide a user option to provide access to the other documents linked to the predetermined first matter.","In another embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable medium may store a program that, when executed by a computing device, causes the computing device to retrieve an electronic document from a source, determine whether the electronic document is associated with a predetermined first matter, and in response to determining that the electronic document is associated with the predetermined first matter, link the electronic document to the predetermined first matter, such that accessing the electronic document will provide access to other documents linked to the predetermined first matter. Similarly, in some embodiments, the program further causes the computing device to create a second matter and linking the electronic document to the second matter, such that accessing the electronic document will provide other documents linked to the second matter, receive a request for the electronic document, and in response to receiving the request for the electronic document, provide a user option to provide access to the other documents linked to the predetermined first matter.","These and additional features provided by the embodiments described herein will be more fully understood in view of the following detailed description, in conjunction with the drawings.","Embodiments disclosed herein include systems and methods for linking items into legal matters. For example, one embodiment may be configured to determine first information related to a first legal document and second information related to a second legal document. The first information and the second information may include docket numbers and\/or other identifiers. Additionally, the first information and the second information may be compared to each other and\/or a repository of legal matters to determine a likelihood that the legal documents pertain to a common legal matter. If there is a likelihood that the legal documents pertain to the common legal matter, a relationship may be created between the two legal documents, such that when an end-user utilizes an electronic research system to locate the first document, the second document may be identified as also pertaining to the common legal matter and may be available to the end-user for review. Additional documents may also be determined and linked to the common legal matter.","Similarly, some embodiments may be configured to utilize a threshold system for determining whether a particular electronic document corresponds to a matter. As an example, various data may be extracted from the electronic document, such as party name, court docket number, judge name, document type, etc. Each of the extracted pieces of data may be weighted and an analysis may be performed on the extracted data to determine which of the extracted data corresponds to a predetermined matter, such as a legal matter. Based on the weighting and amount of extracted data that corresponds to the legal matter, a comparison to a threshold may be performed to determine whether the legal document should be included in the legal matter, not included in the legal matter, or should be subject to further analysis.","Referring now to the drawings,  depicts a computing environment for linking items to a matter, according to one or more embodiments shown and described herein. As illustrated, a network  may be coupled to a user computing device , a remote computing device , and an administrator computing device . The network  may include a wide area network and\/or a local area network and thus may be wired and\/or wireless. The user computing device may include any portable and\/or non-portable computing devices, such as personal computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, etc.","Similarly, the remote computing device may include a server and\/or other computing device for providing information to the user computing device via a request to the searching logic . In some embodiments, the remote computing device may be configured to provide an online research tool, such as a legal research website, individual research tool, business tool, etc. As discussed in more detail below, the remote computing device may include a memory component  that stores searching logic and system enterprise logic to provide this functionality. The searching logic may include software, hardware, and\/or firmware for providing searching capabilities to users, such at the user computing device . Similarly, the system enterprise logic may include software, hardware, and\/or firmware for linking items to a matter, as described in more detail below.","Additionally, the remote computing device may provide information to the administrator computing device for maintenance, monitoring, and\/or other administrative actions. The administrator computing device may be configured as a personal computer, server, PDA, mobile phone, etc.","It should be understood that while the user computing device , the remote computing device , and the administrator computing device are represented in  each as a single component, this is merely an example. More specifically, in some embodiments, there may be numerous different components that provide the described functionality. However, for illustration purposes, single components are shown in  and described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","102","230","232","234","236","238","238","140","140","102","102"],"i":["b ","a ","a","b","b ","b.

From this connection, communication may be facilitated between the user computing device and other computing devices.","The operating logic  may include an operating system and\/or other software for managing components of the user computing device . Similarly, as discussed above, the searching logic may reside in the memory component  and may be configured to cause the processor  to provide one or more search functions. As an example, the searching logic may provide legal searching capabilities for court opinions, briefs, motions, and\/or other legal documents. Similarly, the system enterprise logic may be utilized to link the legal (and\/or other) documents to a common matter to provide more efficient searching. As an example, the system enterprise logic may be configured to determine whether legal documents relate to a particular litigation. If so, those legal documents may be linked together such that a user searching for that litigation will be able to easily find all documents available for that litigation. Other functionality is also included and described in more detail, below.","It should be understood that the components illustrated in  are merely exemplary and are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure. While the components in  are illustrated as residing within the remote computing device , this is merely an example. In some embodiments, one or more of the components may reside external to the remote computing device .
