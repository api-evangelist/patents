In particular, the present invention relates to removing noise from speech signals.","A common problem in speech recognition and speech transmission is the corruption of the speech signal by additive noise. In particular, corruption due to the speech of another speaker has proven to be difficult to detect and\/or correct.","Recently, a system has been developed that attempts to remove noise by using a combination of an alternative sensor, such as a bone conduction microphone, and an air conduction microphone. This system is trained using three training channels: a noisy alternative sensor training signal, a noisy air conduction microphone training signal, and a clean air conduction microphone training signal. Each of the signals is converted into a feature domain. The features for the noisy alternative sensor signal and the noisy air conduction microphone signal are combined into a single vector representing a noisy signal. The features for the clean air conduction microphone signal form a single clean vector. These vectors are then used to train a mapping between the noisy vectors and the clean vectors. Once trained, the mappings are applied to a noisy vector formed from a combination of a noisy alternative sensor test signal and a noisy air conduction microphone test signal. This mapping produces a clean signal vector.","This system is less than optimal when the noise conditions of the test signals do not match the noise conditions of the training signals because the mappings are designed for the noise conditions of the training signals.","A method and apparatus determine a channel response for an alternative sensor using an alternative sensor signal and an air conduction microphone signal. The channel response is then used to estimate a clean speech value using at least a portion of the alternative sensor signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","100"]},"The invention is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Depending on the type of alternative sensor and the level of the background speech, background speech  may also be detected by alternative sensor . However, under embodiments of the present invention, alternative sensor  is typically less sensitive to ambient noise and background speech than air conduction microphone . Thus, the alternative sensor signal  (B) generated by alternative sensor  generally includes less noise than air conduction microphone signal  (Y) generated by air conduction microphone . Although alternative sensor  is less sensitive to ambient noise, it does generate some sensor noise  (W).","The path from speaker  to alternative sensor signal  can be modeled as a channel having a channel response H. The path from background speaker(s)  to alternative sensor signal  can be modeled as a channel have a channel response G.","Alternative sensor signal  (B) and air conduction microphone signal  (Y) are provided to a clean signal estimator , which estimates a clean signal  and in some embodiments, estimates a background speech signal . Clean signal estimate  is provided to a speech process . Clean signal estimate  may either be a filtered time-domain signal or a Fourier Transform vector. If clean signal estimate  is a time-domain signal, speech process  may take the form of a listener, a speech coding system, or a speech recognition system.

Under direct filtering, a maximum likelihood estimate of the channel response(s) for alternative sensor  are determined by minimizing a function relative to the channel response(s). These estimates are then used to determine a maximum likelihood estimate of the clean speech signal by minimizing a function relative to the clean speech signal.","Under one embodiment of the present invention, the channel response G corresponding to background speech being detected by the alternative sensor is considered to be zero and the background speech and ambient noise are combined to form a single noise term. This results in a model between the clean speech signal and the air conduction microphone signal and alternative sensor signal of:\n\n()=()+()\u2003\u2003Eq. 1\n\n()=()*()+()\u2003\u2003Eq. 2\n\nwhere y(t) is the air conduction microphone signal, b(t) is the alternative sensor signal, x(t) is the clean speech signal, z(t) is the combined noise signal that includes background speech and ambient noise, w(t) is the alternative sensor noise, and h(t) is the channel response to the clean speech signal associated with the alternative sensor.

This notation applies to X(k), Z(k), H(k), W(k), and B(k). In the discussion below, the reference to frequency component k is omitted for clarity. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the computations performed below are performed on a per frequency component basis.\n","Under this embodiment, the real and imaginary parts of the noise Zand Ware modeled as independent zero-mean Gaussians such that:\n\n()\u2003\u2003Eq. 5\n\n()\u2003\u2003Eq. 6\n\nwhere \u03c3is the variance for noise Zand \u03c3is the variance for noise W.\n","His also modeled as a Gaussian such that\n\n(,\u03c3)\u2003\u2003Eq. 7\n\nwhere His the mean of the channel response and \u03c3is the variance of the channel response.\n","Given these model parameters, the probability of a clean speech value Xand a channel response value His described by the conditional probability:\n\np(X,H|Y,B,H\u03c3,\u03c3,\u03c3)\u2003\u2003Eq. 8\n\nwhich is proportional to:\n\np(Y,B|X,H,\u03c3,\u03c3)p(H|H,\u03c3)p(X)\u2003\u2003Eq. 9\n\nwhich is equal to:\n\np(Y|X,\u03c3)p(B|X,H,\u03c3)p(H|H,\u03c3)p(X)\u2003\u2003Eq. 10\n","In one embodiment, the prior probability for the channel response, p(H|H,\u03c3), and the prior probability for the clean speech signal, p(X), are ignored and the remaining probabilities are treated as Gaussian distributions.
