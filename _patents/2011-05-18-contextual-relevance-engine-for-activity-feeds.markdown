{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Activity feeds provide a means to alert users in a social network to activity in the social network. The information about the activity may originate from a variety of sources and may be associated with people, events, news items, work related items, etc. The activity feeds are formatted and displayed on a computing device, typically a client computer or a mobile telephone.","As a user's social network grows, the volume of received activity feeds also grows. Depending on the size of a user's social network, a user may be overwhelmed by activity feeds and may not easily be able to distinguish important activity feeds from unimportant activity feeds.","Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a method implemented on a computing device for determining relevance for activity feeds. Activity feeds are received from one or more business entities. Information is received regarding activities being performed by a user. Context information is received regarding the user. A user context is determined from the information the regarding activities being performed by the user and the context information. The user context indicates the current status of the user. A relevance of the activity feeds is determined based on the user context. At least some of the activity feeds are displayed on the computing device. At least some of the activity feeds are displayed according to a priority determined by the relevance.","The details of one or more techniques are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of these techniques will be apparent from the description, drawings, and claims.","The present application is directed to systems and methods for determining a contextual relevance for activity feeds. Activity feed information is displayed to a user on a computing device on the basis of a determined relevance of the activity feeds. Activity feeds that are determined to be of high relevance to the user are given a higher priority than activity feeds that are determined to be less relevant to the user. Accordingly, activity feeds that are determined to be of high relevance are displayed at or near the top of a display screen on the computing device and may also be highlighted by color or other means. In addition, the determination of contextual relevance reduces the chances that irrelevant activity feeds are displayed to the user.","An activity feed is a type of Internet or Intranet news feed in which structured information, typically XML-based, is provided. The activity feed provides information related to activities of individuals in a user's social network. In a business organization, the user's social network may include coworkers on a project team, individuals common to a product area, individuals in a specific part of an organization, for example product development, individuals in a specific professional area, etc. The individuals in a user's social network and the type of activities for which activity feeds are to be received are typically configurable by the user. When a change in a configured activity occurs, an activity feed documenting the activity is automatically sent to the user.","Activity feeds are received from a variety of sources including enterprise systems, enterprise stores and external systems. Relevance is determined for each incoming activity feed based on a context for the activity feed. The context for the activity feed is determined based on various parameters, such as current user activity, user preferences, configurable system parameters and environmental variables such as time of day and location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","110","112","114","106","108"]},"The server computer  may be a server computer used for collaboration, file sharing and social networking. An example is a server computer that runs the Microsoft Sharepoint\u00ae Server 2010 software product from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Client computers ,  may access server computer  over the Internet or via a corporate Intranet network.","External systems , enterprise systems  and enterprise data stores  may direct activity feeds to server computer . Enterprise systems  may include web sites within a business organization, such as human resources web sites or operational web sites. Other examples of enterprise systems  include email systems, database systems and customer relationship management systems. Examples of activity feeds that may originate from enterprise systems  are birthday notices, changes in job title, task status updates, changes made to a document, notifications of a sales order, etc. Other examples of activity feeds are possible.","Enterprise data stores  are data stores associated with the enterprise systems . External systems  may include web sites and data repositories external to the business organization. For example, one external system  may be a web site from a company that may be collaborating with the business organization, such as a supplier. The business organization may be interested in receiving activity feeds from this company and in turn, the company may be interested in receiving activity feeds from the business organization. Other examples of external systems  are possible.","The contextual relevance engine for activity feeds  is a module running on the server computer . In this example and as described further below, the contextual relevance engine for activity feeds  functions to aggregate a plurality of activity feeds, analyze the activity feeds, determine a relevance of the activity feeds, and deliver content from the activity feeds to end users in a manner so that higher important feeds are more easily identified to the end users.","For example, in the example system , the contextual relevance engine for activity feeds  collects and analyzes information from activity feeds generated by one or more of external systems , enterprise systems  and enterprise data stores . A user at client computers ,  can thereupon request the user's activity feeds from the server computer . The contextual relevance engine for activity feeds  delivers information associated with the user's activity feeds to the client computers ,  in a manner so that more important information is presented in a prominent manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["108","108","202","212","204","205","206","208","210","108","214","216","220","218","224","222"]},"The example activity gatherer  listens for and receives activity feeds provided from one or more of the external systems , the enterprise systems  and the enterprise store . The activity gatherer  also monitors the external systems , the enterprise systems  and the enterprise store  for indications of change activity and records the change activity as activity feeds. In addition, the activity gatherer  crawls the enterprise systems  to build a searchable index that can be used by the relevance calculator . Other functionality of the activity gatherer  includes exposing application programming interfaces (APIs) for use by the external systems  and the enterprise systems . Change activity may be submitted to the activity gatherer  via the APIs. Other uses of the activity gatherer  are possible. The example activity store  stores the activity feeds received by the activity gatherer .","The example user activity tracker  monitors user activity to provide a context for received activity feeds. The user activity is recorded and stored in the example user activity store . Some examples of user activity include being on the telephone, in an instant messaging conversation, in a meeting, at a location, at home, on vacation, working on a specific task, updating status of a task, viewing a document, updating a document, sharing a document, etc. Other examples of user activity are possible.","The example configuration user interface  permits an enterprise administrator to configure policies related to activity feeds. These policies include setting access permissions for the activity gatherer , determining types of user activities monitored by the user activity tracker , determining how often the user context processor  and the environment context processor  are run and configuring the relevance calculator  to rank the relevance of specific activities. Other aspects of the configuration user interface  may include configuring privacy settings, configuring security settings, configuring how data is stored and configuring connection policies and access levels for the example enterprise systems . Other uses of the configuration user interface  are possible. The configuration settings from the configuration user interface  are stored in the configuration store .","The example preferences user interface  permits the user to personalize the types of activity feeds the user wishes to receive. The preferences user interface permits the user to configure data elements and fields related to activity feeds. In examples, the preferences user interface  may include a list of items from which a user can select. For example, a user may select one or more groups or individuals from which to receive activity feeds. The user may also be able to exclude one or more groups or individuals. The user may also be able to select groups or organizations from which to receive activity feeds and the user may also be able to select specific types of activity feeds to receive. For example, the user may decide to receive activity feeds relating to meeting updates but not receive activity feeds relating to birthday notices. The user preferences are stored in the user preferences store .","The example user context processor  determines a user context based on user activity. Some examples of user context are an upcoming meeting, relationship to meeting attendees, assigned projects and tasks, location status, for example in-the-office or out of-the office and location of the user if out-of-the office, etc. Other user contexts are possible.","The user context is determined from one of several sources. Example sources for determining user context include the user's calendar, projects and tasks assigned to the user, documents related to the user (for example documents created, authored or edited by the user), documents that may include the user's status, instant messaging activity, e-mail messages, information regarding the user's contacts within and without the business organization, an organizational profile of the user, the position of the user within the hierarchy of the business organization, information regarding the user's current location, information from enterprise data systems, for example from a human resources server, and current date and time. Other sources for determining user context are possible.","The user context may include a plurality of individual user contexts. For example, if the user context includes \u201cupcoming meeting\u201d and \u201cprojects\u201d, the user contexts of \u201cupcoming meeting\u201d and \u201cprojects\u201d may be included in a data structure such as an array. In this example, each row of the array may include a string of characters corresponding to the individual user context. In other examples, each specific user context may correspond to an entry in a bitmask that represents overall user context. Other examples of representing and storing user context are possible.","The example environment context processor  determines an environment context for current environmental variables such as user location, GPS position, outside temperature, date and time of day. Other environmental variables are possible. The determination of environmental context may be represented as a data structure such as an array having a separate row for each environmental variable, a string that concatenates one or more environmental variables, a linked list, etc. Other means for representing environmental context are possible.","The relevance calculator  receives inputs from the activity gatherer , the user context processor , the environment context processor , the configuration store  and the user preferences store . Based on these inputs the relevance calculator  ranks each activity feed received by the activity gatherer  and calculates a relevance score for each activity feed.","When determining a relevance score, the relevance calculator may first classify activity feeds according to an activity type, with some activity types being ranked higher than others. For example, an activity feed related to business function, for example indicating that a document has been updated or that a project task has been created or updated, may be ranked higher than an activity feed related to a social event such as alerting the user about a coworker's birthday.","The relevance calculator  also evaluates the user preferences from the user preference store . The evaluation of the user preferences may determine whether a specific activity feed is relevant to the user. For example, if the activity is an announcement of a birthday and the user preference is not to be notified about birthdays, the activity feed is not displayed to the user.","When it is determined than an activity feed is relevant to the user based on the user preferences, a determination of relevance is made based on the user context. The determination of relevance based on the user context ranks the activity feed according to importance. For example, when the user context is that the user is scheduled for a meeting in 15 minutes and that coworkers A, B and C are also scheduled to attend the meeting, when it is determined from incoming activity feeds that coworker A modified a document and it is determined from the user context that the document is embedded in the notice for the meeting, the activity feed indicating that coworker A modified the document would receive a high ranking. In examples, the activity feed indicating that coworker A modified the document is displayed near or at the top of the activity feeds user interface . In addition, the activity feed indicating that coworker A modified the document may be highlighted and prominently displayed to the user.","In examples, activity feeds may be ranked on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 corresponds to a highest ranking. In other examples different scales, for example 1 to 100, may be used. The ranking that an activity feed receives corresponds to the calculated relevance for the activity feed.","When the relevance calculator  makes a determination of relevance for an activity feed, the activity feed is displayed the user via the activity feeds user interface . Activity feeds may be displayed as a series of messages and may also include hyperlinks, graphics and time stamps. Activity feeds are displayed according to the determined relevance. Typically, activity feeds with a high relevance are displayed at or near a top of the activity feeds user interface . An example of an activity feed display is discussed later herein.","In addition to providing activity feeds for display on the activity feeds user interface , the relevance calculator  may send activity feeds to one or more consumer applications . The consumer applications  are typically computer applications that run on consumer devices or interfaces for which activity feed information is desired. Examples of such consumer devices or interfaces include a desktop browser, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a personal computer, a mobile browser and a tablet browser. Other examples are possible. The relevance calculator  provides APIs for the consumer application  to submit requests for activity feeds. The most contextually relevant activity feeds are then sent to the consumer applications  via APIs exposed on the consumer applications .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","208","300","300"]},"The activity feeds display screen  includes a \u201cfrom\u201d date field , a \u201cto\u201d date field  and a \u201cshow all\u201d field . The \u201cfrom\u201d date field  permits a user to enter a beginning date for which to display activity feeds for the user. A beginning date can be entered directly into the \u201cfrom\u201d date field  or by selecting a date from a calendar. The calendar is displayed when the example calendar field  is selected. Similarly, the \u201cto\u201d date field  permits a user to enter an end date for which to display activity feeds for the user. A calendar is displayed when the example calendar field  is selected. When the \u201cshow all\u201d button  is clicked, all activity feeds for the user are displayed.","For the example shown in , five activity feeds (activity feeds , , ,  and ) are displayed. In this example, the activity feeds are grouped by date. For example, activity feeds ,  and  are grouped under Wednesday, Mar. 30, 2011 and activity feeds  and  are grouped under Tuesday, Mar. 29, 2011. In this example date headers ,  identify the day and date.","For the example shown in , each activity feed displayed includes a time stamp, a priority icon, and a message description. For example, activity feed  includes timestamp , priority icon  and message description . The example timestamp  indicates the time at which the activity feed  was received. The example priority icon  displays an icon that may indicate a priority for the activity feed . For example, an important activity feed may be indicated by a color, for example red, or may be indicated by an exclamation point or some other symbol. The message description  describes the activity feed. In examples, other items can be displayed with the activity feeds, including graphics and hyperlinks. In addition, a scroll bar  is provided for viewing activity links that scroll of the display screen .","For the example shown in , activity feeds of high relevance are displayed at or near the top of the activity display screen . For example, activity feeds ,  and  are all shown as being received on Wednesday, Mar. 30, 2011. Activity feeds  and  are ordered by the time that the activity feeds are received. Because activity feed  was received more recently than activity feed , activity feed  is displayed above activity feed . However, for this example, activity feed  has a higher relevance to the user than either activity feed  or activity feed . Because activity feed  has a higher relevance to the user than activity feeds  and , activity feed  is displayed above both activity feeds  and . Activity feed  is displayed above both activity feeds  and  even though activity feed  was received earlier than activity feeds  and . Activity feed  is displayed near the top of activity display screen  because activity feed  is determined to have a higher relevance to the user than activity feeds  and .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","400","402","418","402","406","400","420"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","112","114","110"]},"The activity feeds are typically received in either a pull or push scenario. In a pull scenario, the example server computer  monitors, listens for and records change activity in the one or more enterprise systems or enterprise stores, typically by periodically polling the one or more enterprise systems or enterprise stores. When such change activity is detected, activity feeds corresponding to the change activity are received at server computer . In a push scenario, server computer  listens for and accepts activity feeds from the one or business entities when the one or more business entities detect change activity and send corresponding activity feeds to server computer . When an external system sends an activity feed to server computer , the external system typically makes use of APIs exposed by server computer . At operation , information is received regarding activities being performed by a user. The information is received by a user activity tracker, for example user activity tracker , on server computer . The user activity tracker  records and stores user activity in order to provide a user context for the received activity feeds. Examples of user activity are updating a document, updating project task status, being in a meeting, etc.","At operation , context information is obtained regarding the user from one or more sources. The one or more sources include an events calendar for the user, tasks and projects assigned to the user, documents relating to a project or task for the user, email and instant messaging activity for the user, user contacts, an organizational hierarchy for the business organization, a user profile, information from enterprise systems (for example from a human resources system), location information for the user and current date and time. Other sources for obtaining context information regarding the user are possible.","At operation , a user context is determined from the obtained information regarding user activity and the context information regarding the user. For example, when it is determined from the user's calendar that a meeting for a user is scheduled in the near future, for example later in the day, the next day, etc., an example user context may be \u201cupcoming meeting.\u201d Similarly, when it is determined from a list of projects that the user is assigned to one or more specific projects, the user context may include \u201cprojects\u201d and may further include an association (for example a link or a pointer) to the one or more specific projects assigned to the user.","At operation , a relevance score is calculated for the activity feeds based on the user context. The relevance is typically calculated by a relevance calculator module, for example relevance calculator . The relevance calculator calculates a ranking score for each activity feed based on the user context. Activity feeds having a high relevance score receive priority when displayed on the activity feeds user interface. Typically, activity feeds with high relevance scores are displayed at or near the top of the activity feeds user interface. In examples, activity feeds with high ranking scores may be displayed with a bright color, such as red, or displayed in bold lettering or with an icon indicating urgency. Other methods of highlighting high ranking activity feeds are possible.","The relevance calculator calculates the relevance score for an activity feed by evaluating the activity feed with respect to the user context. For example if the activity feed indicates that a project document has been updated and the user context indicates that the user will be attending a meeting at which the document will be discussed, the relevance calculator will rank the activity feed very high and prioritize the activity feed over other activity feeds. However, for the same activity feed, if the user context does not indicate the user will be attending an upcoming meeting at which the document will be discussed, the activity feed will receive a lower relevance score and a lower ranking. For this case, the display of the activity feed generally will not be prioritized and the activity feed will typically be displayed in the order in which it is received for similar types of activity feeds.","The relevance calculator may maintain a ranking of activities independently of user context. For example a document update or a task status change may receive a higher priority than an activity feed for a birthday notification.","At operation , the activity feeds are displayed on the activity feeds user interface of the computing device. The activity feeds are displayed based on the calculated relevance of the activity feeds. Typically, activity feeds with higher rankings are displayed at or near the top of the activity feeds user interface. Lower ranked activity feeds are typically displayed in an order determined by the time and date in which the activity feeds are displayed. Activity feeds of higher ranked classifications (for example document updates as opposed to birthday notices) are typically displayed closer to the top of the activity feeds user interface than activity feeds of lower ranked classifications.","With reference to , example components of server computer  are shown. In example embodiments, server computer  is a computing device. Server computer  can include input\/output devices, a central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d), a data storage device, and a network device.","In a basic configuration, server computer  typically includes at least one processing unit  and system memory . Depending on the exact configuration and type of computing device, the system memory  may be volatile (such as RAM), non-volatile (such as ROM, flash memory, etc.) or some combination of the two.
