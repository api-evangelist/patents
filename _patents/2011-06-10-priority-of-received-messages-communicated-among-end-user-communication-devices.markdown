No. 13\/068,340 filed May 9, 2011, and entitled MANAGEMENT FOR INFORMATION COMMUNICATED AMONG END USER COMMUNICATION DEVICES, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application, Ser. No. 13\/065,839 filed Mar. 31, 2011, and entitled \u201cUBIQUITOUS USER CONTROL FOR INFORMATION COMMUNICATED AMONG END USER COMMUNICATION DEVICES\u201d.","This invention relates to communications among end user communication devices and more specifically to the priority of user data processed by end user communication devices, especially but not limited to, wireless end user communication devices, which may be made by different manufacturers and\/or have different operating systems.","Wireless communication devices are now prevalent throughout all developed countries of the world. Although cellular telephones are currently the most widespread, other types of wireless communication devices include personal digital assistants, laptop computers with Wi-Fi and\/or telecommunication carrier communication support, and various types of \u201cpads\u201d that provide visual displays that are larger than conventional cellular telephones but typically smaller than the displays of a laptop computer. Wireless voice communications between mobile devices utilizing different types of communication protocols, e.g. analog, TDMA, CDMA, VOIP, etc., are supported by different telecommunication carriers which provide appropriate communication protocol interfaces\/gateways to facilitate voice communications between mobile units using different communication protocols.","Various types of transport layer communication protocols are supported by wireless communication devices. For example, text messaging, short messaging service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), email such as by simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and instant messaging utilizing hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) are available. Each type service is supported by a transport layer communication protocol that is part of the telecommunication signaling structure associated with the transport of user communications and the communication of telecommunication infrastructure commands and signals.","Some email client programs support setting an importance level of an email message by the message originator. For example, importance levels can be \u201chigh, normal, low\u201d. However, various email clients may not recognize an importance level originated by a different email client or may provide different types of treatment of the message than intended by the originator. In Microsoft Outlook email client the importance level determines the order in which emails are transmitted from the client, i.e. an email with a high importance level will be transmitted ahead of an email with a normal or low importance level even if the latter was stored in a holding queue ahead of the former. Also, an importance level is generally required to be processed by a server disposed in the transmission path between the originator and recipient in order to convey the importance level to the recipient. For example, a Microsoft Exchange Server transmits messages received from a Microsoft Outlook client to the corresponding destinations from a holding queue in an order based on importance level so that higher importance level messages are transmitted ahead of lower importance level messages even if the latter were received prior to the former.","It is an object of this embodiment of the present invention to satisfy a need for improved message priorities.","In accord with an embodiment of the present invention, an exemplary method implemented by a first end-user communication device receives an electronic communication of a digital packet having a header segment and a user data segment, the user data segment containing a user message and a priority value A first message priority is determined by a first module of a enhanced services application program. The first message priority is based on the received priority value that defines first visual indicia representing a first priority for the user message, a plurality of different message priorities with associated different visual indicia being defined by corresponding priority values. Under the control of the first module, the user message concurrent with the first visual indicia are displayed on a screen segment of the first end-user's communication device so that the first priority assigned to the received user message is visually conveyed to the first end-user.","An embodiment of the present invention includes the end-user communication device that executes this method.","An embodiment of the present invention also includes a computer program product, comprising a computer usable tangible medium having a computer readable program code embodied therein, where the computer readable program code is adapted to be executed to implement this method.","Embodiments of the present invention further include all the steps, elements and features recited in the claims.","Referring to , wireless communication systems  and  support communications with a plurality of wireless mobile devices including exemplary wireless mobile devices (units)  and , respectively. The communication system  includes a home location register (HLR)  that serves as an operations and administration center for registered wireless mobile devices and includes information of the current location of the respective mobile devices. A visitor location register (VLR)  provides temporary registration and location services for wireless mobile devices located in a communication system that is not the home system for the mobile device. A short messaging service center (SMSC)  functions as a server for the transmission and reception of SMS messages for wireless mobile devices supported by communication system . A multimedia service center (MMSC)  provides a similar function to SMSC  for the transmission and reception of multimedia information for wireless mobile devices supported by communication system . These nodes\/elements perform their known functions as part of the infrastructure that supports wireless mobile communications. A mobile switching center (MSC)  provides switching for voice and data communications associated with the supported wireless mobile devices. A plurality of radio access nodes (RANs)  and  provide a wireless communications link between the system  and the supported wireless mobile units. Each RAN is connected to the MSC  wherein wireless messages received from a mobile unit by a RAN are transferred to MSC  for further routing, and messages to be delivered to a mobile unit are transferred from the MSC  to a RAN where such messages are then wirelessly transmitted by the RAN to the destination mobile unit. The elements of communication system  are the same as elements in communication system  and provide the same functionality for the respective supported mobile units. Hence, the elements of communication system  need not be described in detail.","A communication network  provides a communication link between the MSCs of systems  and . Communications with an exemplary SMSC\/HTTP\/IMS server  is also supported by network , where HTTP means hypertext transfer protocol and IMS means Internet map server. A mobile services server  is supported by server  and facilitates enhanced capabilities for wireless mobile units in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For example, wireless mobile units may access and download an application program from server  that can be installed and operate on the wireless mobile unit to provide enhanced functionality and control of user data in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. This will be described in greater detail below. Another end user communication device , which may comprise a computer or other device, is connected to the communication network  by other than a wireless communication link, e.g. a wire internet link through an IP service provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["202","128","204","206","208","210","206","204","210","208","204","212","214","216","204","202","128"]},"Where device  represents a wireless mobile unit, a radio frequency receiver , transmitter  and an antenna  are also present and used for wireless communications between the unit and supporting RANs. The I\/O module  supports communications with supporting external peripherals, e.g. USB communications with a peripheral. When device  represents a wireless mobile unit, the application program controlling the microprocessor  is supported by an operating system and includes an enhanced services (ES) application program such as downloaded from server  and installed in the wireless unit. In this case, the user will be the person using the wireless mobile unit. The ES application program provides the wireless mobile unit with functions as explained below.","Where device  represents the mobile services server  (where elements ,  and  are absent), the I\/O module  supports communications with supporting external nodes, e.g. server  or other nodes. In this case, the application program controlling the microprocessor  is supported by an operating system and includes a services support (SS) application program which supports the downloading, upon a request from a wireless unit, the ES application program from server  to the requesting wireless mobile unit. In this case, the user will be an administrator who maintains the operation of the server. The SS application supports the registration of wireless mobile units, and may also support the storage of user data for use in backup and restore functions with the respective wireless mobile units.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","302","304","306","302","306","306"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","306","402","402","402","306","402","402","402"]},"In the exemplary embodiment, field  of the data segment  consists of four bytes which identify one of a plurality of message types in accordance with predetermined message types stored in the SS application program. In this example, field  contains the label \u201c\/\/P:\u201d wherein the characters \/\/ and : form part of the label, and the \u201cP\u201d identifies a specific type of message, i.e. a Peanut message type. In this exemplary embodiment, a Peanut message type identifies the message as being a person-to-person communication. Different characters in place of the \u201cP\u201d in this field can be used to identify other message types where each message type is associated with different subject matter, e.g. email, banking, insurance, coupons, games, health care, etc. Field  consists of one byte identifying the format or coding structure. In this example, field  may have valid values of 0, 1 or 2 wherein 1 indicates a control message, 0 indicates a normal user message utilizing 7 bit coding, and 2 indicates a normal user message utilizing the Unicode format. Field  consists of one byte having a value where this value identifies the priority of the associated message assigned by the message originator that is intended to alert the recipient of the intended priority, e.g. urgency, of acting on and\/or responding to the message. As will be explained, this value may also control additional aspects, e.g. encryption\/decryption. Field  consists of one byte, i.e. a command byte, identifying the length of message parameter values and may have valid values of 0-128. The value of field  specifies the number of sequential bytes that are part of a control portion of the data segment, i.e. bytes before the user input data begins. Field  consists of a number of bytes equal to the value in field , e.g. 0-128, and contains name value pairs as will explained in the below examples. Field  contains the user input information desired to be conveyed to another party. If the length of the user input information exceeds the number of bytes available in field  of one data segment, the user input information can be parsed and transmitted as multiple fragments sent in a series of SMS packets containing corresponding data segments  with the parsed user information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["402","0","19","0","3","402","4","6","5","5","7","16"]},"Example 2 of  is a data segment similar to example 1 in that it contains a \u201cWIPEOUT\u201d command that will be interpreted by the ES application program on the recipient wireless mobile unit as a request to completely wipe out user data stored through the Peanut application operating under the ES application program. That is, all messages, contacts, templates and other user data stored by the Peanut application will be deleted. These first and second examples are intended to be merely representative of a variety of commands that can be utilized, e.g. \u201cACTIVATE\u201d to activate a Peanut application, \u201cCHANGEPIN <xxxx>\u201d to permit the changing of a personal invitation number or password to the value xxxx contained in the control message, etc.","Example 3 of  illustrates a different type of Peanut application data segment in which the 0 value in byte  indicates that the data segment is a normal message type. The 0 value in byte  indicates that no message parameter values are specified. The value 4 in byte  is used to convey the priority selected by the message originator in accord with . This message will be displayed on the screen of the recipient's communication device with a gray background, that is, the message of alphanumeric characters is displayed on a segment of the recipient's screen in which the background color of the segment is gray. The gray background color is intended to convey to the recipient that this is a normal communication and that a response is not expected by the originator. A predefined group of background colors with corresponding message priorities is made known to all end-users so that the originator of a message can specify a corresponding message priority that will be conveyed in accordance with the present invention to the recipient. The display of different background colors for the alphanumeric characters of the message is intended as exemplary of a variety of visual indicia that could be displayed on the screen of the destination device to denote message priorities. For example, the color of the alphanumeric characters themselves, the color of a portion of the screen segment displaying a message, the color of a separate field or distinctive symbol displayed adjacent the message text\/field, type or style of the alphanumeric characters, shading associated with the alphanumeric characters and\/or background, or other visually distinctive appearances with corresponding priority definitions can be utilized to convey different priorities for a message. It is preferred that the priority indicia always be included when the corresponding message is displayed, e.g. it will be displayed with saved messages, messages restored from backup storage, messages transferred to another user device, messages as displayed on the originating device, etc. Also, a larger number of types of priorities can be used to convey finer distinctions of originator expectations, e.g. orange color=\u201curgent, confirm message receipt as soon as possible\u201d; purple color=\u201cnormal message priority, reply within X hours\/days\u201d, etc. As among a group of users, the group members are free to agree that the available suggested priority categories (colors) will have an understood meaning that differs from the standard suggested meaning. The Peanut application on the receiving wireless mobile unit will interpret this data segment as carrying a message, \u201cHELLO FM MIKE\u201d, to be displayed to the user against a gray color background indicating a normal communication to which the originator does not expect a reply communication.","Example 4 of  carries the same message to be conveyed to the user as in example 3. Again, the 0 value in byte  indicates that the data segment is a normal message type. However, the 4 value in byte  indicates that 4 bytes starting at byte location  carry control information that precedes the user message. In this example, bytes - contain \u201cE006\u201d, where the E in byte , i.e. a command identification character, indicates that an expiration of the subject message is to be executed (message is to be automatically deleted), 0 in byte  indicates expiration in zero days, 0 in byte  indicates expiration in zero hours, and the 6 in byte  indicates expiration in six minutes. That is, upon the receipt of this data segment by the Peanut application on the destination wireless mobile unit, the subject message, \u201cHELLO FM MIKE\u201d, will be conveyed to the user, but all instances of this message will be automatically deleted from recipient mobile unit on the expiration of six minutes. The value 4 in byte  indicates the message will be displayed with a gray background conveying a normal communication in which a reply communication by the recipient is not expected.","Example 5 shows an illustrative Peanut application data segment which is similar to example 4 in that the value in byte  is not zero indicating that a command in addition to the user messages contained in the data segment. In this example, the 7 in byte  indicates that seven bytes starting with byte  are associated with command information and precede the beginning of the user data to be conveyed. The L in byte  will be interpreted as signifying that the subject data segment is a long message, i.e. the subject user message has too many characters to be contained in only one data segment, thereby requiring fragmentation of the user message into a plurality of message fragments that will be transmitted in a number of data segments. The four bytes, bytes -, collectively comprise a value used to identify each of the required data segments needed to complete the long message. In this example, this value is \u201c0001\u201d. The next byte, byte , represents the total number of data segments required to complete the long message. In this example, byte  has a value of 2 indicating that two data segments are required to complete the single long message. Byte  represents the current fragment number of the subject data segment. In this example, byte  has a value of 1 indicating that this is the first data segment fragment of the long message in the long message fragments identified as \u201c0001\u201d. The first character of the actual user message is in byte  with the remaining bytes in the subject data segment carrying further portions of a first message fragment. Example 6 shows the second and last message fragment that completes the long message identified by \u201c0001\u201d. Byte  of example 6 contains a value of 2 indicating that it is the second in a message fragment series. It is also the last of the message fragment series since byte  indicates that the long message is contained in two message fragments. Byte  in example 6 contains the first character of user data in this data segment, but corresponds to the next character in the long user message that follows the last character of the user message contained in the preceding data segment represented by example 5. The value 3 in byte  in examples 5 and 6 causes the message characters to be displayed against a green screen background on the recipient's device which is intended to convey a normal communication in which a response is expected by the originator.","Example 7 illustrates a data segment that contains two commands. The value 12 in byte  indicates that 12 bytes starting with byte  are associated with commands. As explained in example 4, the values \u201cE005\u201d in bytes - indicate a message expiration upon five minutes from the receipt by the Peanut application. The value 255 in byte  serves as a predetermined separation character used to separate commands. Similar to example 6, the L in byte , which is the first field\/character at the beginning of a command string, identifies this data segment as a long message. The bytes - serve to identify the fragments in series of data segments. Byte  has a value of 2 indicating that there are a total of two fragments in the long message series and byte  with a value of 1 indicates that this is the first fragment in the series. The first portion of the actual user message follows beginning at byte .","Example 8 represents the second fragment of the long message where the first fragment was described in example 7. It will be noted that this data segment contains only a single command associated with the long message fragmentation. That is, the time expiration contained as a first command in the first message fragment is not repeated. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a time expiration command communicated in a first message fragment will automatically be effective for all succeeding fragments of the same long message. Thus, the entirety of the perceived long message will be subject to the time expiration. In this example, the value 7 in byte  indicates a command string of seven characters in which: L in byte  identifies this segment as a long message type, \u201c0002\u201d in bytes - identifies the long message fragment series, 2 in byte  indicates that the long message consists of two message segments, and the 2 in byte  indicates that this is the second fragment in the series of the identified long message, and since there are only two message fragments in this long message, the 2 in byte  also indicates that this is the last received fragment in the series. The remaining portion of the user message begins with byte  and continues to the conclusion of the user message is contained in this message fragment. The value 1 in byte  in examples 7 and 8 will cause the message characters to be displayed on the recipient's screen segment against a red background which is intended by the originator to convey an emergency message requiring immediate attention.","When a message sent from an originator's device using a native message client is received and processed by the destination device using the Peanut ES application, the message is displayed on the destination device's screen with a white background, denoting that this message was received as a public unsecured communication. Previously received messages are stored by the respective ES applications and always displayed with the corresponding background color of its associated priority as determined by byte  of the respective message. Preferably, messages being composed and stored by an ES application on an origination device are also displayed on the screen of the origination device by the ES application with the background color selected by the user for the priority of the respective message.","In the above examples of , all of the characters in the various byte positions are shown in a clear text format. In order to preserve security during the transmission of such messages, it is preferred that the majority of each message be sent in an encrypted format. For example, all bytes after byte  will preferably be transmitted utilizing a form of encryption. Those skilled in the art will understand that the use of such encryption requires that the receiving wireless mobile device be capable of decrypting the received encrypted characters thus transforming each received message into a corresponding clear text format as illustrated in accordance with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["602","604","606","606","608","610","610","608","610","612"]},"A YES determination by step  or a YES determination by step  results in the user request being processed as indicated by step . Processing of the request may include parsing the received request to determine included commands and\/or user message components. Such processing is substantially the same as described later with regard to processing of received messages by wireless mobile unit. In step , the request is fulfilled. The fulfilling or action taken in response to the request will vary depending upon the nature of the request itself. The action taken may be applicable to the wireless mobile unit that originated the request or to a different wireless mobile unit. For example, a BACKUP request will cause the uploading and storage of user data contained on the requesting mobile unit to the services server. A RESTORE request will cause the stored user data previously obtained during a BACKUP request to be downloaded and installed on the requesting local unit from the services server. However, other commands may initiate actions to be taken at a wireless mobile unit that is not the requesting mobile unit. For example, a DEACTIVATE request received by the services server from a first mobile unit will cause another wireless mobile unit, having an address specified in the request, to be deactivated. Such a request requires user authentication to ensure that the user making the request is the registered owner of the device to which the deactivation request is directed. The process terminates at END .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["702","704","705","706","708","704","706","708","704","706","708","705","706","708","706","708","708"]},"Native communication program  supports a plurality of files and\/or records , e.g. inbox, outbox, archived data, contacts, etc. The native communication program refers to the communication program originally supplied by the manufacturer or service provider upon the initial acquisition of a wireless mobile unit by a user. The enhanced services communication program  is an application program that is typically installed by the user such as by downloading it from the services server or otherwise installing it from an external source. The enhanced services communication program  also supports a plurality of files and\/or records , e.g. inbox, outbox, archived data, contacts, etc. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the user must obtain access to the enhanced services communication program in order to access its supported files and records. Access may be, for example, obtained by entering a user identification and corresponding password in response to user prompts displayed on the screen by the enhanced services communication program upon request to open this program. Interactions between the enhanced services communication program and the native communication program is supported by an application program interface (API) associated with the native communication program and\/or supported by the operating system itself.","In the illustrated example, the digital communication interface  transmits and receives digital communication strings with both the native communication program  and the enhanced services communication program . Since communications originated from a wireless mobile unit utilizing the enhanced services communication program is encrypted, the receipt of such an encrypted communication by a destination mobile device will be unintelligible as viewed from a native communication program of the destination mobile device. However, the message may be viewed in clear text format by utilizing the enhanced services communication program on the destination mobile device. For example, a received SMS text message that was transmitted from an enhanced services communication program on the origination mobile device, will appear as a string of unintelligible characters when viewed by the native communication program of a recipient device, except for the leading format indicator \u201c\/\/P:\u201d. The same message will be displayed in a clear text format in the inbox of enhanced services communication program (Peanut) on the recipient device.","The enhanced services communication program  may include a plurality of modules or sub-programs that support different types of enhanced services, e.g. Peanut \u201c\/\/P:\u201d for messaging, Walnut \u201c\/\/W:\u201d for email, Hazelnut \u201c\/\/H:\u201d for banking, Brazilnut \u201c\/\/B:\u201d for insurance, Chestnut \u201c\/\/C:\u201d for games, Pistachio \u201c\/\/PH:\u201d for healthcare, The Nest \u201c\/\/TN:\u201d for coupons, etc. In support of multiple types of ES, the enhanced services communication program  also contains a router module  which determines the type of received communication based on the identifying format, i.e. the \u201c\/\/X:\u201d designation, and routes the communication to the corresponding module for processing. This routing is independent of the transport layer communication protocol that was used to convey the incoming communication to the destination communication device.","For example, an incoming SMS message from the user's automobile insurance agent may contain a notice of the date on which the term of the current insurance policy will be expiring and a reminder to pay the premium to keep the policy in effect. This SMS message will have been transmitted from a device using ES originated by the Brazilnut module \u201c\/\/B:\u201d format since the subject matter of the communication deals with insurance. The router module  in the recipient's communication device will recognize this ES format and route the corresponding communication to the Brazilnut module for processing. An ES email communication concerning insurance, sent from an originator device using the Brazilnut module, could have been used to convey the same message wherein the router module  in the recipient's communication device would route the email communication with a \u201c\/\/B:\u201d format to the Brazilnut module for processing.","Each ES module supports a unique ES format to identify itself and contains its own segregated set of user utilities, i.e. inbox, outbox, etc. That is, each ES module may require a separate user identification and password in order to access the corresponding user utilities, and will have different encryption\/decryption requirements than other ES modules. As explained above, encryption is used for ES communications except for the ES format identification. To properly decrypt a received communication into clear text, the incoming communication must be processed by the ES module in the destination user's device that corresponds to the ES module used to originate the communication since each ES module uses a different form of encryption. For example, an incoming Brazilnut communication received by the intended destination device and processed by its Brazilnut module will be decrypted into a clear text message. However, an incoming Brazilnut communication received by the intended destination device if processed by an ES module other than the Brazilnut module would not be properly decrypted into a clear text message since the decryption process would not match the encryption process. Thus, ES communications, even if processed by the intended destination device, will appear as a character string that is not intelligible if processed by the native communication program of the device or by an ES module of a different format. An ES communication if received or intercepted by an unintended destination device will appear as an unintelligible character string since the encryption\/decryption process is also unique to the originator\/recipient, i.e. the encryption\/decryption key includes parameters associated with specific devices\/users. Hence, the embodiment of the present invention provides identity management as well as subject matter organization and management.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["802","804","708","705"]},"A determination is made in step  of whether all received messages are to be routed to both the native processing application and the ES application. A YES determination by step  causes the received message to be transmitted for processing to both the native processing application  and to the ES application . A NO determination by step , indicating that the user has not selected that all incoming messages be processed by both applications, results in step  making a determination of whether the user has selected all incoming messages to be processed only by the ES application. A YES determination by step  results and all incoming messages being processed by the ES application at step . A NO determination by step  results in step  making a determination if a valid ES format is present in the received message. For example, a valid ES format can be determined to have been received in a message if the first 4 bytes consist of \u201c\/\/X:\u201d where the X corresponds to one of the valid modules in the ES application. A NO determination by step  results in the message being transferred to the native process application for handling as indicated at step . A YES determination by step , indicating that a valid ES format is present in the received message, results in the message being processed by an ES application at step . In step , the ES module to be utilized to process the received message is determined based on the \u201cX\u201d as explained above. If a message is received by step  for processing that does not contain a valid ES module identification, the ES application will still process the message as a native message in a manner similar to the native process application. However, the native processing provided by the ES application differs from the processing provided by the native application in that the ES application places the resulting message in an inbox of a predetermined default ES module, e.g. the message is displayed to a user in the secure inbox of the Peanut application. An advantage of having the ES application process all of the received messages is that all of the supported ES features, e.g. security, backup, retrieval, restore, etc., is made available for all received messages, even messages that were originated from a user device with native processing. It also permits the user to easily transfer all of the saved messages stored on one handset to another handset, even where the other handset is made by a different manufacturer and\/or utilizes a different operating system. Since all received messages are stored only in secure inboxes of the ES application, all received messages are protected by the security provided by the ES application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 5"],"b":["902","904","4","5","906","906","908","910","912","912","908"]},"A NO determination by step  or a NO determination by step  results in step  making a determination of whether user data is present in the subject received message. A NO determination by step , indicating that no user data is present to be processed, results in the conclusion of processing at END . A YES determination by step  results in step  processing the user data contained in the received message. Typically, in the case of an SMS text message, processing user data includes providing an alert to the user indicating that a message has been received, displaying the received message on the screen of the user's wireless mobile unit along with visual indicia indicating the priority assigned by the originator, and storing the received message as a file or record, e.g. a record in the INBOX of the enhanced services application program.

User input data can be input utilizing a graphical user interface such as from menu selection or by accepting alphanumeric characters entered the user in a predetermined data entry field. For each message, the originating user can select a priority, such as one of the exemplary priorities shown in , that will be assigned to the message. Messages are transmitted with a default priority, e.g. \u201cGRAY\u201d, if the originating user does not set a different priority before the message is completed. Following step  or upon a NO determination by step , indicating that no user data is to be included, a determination is made in step  of whether the completed message should be sent. A YES determination by step  results in the composed message being transmitted from the utilized ES module to the destination wireless mobile unit by step . As part of the transmission process, the transmitted message may be stored in the OUTBOX of the corresponding ES module in the originating wireless mobile unit. The process concludes at END . A NO determination by step , indicating that the composed message is not to be transmitted, results in the aborting of the transmission of the message at step  and determination of processing at END .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"5"},"In addition to displaying a background color indicative of the message priority, the value of the priority byte may be utilized by the ES application for other purposes and functions. For example, the type of encryption\/decryption utilized for a message may be determined based on the value of the priority byte, e.g. values 1-4 may be interpreted by the ES application to utilize a default type of message encryption\/decryption with the corresponding background colors shown in , while values 5-8 causes the ES application to utilize a different type of message encryption\/decryption with the display of the same background colors as for values 1-4, respectively.","Also the value of the priority byte can indicate a message security level, e.g. the value 9 may cause a black background color to be displayed with the message and cause the ES application to utilize a higher level or different encryption\/decryption technique such as requiring a dynamic key exchange or a user entered encryption\/decryption key in order to encrypt\/extract the clear text message. For example, when the originating party selects BLACK as a priority indication, the originator is prompted to enter a password which is used as a custom encryption key to convert clear text message to cipher text that is transmitted to the destination party. On the receiving end, an incoming message with a BLACK priority is received and stored in the cipher text mode. To convert the cipher text message with an associated BLACK priority to clear text, the receiving party will be prompted to enter a password as part of a dynamic key exchange, where the password entered by the receiving party must be the same password used by the originator or a decryption password associated with the encryption password utilized by the originator as part of a linked encryption\/decryption key. The described encryption\/decryption technique and the storage of the message as cipher text for priority value 9 (BLACK) priority messages differ from the priority values 1-4 and 5-8 in that the encryption\/decryption of messages associated with the other priorities is processed automatically in accordance with the ES application and the corresponding messages are displayed and stored in clear text format both at the originating and receiving devices. A received BLACK priority message is stored and displayed as cipher text, and will not be displayed as clear text unless the user enters the required password\/key.","Message priorities as implemented by an embodiment of the present invention are ubiquitous. A message of a specified priority, e.g. green, is displayed with the same priority indicia to the recipient regardless of transport layer communication protocol used to transport the message, i.e. whether the message was conveyed via SMS, MMS, email, etc. Further, message priority is uniform across all modules of the ES application so a \u201cred\u201d priority SMS message originated by a Peanut module and a \u201cred\u201d priority SMS message originated by a Brazil Nut module are displayed with the same priority indicia to the recipient even though the received message is processed by different modules of the ES application. The originating device using the ES application saves sent messages with the corresponding priorities and displays sent messages with the same priority indicia as presented to the recipient. Hence, users can easily discern by the display of sent messages the priority that was associated with each.","The wireless mobile unit in one example employs one or more computer-readable signal-bearing tangible media. The computer-readable signal-bearing tangible media store software, firmware and\/or assembly language for performing one or more portions of one or more embodiments of the invention. The computer-readable signal-bearing tangible medium may contain stored data in the form of magnetic, electrical, optical, biological, and atomic information. For example, the computer-readable signal-bearing tangible medium comprise floppy disks, magnetic tapes, CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, hard disk drives, and electronic memory.","Although exemplary implementations of the invention have been depicted and described in detail herein, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications, additions, substitutions, and the like can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Although the background color of displayed messages is used to indicate priority in the above examples, any visual indicia indicative of priority could be displayed in association with, e.g. concurrent with, adjacent to, or near, the message. Various types of encoding could be used with the transmission of a message to define the message priority and corresponding visual indicia indicative of its priority. The priority \u201cvalue\u201d can comprise other than numeric values, e.g. different alphabetic or other characters or symbols that identify corresponding defined priorities.","The scope of the invention is defined in the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Features of exemplary implementations of the invention will become apparent from the description, the claims, and the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
