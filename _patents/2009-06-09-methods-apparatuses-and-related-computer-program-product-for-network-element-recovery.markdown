{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION","Example 1","Example 2"],"p":["Examples of the present invention relate to network element recovery. More specifically, the examples of the present invention relate to methods, apparatuses, and a related computer program product for network element recovery. The examples of the present invention may be applicable e.g. to policy and charging control (PCC) in a packet based mobile network (e.g. 3generation partnership project (3GPP) system architecture evolution (SAE)), for example recovery and restoration from a failure of a PCC network element.","When a network entity, such as a policy and charging rules function (PCRF), fails and\/or restarts, the existing\/ongoing user sessions may be maintained with no or minimal damage. This may be facilitated by the use of some kind of a recovery mechanism to restore the status and data of the ongoing sessions in the re-started network entity. When \u201chot redundancy\u201d (i.e. every critical network entity is doubled, the second entity running active (\u201chot\u201d) beside the first entity and maintaining the session statuses and data) is not used, at least some of the other network entities connected to the re-started entity may be involved, actively or passively, in restoring the session statuses and data in the restarted entity.","There have been considerations on restoration procedures for a network element. For example, restoring a pre-failure status of user sessions e.g. in the PCRF may be achieved e.g. by fetching the session status information and the related parameters from the network elements connected to the PCRF. Furthermore, restoration procedures may use protocols (e.g. general packet radio service (GPRS) tunneling protocol (GTP)) that comprise different planes (e.g. control plane, user plane) that separate the control and management functions from the user plane\/user session functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","1021","1022","1023","1024","1025","1026","1027"]},"However, in case of failure e.g. of the PCRF , a backup instance is required, such as PCEF , AF , or BBERF . The backup instance already contains at least some session state information, and is used after the failure. In that case, the failed and restarted entity is up-dated\/restored with the latest\/up-to-date session information.","In consideration of the above, according to examples of the present invention, methods, apparatuses and a related computer program product for network element recovery are provided.","In this connection, the examples of the present invention enable one or more of the following:\n\n","The examples of the present invention are described herein below by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings.","It is to be noted that for this description, the terms \u201cPCRF; PCEF, AF\/P-CSCF and\/or SPR; user\/UE ID and\/OR IP address; and request message and\/or user plane event\u201d are examples for \u201crestarted element; connected\/related element; session-related detail information; and protocol-related message\u201d, respectively, without restricting the latter-named terms to the special technical or implementation details imposed to the first-named terms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIGS. 2 and 3","FIGS. 2 and 3"]},"As shown in , a communication system  may comprise a UE (not shown) and a network (not shown). In turn, the network may further comprise a PCEF , a PCRF , an AF\/P-CSCF  and an SPR .","(), e.g. PCEF may trigger session recovery\/restoration after PCRF restart.","As shown in , in steps Sand S, e.g. the PCRF  and network elements , ,  connected to the PCRF  may establish a control session by transmitting and receiving control session-related messages.","As shown in , in steps Sor S, e.g. the PCRF  may perform transmitting restart information indicating a restart of a network element. The transmitted restart information may be received by the PCEF , the AF\/P-CSCF  or the SPR .","Then, in step Sproc, e.g. the PCEF , the AF\/P-CSCF  or the SPR  may perform processing at least one protocol-related message of a first control session to include session-related detail information based on the received restart information.","In steps Sor S, e.g. the PCEF , the AF\/P-CSCF  or the SPR  may perform transmitting, responsive to the receiving, the at least one protocol related message of a first control session.","Then, in steps Sor S, e.g. the PCRF  may perform receiving, the at least one protocol-related message of a first control session, including session-related detail information. The protocol-related message of a first control session may comprise an indication information indicating a need for restoration of at least one session.","Thus, in step S, e.g. the PCRF  may perform restoring the at least one first session based on the received session-related detail information and the at least one session parameter.","As developments for the method pertaining to the PCRF , in optional steps S, S, Sor S, the PCRF  may perform the above restoring further comprising second transmitting a restoration request message based on the session-related detail information, and, in optional steps S, S, Sor S, second receiving at least one session parameter necessary for restoring the at least one first session.","The network element to which the restoration request message is sent may be found using e.g. one of the following: (a) Session identifiers and\/or user\/UE identifiers and\/or IP address are received from an entity that received the restart information; (b) The restarted entity (e.g. PCRF) may send the restoration request to all possible entities and receives an acknowledgement from the entity that recognizes the parameters of the message; (c) Session identifiers and\/or user\/UE identifiers and\/or IP addresses of network elements are saved in a network entity and restored by the restarted entity after the restart.","The restoring may further comprise restoring a second control session related to the first control session, based on the transmitted restoration request message and the received at least one session parameter, and binding the first control session and the second control session, based on the received session parameter(s) and\/or detail information.","Further, the protocol-related message may be e.g. a session modification request or a user plane event report message received from a policy and charging enforcement function, an application function or a bearer binding and event reporting function, and the restoration request message may be a restore session request transmitted to a policy and charging enforcement function, an application function, bearer binding and event reporting function or a subscription profile repository. Alternatively or additionally, the restoration request message may be a regular request message requesting session information from an application function or from a policy and charging enforcement function and requesting user information from a subscription profile repository.","Still further, the indication information may be constituted explicitly by indication information. Alternatively, the indication information may be constituted implicitly by reception of the protocol-related message.","Finally e.g. the PCRF  may perform requesting from any related network element (e.g. PCEF, AF, SPR), after a preconfigured time, restoration of at least one session not yet restored but started before the restart.","As developments for the method pertaining to the PCEF , the AF\/P-CSCF  or the SPR , the transmitting may further comprise transmitting the indication information indicating the need for restoring at least one session.","As developments for the method pertaining to the PCRF  as well as to the PCEF , the AF\/P-CSCF  or the SPR , the restart information may be part of a restarted message, and the session-related detail information may comprise user or UE identifications and\/or internet protocol addresses. In that case, the session-related detail information may further comprise session identifications. Alternatively, the restart information may be part of a restore session message or a Diameter or application message and may comprise user identifications and\/or internet protocol addresses, and the session-related detail information may be part of an acknowledgement message from an entity recognizing the at least one of user identifications and internet protocol addresses. Alternatively, the session-related detail information may be stored upon each control session establishment and may comprise user identifications and\/or internet protocol addresses.","Further, e.g. the PCRF  as well as the PCEF , the AF\/P-CSCF  or the SPR  may perform, at the establishment of the control session or at a later message exchange before the restart or at the restart indication message exchange, negotiating a restoration scheme upon connection set up for a control session. Alternatively, the negotiating may be performed upon performing a session-related message exchange or a non-session-related message exchange. Alternatively, the PCRF  as well as the PCEF , the AF\/P-CSCF  or the SPR  may perform pre-configuring the restoration scheme. Negotiable issues may comprise e.g. an indication to use an indication to inform about a restart, an indication to use soft recovery (i.e. the related session statuses at the restarted entity are restored only when there is anyway a reason to perform message exchange for other purposes like e.g. a user session update), an indication to send identifiers of active sessions and\/or user\/UE identifiers and\/or IP addresses from related entities to the restarted entity after a restart for example to help the restarted entity identify correct network elements, messages (e.g. dedicated or regular) and protocols (e.g. a dedicated protocol or the application protocol) used for recovery purposes, parameters (e.g. session identifiers, user or UE identifiers, IP addresses) required or used in recovery\/restoration messages\/responses.","Still further, the restoring may further comprise restoration of session bindings based on internet protocol addresses and user or UE identifications. Moreover, restart information may not be transmitted prior to an exchange of session termination messages.","In addition, the indication information may be triggered by modification of a session. Alternatively, the indication information may be triggered by a user plane event or by a subscription to an event.","In other words, the first example of the present invention may comprise the following:","Steps , : Connections may be established between the clients (e.g. PCEF , AF ) and the server (PCRF ). The use and details of a recovery mechanism may be negotiated during\/upon the connection establishment message exchange.","Steps , : User\/UE session (e.g. IP-CAN session, AF session) related Diameter control sessions may be established between PCEF  and PCRF  and between AF  and PCRF .","Step : PCRF  may restart for some reason.","Steps , , , : PCRF  may inform the related network elements (e.g. PCEF\/GW , AF ) about the restart. The use and details of a recovery mechanism may be negotiated with a message exchange with the related network elements.","Step : For example, an IP connectivity access network (IP-CAN) session modification or a user plane event may produce e.g. a request message (e.g. a Diameter CC Request message) from the PCEF  to the PCRF . The PCEF  may include user\/UE ID and\/or IP address and possibly other parameters in the message to enable the PCRF  to recover\/restore the session details lost in the restart. Knowing that the system is recovering from a PCRF  restart, the PCEF  may include a parameter to indicate that the request relates to an existing session.","Step : PCRF  may have no status information for the session ID in the request, but the PCRF  may assume this session exists, because of the indication from the PCEF  (or simply because a request was received after a restart where session statuses were lost). PCRF  may restore the session status, e.g. may store the session-ID and possibly other session information and parameters for the User\/UE identity and\/or IP address related control session. PCRF  may also start re-creating the related control sessions with other network elements (e.g. AF , SPR ), because the PCRF  may have lost the statuses and data (e.g. session ID) of the control session upon the failure\/restart.","Step : PCRF  may send a RESTORE SESSION request to AF  to restore the related control session with the AF  and possibly to get the related session information (lost during the failure\/restart).
