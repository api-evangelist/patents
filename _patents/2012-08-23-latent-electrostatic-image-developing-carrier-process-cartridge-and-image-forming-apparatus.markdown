Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a latent electrostatic image developing carrier, a process cartridge and an image forming apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, technologies of copiers and printers based on electrophotography have rapidly been changed from monochromatic modes to full-color modes, and the market of full-color modes tends to expand. In color image formation by full-color electrophotography, a latent electrostatic image is formed on a latent electrostatic image bearing member. Next, the latent electrostatic image is developed with charged three color toners of yellow, magenta and cyan or with charged four color toners of yellow, magenta, cyan and black to thereby form toner images, which are then transferred onto a recording medium, followed by fixing.","In order to form a clear full-color image through such image formation by full-color electrophotography, it is necessary to keep the amount of the toner on the latent electrostatic image bearing member depending on the latent electrostatic image. The fluctuation of the amount of the toner on the latent electrostatic image bearing member results in fluctuation in image density and color tone on a recording medium. The fluctuation of the amount of the toner on the latent electrostatic image bearing member is due to, for example, fluctuation in charge amount of toner. In particular, in the hybrid developing method, there have been reported that the difference in amount of a toner from place to place on a toner bearing member causes a difference in image density on the next development, which is so-called hysteresis (ghost phenomenon) (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2007-25693).","In one effective method for overcoming hysteresis in the hybrid developing method, the toner remaining on the toner bearing member after development of the latent electrostatic image on the latent electrostatic image bearing member is removed and then an unused toner is supplied to the surface of the toner bearing member, to thereby compensate the above-described difference in amount of the toner on the toner bearing member. For example, there has been proposed a method of overcoming hysteresis by scraping off the remaining toner from the toner bearing member with a scraper or a toner recovering roller after development and before supply of an unused toner (see, for example, Japanese Patent (JP-B) No. 3356948 and JP-A Nos. 2005-157002 and 11-231652). Also, there has been proposed a method of overcoming hysteresis by recovering the remaining toner from the toner bearing member with a magnetic roller utilizing the difference in electrical potential, to thereby stabilize the amount of the toner on the toner bearing member (see, for example, JP-A No. 07-072733). Furthermore, there has been proposed a method of overcoming hysteresis by providing a wide half-width region between a developer bearing member and a toner bearing member in which region the half value of the peak of the magnetic flux density of a magnetic roller is observed, to thereby stabilize recovery and supply of the toner with respect to the developer bearing member (see, for example, JP-A No. 07-128983). Moreover, there has been proposed a method of overcoming hysteresis by keeping constant the amount of the toner on the toner bearing member where non-spherical carrier particles are used as a carrier of a two-component developer. Specifically, charges are injected into the carrier particles at the tips of the magnetic brushes; the distance between the developer bearing member and the toner bearing member is made small; the amount of the toner to be supplied at one time to the toner bearing member is increased; and the toner is supplied onto the toner bearing member in such an amount that the amount of the toner thereon is saturated (see, for example, JP-A No. 07-092813).","The above-described hysteresis is said to be a specific problem to the hybrid developing method. However, when a developer is used for a long period of time in the two-component developing method, there has been reported that the developing capability of the developer degrades to cause hysteresis where the image density decreases (see, for example, JP-A No. 11-065247).","Hysteresis occurring in the two-component developing method results from inappropriate removal of a two-component developer. The removal of the developer is performed at a removal region having a magnetic force of almost 0, which is formed by an odd number of magnets provided in the developing sleeve and magnets of the same polarity provided below the rotation shaft of the developing sleeve. In the removal region, the developer after development is allowed to freely fall due to gravitational force. However, counter charges are generated on the carrier when the toner is consumed for forming the previous image to thereby form mirror image force between the carrier and the developer bearing member, resulting that the developer cannot normally be removed. Thus, the developer in which the concentration of the toner has been lowered as a result of consumption of the toner is transferred again to the developing region to reduce the developing capability. In other words, the density of the image formed at the first rotation of the sleeve is normal, while the density of the images formed at the second and subsequent rotations is low.","Furthermore, one proposed method of overcoming hysteresis in the two-component developing method is a method of removing the developer after development using magnetic force generated from pumping rollers each having a magnet therein which are arranged near the removal region on the developing sleeve (see, for example, JP-A No. 11-065247). The developer that has been removed is pumped up with another pumping roller and then transferred to a developer-stirring chamber having a screw, where the concentration of the toner is adjusted again and the toner is charged.","However, even with the above-described proposal, the developer is affected by hysteresis after continuously used for a long period of time. Thus, problematically, it is not possible to stably supply a necessary amount of toner to a latent electrostatic image bearing member. In addition, the above proposal cannot reduce an increase in resistance of a carrier caused by toner spent which is a specific problem in the two-component developing method. Therefore, keen demand has arisen for a measure to solve such problems at the same time.","The present invention has been made under such circumstances, and aims to solve the above existing problems and achieve the following objects. Specifically, the present invention aims to provide a latent electrostatic image developing carrier and a process cartridge and an image forming apparatus each using the latent electrostatic image developing carrier, where the latent electrostatic image developing carrier, even when used continuously for a long period of time, can stably supply a necessary amount of toner to a latent electrostatic image bearing member without being affected by hysteresis, and can prevent an increase in resistance due to deposition of spent toner thereon.","Hysteresis to be solved by the present invention differs from the above hysteresis in a mechanism where it occurs.","Although it has not been clearly elucidated in detail, the mechanism where ghost phenomenon in the present invention occurs is thought to be as follows. Specifically, toner particles are attached onto the developer bearing member depending on the hysteresis of the previous image, and as a result the amount of the toner used for developing the next image varies with the potential of the toner particles attached on the developer bearing member. In other words, the ghost phenomenon is thought to be caused by change in amount of toner used for developing the next image due to the hysteresis of the previous image.","In more detail, a potential with which toner particles are moved from the latent electrostatic image bearing member to the developing sleeve is formed in the non-image portion opposite to a potential in the image portion, and as a result, the toner is directly deposited onto the developer bearing member (toner deposition occurs on the developer bearing member). When the image portion is developed on the next development in this state where the toner is deposited on the developer bearing member, the developing potential is increased by the potential of the toner on the developer bearing member to increase the amount of toner used for the development, since the toner directly deposited on the developer bearing member is charged.","Also, the toner directly deposited on the developer bearing member is consumed during development. Thus, the amount thereof is not constant and varies with the hysteresis of the previous image.","That is, when there are non-image portions and spaces between paper sheets immediately before image formation, the above-described developing potential is increased in developing the subsequent image portion, increasing the image density of the subsequent images. When the previous image is an image having an image occupation rate, the toner directly deposited onto the developer bearing member is consumed for developing the previous image, and the above-described developing potential is increased to less extent, not increasing the image density of the subsequent images.","As described above, the hysteresis to be solved by the present invention is a phenomenon where the density of the next image changes due to change in amount of toner deposited on the developer bearing member depending on the previous image.","The present inventors conducted extensive studies to solve the above problems and found that a latent electrostatic image developing carrier having the constitution of the present invention, even when used continuously for a long period of time, can stably supply a necessary amount of toner to a latent electrostatic image bearing member without being affected by hysteresis, and can prevent an increase in resistance due to deposition of spent toner thereon. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the finding.","The present invention is based on the finding obtained by the present inventors. Means for solving the above existing problems are as follows. Specifically, a latent electrostatic image developing carrier of the present invention includes: core particles each having magnetism; and a coating layer covering each of the core particles, wherein the latent electrostatic image developing carrier has a shape factor SF-2 of 115 to 150 and has a bulk density of 1.8 g\/cmto 2.4 g\/cm, wherein the core particles have a shape factor SF-2 of 120 to 160 and have an arithmetic mean surface roughness Ra of 0.5 \u03bcm to 1.0 \u03bcm, and wherein the coating layer contains a resin and a filler and an amount of the filler contained in the coating layer is 50 parts by mass to 500 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the resin contained in the coating layer.","The present invention can provide a latent electrostatic image developing carrier and a process cartridge and an image forming apparatus each using the latent electrostatic image developing carrier, where the latent electrostatic image developing carrier, even when used continuously for a long period of time, can stably supply a necessary amount of toner to a latent electrostatic image bearing member without being affected by hysteresis, and can prevent an increase in resistance due to deposition of spent toner thereon.","(Latent Electrostatic Image Developing Carrier)","A latent electrostatic image developing carrier of the present invention includes core particles and a coating layer covering each of the core particles; and, if necessary, further includes other ingredients.","<Core Particles>","The core particles are not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, so long as they are core particles each having magnetism. Examples thereof include ferromagnetic metals such as iron and cobalt; iron oxides such as magnetite, hematite and ferrite; and resin particles formed by dispersing in a resin a magnetic material such as alloys and compounds. Among them, Mn ferrites, Mn\u2014Mg ferrites and Mn\u2014Mg\u2014Sr ferrites are preferred since they are environmentally friendly.","\u2014Shape Factor SF-1 of Core Particles\u2014","The core particles are defined by shape factor SF-1.","The SF-1 defines the degree of circularity of the particles.","As the SF-1 becomes greater, the shape of the particles deviates from a circle (spherical shape).","The shape factor SF-1 of the core particles is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.","The shape factor SF-1 of the core particles was measured as follows. Specifically, the core particles were observed at a magnification of \u00d7300 under a scanning electron microscope (e.g., FE-SEM (S-800), product of Hitachi, Ltd.). Then, 100 core particles on the obtained image were randomly sampled and the obtained image information was analyzed with an image analyzer (e.g., Luzex AP, product of NIRECO CORPORATION), followed by calculation using the following equation (1):\n\nSF-1=()\u00d7(\u03c0\/4)\u00d7100\u2003\u2003(1)\n","in the above equation (1), L denotes an absolute maximum length (a length of the circumcircle) of each core particle and A denotes a projected area of each core particle.","\u2014Shape Factor SF-2 of Core Particles\u2014","The core particles are defined by shape factor SF-2.","The SF-2 defines the degree of irregularity of the particles.","As the SF-2 becomes greater, the irregularity on the surfaces of the particles becomes larger.","The shape factor SF-2 of the core particles is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, so long as it is 120 to 160. When the shape factor SF-2 is less than 120, it becomes easy for convex portions of the core particles to be covered, potentially making it difficult to form local low-resistance regions. When the shape factor SF-2 is more than 160, the amount of voids of the core particles increases to decrease the strength of the core particles. In addition, when the formed carrier is used in a developing device for a long time, the core particles are exposed to a large extent, which leads to a great change in resistance between before and after use. As a result, the amount of the toner on the latent electrostatic image bearing member and the way of forming a toner image are changed to potentially change the image density.","The shape factor SF-2 of the core particles was measured as follows. Specifically, the core particles were observed at a magnification of \u00d7300 under a scanning electron microscope (e.g., FE-SEM (S-800), product of Hitachi, Ltd.). Then, 100 core particles on the obtained image were randomly sampled and the obtained image information was analyzed with an image analyzer (e.g., Luzex AP, product of NIRECO CORPORATION), followed by calculation using the following equation (2):\n\nSF-2=()\u00d7(1\/4\u03c0)\u00d7100\u2003\u2003(2)\n","in the above equation (2), P denotes a perimeter of each core particle and A denotes a projected area of each core particle.","\u2014Arithmetic Mean Surface Roughness Ra of Core Particles\u2014","The arithmetic mean surface roughness Ra of the core particles defines the surface roughness of the core particles.","Defining the arithmetic mean surface roughness Ra of the core particles has the meaning that deformed core particles having a shape factor SF-2 of 120 to 160 but greatly deviating the spherical shape cause considerable carrier deposition and thus cannot be used in the present invention.","The arithmetic mean surface roughness Ra of the core particles is not particularly limited, so long as it is 0.5 \u03bcm to 1.0 \u03bcm, and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but is preferably 0.6 \u03bcm to 0.9 \u03bcm.","The arithmetic mean surface roughness Ra of the core particles was measured using an optical microscope (e.g., OPTELICS C130, product of LASERTEC CORPORATION) as follows. Specifically, an image was taken in at a resolution of 0.20 \u03bcm with the objective lens adjusted to a magnification of \u00d750. Then, the observation area was defined to be 10 \u03bcm\u00d710 \u03bcm around the apex of each core particle, and the surface roughnesses Ras of 100 core particles were averaged.","\u2014Grain Size of Core Particles\u2014","The grain size of the core particles is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but is preferably 2 \u03bcm to 8 \u03bcm.","\u2014BET Specific Surface Area of Core Particles\u2014","The BET specific surface area of the core particles is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but is preferably 0.09 m\/g to 0.40 m\/g.","\u2014Weight Average Particle Diameter Dw of Core Particles\u2014","The weight average particle diameter Dw of the core particles refers to a particle diameter at an integrated value of 50% in a particle size distribution of the core particles measured by the laser diffraction\/scattering method.

Specifically, the particle size distribution on the number basis (the relationship between number frequency and particle diameter) was measured using a MICROTRACK particle distribution analyzer (HRA9320-X100, product of Honewell Co.) under the following conditions and the Dw was calculated using the following equation (3). Notably, the number of channels was that dividing into unit ranges the particle diameter range in the particle size distribution chart, and the representative particle diameter adopted was the lowest value of the particle diameters stored in each channel.\n\n1\/\u03a3()}\u00d7{\u03a3()}\u2003\u2003(3)\n","in the above equation (3), D denotes a representative particle diameter (\u03bcm) of core particles present in each channel, and n denotes the total number of core particles present in each channel.","[Measurement Conditions]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["[1] Particle diameter range: 100 \u03bcm to 8 \u03bcm","[2] Channel length (channel width): 2 \u03bcm","[3] Channel number: 46","[4] Refractive index: 2.42\n\n<Coating Layer>\n"]}},"The coating layer is formed from a coating layer forming solution containing a resin and a filler.","The coating layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, so long as it is contains 50 parts by mass to 500 parts by mass of the filler per 100 parts by mass of the resin. Preferably, the coating layer contains 100 parts by mass to 300 parts by mass of the filler per 100 parts by mass of the resin. When the amount of the filler is less than 50 parts by mass, the coating layer may be abraded. When it is more than 500 parts by mass, the amount of the resin exposed to the carrier surface becomes smaller, resulting in that the toner may be easier to cause spent on the carrier surface. When the amount of the filler falls within the above preferred range, it is advantageous in that the coating layer is hardly abraded even after the formed carrier has been used in a developing device for a long period of time.","When the thickness of the coating layer is too small, the surfaces of the core particles are easily exposed due to stirring in a developing device, potentially changing in resistance greatly. When it is too large, the convex portions of the core particles are not exposed to make it difficult to form local low-resistance regions. The thickness of the coating layer can be controlled by adjusting the amount of the resin contained in the core particles. The amount of the resin contained in the core particles is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. It is preferably 0.5% by mass to 3.0% by mass since the thickness of the formed coating layer can form local low-resistance regions.","\u2014Resin\u2014","The resin is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose.

The replenishing developer can be applied to an image forming apparatus which performs image formation while discharging excess developer from the developing device. The developing device using the replenishing developer can attain steady image quality for a very long period of time. Specifically, in the image forming apparatus using the above replenishing developer, the degraded carrier in the developing device is exchanged to unused carrier in the replenishing developer. As a result, it is possible to keep the charge amount stable for a long period of time, leading to stable image formation. This method is particularly advantageous in printing an image having a large image occupation area. The degradation during printing of the image having a large image occupation area is caused due to degradation of the carrier which is mainly reduction in charging performance of the carrier resulting from toner spent on the carrier. However, with this method, the degraded carrier is exchanged more frequently in printing an image having a large image occupation area, since the amount of the carrier replenished becomes large in this case.","The replenishing developer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, so long as it contains the above toner in an amount of 2 parts by mass to 50 parts by mass per 1 part by mass of the latent electrostatic image developing carrier. The replenishing developer preferably contains the above toner in an amount of 5 parts by mass to 20 parts by mass per 1 part by mass of the latent electrostatic image developing carrier. When the toner is contained in the replenishing developer in an amount of 2 parts by mass or less per 1 part by mass of the latent electrostatic image developing carrier, the amount of the carrier replenished becomes so large that the carrier is excessively supplied. As a result, the concentration of the carrier in the developing device becomes so high that the charge amount of the toner may increase. In addition, when the charge amount of the toner increases, the toner decreases in developing capability to potentially reduce the image density. When the toner is contained in the replenishing developer in an amount of 50 parts by mass or more per 1 part by mass of the latent electrostatic image developing carrier, the amount of the carrier in the replenishing developer becomes small, and the carrier in the image forming apparatus is exchanged less frequently, so that the effects of improving the carrier degradation cannot expected in some cases.","(Process Cartridge)","A process cartridge of the present invention includes; a latent electrostatic image bearing member; and a developing unit configured to develop a latent electrostatic image on the latent electrostatic image bearing member with a developer containing the above-described latent electrostatic image developing carrier of the present invention and a toner, wherein the latent electrostatic image bearing member is supported integrally with the developing unit.","An embodiment of the process cartridge of the present invention will be described with reference to .","As illustrated in , a process cartridge  includes: a latent electrostatic image bearing member ; a charging device  configured to charge the latent electrostatic image bearing member; a developing device  configured to develop a latent electrostatic image on the latent electrostatic image bearing member with the developer of the present invention, to thereby form a toner image; and a cleaning device  configured to remove the toner remaining on the latent electrostatic image bearing member after the toner image has been transferred from the latent electrostatic image bearing member to a recording medium.

electrostatic image developing carriers produced in Examples 1 to 15 were good since these were found to be small in \u0394ID after the printing of 100,000 sheets. Also, the developers containing the latent electrostatic image developing carriers produced in Examples 1 to 15 were found to be smaller in change between the resistance measured before printing (i.e., after printing of 0 sheets) and the resistance measured after the printing of 100,000 sheets and in change between the resistance measured before printing and the resistance measured after the printing of 300,000 sheets. Also in these developers, the amount of spent toner was small and less change in image was observed.","In contrast, the developers containing the latent electrostatic image developing carriers produced in Comparative Examples 2, 3, 4 and 6 were found to be large in \u0394ID after the printing of 100,000 sheets, be greatly affected by hysteresis for the previous image formation, and form visually observed abnormal images. The developer containing the latent electrostatic image developing carrier produced in Comparative Example 5 was found to exhibit a large amount of spent toner, background smear caused by reduction in charge amount, toner scattering in the apparatus, and elevation in image density. The latent electrostatic image developing carriers produced in Comparative Examples 1 and 7 were found to large in change between the resistance measured before printing (i.e., the number of printed sheets: 0) and the resistance measured after the printing of 300,000 sheets, and changes in image quality were observed such as reduction in amount of toner on thin lines and elevation of image density. The latent electrostatic image developing carrier produced in Comparative Example 8 was found to cause carrier deposition so much. As a result, the carrier was scattered and attached onto the image, leading to image failures.","As described above, it is found that the latent electrostatic image developing carriers produced in Examples 1 to 15, even when used continuously for a long period of time, can stably supply a necessary amount of toner to a latent electrostatic image bearing member without being affected by hysteresis, and can prevent an increase in resistance due to deposition of spent toner thereon.","Aspects of the present invention are as follows.","<1> A latent electrostatic image developing carrier including:","core particles each having magnetism;
