No. 10\/028,311, filed Dec. 28, 2001, now abandoned, which claims priority to Japanese Application No. 2000-401236, filed Dec. 28, 2000, the entire content of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in this application.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a game management method of a game server which provides a game for a game apparatus of a player who have logged in through a communication network, or relates to a game apparatus, a game server, a game program, and a storing medium applied to a game utilizing the communication network.","2. Description of the Prior Art","With respect to a multiplayer-participating-type RPG (Role Playing Game) which utilizes internet, Ultima Online provided by Electronic Arts Square is well known. In such the multiplayer-participating-type RPG, a game map and player character data are provided on a game server on the internet, and a virtual space in which his own player character appear is reproduced on a display of a client computer owned by a person who logged in the game server. In the virtual space, another player character is also appearing, and the player character is operated by another client computer. In this manner, since each player character appearing in the virtual space is operated by the client computer, it is possible to enjoy a real maneuvering which could not be experienced with a stand-alone RPG.","In the prior art, however, only the player characters logging-in the game server are appearing in the virtual space. Due to this, in order to play a game with a player character not logging-in the game server, there was a necessity of either selecting a non-real time method such as filling out on a message board provided in the game or utilizing a communication method in a real-space such as making a phone call. Therefore, it was time consuming in starting the game. In addition, in such the game as in the prior art, there were many players who did not wish to be acquainted with an opponent in the real-space even though each player took a role as a friend in the game. Therefore, it was not possible to make a telephone communication with such the player.","It is a fact that one of pleasures in the multiplayer-participating-type game is to be able to meet persons who have a common interest. However, in the prior system, it is only possible to find a new friend out of players logging-in at that time. Of course, it is possible to meet a new person who has a common interest by resorting to such a method as leaving a message on the message board, \u201cThose interested in OOO, come and join me at XX to \u0394\u0394.\u201d In this case, it is not only inflexible because of a need of making an infallible access at an agreed-upon time, but also was there a necessity to allow a plenty of time for the opponent to read the message ever since the message was filled out on the message board. Due to this, there was a problem that it took time until it becomes possible to enjoy a game with an intended opponent.","Therefore, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a novel game management method, a game server, a game apparatus, a game program and storing medium.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a game management method capable of simply and promptly playing a game between a player logging-in a game server and a player not logging-in the game server.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a game server allowing a logging-in player to simply and promptly play a game with non logging-in player.","Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a game apparatus allowing to simply and promptly play a game with a player not logging-in the game server.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a game program capable of simply and promptly playing a game between a player logging-in a game server and a player not logging-in the game server.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a storing medium storing a game program capable of simply and promptly playing a game between a player logging-in a game server and a player not logging-in the game server.","According to the present invention, a game management method of a game server which provides a game for a first game apparatus of a first player who has logged-in through a communication network out of a plurality of players who are previously registered, comprises steps of: (a) transmitting to the first game apparatus player information representing a second player who does not log-in cut of the plurality of players; and (b) transmitting a log-in operation request to a second game apparatus of the second player upon receipt of a first selection signal which represents a selection of the second player from the first game apparatus.","According to the present invention, a game server which provides a game for a first game apparatus of a first player who has logged-in through a communication network out of a plurality of players who are previously registered, comprises: a first transmission means for transmitting to the first game apparatus player information representing a second player who does not log-in out of the plurality of players; and a second transmission means for transmitting a log-in operation request to a second game apparatus of the second player upon receiving from the first game apparatus a selection signal which represents a selection of the second player.","A plurality of players are previously registered on the game server, and the game server provides a game for the first game apparatus of the first player who logged-in through the communication network. At this time, the game server transmits to the first game apparatus the player information representing the second player who has not logged-in, and transmits to the second game apparatus of the second player the log-in operation request when receiving from the first game apparatus a first selection signal which represents a selection of the second player. Due to a fact that the player information is transmitted to the first game apparatus, it is possible to easily identify the second player who does not log-in by the first game apparatus. Herein, if the second player is selected by the first player, the first selection signal is applied to the game server from the first game apparatus, and the log-in operation request is transmitted to the second game apparatus from the game server. That is, the second player is invited from the first player to take part in a game. Therefore, it is possible to simply and promptly play the game between the first player and the second player.","In a certain aspect of the present invention, each player can register in the game server first transmission information which uniformly permits\/prohibits a transmission of the log-in operation request. When the first transmission information of the second player shows a prohibition, the came server sends back a first message to the first game apparatus without transmitting the log-in operation request to the second game apparatus.","In another aspect of the present invention, each player can register in the game server second transmission information which permits\/prohibits a transmission of the log-in operation request depending upon each player. When the second transmission information of the second player shows a prohibition on the first player, the game server sends back the first message to the first came apparatus without transmitting the log-in operation request to the second game apparatus.","In still another aspect of the present invention, the game server sends back the second message to the first game apparatus when a log-in operation denial is sent back from the second game apparatus toward the log-in operation request.","It is noted that it may be possible to include identification information capable of specifying the first player in the log-in operation request.","In yet still another aspect of the present invention, each player can register personal information in the game server. The game server sends back the personal information of the second player to the first game apparatus when receiving from the first game apparatus the second selection signal which represents a selection of the second player.","In another aspect of the present invention, the game server reads from a memory a first character signal representing a first character operated by the first player, a second character signal representing a second character operated by the second player and a third character signal representing a third character operated by a third player who has already logged-in at a time of the first player's logging-in, adds the player information to the second character signal, and transmits to the first game apparatus the first character signal, the second character signal to which the player information is added and the third character signal. The second character is displayed on the first game apparatus in such a manner as to be different from the first character and the third character.","According to the present invention, a game program product allowing a game apparatus operated by a player logging-in a game server through a communication network to execute, comprises steps of: (a) receiving from the game server player information representing a specific player who is previously registered and does not log-in the game server when logging-in the game server; (b) guiding a selection of the specific player based on the player information; (c) requesting the game server to transmit a log-in operation request to the specific player when the specific player is selected; and (d) guiding a log-in operation in receipt of the log-in operation request from the game server while not logging-in the game server.","According to the present invention, a game apparatus operated by a player who logged-in a game server through a communication network, comprises: a player information receiving means for receiving from the game server player information representing a specific player who is previously registered and does not log-in the game server when logging-in the game server and; a first guiding means for guiding a selection of the specific player based on the player information; a requesting means for requesting the game server to transmit a log-in operation request to the specific player when the specific player is selected; and a second guiding means for guiding a log-in operation upon receipt of the log-in operation request from the game server while not logging-in the game server.","According to the present invention, a storing medium storing a game program allowing a game apparatus operated by a player logging-in a game server through a communication network to execute, wherein said game program comprises steps of: (a) receiving from the game server player information representing a specific player who is previously registered and does not log-in the game serve: when logging-in the game server; (b) guiding a selection of the specific player based on the player information; (c) requesting the specific player to transmit a log-in operation request to the game server when the specific player is selected; and (d) guiding a log-in operation upon receipt of the log-in operation request from the game server while not logging-in the game server.","By operating the game apparatus, the player is logged-in the game server through the communication network. Upon logging-in the game server, the player information previously registered and representing a specific player who does not log-in the game server is transmitted from the game server, and the selection of the specific player is guided based upon the player information. If the specific player is selected, a transmission request of the log-in operation request to the specific player is transmitted to the game server. A game apparatus not logging-in the game server guides the log-in operation when receiving the log-in operation request from the game server. That is, when the specific player is selected in the logging-in game apparatus, the log-in operation request is applied to the game apparatus of the specific player. Therefore, it is possible for a player who has logged-in to simply and promptly play a game with a player who does not log-in.","In a certain aspect of the present invention, a character of the specific player is displayed on a game screen based on the player information, and a predetermined operation is guided toward the displayed character. If the predetermined operation is carried out toward such the specific player, a transmission of the log-in operation request is requested to the game server.","In another aspect of the present invention, the log-in operation request includes request source identification information. When guiding the log-in operation, identification information is detected from the log-in operation request, and a guide message specifying the request source is outputted based on the identification information in question.","In still another aspect of the present invention, if a denial operation is carried out toward a guide of the log-in operation, a transmission of denial message information is requested to the game server. When receiving the denial message information from the game server, a denial message is outputted.","The above described objects and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Referring to , a network game system  in this embodiment includes a game server  which is constantly wire-connected to a communication network , and a plurality of portable communication terminals , , . . . which are wireless-connected, if required, to the communication network . When a player already registered in the game server  logs-in the game server  by operating his own portable communication terminal , the game server  provides a game for the portable communication terminal  of the log-in player. By doing this, it becomes possible to play the game among the log-in players.","The game server  is provided with a CPU  and a memory  as shown in , and a program storing area , a geography matrix storing area , a character data storing area and a work area are formed in the memory  as shown in . The program storing area stores a game program, the geography matrix storing area stores matrix data showing a virtual space geography in which the game is played. In addition, the character data storing area stores data (character data) of characters , ,  . . . operated by each player. Furthermore, the work area stores matrix data (character matrix) showing characters appearing in the virtual space and a transmission list which cites a transmission destination of the character matrix.","With respect to the memory , in addition to a storing medium undetachably provided inside an apparatus such as a hard disk or a non-volatile memory (EEPROM, for example), a detachable storing medium such as a magnetooptical disk or a memory card may be used.","The game program stored in the program storing area carries out processes in accordance with flowcharts shown in .","The matrix data stored in the geography matrix storing area is data showing a geography (map) of the entire virtual space. The virtual space is divided into n blocks in either horizontal or vertical direction, and coordinates (X, Y) to (Xn, Yn) are assigned to each block. The geography matrix is illustrated by coordinate data of each block and an identifying number (graphic number) of graphic data to be reproduced in each block.","The character data stored in the character data storing area is formed of an character ID, a name, a mail address, an IP address, personal information, position information, map size information, status information and reception mode information. The character ID is a unique identifier assigned to each character, the name is a unique character name assigned to each character, and each of the mail address and the IP address is a unique address assigned to a player (portable communication terminal ) operating the character. The mail address is used upon transmitting a log-in operation request from the game server  to the portable communication terminal , the IP address is used upon transmitting the map data or the like to the portable communication terminal  which completed the logging-in.","The personal information includes a character's gender, a character's age, a character's occupation, a character's graphic number, a character's own capability, character's belongings (item) and a message sent out by the character to each player. The position information is information showing in what block (coordinate) in the virtual space the character is present, and for what direction the character is headed. The map size information is information to show which size of the virtual space, size  or size , is to be displayed on the player's portable communication terminal , and the status information is information to show which state, log-in or log-out, the player is in.","The reception mode information is information to show from which player a call-out is allowed to receive. In accepting a call-out from any player (neutral reception), \u201cALLOW CALL\u201d is set on a switch , \u201cALLOW ALL CHARACTERS\u201d is set on a switch , and the character list columns become blank. In accepting the call-out from a particular character only (receive the call-out from a friend only), \u201cALLOW CALL\u201d is set on the switch , and \u201cALLOW PARTICULAR CHARACTER ONLY\u201d is set on the switch , and a name of the particular character (friend character) is registered on the character list.","In accepting the call-out from a character other than the particular character (refusing a call from a suspicious character), \u201cALLOW CALL\u201d is set on the switch , \u201callow any character except the particular one\u201d is set on the switch , and a name of the particular character (suspicious character) is registered on the character list. In refusing the call-out from any of these characters. \u201cPROHIBIT CALL\u201d is se: on the switch , and a content of the switch  and the character list become invalid. The game server  determines whether or not to transmit the log-in operation request with referring to the reception mode information when a certain player requests to transmit the log-in operation request to another player.","It is noted that players who wish to participate in the game are required to make an advance registration on the game server , and upon the registration, arbitrary character data is created by the player.","The character matrix stored in the work area is matrix data showing the characters appearing in the virtual space. The character matrix is created with respect to one part of the virtual space which centers on the character of a request source player when a log-in request, a log-out request, a character moving request or the like are applied from the player. The one part of the virtual space is divided into m blocks in either horizontal or vertical direction, coordinates (Xp, Yp) to (Xp+m, Yp+m) are assigned to each block (m<n). Similar to the geography matrix, the character matrix is also illustrated by the coordinate data and the graphic data.","Notwithstanding the same character, a display manner differs if a character's direction is different (facing forward, facing backward, facing to the right, facing to the left). In addition, a character in the middle of logging-out is displayed in a sleeping state in the virtual space. In this manner, since there are a plurality of display manners with respect to characters, in order to identify the display manner, an extension identifier is added to each graphic number. For example, if a character is facing forward, \u201cf\u201d is added, if a character is facing backward, \u201cb\u201d is added, if a character is facing to the right, \u201cr\u201d is added, if a character is facing to the left, \u201cl\u201d is added, and if a character is in a sleeping state, \u201cs\u201d is added. It is noted that the coordinate and the direction of each character are specified by the position information, and log-in\/log-out is specified by the status information.","The transmission list stored in the work area is a list which cites players to whom the map data formed of the geography matrix and the character matrix are to be transmitted. The portable communication terminal  which requires to renew the virtual space is different according to a size (map size) of the virtual space to be displayed and a relative position between a character of a player who transmitted the log-in request, the log-out request, the moving request and etc. and another character. Due to this, players who require to renew the virtual space are cited on the transmission list based on the position information of each character and the map size information.","From the geography matrix area and the work area , one part of the geography matrix and one part of the character matrix which center on the character or each cited player are carved out, and the carved-out geography matrix and the character matrix are transmitted to the each player's portable communication terminal  as the map data.","The portable communication terminal  includes a main body  formed in a thin long elliptical manner as shown in . An antenna  is protruded on an upper surface of the main body , and a communication-use speaker , a display , a game key , telephone key  and a communication-use microphone  are arranged at a front surface. With respect to the game key , an A button and a B button to control his own character's behavior, a menu screen display, a menu item selection or the like and a cross key in order to move his own character and a cursor on the menu screen are present. With respect to the telephone key , a hook key , a hold key , a number key showing \u201c0\u201d to \u201c9\u201d, a key , a # key , a manner key and a voice memory key are present. It is noted that alphabet, Japanese syllabary characters or hiragana in Japanese and etc. are assigned to the number key , the *key and the # key . Therefore, it becomes possible to create mail.","An inner portion of the main body  is constituted as shown in . The antenna  is connected to a communication circuit , and the communication-use speaker  and the communication-use microphone  are connected to an audio conversion circuit . The communication circuit  and the audio conversion circuit  are connected to each other, and respectively controlled by the CPU . To the CPU , the game key , the telephone key , the display , a vibration motor , a call-use speaker  and a non-volatile memory  such as EEPROM are connected. The vibration motor  vibrates the main body  upon receiving the mail or a call signal, and the call-use speaker  outputs a beep sound upon receiving the mail or the call signal. It is noted that the call-use speaker  is provided at a rear side of the main body .","In the memory , a program storing area , a graphic data storing area , a work area and a display area are formed as shown in . The program storing area stores a game program received from the game server  when the player registers the character data. The graphic data storing area stores the graphic data received from the game server  at a time of logging-in. The work area stores the map data received in the middle of logging-in from the game server , the reception mode information set by the player himself, and the friend character list. The reception mode information and the friend character list are transferred from the program storing area to the work area at a time of logging-in, and transferred from the work area to the program storing area at a time of logging-out.","Although it is necessary that the program storing area is formed on a non-volatile memory, the graphic data storing area , the work area and the display area may be formed on a volatile RAM. In addition, although the graphic data may be received together with the game program upon registering to the game server , in this case, it is necessary that the graphic data storing area is formed on a non-volatile memory.","The game program stored in the program storing area carries out processes according to flowcharts shown in .","The game program stored in the graphic data storing area includes image data of objects forming the virtual space such as \u201ctree\u201d, \u201crock\u201d, \u201clawn\u201d and image data of the characters appearing in the virtual space, and different graphic numbers are respectively assigned to each image data. With respect to the character, as described above, there are five states, that is, facing-forward, facing-backward, facing-to-the-right, facing-to-the-left, and in the middle of sleeping. Image data showing each state is prepared in the graphic data storing area . Although a common graphic number is assigned to each image data, an extension identifier added to the graphic number is respectively different.","The map data stored in the work area is formed of the geography matrix of the virtual space (size  or size  virtual space) to be reproduced on the display  and the character matrix. As shown in , the geography matrix is formed of coordinates (X, Y) to (Xs, Ys) of blocks forming the virtual space and the graphic numbers of the geography to be reproduced in each block, and the character matrix is also formed of coordinates (X, Y) to (Xs, Ys) of blocks forming the virtual space and the graphic number of the characters to be reproduced in each block. In a case of the size  virtual space, the number of horizontal blocks and the number of vertical blocks are, for example, \u201c9\u201d (s=9), and in a case of the size  virtual space, the number of horizontal blocks and the number of vertical blocks are, for example, \u201c5\u201d (s=5). It is noted that with respect to either size  or size , s<m is applied.","Based on such the map data and the graphic data of the graphic data storing area , virtual space data (game screen data) of size  or size  shown in  is created. The created virtual space data is stored in the display area , and the virtual space (game screen) based thereon is displayed on the display . According to , the geography is expressed by \u201crock\u201d, \u201ctree\u201d, \u201cstone pavement\u201d and etc., and characters such as \u201cclown\u201d, \u201cwizard\u201d, \u201cmountain man\u201d and etc. appear on such the geography. Characters in the middle of logging-in stand up and walk around in the virtual space. On the other hand, characters in the middle of logging-out are sleeping in a place where he was present immediately before the log-out. That is, in this embodiment, all the characters registered in the game server  are reproduced in the virtual space no matter whether or not the player logs-into the game server .","Returning to , the reception mode information stored in the work area is different from the reception mode information forming the character data on a game server  side in that the former has the switch  and  only. However, the acquaintance character list is stored other than the reception mode information, and a sub list of \u201cFRIEND CHARACTER\u201d, \u201cNEUTRAL CHARACTER\u201d and \u201cSUSPICIOUS CHARACTER\u201d are formed onto the acquaintance character list. Meanings which switch , switch , friend character, neutral character, and suspicious character carry is same on either the game server  side or the portable communication terminal  side.","On the display  of the portable communication terminal  in the middle of logging-out, a start menu screen shown in  is displayed, and if \u201cGAME\u201d is herein selected, the start menu screen is renewed to a game menu screen shown in . According to the , a title \u201cOnline Game\u201d is displayed at an upper side of the screen, and a menu item of \u201cSTART GAME\u201d and \u201cCHANGE RECEPTION MODE\u201d, and a cursor pointing at either menu item is displayed at a lower side of the screen. If a player selects \u201cSTART GAME\u201d by the cross key and the A button , a log-in request is transmitted from the portable communication terminal  to the game server . The game server  detects character data of the player who transmitted the log-in request from the character data storing area shown in , and renews the status information included in the detected character data from \u201clog out\u201d to \u201clog in\u201d.","Furthermore, based on the position information, the map size information and the status information included in each character data, players who need to renew the screen as a result of the present log-in are brought onto the transmission list , and the map data is respectively created with respect to the players brought onto the list. The created map data is transmitted to the portable communication terminal  of each player brought onto the list. The portable communication terminal  which received the map data displays a game screen on the display  based on this map data. The display of the portable communication terminal  which logged in this time is renewed from the game menu screen shown in  to a game screen shown in . In the portable communication terminal  which already logged in, a character in the middle of sleeping displayed on the game screen stands up.","If a player who logged in operates the cross key , a moving request is transmitted to the game server . The game server , upon being given the moving request, detects the character data of a request source player from the character data storing area , and renews the position information included in the detected character data. Furthermore, as described above, players who need to renew the game screen are brought onto a list, map data differing depending on each player brought onto the list is created, and the created map data is transmitted to the portable communication terminal  of each player. Due to this, the display  of the portable communication terminal  which received the map data is renewed based on this map data. That is, the character of the player who operated the cross key moves on the game screen of each portable communication terminal  which received the map data.","If the player moves his own character in front of another character, and operates the A button , an action menu screen having two menu items of \u201cSEARCH\u201d and \u201cWAKE-UP\u201d as shown in  is displayed at an upper right of the screen in an OSD manner. Herein, if the player selects \u201cSEARCH\u201d by operating the cross key and the A button , \u201cSEARCH\u201d information is transmitted to the game server . The game server  detects character data of a player who transmitted the \u201cSEARCH\u201d information from the character data storing area shown in , and specifies the character data of an opponent to be searched (a character present in front) based on the position information (coordinate and direction) included in the detected character data and the position information (coordinate) included in another character data. Furthermore, the game server  sends back personal information included in the specified character data to the \u201cSEARCH\u201d information transmission source. The portable communication terminal  which received the character name and the personal information registers the character name onto a sub list of \u201cNEUTRAL CHARACTER\u201d shown in  first, and then displays the personal information as shown in  on the display .","According to , a character image is displayed at an upper left of the screen, a character's name, occupation, gender and age are displayed on a right side of the character image, and a message is displayed at a lower side of the screen. The character image is created based on the graphic number included in the personal information and the graphic data stored in the graphic data storing area shown in . In addition, among the personal information received, capability and belongings are not displayed.","If \u201cWAKE-UP\u201d is selected on the action menu screen shown in , the \u201cWAKE-UP\u201d information is transmitted from the portable communication terminal  to the game server . The game server  detects from the character data storing area shown in  the character data of the player who transmitted the \u201cWAKE-UP\u201d information, and specifies the character data of an opponent to be awaken (character present in front) based on the position information included in the detected character data and the position information included in another character data. Furthermore, the game server  determines reception mode information included in the specified character data.","Herein, if a content of the switch  is \u201cPROHIBIT CALL\u201d, information A is sent back to the \u201cWAKE-UP\u201d information transmission source. On the display  of the portable communication terminal  in receipt of the information A, a message that says \u201cSLEEP WELL, NO SIGN OF WAKING UP\u201d is displayed as shown in .

Due to this, the center coordinate and the size of the character matrix are determined as shown in .","Once the center coordinate and the size of the character matrix are determined, a character number i is set to \u201c1\u201d in a step S, and the position information is detected from the character data of the character i (specified from the character data storing area ) in a step S. In a step S, it is determined whether or not the character i is included within a range of the character matrix based on the position information detected in the step S, if it is determined NO, then the process directly proceeds to a step S. On the other hand, if it is determined YES in the step S, the status information and the graphic number are detected from the character data of the character i in a step S, the graphic number is mapped to the character matrix in a step S, and then the process proceeds to the step S. In the step S, more specifically, an extension identifier determined based on the position information (direction of the character i) and the status information are added to the graphic number, and the graphic number to which the extension identifier is added is mapped to the character matrix according to the position information (coordinate of the character i) detected in the step S.","The character number i is incremented in the step S, and the incremented character number i is compared with a maximum character number imax in a subsequent step S.

That is, the character ID of the character n is unconditionally added onto the transmission list.","In the meantime, if NO is determined in the steps S, the status information is detected from the character data of the character i (stored in the character data storing area ) in the step S, and in a step S, it is determined in which state, log-in state or log-out state, the character i is. If the log-out state is determined, the process proceeds to a step S without carrying out a transmission list addition process. In contrast, if the log-in state is determined, the man size information is detected from the character data of the character i in a step S, and it is determined whether or not the character n is present within a visual range of the character i in a step S. More specifically, it is determined whether or not the coordinate of the character n is present within a map size range of the character i based on the map size information and the position information of the detected character i.
