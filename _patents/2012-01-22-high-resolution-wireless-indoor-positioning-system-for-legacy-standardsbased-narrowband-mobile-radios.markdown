title: High resolution wireless indoor positioning system for legacy standards-based narrowband mobile radios
abstract: Two or more data packets transmitted through a wireless channel are received using a receiver device. The two or more data packets are a result of two or more transmissions that are made sequentially in time at different center frequencies in order to span a desired bandwidth. Each data packet of the two or more data packets is transmitted at a single center frequency. Time differences and/or carrier phase differences among the two or more transmissions are estimated. A time-of-arrival of one or more data packets of the two or more data packets is calculated using each data packet of the two or more data packets and one or more of the estimated time differences, the different center frequencies, and the estimated carrier phase differences.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","INTRODUCTION","DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/286,649, filed Nov. 1, 2011 (the \u201c'649 application\u201d) and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/435,269 filed Jan. 22, 2011. The '649 application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/409,123 filed Nov. 2, 2010 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/421,641 filed Dec. 10, 2010. All of the above mentioned applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","The '649 application describes a method for high-resolution channel sounding that can be used to combat multipath in indoor wireless time-of-flight-based positioning systems. Using this technique, referred to herein as Time-Frequency Offset Wideband (TF-WB) signaling, a transmitter device sends a sequence of narrowband packets to a receiver device at different times and frequencies in order to span a desired bandwidth, where it is assumed that the time, frequency and carrier phase differences among the signal transmissions are known to the receiver. The receiver listens for the transmissions at the known times and frequencies while digitizing and storing them for post-processing, then uses the stored receive signals and the known time, frequency and carrier phase differences to obtain a high-resolution time-of-arrival estimate of the received signals at its antenna.","Although it enjoys significant advantages over state-of-the-art wideband and ultra-wideband signaling systems, the technique described in the '649 application requires both transmit and receive devices to have knowledge of TF-WB and to collaborate in order to make it work. Since there are literally billions of wireless devices shipped each year, there is a clear motivation to require only one side of the link\u2014the network side\u2014to have this knowledge.","Before one or more embodiments of the present teachings are described in detail, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the present teachings are not limited in their application to the details of construction, the arrangements of components, and the arrangement of steps set forth in the following detailed description or illustrated in the drawings. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.","Time\/frequency offset wideband (TF-WB) signaling is described in the '649 application, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. TF-WB is a technique that allows the time-of-arrival (ToA) of multiple narrowband signals sent sequentially in time and at different center frequencies to be calculated with the same accuracy as a wideband signal spanning the same bandwidth. Although there are other known protocols such as Multi-band OFDM (also referred to as MB-OFDM or ECMA-368, an ultra-wideband or UWB standard) that use a similar means of generating wideband signals to facilitate high-resolution ToA estimates, a key advantage TF-WB provides over such techniques is that TF-WB is designed specifically to be used with pre-existing wireless standards such as IEEE 802.11\/WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM\/GPRS\/EDGE, CDMA, etc. Techniques like those prescribed by MB-OFDM, on the other hand, require very specific changes to the physical layer representation of each data packet and as such cannot be applied more generally to other wireless standards. These conceptual differences are illustrated in , which show the physical layer characteristics of MB-OFDM and TF-WB, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["120","140","115","110","130","140","115"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["210","130","220","140"]},"In summary, unlike other known methods of transmitting multiple narrowband signals sequentially in time and at different center frequencies to improve TOA accuracy, TF-WB allows data packets to be transmitted at fixed center frequencies and with arbitrary time and carrier phase offsets. These key differences come from its being designed specifically to facilitate high-resolution TOA measurements using pre-existing wireless protocols.","In various embodiments, legacy time\/frequency offset wideband (LTF-WB) signaling allows a network of wireless receivers to locate a mobile transmitter using TF-WB signaling techniques without requiring the mobile to know anything about TF-WB, or even that it's being located. LTF-WB allows, for example, a network of LTF-WB-capable IEEE 802.11 WiFi Access Points to locate any WiFi mobile device\u2014even if it doesn't support TF-WB per se.","While the techniques described herein can be applied to a broad class of wireless protocols (including cellular, 3G, WiMax, etc), the following examples relate to the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (WiFi) standard.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","20","30","40","20"]},"SE devices , typically the size of a WiFi Access Point (AP), are placed in various known positions in an indoor environment such as a hospital, retail store or a shopping mall.

For example, the operating system used on Google Android smartphones provides a function in its application programming interface (API) which when executed, causes the smartphone to perform an 802.11 Active Scan, sending 802.11 Probe Request messages on each of its supported RF frequencies in sequence. This, for example, would allow a programmer to write a Google Android application that can generate LTF-WB sequences by doing 802.11 Active Scans on command from the network. Unlike spoofing, this would obviously require a modification to the client device to support this new functionality, but the change is only in software; no hardware changes to the client are necessary. Note however that without hardware changes on the client side, the time offsets and carrier phase differences between the narrowband transmissions will not generally be available to the client software, and so will have to be estimated by the LTF-WB-enabled receiver on the network side in order to estimate the TOA of the received sequence.","Receiver Calibration","Most digital receivers use some sort of automatic gain control (AGC) to adjust their received signal level entering the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The gain control circuit is often implemented as a set of variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) in series that can be either switched on and off depending on the value of an input gain control word. When a VGA stage is turned on vs. off, it can create a carrier phase and\/or group delay change. If the receiver changes its AGC setting to receive the narrowband transmissions at different frequencies, the phase shifts and group delay changes will create distortion in the received waveforms.","Fortunately, these phase and group delay vs. Rx gain variations don't change much across time and temperature, so they can be calibrated (i.e., measured at the time of manufacturing), stored in a table, and compensated for during data digitization and data storage.","LTF-WB Receiver System","Referring to , a system for calculating the time-of-arrival of a wireless signal through a wireless channel includes receiver device .
