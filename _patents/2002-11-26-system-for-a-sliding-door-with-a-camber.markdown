{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to slide assemblies for use with a pocket door of a furniture piece and, more particularly, to cambered slide assemblies for preventing the doors from sagging and ensures smooth operation of the pocket doors.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Some furniture pieces for use in the office and home have doors for closing open fronts. Typically, these doors are hinged at one side that is adjacent to the sidewall of the furniture piece and swing towards the front in an open position. Very often the hinge arrangement provides an open door that extends well beyond the furniture piece. Consequently, to eliminate the problem of the open door getting in the way when space may be limited, furniture pieces today are designed with pocket door assemblies. The pocket door assembly permits the doors to be slid out and closed. When in the open position the doors are slid back within the recess of the furniture piece opening thereby reducing space requirements for the furniture piece.","An example of a furniture piece is an entertainment center. Such centers have been getting larger with the advent of television sets that in recent years have been getting much bigger. In addition to the television sets, entertainment centers may accommodate VCR, CD, DVD players, stereo receivers, speakers and other electronic equipment that is generally found in an entertainment center.","The sliding pocket door has application, as well, in cabinets of all types, such as armoires, kitchen cabinets and other furniture items for use both in the office and home environment. These furniture pieces are generally finished furniture pieces with paint or varnished finishes.","Many different assembly mechanisms have been utilized in the past for the installation of pocket doors in furniture pieces. One is a cabinet with pocket doors in an assembly comprising a vertical carrier hingibly connecting a door and slidably mounted to upper and lower rails mounted to the cabinet sidewalls. After the door has been placed in the open position, it can be easily moved rearward with the carrier in the cabinet.","Another mechanism is a scissors mechanism mounted between the cabinet back wall and the rear edge of the door.","Yet another mechanism includes tracks mounted to the cabinet sidewall. A pair of pulleys is mounted below the rear portion of the upper track and above the front portion of the lower track. A cable is threaded around the pulleys with first and second ends attached to the door.","Another mechanism includes tracks containing a slide assembly with ball bearings between the slide assembly and an alignment element which is connected to the pair of slides within the track. The door is then affixed to the mounting plates on the slides and can move from the open to closed position and the closed to open position. Generally these assemblies are built to provide the appropriate installation distance for the slides. However, the weight of the door acting on the slide assembly causes the door to sag.","Arrangements for compensating for the sag of a door using a slide assembly are known in the art. However, these methods require a skilled installer to properly install the door in a proper position. It would be desirable to have an assembly that does not require skilled installers, especially on a furniture assembly line. In addition, it would be desirable to have a slide assembly that reduces the inventory that a manufacturer must maintain. Such a slide assembly would also be advantageous for use by the \u201cdo it yourselfers.\u201d That is, the ease of installation would make elaborate instructions regarding the appropriate installation of the slide assembly on the pair of doors unnecessary.","Thus, there remains a need for a new and improved slide assembly with a camber that is sufficient to compensate for any sag of the door regardless of door weight. Further, a slide assembly having a universal camber would be easy to install while at the same time not requiring elaborate installation instructions.","The present invention is directed to a slide assembly to support a door mounted in a furniture piece. The slide assembly includes a pair of cambered slides and an alignment element. The pair of slides is for slidably mounting the door. The alignment element is for aligning the movement of the pair of slides. The camber is for compensating for the weight of the door to maintain the movement of the door substantially true relative to the furniture piece. Preferably, the pair of cambered slides is universally cambered. The universal camber is for permitting one design to be used without having to be concerned about the handedness of the cambered slide assembly.","The furniture piece may be any one of fixed and movable. Examples of furniture pieces include a case good for providing interior storage space such as any one of a bookcase and a chest of drawers. Examples of fixed furniture pieces include a cabinet such as a kitchen cabinet. Other examples of furniture pieces include an armoire and an entertainment unit. The furniture piece may further include any one of framing and pilaster at an opening at which the door is both hingibly and slidably mounted.","Each slide of the pair of slides may be of a type that permits the door to be both hingibly and slidably mounted. One example of such a slide is a roller type slide. Another example of such a slide is a ball bearing type slide. A ball bearing type slide may include about 2 to 4 ball bearings per inch, preferably about 3 ball bearings per inch.","The slide assembly may further include a mounting plate or pair of mounting plates in contacting communication with each slide of the pair of slides. The slide assembly may further include an alignment element in contacting communication with each slide of the pair of slides. The alignment element may be as simple as a bar extending between the pair of slides. Such a bar may be any one of a flat stock and u-shaped channel and conceivably made of metal. The flat stock and u-shaped channel may be extruded. Preferably, the flat stock is extruded. Applicants have found that a flatness tolerance for the length of the alignment element of about 1\/32 of an inch for up to and including about 120 inches, preferably, about 1\/32 of an inch for up to and including about 240 inches to work well. The alignment element may be used to define the center-to-center distance between any one of a pair of hinges and the pair of slides.","The camber of the slide assembly is obtained by preselecting an offset in an attachment of each slide of the pair of slides at opposite ends of said alignment element. The preselected offset is determined by the weight of said door. The preselected offset is between about 0.005 to 0.02 inch. Such an offset creates a camber for the pair of slides of between about 0.005 to 0.02 inch\/inch (between about 0.286 to 1.146 degrees).","The slide assembly may further include a pair of hinges for providing communication between the door and the slide assembly. The pair of hinges may be any one of a pair of high strength hinges and a pair of concealed hinges. The concealed hinges may be any one of concealed frameless hinges and concealed frame hinges. A specific example of concealed hinges is one of a geometric hinge. The slide assembly may be mounted so that the door has a horizontal pivot. Alternatively, the slide assembly may be mounted so that the door has a vertical pivot.","The sliding pocket door assembly further may include a hinge mounting plate. The hinge mounting plate may be any one of fixed and adjustable. The adjustable mounting plate may be slotted to provide for slidable adjustments.","The slide assembly may further include a spacer block for both hingibly and slidably mounting the door in a prescribed offset. The space is preferably a spacer block. The spacer block may be between about 0.5 and 2 inches thick. The material used for the space block is one that, among other things, may be receptive to accepting a fastener. To that end, the spacer block may be one of a wood and a polymer. Examples of some useful polymers include any one of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a polyamide, a high density polyethylene (HDPE) and a high impact styrene). Preferred polymers include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and a polyamide.","The spacer is preferably a spacer block. Such a spacer block may further include a peripheral wall. Further, a support rib may be included within the peripheral wall. The support rib within the peripheral wall may be a plurality of support ribs. The spacer block further may include a thickened section in the peripheral wall. The thickened section in the peripheral wall may be a plurality of thickened sections. At locations of contacting communication between the peripheral wall and the support rib, the spacer block further may include rounded corners. Also at locations of contacting communication between any one of the peripheral wall and the plurality of support ribs and the plurality of support ribs wherein the spacer block further may include rounded corners. The spacer block further may includes pilot holes for accepting fasteners. Such pilot holes may be in one or more of the thickened section of the peripheral wall. The spacer may be manufactured by any appropriate means such as machining and the like. Injection molding appears to be a preferred manufacturing approach.","Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is to provide a slide assembly for use in a furniture piece with a door. The slide assembly includes a pair of cambered slides and an alignment element. The pair of slides is for slidably mounting the door. The alignment element is for aligning the movement of the pair of slides. The camber is for compensating for the weight of the door to maintain the movement of the door substantially true relative to the furniture piece.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a slide assembly for use in a furniture piece with a door. The slide assembly includes a pair of universally cambered slides and an alignment element. The pair of slides is for slidably mounting the door. The alignment element is for aligning the movement of the pair of slides. The universal camber is for compensating for the weight of the door to maintain the movement of the door substantially true relative to the furniture piece while at the same time permitting one design to be used without having to be concerned about the handedness of the slide assembly.","Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a slide assembly to support a door mounted in a furniture piece.
