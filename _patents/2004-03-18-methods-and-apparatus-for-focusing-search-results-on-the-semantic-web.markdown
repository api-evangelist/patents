title: Methods and apparatus for focusing search results on the semantic web
abstract: Methods and apparatus for searching Semantic Web structured resources and presenting the search results to a user can increase the likelihood that the search can produce meaningful results. An index database can be constructed by parsing literal values from statements from the resources to obtain component words of the literal values, with the index relating the component words to the statements from which they were parsed. A search engine can obtain component words from the database that match search terms in a query prepared by the user and can obtain the related statements for the matching words. A servlet or other application using the search engine and database can obtain predicates, instances, types of said instances, and full literal values of said instances for the related statements. The search results can be presented to the user as a summary of the predicates, instances, types, and full literal values.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority to, and incorporates by reference, the entire disclosure of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/465,925, filed on Apr. 28, 2003. This application is co-pending with a related patent application entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Representing, Using and Displaying Time-Varying Information on the Semantic Web\u201d 10\/806,406, by the same inventor and having assignee in common, filed concurrently herewith and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","This disclosed methods and systems were developed pursuant to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contract number F30602-00-C-0178. The U.S. Government may have rights in the disclosed methods and systems.","The methods and apparatus relate to web searches, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for using the structure of information in the Semantic Web to increase the likelihood that a search produces meaningful results.","The Semantic Web is an evolving collection of knowledge, which provides information on the Internet, or World Wide Web in such a way that it can be readily used by intelligent agents and other computer programs. Information on the Semantic Web, rather than being in natural language text, can be maintained in a structured that both computers and people can work with. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) underlies most Semantic Web efforts. RDF consists of statements (subject\/predicate\/object triples) made about instances of specific classes (similar to an object-oriented programming language).","The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general framework for how to describe an Internet resource such as a Web site and its content. An Internet resource is defined herein as a resource with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), including the Uniform Resource Locators (URL) that identify Web sites as well as specific Web pages. As with known HyperText Markup Language (HTML) META tags, the RDF description statements, encased as part of an Extensible Markup Language (XML) section, can be included within a Web page (HTML file), or can be in separate files.","In performing Web searches, users can input a word or short phrase to a search engine and obtain listing of sites containing the words, or phrase, or portions thereof. The listings can include titles and portions of text from the Web sites containing the search term(s). The titles and text portions provide the user with limited insight into the contextual framework of the Web sites in the listings. Further, the listings generally do not group the results in terms of context. In order to find those sites having meaningful results within the user's context the user can scan multiple pages of listings based only on the titles and short snippets of text from the sites. Current search engines also do not take advantage of the rich contextual information provided by RDF statements of Semantic Web sites.","Methods and apparatus for searching Semantic Web structured resources and presenting the search results to a user can increase the likelihood that the search can produce meaningful results. A database can be constructed in the form of an index by parsing literal values from statements about resources to obtain component words of the literal values, with the index relating the component words to the statements from which they were parsed. A search engine can obtain component words from the database that match search terms in a query prepared by the user and can obtain the related statements for the matching words from the index. A servlet or other application can obtain predicates, instances, types of said instances, and full literal values of said instances for the related statements. The search results can be presented to the user as a summary of the predicates, instances, types, and full literal values.","In one embodiment, a method of obtaining search results can include parsing statements from at least one Semantic Web structured resource to identify component words, constructing an index from the component words, wherein the index relates the component words to the statements from which they were parsed, comparing the component words to a search term so as to identify matching words, identifying the statements related to the matching words based on the index, obtaining the predicates, instances, types of said instances, and full literal values of said instances for the related statements, and summarizing the results for presentation to a user.","The summaries can include counts and listings of the types, instances and values. The predicates, instances, types, and values can be arranged into graphical representations and grouped according to types and\/or values. A web crawler or agent can identify Semantic Web structured resources on the network and gather statements from the identified resources. The gathered statements can be parsed to obtain their component words and the index can be constructed and\/or updated based on the parsed gathered statements. The agent can iteratively identify resources and gather statements for parsing for updating the index.","In one embodiment, computer-readable medium can contain instructions for controlling a processor to construct a database by having a software agent visit sites on a network to identify Semantic Web structured resources and gather statements from the Semantic Web structured resources. The instructions can include instructions for parsing the statements to identify component words, constructing an index from the component words, which relates the component words to the statements, storing the index in a database on the computer-readable medium, and updating the database by iteratively performing the aforementioned visiting, gathering, parsing, constructing, and storing.","The computer-readable medium can include instructions for controlling the processor to obtain search results for a search query using the database by obtaining predicates, instances, types of instances, and literal values of the statements related to search terms of the query by the index, and summarizing the predicates, instances, types, and literal values for presentation to a user as the search results. The instructions can include instructions for controlling the processor to display the search results by arranging the predicates, instances, types, and literal values into one or more graphical representations, and grouping the graphical representations according to the types and\/or the literal values.","In one embodiment, a system for obtaining search results for a query prepared by a user can include at least one parser for receiving statements from Semantic Web structured resources and identifying component words of the statements, a processor for constructing an index relating the component words to the statements from which they were parsed, a database for storing the index, a search engine for matching search terms of the query to the component words and identifying statements related to the matched words, a servlet for obtaining predicates, instances, types of instances, and full literal values of the instances for the identified statements, and an object viewer for summarizing the results for presentation to the user.","The object viewer can include means for arranging the predicates, instances, types, and literal values into one or more graphical representations, and means for grouping the graphical representations according to the types and\/or the literal values. The system can include means for identifying Semantic Web structured resources to obtain identified Semantic Web structured resources, means for gathering statements from the identified Semantic Web structured resources to obtain gathered statements, means for presenting the gathered statements for parsing of the gathered statements, means for iteratively invoking the means for identifying, the means for gathering and the means for presenting, wherein the processor includes means for updating the index based on the parsing of the gathered statements.","In one embodiment, a computer program, disposed on a computer readable medium, can enable searching of and presentation of search results from Semantic Web structured resources. The computer program can include instructions for causing a processor to parse statements from at least one Semantic Web structured resource to identify component words, construct an index from the component words, wherein the index relates the component words to the statements from which they were parsed, compare the component words to a search term to identify matching words, identify related ones of the statements for the matching words based on the index, obtain predicates, instances, types of said instances, and values of said instances for the related statements, and summarize the predicates, instances, types, and full literal values for presentation to a user.","The computer program can include instructions to identify Semantic Web structured resources to obtain identified Semantic Web structured resources, gather statements from the identified Semantic Web structured resources to obtain gathered statements, present the gathered statements for parsing of the gathered statements, update the index based on the parsing of the gathered statements, and iteratively identify, gather and present. The instructions for causing a processor to summarize can include instructions to arrange the predicates, instances, types, and literal values into one or more graphical representations, and to group the graphical representations according to the types and\/or the literal values.","To provide an overall understanding, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described; however, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems and methods described herein can be adapted and modified to provide systems and methods for other suitable applications and that other additions and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the systems and methods described herein.","Unless otherwise specified, the illustrated embodiments can be understood as providing exemplary features of varying detail of certain embodiments, and therefore, unless otherwise specified, features, components, modules, and\/or aspects of the illustrations can be otherwise combined, separated, interchanged, and\/or rearranged without departing from the disclosed systems or methods. Additionally, the shapes and sizes of components are also exemplary and unless otherwise specified, can be altered without affecting the disclosed systems or methods.","Referring to , the system  can access one or more Semantic Web resources  of the World Wide Web (WWW) , or other network-accessible information on a network such as the Internet. The resources  can include bodies of knowledge structured in accordance with the Resource Definition Framework (RDF) of the Semantic Web. Resources can include Web pages, part of a Web page, e.g. a specific HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or eXtensible Markup Language (XML) element within a source, a collection of pages, a Web site, or other RDF structured object. Parser  of system  can parse the RDF statements in the resources  and tokenize the literal values or words of the RDF statements. Database  can include an index from the tokenized words to the statements in which they appear. Parser  can include processor for constructing and storing the index in database .","The user  can construct a search for one or more selected words, or search terms in the manner known for construction of searches on WWW . The user  can provide the search terms to servlet , which uses search engine  to locate the search words, or terms in the index of database  and identify the RDF statements in which the word(s) occurs. In one embodiment, database  can be a Statement Database and system  can include a Word Database (shown in phantom) used by search engine . If a search involves multiple words, the results for the multiple words can be merged. Search servlet  can identify: the predicates, or named properties used in the statements, e.g. name, label, place, etc.; the instances, or subjects of the statements, e.g. the specific resources for the statements; and the types of the instances, or values of the properties. The value or object of a statement can be another resource or a literal value.","The search results can be summarized by search servlet , including summaries of the identified predicates, instances and types which can be presented to user  at user interface . User interface  can include a web browser running on a processor, such as a personal computer for use in accessing WWW . The summaries can include counts of the number of results for the various predicates, literal values matched, type specific information and\/or relevance rankings. As an example, a search for the string \u201cColumbia\u201d using resources such as an online US Atlas, a space exploration web site and an online genealogical database can result in four instances of type City with predicate of name, one instance of type StateOrTerritory with predicate of name, one instance of type River with predicate of name, one instance of type SpaceShuttle with predicate of name and 10 instances of type BirthEvent with predicate of place.

Known search engines can include web crawlers that can visit WWW  sites for creating entries for the search engine index. Typically however, the entries can be text based. The method  can start () with agents  of system , shown in , visiting () web sites. Agents  can include autonomous programs acting on behalf of user . Unlike the text-based entries from known web crawlers, agents  can include instructions for identifying () Semantic Web sites or resources  and for gathering () from the resources  bodies of statements to be used in searching. Agents  can present () the statements to parsers  and parsers  can tokenize () the literal values to identify their component words, as previously described.","Method  can construct and\/or modify () the index for database  based on the statements obtained by agents . It can be understood that in constructing the index, the processors of parsers  can discard articles, such as \u201cthe\u201d, \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d, and other noise words and short numbers in the manner of known methods for constructing such indices. It can also be understood that agents  can periodically or continuously visit Semantic Web sites, gather statements and provide the statements to parsers , as shown by loop , such that parsers  can maintain database  updated.
