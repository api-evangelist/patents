Application No. PCT\/US2004\/23334, filed Jul. 20, 2004, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/489,693, filed Jul. 24, 2003.","The instant invention involves compounds that inhibit 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), compositions containing such compounds and methods of treatment using such compounds for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and related diseases and conditions.","Inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis has been an active area of pharmaceutical research for many years. Leukotrienes are potent contractile and inflammatory mediators derived through the oxygenation of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase.","One class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors are those known to act through inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). In general, 5-LO inhibitors have been sought for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma and inflammatory conditions including arthritis. One example of a 5-LO inhibitor is the marketed drug zileuton, which is indicated for the treatment of asthma. More recently, it has been reported that 5-LO may be an important contributor to the atherogenic process; see Mehrabian, M. et al., Circulation Research, 2002 Jul. 26, 91(2):120-126.","A new class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors (now known as FLAP inhibitors) distinct from 5-LO inhibitors is described in Miller, D. K. et al., Nature, vol. 343, No. 6255, pp. 278-281, 18 Jan. 1990. These compounds inhibit the formation of cellular leukotrienes but have no direct effect on soluble 5-LO activity. These compounds were used to identify and isolate the inner nuclear membrane 18,000 dalton protein 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). In cells, arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by the action of cytosolic phospholipase 2. This arachidonic acid is transferred to nuclear membrane bound 5-lipoxygenase by FLAP. The presence of FLAP in cells is essential for the synthesis of leukotrienes. Additionally, based on studies described in Helgadottir, A., et al., Nature Genetics, vol 36, no. 3 (March 2004) 233-239, it is believed that the gene encoding 5-lipoxygenase activating protein confers risk for myocardial infarction and stroke in humans.","Despite significant therapeutic advances in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events, such as the improvements that have been achieved with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, further treatment options are clearly needed. The instant invention addresses that need by providing compounds, compositions and methods for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis as well as related conditions.","The instant invention relates to compounds of formula I which are FLAP inhibitors, methods for their preparation, and methods and pharmaceutical formulations for using these compounds in mammals, especially humans.

(1999), \u201cMK-591 acutely restores glomerular size selectivity and reduces proteinuria in human glomerulonephritis,\u201d Kidney Int., 56:261-267); and also for and prevention, amelioration and treatment of kidney damage resulting from diabetes complications (see Valdivielso J M, Montero A., Badr K F., Munger K A. (2003), \u201cInhibition of FLAP decreases proteinuria in diabetic rats,\u201d J. Nephrol., 16(1):85-940.)","In addition, the compounds of this invention can also be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As described in S. Kilfeather, Chest, 2002, vol 121, 197, airway neutrophilia in COPD patients is believed to be a contributing source of inflammation and is associated with airway remodeling. The presence of neutrophils is mediated in part by LTB, and treatment with the instant compounds could be used to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in patients with COPD.","The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions, and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are: (A) an ethanol-induced lesion assay and (B) an indomethacin-induced ulcer assay and are described in EP 140,684.","In particular, the compounds of the invention would be useful to reduce the gastric erosion caused by co-administration of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and low-dose aspirin. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors are widely used as effective anti-inflammatory drugs with less potential for gastrointestinal complications as compared to traditional, non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the combined use of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor with low-dose aspirin for cardio protection may compromise the gastrointestinal safety of this class of compounds. By virtue of its activity as a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, the compounds of the invention would be expected to be gastric protective in this regard. See Fiorucci, et al. FASEB J. 17:1171-1173, 2003. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors for use with the invention include but are not limited to rofecoxib (VIOXX\u00ae), etoricoxib (ARCOXIA\u2122), celecoxib (CELEBREX\u00ae) and valdecoxib (BEXTRA\u2122). A compound of this invention in combination with a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form or separately to a patient on low-dose aspirin therapy. Alternatively, the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form with low-dose aspirin, in which case a compound of this invention would be administered separately. All three active ingredients in unit dosage form is also encompassed. Conventional dosage amounts of the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and aspirin (for cardio protection) may be utilized. For example, rofecoxib could be administered at 12.5 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg once daily. Aspirin could be administered at 81 mg once daily.","In general, FLAP inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which have an ICin the \u201cFLAP Binding Assay\u201d that is less than or equal to 1 \u03bcM, and preferably 500 nM or less.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes mammals, especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of onset of atherosclerosis.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.","An effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor in the method of this invention is in the range of about 0.001 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg of body weight per day, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to 1 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. A single daily dose is preferred but not necessary. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. As examples, the daily dosage amount may be selected from, but not limited to 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 250 mg. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the patient's condition. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the FLAP inhibitor will administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting months, years or the life of the patient.","In a broad embodiment, any suitable additional active agent or agents, including but not limited to anti-atherosclerotic agents, may be used in combination with the compound of formula I in a single dosage formulation, or may be administered to the patient in a separate dosage formulation, which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents. One or more additional active agents may be administered with a compound of Formula I. The additional active agent or agents can be lipid modifying compounds or agents having other pharmaceutical activities, or agents that have both lipid-modifying effects and other pharmaceutical activities. Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which include statins in their lactonized or dihydroxy open acid forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, including but not limited to lovastatin (see U.S. Pat.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitors block the movement of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes of the small intestinal wall. This blockade is their primary mode of action in reducing serum cholesterol levels. These compounds are distinct from compounds which reduce serum cholesterol levels primarily by mechanisms of action such as acyl coenzyme A\u2014cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) inhibition, inhibition of triglyceride synthesis, MTP inhibition, bile acid sequestration, and transcription modulation such as agonists or antagonists of nuclear hormones.

The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred.","For oral use, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.

These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.","Oral immediate-release and time-controlled release dosage forms may be employed, as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. One example of a time-controlled release device is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,738. They may also be coated by the technique described in U.S. Pat.

The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.","Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.","Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.

Additionally, the medicament may be useful for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerotic disease, halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease once it has become clinically manifest, and preventing or reducing the risk of a first or subsequent occurrence of an atherosclerotic disease event. The medicament comprised of a compound of Formula I may also be prepared with one or more additional active agents, such as those described herein.","The compounds of structural formula I of the present invention can be prepared according to the procedures of the following Schemes and Examples, using appropriate materials and are further exemplified by the specific examples which follow.

The compounds illustrated in the examples are not, however, to be construed as forming the only genus that is considered as the invention. The Examples further illustrate details for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions and processes of the following preparative procedures can be used to prepare these compounds. The instant compounds are generally isolated in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as those described previously hereinabove. The free amine bases corresponding to the isolated salts can be generated by neutralization with a suitable base, such as aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide, and extraction of the liberated amine free base into an organic solvent followed by evaporation. The amine free base isolated in this manner can be further converted into another pharmaceutically acceptable salt by dissolution in an organic solvent followed by addition of the appropriate acid and subsequent evaporation, precipitation, or crystallization. All temperatures are degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted. Mass spectra (MS) were measured by electron-spray ion-mass spectroscopy.","The phrase \u201cstandard peptide coupling reaction conditions\u201d means coupling a carboxylic acid with an amine using an acid activating agent such as HATU, EDC, and PyBOP in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or DMF in the presence of a auxiliary nucleophile such as HOAT or HOBT. The use of protecting groups for the amine and carboxylic acid functionalities to facilitate the desired reaction and minimize undesired reactions is well documented. Conditions required to add and remove protecting groups are found in standard textbooks such as Greene, T, and Wuts, P. G. M., , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1999. CBZ and BOC are commonly used amino protecting groups in organic synthesis, and their removal conditions are known to those skilled in the art. For example, CBZ may be removed by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal or its oxide such as palladium on activated carbon in a protic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. In cases where catalytic hydrogenation is contraindicated due to the presence of other potentially reactive functionalities, removal of CBZ groups can also be achieved by treatment with a solution of hydrogen bromide in acetic acid or by treatment with a mixture of TFA and dimethylsulfide. Removal of BOC protecting groups is carried out with a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, or hydrogen chloride gas, in a solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxane, methanol, or ethyl acetate.","Abbreviations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["Ar Aryl","9-BBN 9-Borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane","BOC (Boc) tert-butyloxycarbonyl","Bn benzyl","Bu butyl",{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0006","num":"0147"},"sup":"t "},"celite Celite\u2122 diatomaceous earth","CBZ (Cbz) benzyloxycarbonyl","DEAD diethyl azodicarboxylate","Dess-Martin Periodinane 1,1,1-tris(acetyloxy)-1,1-dihydro1,2-benzodoxol-3-(1H)-one","DIAD diisopropylazodicarboxylate","DIBAL-H diisobutylaluminum hydride","DIPEA diisopropylethylamine","DMAP 4-dimethylaminopyridine","DMF N,N-dimethylformamide","dppf 1,1\u2032-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene","EDC 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-ethylcarbodiimide.HCl","equiv. equivalent(s)","ES-MS electron spray ion-mass spectroscopy","Et ethyl","EtOAc ethyl acetate","h hour(s)","HATU O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate","HetAr or HAR Heteroaryl","HOAt 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole","HOBt 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate","HPLC high performance liquid chromatography","i iso","LDA lithium diisopropylamide","LG leaving group","Me methyl","min minute(s)","m.p. melting point","MS mass spectrum","Ms methanesulfonyl","NMM N-Methylmorpholine","NMO N-Methylmorpholine-N-oxide","NMP 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone","p para","PCC pyridinium chlorochromate","Ph phenyl","Pr propyl",{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0043","num":"0184"},"sup":"i"},"p-TSA para-toluenesulfonic acid","PyBOP benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinephosphonium hexafluorophosphate","Tf trifluoromethanesulfonyl","TFA trifluoroacetic acid","THF tetrahydrofuran"]}}}},"Reaction schemes A-M illustrate preferred methods for the syntheses of compounds of the present invention of structural formula I.

In this method, 1 is treated with an organometallic reagent of type 4, capable of transferring an aryl group. Preferred organometallic reagents for this transformation include organomagnesium (Grignard) or organolithium compounds. When Grignard reagents are employed as shown in scheme B, it is customary to conduct the reaction in a suitable ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether, THF or mixtures thereof, at temperatures between \u221278\u00b0 C. and the boiling temperature of the solvent. In the case of an organolithium reagent, the reaction can be conducted in a variety of solvents such as diethyl ether or hexanes, at temperatures between \u221278\u00b0 C. and room temperature. The Grignard and the organolithium reagents are often purchased commercially, but can be prepared synthetically according to known methods in organic synthesis.

The 100,000\u00d7g pellet membranes were resuspended in Tris-Tween assay buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20) to yield a final protein concentration of 50 \u03bcg to 150 \u03bcg\/ml. Aliquots (100 \u03bcl) of membrane suspension were added to 12 mm\u00d775 mm polypropylene tubes containing 100 \u03bcl Tris-Tween assay buffer, 30,000 cpm of Compound A in 5 \u03bcMeOH:assay buffer (1:1), and 2 \u03bcl dimethyl sulfoxide or competitor (i.e., the compound to be tested) in dimethyl sulfoxide. Compound B (10 \u03bcM final concentration) was used to determine non-specific binding. After a 20 minute incubation at room temperature, tube contents were diluted to 4 ml with cold 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20 wash buffer and the membranes were collected by filtration of GFB filters presoaked in the wash buffer. Tubes and filters were rinsed with 2\u00d74 ml aliquots of cold wash buffer. Filters were transferred to 12 mm\u00d73.5 mm polystyrene tubes for determination of radioactivity by gamma-scintillation counting.","Specific binding is defined as total binding minus non-specific binding. Total binding was Compound A bound to membranes in the absence of competitor; non-specific binding was Compound A bound in the presence of 10 uM Compound B. Preparation of Compound A is described in reference 1, below. The ICvalues obtained by computer analysis (see reference 2, below) of the experimental data, such that select compounds of the invention demonstrate an ICin the range of about 1 nM to as high as about 10 \u03bcM.","1.
