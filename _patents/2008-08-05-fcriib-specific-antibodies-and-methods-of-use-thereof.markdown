The present invention also encompasses the use of an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, as a single agent therapy for the treatment, prevention, management, or amelioration of a cancer, preferably a B-cell malignancy, particularly, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an autoimmune disorder, an inflammatory disorder, an IgE-mediated allergic disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof. The present invention also encompasses the use of an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, in combination with other cancer therapies. The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, in amounts effective to prevent, treat, manage, or ameliorate a cancer, such as a B-cell malignancy, an autoimmune disorder, an inflammatory disorder, an IgE-mediated allergic disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof. The invention further provides methods of enhancing the therapeutic effect of therapeutic antibodies by administering the antibodies of the invention to enhance the effector function of the therapeutic antibodies. The invention also provides methods of enhancing efficacy of a vaccine composition by administering the antibodies of the invention with a vaccine composition. The invention further provides methods of treating cancer and\/or regulating immune complex-mediated cell activation by administering the antibodies of the invention to enhance an immune response. The invention also provides methods of breaking tolerance to an antigen by administering an antigen-antibody complex and an antibody of the invention.","The interaction of antibody-antigen complexes with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses, ranging from effector functions such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, mast cell degranulation, and phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc domain of antibodies or immune complexes to specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. The diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes results from the structural heterogeneity of Fc receptors. Fc receptors share structurally related ligand binding domains which presumably mediate intracellular signaling.","The Fc receptors, members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of proteins, are surface glycoproteins that can bind the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules. Each member of the family recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more isotypes through a recognition domain on the A-chain of the Fc receptor. Fc receptors are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. Fc receptors for IgG are referred to as Fc\u03b3R, for IgE as Fc\u03b5R, and for IgA as Fc\u03b1R. Different accessory cells bear Fc receptors for antibodies of different isotype, and the isotype of the antibody determines which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response (reviewed by Ravetch J. V. et al. (1991) \u201c,\u201d Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9: 457-92; Gerber et al. (2001) \u201c,\u201d Microbes and Infection, 3: 131-139; Billadeau et al. (2002), \u201c,\u201d The Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2(109): 161-168; Ravetch et al. (2000) \u201c,\u201d Science, 290: 84-89; Ravetch et al., (2001) \u201c,\u201d Annu. Rev. Immunol. 19:275-290; Ravetch (1994) \u201c,\u201d Cell, 78(4): 553-560). The different Fc receptors, the cells that express them, and their isotype specificity is summarized in Table 1 (adapted from I: TISHD4ed. 1999, Elsevier Science Ltd\/Garland Publishing, New York).","A. Fc\u03b3 Receptors","Each member of this family is an integral membrane glycoprotein, possessing extracellular domains related to a C2-set of immunoglobulin-related domains, a single membrane-spanning domain and an intracytoplasmic domain of variable length. There are three known Fc\u03b3Rs, designated Fc\u03b3RI(CD64), Fc\u03b3RII(CD32), and Fc\u03b3RIII(CD16). The three receptors are encoded by distinct genes; however, the extensive homology among the three family members suggests they arose from a common progenitor, perhaps by gene duplication. This invention specifically focuses on Fc\u03b3RII(CD32).","B. Fc\u03b3RII(CD32)","Fc\u03b3RII proteins are 40 KDa integral membrane glycoproteins that bind only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig (10M). This receptor is the most widely expressed Fc\u03b3R, present on all hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and platelets. Fc\u03b3RII has only two immunoglobulin-like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower affinity for IgG than Fc\u03b3RI. There are three human Fc\u03b3RII genes (Fc\u03b3RII-A, Fc\u03b3RII-B, Fc\u03b3RII-C), all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes.","Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of Fc\u03b3RIIA (CD32A) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (CD32B) create two functionally heterogenous responses to receptor ligation. The fundamental difference is that the A isoform initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation, resulting in events such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst, whereas the B isoform initiates inhibitory signals, e.g., inhibiting B-cell activation.","C. Signaling Through Fc\u03b3Rs","Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the Fc\u03b3Rs following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. Two distinct domains within the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptor called Immunoreceptor Tyrosine based Activation Motifs (ITAMs) or Immunoreceptor Tyrosine based Inhibitory Motifs (ITIMS) account for the different responses. The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the Fc\u03b3R-mediated cellular responses. ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R complexes include Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA, whereas ITIM-containing complexes only include Fc\u03b3RIIB.","Human neutrophils express Fc\u03b3RIIA. Fc\u03b3RIIA clustering via immune complexes or specific antibody cross-linking serves to aggregate ITAMs along with receptor-associated kinases that facilitate ITAM phosphorylation. ITAM phosphorylation serves as a docking site for Syk kinase, activation of which results in activation of downstream substrates (e.g., PI3K). Cellular activation leads to release of pro-inflammatory mediators.","Fc\u03b3RIIB is expressed on B lymphocytes; its extracellular domain is 96% identical to Fc\u03b3RIIA and binds IgG complexes in an indistinguishable manner. The presence of an ITIM in the cytoplasmic domain of Fc\u03b3RIIB defines this inhibitory subclass of Fc\u03b3R. Recently the molecular basis of this inhibition was established. When colligated along with an activating Fc\u03b3R, the ITIM in Fc\u03b3RIIB becomes phosphorylated and attracts the SH2 domain of the inositol polyphosphate 5\u2032-phosphatase (SHIP), which hydrolyzes phosphoinositol messengers that are released as a consequence of ITAM-containing Fc\u03b3R-mediated tyrosine kinase activation, thus preventing the influx of intracellular Ca++. In this manner, crosslinking of Fc\u03b3RIIB dampens the activating response to Fc\u03b3R ligation and inhibits cellular responsiveness. B cell activation, B cell proliferation and antibody secretion is aborted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Receptors for the Fc Regions of Immunoglobulin Isotypes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Effect"]},{"entry":["Receptor","Binding","Cell Type","of Ligation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Fc\u03b3RI","IgG1","Macrophages, Neutrophils,","Uptake"]},{"entry":["(CD64","10M","Eosinophils, Dendritic cells","Stimulation"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Activation of"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"respiratory"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"burst Induction"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"of killing"]},{"entry":["Fc\u03b3RII-A","IgG1","Macrophages, Neutrophils,","Uptake"]},{"entry":["(CD32)","2 \u00d7 10M","Eosinophils, Dendritic cells,","Granule"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Platelets, Langerhan cells","release"]},{"entry":["Fc\u03b3RII-B2","IgG1","Macrophages, Neutrophils,","Uptake"]},{"entry":["(CD32)","2 \u00d7 10M","Eosinophils","Inhibition"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"of Stimulation"]},{"entry":["Fc\u03b3RII-BI","IgG1","B cells, Mast cells","No uptake"]},{"entry":["(CD32)","2 \u00d7 10M",{},"Inhibition of"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Stimulation"]},{"entry":["Fc\u03b3RIII","IgG1","NK cells, Eosinophil","Induction of"]},{"entry":["(CD16)","5 \u00d7 10M","macrophages, Neutrophils,","Killing"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Mast Cells"]},{"entry":["Fc\u03b5RI","IgG1","Mast cells, Eosinophil","Secretion of"]},{"entry":[{},"10M","Basophils","granules"]},{"entry":["Fc\u03b1RI","IgG1,","Macrophages, Neutropils","Uptake"]},{"entry":["(CD89)","IgA2","Eosinophils","Induction"]},{"entry":[{},"10M",{},"killing of"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A. Cancer","A neoplasm, or tumor, is a neoplastic mass resulting from abnormal uncontrolled cell growth which can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors generally remain localized. Malignant tumors are collectively termed cancers. The term \u201cmalignant\u201d generally means that the tumor can invade and destroy neighboring body structures and spread to distant sites to cause death (for review, see Robbins and Angell, 1976, 2Ed., W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, pp. 68-122). Cancer can arise in many sites of the body and behave differently depending upon its origin. Cancerous cells destroy the part of the body in which they originate and then spread to other part(s) of the body where they start new growth and cause more destruction.","More than 1.2 million Americans develop cancer each year. Cancer is the second leading case of death in the United States and if current trends continue, cancer is expected to be the leading cause of the death by the year 2010. Lung and prostate cancer are the top cancer killers for men in the United States. Lung and breast cancer are the top cancer killers for women in the United States. One in two men in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during his lifetime. One in three women in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer at some time during her lifetime. A cure for cancer has yet to be found. Current treatment options, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment, are often either ineffective or present serious side effects.","Currently, cancer therapy may involve surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and\/or radiation treatment to eradicate neoplastic cells in a patient (See, for example, Stockdale, 1998,\u201d in SA: M, vol. 3, Rubenstein and Federman, eds., Chapter 12, Section IV). Recently, cancer therapy could also involve biological therapy or immunotherapy. All of these approaches pose significant drawbacks for the patient. Surgery, for example, may be contraindicated due to the health of the patient or may be unacceptable to the patient. Additionally, surgery may not completely remove the neoplastic tissue. Radiation therapy is only effective when the neoplastic tissue exhibits a higher sensitivity to radiation than normal tissue, and radiation therapy can also often elicit serious side effects. Hormonal therapy is rarely given as a single agent and although can be effective, is often used to prevent or delay recurrence of cancer after other treatments have removed the majority of the cancer cells. Biological therapies\/immunotherapies are limited in number and may produce side effects such as rashes or swellings, flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and fatigue, digestive tract problems or allergic reactions.","With respect to chemotherapy, there are a variety of chemotherapeutic agents available for treatment of cancer. A significant majority of cancer chemotherapeutics act by inhibiting DNA synthesis, either directly, or indirectly, by inhibiting the biosynthesis of the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate precursors, to prevent DNA replication and concomitant cell division (See, for example, Gilman et al., 8th Ed., (Pergamom Press, New York, 1990). These agents, which include alkylating agents, such as nitrosourea, anti-metabolites, such as methotrexate and hydroxyurea, and other agents, such as etoposides, camptothecins, bleomycin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, etc., although not necessarily cell cycle specific, kill cells during S phase because of their effect on DNA replication. Other agents, specifically colchicine and the vinca alkaloids, such as vinblastine and vincristine, interfere with microtubule assembly resulting in mitotic arrest. Chemotherapy protocols generally involve administration of a combination of chemotherapeutic agents to increase the efficacy of treatment.","Despite the availability of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, chemotherapy has many drawbacks (See, for example, Stockdale, 1998,\u201d in , vol. 3, Rubenstein and Federman, eds., Ch. 12, Sect. 10). Almost all chemotherapeutic agents are toxic, and chemotherapy causes significant, and often dangerous, side effects, including severe nausea, bone marrow depression, immunosuppression, etc. Additionally, even with administration of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, many tumor cells are resistant or develop resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents. In fact, those cells resistant to the particular chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment protocol often prove to be resistant to other drugs, even those agents that act by mechanisms different from the mechanisms of action of the drugs used in the specific treatment; this phenomenon is termed pleiotropic drug or multidrug resistance. Thus, because of drug resistance, many cancers prove refractory to standard chemotherapeutic treatment protocols.","B. B Cell Malignancies","B cell malignancies, including, but not limited to, B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, are neoplastic diseases with significant incidence in the United States. There are approximately 55,000 new lymphoma cases of per year in the U.S. (1998 data), with an estimated 25,000 deaths per year. This represents 4% of cancer incidence and 4% of all cancer-related deaths in the U.S. population. The revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms (1994 REAL classification, modified 1999) grouped lymphomas based on their origin as either B cell lineage lymphoma, T cell lineage lymphoma, or Hodgkin's lymphoma. Lymphoma of the B cell lineage is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) diagnosed in the U.S. (Williams, H6ed. Beutler et al. eds., McGraw Hill, 2001).","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a neoplastic disease characterized by the accumulation of small, mature-appearing lymphocytes in the blood, marrow, and lymphoid tissues. CLL has an incidence of 2.7 cases per 100,000 in the U.S. The risk increases progressively with age, particularly in men. It accounts for 0.8% of all cancers and is the most common adult leukemia, responsible for 30% of all leukemias. In nearly all cases (>98%) the diseased cells belong to the B lymphocyte lineage. A non-leukemic variant, small lymphocytic lymphoma, constitutes 5-10% of all lymphomas, has histological, morphological and immunological features indistinguishable from that of involved lymph nodes in patients with B-CLL (Williams, H6ed. Beutler et al. eds., McGraw Hill, 2001).","The natural history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia falls into several phases. In the early phase, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an indolent disease, characterized by the accumulation of small, mature, functionally incompetent malignant B-cells having a lengthened life span. Eventually, the doubling time of the malignant B-cells decreases and patients become increasingly symptomatic. While treatment with chemotherapeutic agents can provide symptomatic relief, the overall survival of the patients is only minimally extended. The late stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are characterized by significant anemia and\/or thrombocytopenia. At this point, the median survival is less than two years (Foon et al. (1990) \u201c,\u201d Annals Int. Medicine 113:525-539). Due to the very low rate of cellular proliferation, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is resistant to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.","Recently, gene expression studies have identified several genes that may be up-regulated in lymphoproliferative disorders. One molecule thought to be over-expressed in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and in a large fraction of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients is CD32B (Alizadeh et al. (2000) \u201c-,\u201d Nature 403:503-511; Rosenwald et al. (2001) \u201c,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 184:1639-1647). However, the role of CD32B is B-CLL is unclear since one report demonstrates that CD32B was expressed on a low percentage of B-CLL cells and at a low density (Damle et al. (2002) \u201c--,\u201d Blood 99:4087-4093). CD32B is a B cell lineage surface antigen, whose over-expression in B cell neoplasia makes it a suitable target for therapeutic antibodies. In addition, CD32B belongs to the category of inhibitory receptors, whose ligation delivers a negative signal. Therefore, antibodies directed against CD32B could function to eliminate tumor cells by mechanisms that include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), but also triggering an apoptotic signal. The high homology of CD32B with its counterpart, CD32A, an activating Fc\u03b3 receptor, has thus far hampered the generation of antibodies that selectively recognize one but not the other form of the molecule.","B cell malignancy is generally treated with single agent chemotherapy, combination chemotherapy and\/or radiation therapy. These treatments can reduce morbidity and\/or improve survival, albeit they carry significant side effects. The response of B-cell malignancies to various forms of treatment is mixed. For example, in cases in which adequate clinical staging of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is possible, field radiation therapy can provide satisfactory treatment. Certain patients, however, fail to respond and disease recurrence with resistance to treatment ensues with time, particularly with the most aggressive variants of the disease. About one-half of the patients die from the disease (Devesa et al. (1987) \u201c1947-84,\u201d J. Nat'l Cancer Inst. 79:701-770).","Investigational therapies for the treatment of refractory B cell neoplasia include autologous and allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation and gene therapies. Recently, immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies to target B-cell specific antigens has been introduced in the treatment of B cell neoplasia. The use of monoclonal antibodies to direct radionuclides, toxins, or other therapeutic agents offers the possibility that such agents can be delivered selectively to tumor sites, thus limiting toxicity to normal tissues.","There is a significant need for alternative cancer treatments, particularly for treatment of cancer that has proved refractory to standard cancer treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. A promising alternative is immunotherapy, in which cancer cells are specifically targeted by cancer antigen-specific antibodies. Major efforts have been directed at harnessing the specificity of the immune response; for example, hybridoma technology has enabled the development of tumor selective monoclonal antibodies (See Green et al. (2000) \u201c,\u201d Cancer Treat Rev., 26: 269-286; Weiner L M (1999) \u201c,\u201d Semin Oncol. 26(suppl. 14):43-51), and in the past few years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first mAbs for cancer therapy: RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) (anti-CD20) for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, CAMPATH\u00ae (alemtuzumab) (anti-CD52) for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and HERCEPTIN\u00ae (trastuzumab) [anti-(c-erb-2\/HER-2)] for metastatic breast cancer (S. A. Eccles (2001) \u201cMonoclonal ?,\u201d Breast Cancer Res., 3: 86-90). These antibodies have demonstrated clinical efficacy, but their use is not without side effects. The potency of antibody effector function, e.g., to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (\u201cADCC\u201d) is an obstacle to such treatment. Furthermore, with RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) and CAMPATH\u00ae (alemtuzumab), at least half the patients fail to respond and a fraction of responders may be refractory to subsequent treatments.","C. Inflammatory Diseases and Autoimmune Diseases","Inflammation is a process by which white blood cells and other cellular chemicals protect the body from infection by foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses. It is usually characterized by pain, swelling, warmth and redness of the affected area. Chemicals known as cytokines and prostaglandins control this process, and are released in an ordered and self-limiting cascade into the blood or affected tissues. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in the redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. These changes, when occurring for a limited period in the relevant area, work to the benefit of the body.","In autoimmune and\/or inflammatory disorders, the immune system triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign substances to fight and the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues by mistakenly attacking self. There are many different autoimmune disorders that affect the body in different ways. For example, the brain is affected in individuals with multiple sclerosis, the gut is affected in individuals with Crohn's disease, and the synovium, bone and cartilage of various joints are affected in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. As autoimmune disorders progress destruction of one or more types of body tissues, abnormal growth of an organ, or changes in organ function may result. The autoimmune disorder may affect only one organ or tissue type or may affect multiple organs and tissues. Organs and tissues commonly affected by autoimmune disorders include red blood cells, blood vessels, connective tissues, endocrine glands (e.g., the thyroid or pancreas), muscles, joints, and skin. Examples of autoimmune disorders include, but are not limited to, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune inner ear disease myasthenia gravis, Reiter's syndrome, Graves disease, autoimmune hepatitis, familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis are types of inflammatory arthritis. Arthritis is a general term that describes inflammation in joints. Some, but not all, types of arthritis are the result of misdirected inflammation. Besides rheumatoid arthritis, other types of arthritis associated with inflammation include the following: psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis arthritis, and gouty arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a type of chronic arthritis that occurs in joints on both sides of the body (such as both hands, wrists or knees). This symmetry helps distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from other types of arthritis. In addition to affecting the joints, rheumatoid arthritis may occasionally affect the skin, eyes, lungs, heart, blood or nerves.","Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1% of the world's population and is potentially disabling. There are approximately 2.9 million incidences of rheumatoid arthritis in the United States. Two to three times more women are affected than men. The typical age that rheumatoid arthritis occurs is between 25 and 50. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis affects 71,000 young Americans (aged eighteen and under), affecting six times as many girls as boys.","Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system improperly identifies the synovial membranes that secrete the lubricating fluid in the joints as foreign. Inflammation results, and the cartilage and tissues in and around the joints are damaged or destroyed. In severe cases, this inflammation extends to other joint tissues and surrounding cartilage, where it may erode or destroy bone and cartilage and lead to joint deformities. The body replaces damaged tissue with scar tissue, causing the normal spaces within the joints to become narrow and the bones to fuse together. Rheumatoid arthritis creates stiffness, swelling, fatigue, anemia, weight loss, fever, and often, crippling pain. Some common symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include joint stiffness upon awakening that lasts an hour or longer; swelling in a specific finger or wrist joints; swelling in the soft tissue around the joints; and swelling on both sides of the joint. Swelling can occur with or without pain, and can worsen progressively or remain the same for years before progressing.","The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is based on a combination of factors, including: the specific location and symmetry of painful joints, the presence of joint stiffness in the morning, the presence of bumps and nodules under the skin (rheumatoid nodules), results of X-ray tests that suggest rheumatoid arthritis, and\/or positive results of a blood test called the rheumatoid factor. Many, but not all, people with rheumatoid arthritis have the rheumatoid-factor antibody in their blood. The rheumatoid factor may be present in people who do not have rheumatoid arthritis. Other diseases can also cause the rheumatoid factor to be produced in the blood. That is why the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is based on a combination of several factors and not just upon the presence of the rheumatoid factor in the blood.","The typical course of the disease is one of persistent but fluctuating joint symptoms, and after about 10 years, 90% of sufferers will show structural damage to bone and cartilage. A small percentage will have a short illness that clears up completely, and another small percentage will have very severe disease with many joint deformities, and occasionally other manifestations of the disease. The inflammatory process causes erosion or destruction of bone and cartilage in the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, there is an autoimmune cycle of persistent antigen presentation, T-cell stimulation, cytokine secretion, synovial cell activation, and joint destruction. The disease has a major impact on both the individual and society, causing significant pain, impaired function and disability, as well as costing millions of dollars in healthcare expenses and lost wages.","Currently, available therapy for arthritis focuses on reducing inflammation of the joints with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications. The first line of treatment of any arthritis is usually anti-inflammatories, such as aspirin, ibuprofen and Cox-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib and rofecoxib. \u201cSecond line drugs\u201d include gold, methotrexate and steroids. Although these are well-established treatments for arthritis, very few patients remit on these lines of treatment alone. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis have led to the use of methotrexate in combination with antibodies to cytokines or recombinant soluble receptors. For example, recombinant soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 have been used in combination with methotrexate in the treatment of arthritis. However, only about 50% of the patients treated with a combination of methotrexate and anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents such as recombinant soluble receptors for TNF-\u03b1 show clinically significant improvement. Many patients remain refractory despite treatment. Difficult treatment issues still remain for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Many current treatments have a high incidence of side effects or cannot completely prevent disease progression. So far, no treatment is ideal, and there is no cure. Novel therapeutics are needed that more effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders.","D. Allergy","Immune-mediated allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions are classified into four types (I-IV) according to the underlying mechanisms leading to the expression of the allergic symptoms. Type I allergic reactions are characterized by IgE-mediated release of vasoactive substances such as histamine from mast cells and basophils. The release of these substances and the subsequent manifestation of allergic symptoms are initiated by the cross-linking of allergen-bound IgE to its receptor on the surface of mast cells and basophils. In individuals suffering from type I allergic reactions, exposure to an allergen for a second time leads to the production of high levels of IgE antibodies specific for the allergen as a result of the involvement of memory B and T cells in the 3-cell interaction required for IgE production. The high levels of IgE antibodies produced cause an increase in the cross-linking of IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils by allergen-bound IgE, which in turn leads to the activation of these cells and the release of the pharmacological mediators that are responsible for the clinical manifestations of type I allergic diseases.","Two receptors with differing affinities for IgE have been identified and characterized. The high affinity receptor (Fc\u03b5RI) is expressed on the surface of mast cells and basophils. The low affinity receptor (Fc\u03b5RII\/CD23) is expressed on many cell types, including B cells, T cells, macrophages, eosinophils and Langerhan cells. The high affinity IgE receptor consists of three subunits (alpha, beta and gamma chains). Several studies demonstrate that only the alpha chain is involved in the binding of IgE, whereas the beta and gamma chains (which are either transmembrane or cytoplasmic proteins) are required for signal transduction events. The identification of IgE structures required for IgE to bind to the Fc\u03b5RI on mast cells and basophils is of utmost importance in devising strategies for treatment or prevention of IgE-mediated allergies. For example, the elucidation of the IgE receptor-binding site could lead to the identification of peptides or small molecules that block the binding of IgE to receptor-bearing cells in vivo.","Currently, IgE-mediated allergic reactions are treated with drugs such as antihistamines and corticosteroids which attempt to alleviate the symptoms associated with allergic reactions by counteracting the effects of the vasoactive substances released from mast cells and basophils. High doses of antihistamines and corticosteroids have deleterious side effects (e.g., central nervous system disturbance, constipation, etc). Thus, other methods for treating type I allergic reactions are needed.","One approach to the treatment of type I allergic disorders has been the production of monoclonal antibodies which react with soluble (free) IgE in serum, block IgE from binding to its receptor on mast cells and basophils, and do not bind to receptor-bound IgE (i.e., they are non-anaphylactogenic). Two such monoclonal antibodies are in advanced stages of clinical development for treatment of IgE-mediated allergic reactions (see, e.g., Chang, T. W. (2000) \u201c-,\u201d Nature Biotechnology 18:157-162).","One of the most promising treatments for IgE-mediated allergic reactions is the active immunization against appropriate non-anaphylactogenic epitopes on endogenous IgE. Stanworth et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,821) described a strategy involving the use of a peptide derived from the C\u03b5H4 domain of the human IgE coupled to a heterologous carrier protein as an allergy vaccine. However, this peptide has been shown not to induce the production of antibodies that react with native soluble IgE. Further, Hellman (U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,980) proposed anti-IgE vaccine compositions based on fusion of full-length C\u03b5H2-C\u03b5H3 domains (approximately 220 amino acids long) to a foreign carrier protein. However, the antibodies induced by the anti-IgE vaccine compositions proposed in Hellman will most likely it result in anaphylaxis, since antibodies against some portions of the C\u03b5H2 and C\u03b5H3 domains of the IgE molecule have been shown to cross-link the IgE receptor on the surface of mast cell and basophils and lead to production of mediators of anaphylaxis (See, e.g., Stadler et al. (1993) \u201c-,\u201d Int. Arch. Allergy and Immunology 102:121-126). Therefore, a need remains for treatment of IgE-mediated allergic reactions which do not induce anaphylactic antibodies.","The significant concern over induction of anaphylaxis has resulted in the development of another approach to the treatment of type I allergic disorders consisting of mimotopes that could induce the production of anti-IgE polyclonal antibodies when administered to animals (See, e.g., Rudolf, et al. (1998) \u201c-,\u201d Journal of Immunology 160:3315-3321). Kricek et al. (International Publication No. WO 97\/31948) screened phage-displayed peptide libraries with the monoclonal antibody BSWI7 to identify peptide mimotopes that could mimic the conformation of the IgE receptor binding. These mimotopes could presumably be used to induce polyclonal antibodies that react with free native IgE, but not with receptor-bound IgE as well as block IgE from binding to its receptor. Kriek et al. disclosed peptide mimotopes that are not homologous to any part of the IgE molecule and are thus different from peptides disclosed in the present invention.","As evidenced by a survey of the art, there remains a need for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of current methods of treating or preventing disorders such as cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammatory disorder, or allergy. In particular, there is a need for enhancing the effector function, particularly, the cytotoxic effect of therapeutic antibodies used in treatment of cancer. The current state of the art is also lacking in treating or preventing allergy disorders (e.g., either by antibody therapy or vaccine therapy).","The extracellular domains of Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB are 95% identical and thus share numerous epitopes. However, Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB exhibit very different activities. The fundamental difference is that the Fc\u03b3RIIA initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst, whereas the Fc\u03b3RIIB initiates inhibitory signaling. Prior to this invention, to the knowledge of the inventors, antibodies known to distinguish between native human Fc\u03b3RIIA and native human Fc\u03b3RIIB have not been identified. In view of their distinctive activities and role in modulating immune responses, antibodies that recognize native Fc\u03b3RIIB and not native Fc\u03b3RIIA are needed. The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery of such Fc\u03b3RIIB-specific antibodies.","The invention relates to an isolated antibody or a fragment thereof that specifically binds Fc\u03b3RIIB, particularly human Fc\u03b3RIIB, more particularly native human Fc\u03b3RIIB, with a greater affinity than said antibody or a fragment thereof binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, particularly human Fc\u03b3RIIA, more particularly native human Fc\u03b3RIIA, and blocks the Fc binding domain of Fc\u03b3RIIB.

If the antibody that specifically binds to Fc\u03b3RIIB binds through its variable domain, it is understood to one skilled in the art that it is not aggregated, i.e., is monomeric. An antibody that specifically binds to Fc\u03b3RIIB may bind to other peptides or polypeptides with lower affinity as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIAcore, or other assays known in the art.

Preferably, the native Fc\u03b3RIIB is not expressed in a bacterial cell, i.e., . Most preferably, the native Fc\u03b3RIIB is not denatured, i.e., it is in its biologically active conformation.","As used herein, the term \u201cnative Fc\u03b3RIIA\u201d refers to Fc\u03b3RIIA that is endogenously expressed and present on the surface of a cell.

A proteinaceous agent that has a similar amino acid sequence refers to a second proteinaceous agent that satisfies at least one of the following:\n\n","A proteinaceous agent with similar structure to a second proteinaceous agent refers to a proteinaceous agent that has a similar secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure to the second proteinaceous agent. The structure of a polypeptide can be determined by methods known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to, peptide sequencing, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and crystallographic electron microscopy.","To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=number of identical overlapping positions\/total number of positions\u00d7100%). In one embodiment, the two sequences are the same length.","The determination of percent identity between two sequences can also be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin et al. (1990) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87:2264-2268, modified as in Karlin et al. (1993) \u201c-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. (1990) \u201c,\u201d J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST nucleotide program parameters set, e.g., for score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program parameters set, e.g., to score-50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the present invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) \u201c-,\u201d Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships between molecules (Id.). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., of XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used (see, e.g., the NCBI website). Another preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers et al. (1988) \u201c,\u201d Comput. Appl. Biosci. 4:11-17. Such an algorithm is incorporated in the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.","The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity, typically only exact matches are counted.","As used herein, the term \u201canalog\u201d in the context of a non-proteinaceous agent refers to a second organic or inorganic molecule which possesses a similar or identical function as a first organic or inorganic molecule and is structurally similar to the first organic or inorganic molecule.","As used herein, the terms \u201cantagonist\u201d and \u201cantagonists\u201d refer to any protein, polypeptide, peptide, antibody, antibody fragment, large molecule, or small molecule (less than 10 kD) that blocks, inhibits, reduces or neutralizes a function, activity and\/or expression of another molecule, such as that of Fc\u03b3RIIB.

As used herein, cancer explicitly includes leukemias and lymphomas. The term \u201ccancer\u201d refers to a disease involving cells that have the potential to metastasize to distal sites and exhibit phenotypic traits that differ from those of non-cancer cells, for example, formation of colonies in a three-dimensional substrate such as soft agar or the formation of tubular networks or weblike matrices in a three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation. Non-cancer cells do not form colonies in soft agar and form distinct sphere-like structures in three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparations. Cancer cells acquire a characteristic set of functional capabilities during their development, albeit through various mechanisms. Such capabilities include evading apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, tissue invasion\/metastasis, limitless explicative potential, and sustained angiogenesis. The term \u201ccancer cell\u201d is meant to encompass both pre-malignant and malignant cancer cells. In some embodiments, cancer refers to a benign tumor, which has remained localized.

An epitope having immunogenic activity is a fragment of a polypeptide or protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal. An epitope having antigenic activity is a fragment of a polypeptide or protein to which an antibody immunospecifically binds as determined by any method well-known to one of skill in the art, for example by immunoassays. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.","As used herein, the term \u201cfragment\u201d refers to a peptide or polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of at least 5 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 15 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 25 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 50 contiguous amino acid residues, at least 60 contiguous amino residues, at least 70 contiguous amino acid residues, at least contiguous 80 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 90 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 100 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 125 amino acid residues, at least 150 contiguous amino acid residues, at least contiguous 175 amino acid residues, at least contiguous 200 amino acid residues, or at least contiguous 250 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of another polypeptide.

Preferably, antibody fragments are epitope binding fragments.","As used herein, the term \u201chumanized antibody\u201d refers to an immunoglobulin comprising a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human (usually a mouse or rat) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDR's is called the \u201cdonor\u201d and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the \u201cacceptor\u201d. Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-90%, preferably about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDR's, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. A \u201chumanized antibody\u201d is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. For example, a humanized antibody would not encompass a typical chimeric antibody, because the entire variable region of a chimeric antibody is non-human. One says that the donor antibody has been \u201chumanized\u201d, by the process of \u201chumanization\u201d, because the resultant humanized antibody is expected to bind to the same antigen as the donor antibody that provides the CDR's. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Framework Region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin that immunospecifically binds to an Fc\u03b3RIIB polypeptide, that has been altered by the introduction of amino acid residue substitutions, deletions or additions (i.e., mutations). In some embodiments, a humanized antibody is a derivative. Such a humanized antibody comprises amino acid residue substitutions, deletions or additions in one or more non-human CDRs. The humanized antibody derivative may have substantially the same binding, better binding, or worse binding when compared to a non-derivative humanized antibody. In specific embodiments, one, two, three, four, or five amino acid residues of the CDR have been substituted, deleted or added (i.e., mutated).

Without being bound by any theory, the present inventors have discovered that Fc\u03b3RIIB is not highly expressed on neutrophils, as previously thought. High concentrations of an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody react with neutrophils. However, neutrophil reactivity rapidly disappears with decreasing concentrations of anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB.

(See, e.g., Greenspan et al. (1989) \u201c-,\u201d FASEB J. 7:437-444; and Nissinoff (1991) \u201c,\u201d J. Immunol. 147:2429-2438). The invention provides methods employing the use of polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention or a fragment thereof.","The present invention encompasses single domain antibodies, including camelized single domain antibodies (See e.g., Muyldermans et al.

In one embodiment, the present invention provides single domain antibodies comprising two VH domains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed.","The methods of the present invention also encompass the use of antibodies or fragments thereof that have half-lives (e.g., serum half-lives) in a mammal, preferably a human, of greater than 15 days, preferably greater than 20 days, greater than 25 days, greater than 30 days, greater than 35 days, greater than 40 days, greater than 45 days, greater than 2 months, greater than 3 months, greater than 4 months, or greater than 5 months. The increased half-lives of the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof in a mammal, preferably a human, results in a higher serum titer of said antibodies or antibody fragments in the mammal, and thus, reduces the frequency of the administration of said antibodies or antibody fragments and\/or reduces the concentration of said antibodies or antibody fragments to be administered. Antibodies or fragments thereof having increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by modifying (e.g., substituting, deleting or adding) amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the Fc domain and the FcRn receptor. The antibodies of the invention may be engineered by methods described in Ward et al. to increase biological half-lives (See U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375 B1). For example, antibodies of the invention may be engineered in the Fc-hinge domain to have increased in vivo or serum half-lives.","Antibodies or fragments thereof with increased in vivo half-lives can be generated by attaching to said antibodies or antibody fragments polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol (PEG). PEG can be attached to said antibodies or antibody fragments with or without a multifunctional linker either through site-specific conjugation of the PEG to the N- or C-terminus of said antibodies or antibody fragments or via epsilon-amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation will be closely monitored by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody-PEG conjugates by, e.g., size exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography.","The antibodies of the invention may also be modified by the methods and coupling agents described by Davis et al. (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337) in order to provide compositions that can be injected into the mammalian circulatory system with substantially no immunogenic response.","The present invention also encompasses the use of antibodies or antibody fragments comprising the amino acid sequence of any of the antibodies of the invention with mutations (e.g., one or more amino acid substitutions) in the framework or CDR regions. Preferably, mutations in these antibodies maintain or enhance the avidity and\/or affinity of the antibodies for Fc\u03b3RIIIB to which they immunospecifically bind. Standard techniques known to those skilled in the art (e.g., immunoassays) can be used to assay the affinity of an antibody for a particular antigen.","For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use human, chimeric or humanized antibodies. Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human subjects. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and International Publication Nos. WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50433, WO 98\/24893, WO 98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/33735, and WO 91\/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the Jregion prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized using conventional methodologies with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg et al. (1995) \u201c,\u201d Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 98\/24893, WO 96\/34096, and WO 96\/33735; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,923, 5,625,126, 5,633,425, 5,569,825, 5,661,016, 5,545,806, 5,814,318, and 5,939,598, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Medarex (Princeton, N.J.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a non-human antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (See e.g., Morrison (1985) \u201c,\u201d Science 229:1202-1207; Oi et al. (1986) \u201c,\u201d BioTechniques 4:214-221; Gillies et al.

Nos. 6,311,415, 5,807,715, 4,816,567, and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.) Chimeric antibodies comprising one or more CDRs from a non-human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule can be produced using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; International Publication No. WO 91\/09967; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539, 5,530,101, and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan (1991) \u201c-,\u201d Molecular Immunology 28(4\/5):489-498; Studnicka et al. (1994) \u201c---,\u201d Protein Engineering 7:805-814; and Roguska et al. (1994) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 91:969-973), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332). Each of the above-identified references is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Often, framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; and Riechmann et al. (1988) \u201c,\u201d Nature 332:323-327, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.)","In preferred embodiments, the antibodies are humanized antibodies. A humanized antibody is an antibody, a variant or a fragment thereof which is capable of binding to a predetermined antigen and which comprises a framework region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human immunoglobulin. A humanized Fc\u03b3RIIB specific antibody may comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Preferably, a humanized antibody of the invention also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. The constant domains of the humanized antibodies of the invention may be selected with respect to the proposed function of the antibody, in particular the effector function which may be required. In some embodiments, the constant domains of the humanized antibodies of the invention are human IgA, IgE, IgG or IgM domains. In a specific embodiment, human IgG constant domains, especially of the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes are used, when the humanized antibodies of the invention is intended for therapeutic uses and antibody effector functions are needed. In alternative embodiments, IgG2 and IgG4 isotypes are used when the humanized antibody of the invention is intended for therapeutic purposes and antibody effector function is not required. Humanized Fc\u03b3RIIB specific antibodies are disclosed in U.S. Application Ser. Nos. 60\/569,882 and 60\/582,043, filed May 10, 2004 and Jun. 21, 2004, respectively.","In some embodiments, the antibody contains both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. In other embodiments, the antibody may further comprise one or more of the CHI, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. The humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA and IgE, and any isotype, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. In some embodiments, the constant domain is a complement fixing constant domain where it is desired that the humanized antibody exhibit cytotoxic activity, and the class is typically IgG1. In other embodiments, where such cytotoxic activity is not desirable, the constant domain may be of the IgG2 class. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype, and selecting particular constant domains to optimize desired effector functions is within the ordinary skill in the art.","The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences, e.g., the donor CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the consensus or the donor antibody. Such mutations, however, are preferably not extensive. Usually, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental framework region (FR) and CDR sequences, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%. Humanized antibodies can be produced using variety of techniques known in the art, including but not limited to, CDR-grafting (European Patent No. EP 239,400; International Publication No. WO 91\/09967; and U.S. Pat.

In other embodiments, the humanized antibodies bind to the same epitope as 2B6 or 3H7. In a most preferred embodiment, the humanized antibody specifically binds to the same epitope as the donor murine antibody. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the invention encompasses CDR grafting of antibodies in general. Thus, the donor and acceptor antibodies may be derived from animals of the same species and even same antibody class or sub-class. More usually, however, the donor and acceptor antibodies are derived from animals of different species. Typically, the donor antibody is a non-human antibody, such as a rodent mAb, and the acceptor antibody is a human antibody.","In some embodiments, at least one CDR from the donor antibody is grafted onto the human antibody. In other embodiments, at least two and preferably all three CDRs of each of the heavy and\/or light chain variable regions are grafted onto the human antibody. The CDRs may comprise the Kabat CDRs, the structural loop CDRs or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the invention encompasses a humanized Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody comprising at least one CDR grafted heavy chain and at least one CDR-grafted light chain.","In a preferred embodiment, the CDR regions of the humanized Fc\u03b3RIIB specific antibody are derived from a murine antibody specific for Fc\u03b3RIIB. In some embodiments, the humanized antibodies described herein comprise alterations, including but not limited to amino acid deletions, insertions, modifications, of the acceptor antibody, i.e., human, heavy and\/or light chain variable domain framework regions that are necessary for retaining binding specificity of the donor monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the framework regions of the humanized antibodies described herein does not necessarily consist of the precise amino acid sequence of the framework region of a natural occurring human antibody variable region, but contains various alterations, including but not limited to amino acid deletions, insertions, modifications that alter the property of the humanized antibody, for example, improve the binding properties of a humanized antibody region that is specific for the same target as the murine Fc\u03b3RIIB specific antibody. In most preferred embodiments, a minimal number of alterations are made to the framework region in order to avoid large-scale introductions of non-human framework residues and to ensure minimal immunogenicity of the humanized antibody in humans. The donor monoclonal antibody is preferably a monoclonal antibody produced by clones 2B6 and 3H7 (having ATCC accession numbers PTA-4591, and PTA-4592, respectively) which bind Fc\u03b3RIIB.","In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses the use of a CDR-grafted antibody which specifically binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a greater affinity than said antibody binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, wherein the CDR-grafted antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region domain comprising framework residues of the recipient antibody and residues from the donor monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a greater affinity than said antibody binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, e.g., monoclonal antibody produced from clones 2B6 and 3H7. In another specific embodiment, the invention encompasses the use of a CDR-grafted antibody which specifically binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a greater affinity than said antibody binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, wherein the CDR-grafted antibody comprises a light chain variable region domain comprising framework residues of the recipient antibody and residues from the donor monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a greater affinity than said antibody binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, e.g., monoclonal antibody produced from clones 2B6, 3H7, 1D5, 2E1, 2H9, 2D11, or 1F2.","Preferably the humanized antibodies of the invention bind the extracellular domain of native human Fc\u03b3RIIB.

In another specific embodiment, the humanized 3H7 antibody further comprises a VL regions, which consists of the FR segments of a human germline VL segment and the CDR regions of 3H7VL, having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:46.","In particular, a humanized antibody is provided that immunospecifically binds to extracellular domain of native human Fc\u03b3RIIB, said antibody comprising (or alternatively, consisting of) CDR sequences of 2B6 or 3H7, in any of the following combinations: a VH CDR1 and a VL CDR1; a VH CDR1 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR1 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR2 and a VL CDR1; VH CDR2 and VL CDR2; a VH CDR2 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR3 and a VH CDR1; a VH CDR3 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR3 and a VL CDR3; a VH1 CDR1, a VH CDR2 and a VL CDR1; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3 and a VL CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR2, a VH CDR2 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR1, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR1, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR2, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR2, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3 and a VL CDR1; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR2 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR2; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1 and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR2, a VL CDR1, a VL CDR2, and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR1, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1, a VL CDR2, and a VL CDR3; a VH CDR2, a VH CDR3, a VL CDR1, a VL CDR2, and a VL CDR3; or any combination thereof of the VH CDRs and VL CDRs disclosed herein.","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the Jregion prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring that express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized using conventional methodologies with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg et al. (1995) \u201c,\u201d Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 98\/24893, WO 96\/34096, and WO 96\/33735; and U.S. Pat.

In addition, companies such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Medarex (Princeton, N.J.) can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.","A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a non-human antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. The present invention provides chimeric antibodies of 2B6, 3H7, 1D5, 2E1, 2H9, 2D11, or 1F2 having ATCC accession numbers PTA-4591, PTA-4592, PTA-5958, PTA-5961, PTA-5962, PTA-5960, and PTA-5959, respectively. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison (1985) \u201c,\u201d Science 229:1202-1207; Oi et al. (1986) \u201c,\u201d BioTechniques 4:214-221; Gillies et al.

Each of the above-identified references is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Often, framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; and Riechmann et al.

Oligosaccharides as used herein refer to carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars and the two terms may be used interchangeably herein. Carbohydrate moieties of the instant invention will be described with reference to commonly used nomenclature in the art. For a review of carbohydrate chemistry, see, e.g., Hubbard et al. (1981) \u201c-,\u201d Ann. Rev. Biochem., 50: 555-583, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This nomenclature includes for example, Man, which represents mannose; GlcNAc which represents 2-N-acetylglucosamine; Gal which represents galactose; Fuc for fucose and Glc for glucose. Sialic acids are described by the shorthand notation NeuNAc for 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid, and NeuNGc for 5-glycolneuraminic.","In general, antibodies contain carbohydrate moeities at conserved positions in the constant region of the heavy chain, and up to 30% of human IgGs have a glycosylated Fab region. IgG has a single N-linked biantennary carbohydrate structure at Asn 297 which resides in the CH2 domain (Jefferis et al. (1998) \u201c--,\u201d Immunol. Rev. 163: 59-76; Wright et al. (1997) \u201c,\u201d Trends Biotech. 15: 26-32). Human IgG typically has a carbohydrate of the following structure; GlcNAc(Fucose)-GlcNAc-Man-(ManGlcNAc). However variations among IgGs in carbohydrate content does occur which leads to altered function, see, e.g., Jassal et al. (2001) \u201c--2,6-,\u201d Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 288: 243-249; Groenink et al. (1996) \u201c,\u201d Eur. J. Immunol. 26: 1404-1407; Boyd et al. (1995) \u201c-1,\u201d Mol. Immunol. 32: 1311-1318; Kumpel et al. (1994) \u201c----,\u201d Human Antibody Hybridomas, 5: 143-151. The invention encompasses antibodies comprising a variation in the carbohydrate moiety that is attached to Asn 297. In one embodiment, the carbohydrate moiety has a galactose and\/or galactose-sialic acid at one or both of the terminal GlcNAc and\/or a third GlcNac arm (bisecting GlcNAc).","In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are substantially free of one or more selected sugar groups, e.g., one or more sialic acid residues, one or more galactose residues, one or more fucose residues. An antibody that is substantially free of one or more selected sugar groups may be prepared using common methods known to one skilled in the art, including for example recombinantly producing an antibody of the invention in a host cell that is defective in the addition of the selected sugar groups(s) to the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody, such that about 90-100% of the antibody in the composition lacks the selected sugar group(s) attached to the carbohydrate moiety. Alternative methods for preparing such antibodies include for example, culturing cells under conditions that prevent or reduce the addition of one or more selected sugar groups, or post-translational removal of one or more selected sugar groups.","In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses a method of producing a substantially homogenous antibody preparation, wherein about 80-100% of the antibody in the composition lacks a fucose on its carbohydrate moiety, e.g., the carbohydrate attachment on Asn 297. The antibody may be prepared, for example, by:\n\n","Most preferably, nucleic acid encoding the desired antibody is expressed in a host cell that has a reduced ability to fucosylate the antibody expressed therein. Preferably the host cell is a dihydrofolate reductase deficient chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO), e.g., a Lec 13 CHO cell (lectin resistant CHO mutant cell line; Ripka et al. (1986) \u201c--,\u201d Somatic Cell & Molec. Gen. 12(1): 51-62; Ripka et al. (1986) \u201c--,\u201d Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249(2): 533-545), CHO-K1, DUX-B11, CHO-DP12 or CHO-DG44, which has been modified so that the antibody is not substantially fucosylated. Thus, the cell may display altered expression and\/or activity for the fucoysltransferase enzyme, or another enzyme or substrate involved in adding fucose to the N-linked oligosaccharide so that the enzyme has a diminished activity and\/or reduced expression level in the cell. For methods to produce antibodies with altered fucose content, see, e.g., WO 03\/035835 and Shields et al. (2002) \u201c1 --,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 277(30): 26733-26740; both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","In some embodiments, the altered carbohydrate modifications modulate one or more of the following: solubilization of the antibody, facilitation of subcellular transport and secretion of the antibody, promotion of antibody assembly, conformational integrity, and antibody-mediated effector function. In a specific embodiment, the altered carbohydrate modifications enhance antibody mediated effector function relative to the antibody lacking the carbohydrate modification. Carbohydrate modifications that lead to altered antibody mediated effector function are well known in the art (see Shields et al. (2002) \u201c1 --,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 277(30): 26733-26740; Davies et al. (2001) \u201c-20 ,\u201d Biotechnology & Bioengineering, 74(4): 288-294). In another specific embodiment, the altered carbohydrate modifications enhance the binding of antibodies of the invention to Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor. Altering carbohydrate modifications in accordance with the methods of the invention includes, for example, increasing the carbohydrate content of the antibody or decreasing the carbohydrate content of the antibody. Methods of altering carbohydrate contents are known to those skilled in the art, see, e.g., Wallick et al. (1988) \u201c(1----6) ,\u201d Journal of Exp. Med. 168(3): 1099-1109; Tao et al.

In other embodiments, the invention encompasses antibodies comprising one or more glycosylation sites and one or more modifications in the Fc region, such as those disclosed supra and those known to one skilled in the art. In preferred embodiments, the one or more modifications in the Fc region enhance the affinity of the antibody for an activating Fc\u03b3R, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA, relative to the antibody comprising the wild type Fc regions. Antibodies of the invention with one or more glycosylation sites and\/or one or more modifications in the Fc region have an enhanced antibody mediated effector function, e.g., enhanced ADCC activity. In some embodiments, the invention further comprises antibodies comprising one or more modifications of amino acids that are directly or indirectly known to interact with a carbohydrate moiety of the antibody, including but not limited to amino acids at positions 241, 243, 244, 245, 245, 249, 256, 258, 260, 262, 264, 265, 296, 299, and 301. Amino acids that directly or indirectly interact with a carbohydrate moiety of an antibody are known in the art, see, e.g., Jefferis et al. (1995) \u201c,\u201d Immunology Letters, 44: 111-117, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention encompasses antibodies that have been modified by introducing one or more glycosylation sites into one or more sites of the antibodies, preferably without altering the functionality of the antibody, e.g., binding activity to Fc\u03b3RIIB. Glycosylation sites may be introduced into the variable and\/or constant region of the antibodies of the invention. As used herein, \u201cglycosylation sites\u201d include any specific amino acid sequence in an antibody to which an oligosaccharide (i.e., carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars linked together) will specifically and covalently attach. Oligosaccharide side chains are typically linked to the backbone of an antibody via either N- or O-linkages. N-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to a hydroxyamino acid, e.g., serine, threonine. The antibodies of the invention may comprise one or more glycosylation sites, including N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites. Any glycosylation site for N-linked or O-linked glycosylation known in the art may be used in accordance with the instant invention. An exemplary N-linked glycosylation site that is useful in accordance with the methods of the present invention, is the amino acid sequence: Asn-X-Thr\/Ser, wherein X may be any amino acid and Thr\/Ser indicates a threonine or a serine. Such a site or sites may be introduced into an antibody of the invention using methods well known in the art to which this invention pertains. See, for example, \u201c,\u201d in , (1983) J. D. Watson, et al. eds. Ch. 8, pp. 106-116, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. An exemplary method for introducing a glycosylation site into an antibody of the invention may comprise modifying or mutating an amino acid sequence of the antibody so that the desired Asn-X-Thr\/Ser sequence is obtained.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses methods of modifying the carbohydrate content of an antibody of the invention by adding or deleting a glycosylation site. Methods for modifying the carbohydrate content of antibodies are well known in the art and encompassed within the invention, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,149; EP 0 359 096 B1; U.S. Publication No. US 2002\/0028486; WO 03\/035835; U.S. Publication No. 2003\/0115614; U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,149; U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,511; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In other embodiments, the invention encompasses methods of modifying the carbohydrate content of an antibody of the invention by deleting one or more endogenous carbohydrate moieties of the antibody.","In some specific embodiments, the invention encompasses the use of modified Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies wherein the N-glysosylation consensenus site Asn50-Val-Ser of the CDR2 region has been modified, so that the glycosylation site at position 50 is eliminated. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, removal of the glycosylation site may limit potential variation in production of the antibody as well as potential immunogenicity in a pharmaceutical application. In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses the use of a humanized Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody wherein the amino acid at position 50 has been modified, e.g., deleted or substituted. In another specific embodiment, the invention further encompasses the use of an antibody with an amino acid modification, e.g., deletion or substitution, at position 51. In one specific embodiment, the invention encompasses the use of a humanized Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody wherein the amino acid at position 50 has been replaced with tyrosine. In another more specific embodiment, the invention encompasses the use of an Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody wherein the amino acid at position 50 has been replaced with tyrosine and the amino acid at position 51 has been replaced with alanine.","In addition to the use of a Fc\u03b3RIIB-specific antibody, an analog, derivative, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof in the methods and compositions of the invention, other Fc\u03b3RIIB agonist and antagonists may be used in accordance with the methods of the invention. Fc\u03b3RIIB agonists and antagonists include, but are not limited to, proteinaceous molecules (e.g., proteins, polypeptides (e.g., soluble Fc\u03b3RIIB polypeptides), peptides, fusion proteins (e.g., soluble Fc\u03b3RIIB polypeptides conjugated to a therapeutic moiety), nucleic acid molecules (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIB antisense nucleic acid molecules, triple helices, dsRNA that mediates RNAi, or nucleic acid molecules encoding proteinaceous molecules), organic molecules, inorganic molecules, small organic molecules, drugs, and small inorganic molecules that block, inhibit, reduce or neutralize a function, an activity and\/or the expression of a Fc\u03b3RIIB polypeptide, expressed by an immune cell, preferably a B-cell. In some embodiments, an Fc\u03b3RIIB agonist or antagonist used in accordance with the methods of the invention is not a small organic molecule, a drug or an antisense molecule. Fc\u03b3RIIB agonists and antagonists can be identified using techniques well-known in the art or described herein.","Prophylactic and therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, proteinaceous molecules, including, but not limited to, peptides, polypeptides, proteins, including post-translationally modified proteins, antibodies, etc.; small molecules (less than 1000 daltons), inorganic or organic compounds; nucleic acid molecules including, but not limited to, double-stranded or single-stranded DNA, double-stranded or single-stranded RNA, as well as triple helix nucleic acid molecules. Prophylactic and therapeutic compounds can be derived from any known organism (including, but not limited to, animals, plants, bacteria, fungi, and protista, or viruses) or from a library of synthetic molecules.","In certain embodiments, Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists reduce a function, activity, and\/or expression of a Fc\u03b3RIIB polypeptide in a subject with a B-cell malignancy. In other embodiments, the Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists directly bind to an Fc\u03b3RIIB polypeptide and directly or indirectly modulate an activity and\/or function of B-lymphocytes. In particular embodiments, Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists inhibit or reduce B-cell proliferation in a subject with a B-cell malignancy as determined by standard in vivo and\/or in vitro assays described herein or well-known to those skilled in the art. In a specific embodiment, Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists mediate the depletion of lymphocytes, in particular peripheral blood B-cells, in a subject with a B-cell malignancy as determined by standard in vivo and\/or in vitro assays described herein or well-known to those skilled in the art. In another embodiment, Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists directly or indirectly modulate an activity and\/or function of B-lymphocytes by utilizing antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC).","In a preferred embodiment, proteins, polypeptides or peptides (including antibodies and fusion proteins) that are utilized as Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists are derived from the same species as the recipient of the proteins, polypeptides or peptides so as to reduce the likelihood of an immune response to those proteins, polypeptides or peptides. In another preferred embodiment, when the subject is a human, the proteins, polypeptides, or peptides that are utilized as Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists are human or humanized.","Nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins, polypeptides, or peptides that function as Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists can be administered to a subject with a B-cell malignancy, in accordance with the methods of the invention. Further, nucleic acid molecules encoding derivatives, analogs, fragments or variants of proteins, polypeptides, or peptides that function as Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonists can be administered to a subject with a B-cell malignancy in accordance with the methods of the invention. Preferably, such derivatives, analogs, variants and fragments retain the Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonist activity of the full-length wild-type protein, polypeptide, or peptide.","The present invention encompasses antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to heterologous polypeptides (i.e., an unrelated polypeptide; or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90 or at least 100 amino acids of the polypeptide) to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences. Antibodies may be used for example to target heterologous polypeptides to particular cell types, either in vitro or in vivo, by fusing or conjugating the antibodies to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Antibodies fused or conjugated to heterologous polypeptides may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art.

Therapeutic agents or drug moieties are not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin (i.e., PE-40), or diphtheria toxin, ricin, gelonin, and pokeweed antiviral protein, a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, interferons including, but not limited to, \u03b1-interferon (IFN-\u03b1), \u03b2-interferon (IFN-\u03b2), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), an apoptotic agent (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, AIM I as disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 97\/33899), AIM II (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 97\/34911), Fas Ligand (Takahashi et al.

One or more portions of a polynucleotide encoding an antibody or antibody fragment, which portions specifically bind to Fc\u03b3RIIB may be recombined with one or more components, motifs, sections, parts, domains, fragments, etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.","The present invention also encompasses antibodies conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent or any other molecule for which serum half-life is desired to be increased. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to, for example, monitor the development or progression of a disease, disorder or infection as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody or indirectly, through an intermediate (such as, for example, a linker known in the art) using techniques known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Such diagnosis and detection can be accomplished by coupling the antibody to detectable substances including, but not limited to, various enzymes, enzymes including, but not limited to, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; prosthetic group complexes such as, but not limited to, streptavidin\/biotin and avidin\/biotin; fluorescent materials such as, but not limited to, umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; luminescent material such as, but not limited to, luminol; bioluminescent materials such as, but not limited to, luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; radioactive material such as, but not limited to, bismuth (Bi), carbon (C), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), fluorine (F), gadolinium (Gd, Gd), gallium (Ga, Ga), germanium (Ge), holmium (Ho), indium (In, In, In, In), iodine (I, I, I, I), lanthanium (La), lutetium (Lu), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), palladium (Pd), phosphorous (P), praseodymium (Pr), promethium (Pm), rhenium (Re, Re), rhodium (Rh), ruthemium (97Ru), samarium (Sm), scandium (Sc), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), sulfur (S), technetium (Tc), thallium (Ti), tin (Sn, Sn), tritium (H), xenon (Xe), ytterbium (Yb, Yb), yttrium (Y), zinc (Zn); positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions.","An antibody may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin (e.g., a cytostatic or cytocidal agent), a therapeutic agent or a radioactive element (e.g., alpha-emitters, gamma-emitters, etc.).

No. 4,676,980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Antibodies may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.","Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., , (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2 ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: -, pp. 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) both of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.","Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with an antigen of interest or a cell expressing such an antigen. Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limiting dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding the antigen. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by inoculating mice intraperitoneally with positive hybridoma clones.","In one particular embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with greater affinity than said monoclonal antibodies bind Fc\u03b3RIIA comprising: immunizing one or more Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic mice (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,877,396 and 5,824,487) with the purified extracellular domain of human Fc\u03b3RIIB, amino acids 1-180; producing hybridoma cell lines from spleen cells of said mice, screening said hybridoma cells lines for one or more hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies that specifically bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with greater affinity than said antibodies bind Fc\u03b3RIIA. In another specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing Fc\u03b3RIIB monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind Fc\u03b3RIIB, particularly human Fc\u03b3RIIB, with a greater affinity than said monoclonal antibodies bind Fc\u03b3RIIA, said method further comprising: immunizing one or more Fc\u03b3RIIA transgenic mice with purified Fc\u03b3RIIB or an immunogenic fragment thereof, booster immunizing said mice sufficient number of times to elicit an immune response, producing hybridoma cells lines from spleen cells of said one or more mice, screening said hybridoma cell lines for one or more hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies that specifically bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with a greater affinity than said antibodies bind Fc\u03b3RIIA. In one embodiment of the invention, said mice are immunized with purified Fc\u03b3RIIB which has been mixed with any adjuvant known in the art to enhance immune response.

For example, Fab and F(ab\u2032)fragments may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab\u2032)fragments). F(ab\u2032)fragments contain the complete light chain, and the variable region, the CH1 region and at least a portion of the hinge region of the heavy chain.","For example, antibodies can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains, such as Fab and Fv or disulfide-bond stabilized Fv, expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage, including fd and M13. The antigen binding domains are expressed as a recombinantly fused protein to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein.

For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT Publication WO 92\/22324; Mullinax et al.

This technique would be useful in obtaining high affinity antibodies that could be used in the combinatorial methods of the invention. The technology, referred to as affinity maturation, employs mutagenesis or CDR walking and re-selection using Fc\u03b3RIIB or an antigenic fragment thereof to identify antibodies that bind with higher affinity to the antigen when compared with the initial or parental antibody (See, e.g., Glaser et al. (1992) \u201c-,\u201d J. Immunology 149:3903-3913). Mutagenizing entire codons rather than single nucleotides results in a semi-randomized repertoire of amino acid mutations. Libraries can be constructed consisting of a pool of variant clones each of which differs by a single amino acid alteration in a single CDR and which contain variants representing each possible amino acid substitution for each CDR residue. Mutants with increased binding affinity for the antigen can be screened by contacting the immobilized mutants with labeled antigen. Any screening method known in the art can be used to identify mutant antibodies with increased avidity to the antigen (e.g., ELISA) (See Wu et al. (1998) \u201c3-,\u201d Proc Natl. Acad Sci. USA 95:6037-6042; Yelton et al. (1995) \u201c96 --,\u201d J. Immunology 155:1994-2004). CDR walking, which randomizes the light chain, is also possible (See Schier et al. (1996) \u201c---2 -,\u201d J. Mol. Bio. 263:551-567).","Antibodies of the invention may be further characterized by epitope mapping, so that antibodies may be selected that have the greatest specificity for Fc\u03b3RIIB compared to Fc\u03b3RIIA. Epitope mapping methods of antibodies are well known in the art and encompassed within the methods of the invention. In certain embodiments fusion proteins comprising one or more regions of Fc\u03b3RIIB may be used in mapping the epitope of an antibody of the invention. In a specific embodiment, the fusion protein contains the amino acid sequence of a region of an Fc\u03b3RIIB fused to the Fc portion of human IgG2. Each fusion protein may further comprise amino acid substitutions and\/or replacements of certain regions of the receptor with the corresponding region from a homolog receptor, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIA, as shown in Table 4 below. pMGX125 and pMGX132 contain the IgG binding site of the Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor, the former with the C-terminus of Fc\u03b3RIIB and the latter with the C-terminus of Fc\u03b3RIIA and can be used to differentiate C-terminus binding. The others have Fc\u03b3RIIA substitutions in the IgG binding site and either the Fc\u03b3IIA or Fc\u03b3IIB N-terminus. These molecules can help determine the part of the receptor molecule where the antibodies bind.","Table 4 shows a list of the fusion proteins that may be used to investigate the epitope of the monoclonal anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies.

SPR is based on measuring the change in refractive index of the solvent near the surface that occurs upon complex formation or dissociation. The surface onto which the immobilization occurs is the sensor chip, which is at the heart of the SPR technology; it consists of a glass surface coated with a thin layer of gold and forms the basis for a range of specialized surfaces designed to optimize the binding of a molecule to the surface. A variety of sensor chips are commercially available especially from the companies listed supra, all of which may be used in the methods of the invention. Examples of sensor chips include those available from BIAcore AB, Inc., e.g., Sensor Chip CM5, SA, NTA, and HPA. A molecule of the invention may be immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip using any of the immobilization methods and chemistries known in the art, including but not limited to, direct covalent coupling via amine groups, direct covalent coupling via sulfhydryl groups, biotin attachment to avidin coated surface, aldehyde coupling to carbohydrate groups, and attachment through the histidine tag with NTA chips.","Antibodies of the invention may also be assayed using any fluorescence-based assays known in the art for characterizing the interaction of the antibody with Fc\u03b3RIIB. Specific binding of an antibody of the invention to Fc\u03b3RIIB may be determined, for example, using fluorescence-based methods including, but not limited to, resonance energy transer assays, anisotropy assays, quenching assays, flow cytometry assays, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy assays, two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy assays, third harmonic generation microscopy assays, coherent anti-stokes raman scattering microscopy assays, confocal scanning microscopy assays and fluorescent immunoassays, including, but not limited to, ELISA, etc. Such assays are routine and well-known in the art (see, e.g., PFS2Edition, 1999, Lakowicz (ed.); CSOMRIS1996, Corle et al. (eds.); and OIM: TAS2003, Torok et al. (eds.), herein incorporated by reference in their entireties).","The invention encompasses characterization of the antibodies produced by the methods of the invention using certain characterization assays for identifying the function of the antibodies of the invention, particularly the activity to modulate Fc\u03b3RIIB signaling. For example, characterization assays of the invention can measure phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the ITIM motif of Fc\u03b3RIIB, or measure the inhibition of B cell receptor-generated calcium mobilization. The characterization assays of the invention can be cell-based or cell-free assays.","It has been well established in the art that in mast cells coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB with the high affinity IgE receptor, Fc\u03b5RI, leads to inhibition of antigen-induced degranulation, calcium mobilization, and cytokine production (Metcalfe et al. (1997) \u201c,\u201d Physiol. Rev. 77:1033-1079; Long (1999) \u201c,\u201d Annu. Rev. Immunol. 17: 875-904). The molecular details of this signaling pathway have been recently elucidated (Ott (2002) \u201c62(), ,\u201d J. Immunol. 162(9):4430-4439). The molecular details of this signaling pathway have been recently elucidated (Ott (2002) \u201c62,\u201d J. Immunol. 168(9):4430-4439). Once coaggregated with Fc\u03b5RI, Fc\u03b3RIIB is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in its ITIM motif, and then recruits Src Homology-2 containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP), an SH2 domain-containing inosital polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, which is in turn phosphorylated and associates with Shc and p62(p62is the prototype of a family of adaptor molecules, which includes signaling domains such as an aminoterminal pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain), a PTB domain, and a carboxy terminal region containing PXXP motifs and numerous phosphorylation sites (Carpino et al. (1997) \u201c62(): --,\u201d Cell, 88: 197-204; Yamanashi et al. (1997) \u201c--62 ,\u201d Cell, 88:205-211).","The invention encompasses characterizing the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention in modulating one or more IgE mediated responses. Preferably, cells lines co-expressing the high affinity receptor for IgE and the low affinity receptor for Fc\u03b3RIIB will be used in characterizing the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention in modulating IgE mediated responses. In a specific embodiment, cells from a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-H23; Barsumian et al. (1981) \u201c-,\u201d Eur. J. Immunol. 11:317-323, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) transfected with full length human Fc\u03b3RIIB will be used in the methods of the invention. RBL-2H3 is a well characterized rat cell line that has been used extensively to study the signaling mechanisms following IgE-mediated cell activation. When expressed in RBL-2H3 cells and coaggregated with Fc\u03b5RI, Fc\u03b3RIIB inhibits Fc\u03b5RI-induced calcium mobilization, degranulation, and cytokine production (Malbec et al. (1998) \u201c--,\u201d J. Immunol. 160:1647-1658; Daeron et al. (1995) \u201c---,\u201d J. Clin. Invest. 95:577-585; Ott et al. (2002) \u201c62(), ,\u201d J. Immunol. 168:4430-4439).","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses characterizing the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention for inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI induced mast cell activation. For example, cells from a rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-H23; Barsumian et al. (1981) \u201c-,\u201d Eur. J. Immunol. 11:317-323) that have been transfected with Fc\u03b3RIIB are sensitized with IgE and stimulated either with F(ab\u2032)fragments of rabbit anti-mouse IgG, to aggregate Fc\u03b5RI alone, or with whole rabbit anti-mouse IgG to coaggregate Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI. In this system, indirect modulation of down stream signaling molecules can be assayed upon addition of antibodies of the invention to the sensitized and stimulated cells. For example, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and recruitment and phosphorylation of SHIP, activation of MAP kinase family members, including but not limited to Erk1, Erk2, JNK, or p38; and tyrosine phosphorylation of p62and its association with SHIP and RasGAP can be assayed.","One exemplary assay for determining the inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI induced mast cell activation by the antibodies of the invention can comprise the following: transfecting RBL-H23 cells with human Fc\u03b3RIIB; sensitizing the RBL-H23 cells with IgE; stimulating RBL-H23 cells with either F(ab\u2032)of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (to aggregate Fc\u03b5RI alone and elicit Fc\u03b5RI-mediated signaling, as a control), or stimulating RBL-H23 cells with whole rabbit anti-mouse IgG to (to coaggregate Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI, resulting in inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI-mediated signaling). Cells that have been stimulated with whole rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies can be further pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention. Measuring Fc\u03b5RI-dependent activity of cells that have been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention and cells that have not been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention, and comparing levels of Fc\u03b5RI-dependent activity in these cells, would indicate a modulation of Fc\u03b5RI-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention.","The exemplary assay described above can be for example, used to identify antibodies that block ligand (IgG) binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and antagonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI signaling by preventing coaggregating of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI. This assay likewise identifies antibodies that enhance coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI and agonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI signaling by promoting coaggregating of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI.","In a preferred embodiment, Fc\u03b5RI-dependent activity is at least one or more of the following: modulation of downstream signaling molecules (e.g., modulation of phosphorylation state of Fc\u03b3RIIB, modulation of SHIP recruitment, modulation of MAP Kinase activity, modulation of phosphorylation state of SHIP, modulation of SHIP and Shc association SHIP and Shc, modulation of the phosphorylation state of p62, modulation of p62and SHIP association, modulation of p62and RasGAP association, modulation of calcium mobilization, modulation of degranulation, and modulation of cytokine production. In yet another preferred embodiment, Fc\u03b5RI-dependent activity is serotonin release and\/or extracellular Ca influx and\/or IgE dependent mast cell activation. It is known to one skilled in the art that coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and FC\u03b5RI stimulates Fc\u03b3RIIB tyrosine phosphorylation, stimulates recruitment of SHIP, stimulates SHIP tyrosine phosphorylation and association with Shc, and inhibits activation of MAP kinase family members including, but not limited to, Erk1, Erk2, JNK, p38. It is also known to those skilled in the art that coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI stimulates enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of p62and its association with SHIP and RasGAP.","In some embodiments, the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention are characterized for their ability to modulate an IgE-mediated response by monitoring and\/or measuring degranulation of mast cells or basophils, preferably in a cell-based assay. Preferably, mast cells or basophils for use in such assays have been engineered to contain human Fc\u03b3RIIB using standard recombinant methods known to one skilled in the art. In a specific embodiment, the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention are characterized for their ability to modulate an IgE mediated response in a cell-based \u03b2-hexosaminidase (enzyme contained in the granules) release assay. \u03b2-hexosaminidase release from mast cells and basophils is a primary event in acute allergic and inflammatory condition (Aketani et al. (2001) \u201c-23 -,\u201d Immunol. Lett. 75: 185-189; Aketani et al. (2000) \u201c-,\u201d Anal. Chem. 72: 2653-2658). Release of other inflammatory mediators including but not limited to serotonin and histamine may be assayed to measure an IgE-mediated response in accordance with the methods of the invention. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, release of granules such as those containing \u03b2-hexosaminidase from mast cells and basophils is an intracellular calcium concentration dependent process that is initiated by the cross-linking of Fc\u03b5RIs with multivalent antigen.","One exemplary assay for characterizing the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention in mediating an IgE mediated response is a \u03b2-hexosaminidase release assay comprising the following: transfecting RBL-H23 cells with human Fc\u03b3RIIB; sensitizing the cells with mouse IgE alone or with mouse IgE and an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody of the invention; stimulating the cells with various concentrations of goat anti-mouse F(ab), preferably in a range from 0.03 \u03bcg\/mL to 30 \u03bcg\/mL for about 1 hour; collecting the supernatant; lysing the cells; and measuring the \u03b2-hexosaminidase activity released in the supernatant by a colorometric assay, e.g., using p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminide. The released \u03b2-hexosaminidase activity is expressed as a percentage of the released activity to the total activity. The released \u03b2-hexosaminidase activity will be measured and compared in cells treated with antigen alone; IgE alone; IgE and an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody of the invention. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, once cells are sensitized with mouse IgE alone and challenged with F(ab)fragments of a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG, aggregation and cross linking of Fc\u03b5RI occurs since the polyclonal antibody recognizes the light chain of the murine IgE bound to the Fc\u03b5RI; which in turn leads to mast cell activation and degranulation. On the other hand, when cells are sensitized with mouse IgE and an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody of the invention and challenged with F(ab)fragments of a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG; cross linking of Fc\u03b5RI and Fc\u03b3RIIB occurs, resulting in inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI-induced degranulation. In either case, goat anti mouse F(ab)induces a dose-dependent \u03b2-hexoaminidase release. In some embodiments, the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies bound to the Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and cross linked to Fc\u03b5RI do not affect the activation of the inhibitory pathway, i.e., there is no alteration in the level of degranulation in the presence of an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody. In other embodiments, the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies mediate a stronger activation of the inhibitory receptor, Fc\u03b3RIIB, when bound by the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody, allowing effective cross-linking to Fc\u03b5RI and activation of the inhibitory pathway of homo-aggregated Fc\u03b3RIIB.","The invention also encompasses characterizing the effect of the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention on IgE mediated cell response using calcium mobilization assays using methodologies known to one skilled in the art. An exemplary calcium mobilization assay may comprise the following: priming basophils or mast cells with IgE; incubating the cells with a calcium indicator, e.g., Fura 2; stimulating cells as described supra; and monitoring and\/or quantitating intracellular calcium concentration for example by using flow cytometry. The invention encompasses monitoring and\/or quantitating intracellular calcium concentration by any method known to one skilled in the art see, e.g., Aketani et al. (2001) \u201c-23 -,\u201d Immunology Letters 75:185-189; Oka et al. (2002) \u201c---23 ,\u201d British J. of Pharm. 136:837-845; Ott et al. (2002) \u201c62,\u201d J. Immunol. 168:4430-4439 and Mahmoud et al. (2001) \u201c-23 ,\u201d J. Cell Biol., 153(2):339-350; all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","In preferred embodiments, anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention inhibit IgE mediated cell activation. In other embodiments, the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention block the inhibitory pathways regulated by Fc\u03b3RIIB or block the ligand binding site on Fc\u03b3RIIB and thus enhance immune response.","The ability to study human mast cells has been limited by the absence of suitable long term human mast cell cultures. Recently two novel stem cell factor dependent human mast cell lines, designated LAD 1 and LAD2, were established from bone marrow aspirates from a patient with mast cell sarcoma\/leukemia. (Kirshenbaum et al. (2003) \u201c1 2 ,\u201d Leukemia research, 27(8):677-682, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) Both cell lines have been described to express Fc\u03b5RI and several human mast cell markers. The invention encompasses using LAD 1 and 2 cells in the methods of the invention for assessing the effect of the antibodies of the invention on IgE mediated responses. In a specific embodiment, cell-based \u03b2-hexosaminidase release assays such as those described supra may be used in LAD cells to determine any modulation of the IgE-mediated response by the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention. In an exemplary assay, human mast cells, e.g., LAD 1, are primed with chimaeric human IgE anti-nitrophenol (NP) and challenged with BSA-NP, the polyvalent antigen, and cell degranulation is monitored by measuring the \u03b2-hexosaminidase released in the supernatant (Kirshenbaum et al. (2003) \u201c1 2 ,\u201d Leukemia research, 27(8):677-682, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","In some embodiments, if human mast cells have a low expression of endogenous Fc\u03b3RIIB, as determined using standard methods known in the art, e.g., FACS staining, it may be difficult to monitor and\/or detect differences in the activation of the inhibitory pathway mediated by the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention. The invention thus encompasses alternative methods, whereby the Fc\u03b3RIIB expression may be upregulated using cytokines and particular growth conditions. Fc\u03b3RIIB has been described to be highly up-regulated in human monocyte cell lines, e.g., THP1 and U937, (Tridandapani et al. (2002) \u201c,\u201d J. Biol. Chem., 277(7): 5082-5089) and in primary human monocytes (Pricop et al. (2001) \u201c1 2 ,\u201d J. Immunol., 166: 531-537) by IL4. Differentiation of U937 cells with dibutyryl cyclic AMP has been described to increase expression of Fc\u03b3RII (Cameron et al. (2002) \u201c937,\u201d Immunology Letters 83, 171-179). Thus, the endogenous Fc\u03b3RIIB expression in human mast cells for use in the methods of the invention may be up-regulated using cytokines, e.g., IL-4, IL-13, in order to enhance sensitivity of detection.","The invention also encompasses characterizing the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention for inhibition of B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling. BCR-mediated signaling can include at least one or more down stream biological responses, such as activation and proliferation of B cells, antibody production, etc. Coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and BCR leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression and cellular survival. Further, coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and BCR leads to inhibition of BCR-mediated signaling.","Specifically, BCR-mediated signaling comprises at least one or more of the following: modulation of down stream signaling molecules (e.g., phosphorylation state of Fc\u03b3RIIB, SHIP recruitment, localization of Btk and\/or PLC\u03b3, MAP kinase activity, recruitment of Akt (anti-apoptotic signal), calcium mobilization, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation.","Although numerous effector functions of Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling are mediated through SHIP, recently it has been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated B cells from SHIP deficient mice exhibit significant Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of calcium mobilization, Ins(1,4,5)Pproduction, and Erk and Akt phosphorylation (Brauweiler et al (2001) \u201c,\u201d J. Immunol. 167(1): 204-211). Accordingly, ex vivo B cells from SHIP deficient mice can be used to characterize the antibodies of the invention. One exemplary assay for determining Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling by the antibodies of the invention can comprise the following: isolating splenic B cells from SHIP deficient mice, activating said cells with lipopolysachharide, and stimulating said cells with either F(ab\u2032)anti-IgM to aggregate BCR or with anti-IgM to coaagregate BCR with Fc\u03b3RIIB. Cells that have been stimulated with intact anti-IgM to coaggregate BCR with Fc\u03b3RIIB can be further pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention. Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity of cells can be measured by standard techniques known in the art. Comparing the level of Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity in cells that have been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention and cells that have not been pre-incubated, and comparing the levels would indicate a modulation of Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention.","Measuring Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity can include, for example, measuring intracellular calcium mobilization by flow cytometry, measuring phosphorylation of Akt and\/or Erk, measuring BCR-mediated accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P, or measuring Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated proliferation B cells.","The assays can be used, for example, to identify antibodies that modulate Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling by blocking the ligand (IgG) binding site to Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and antagonizing Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling by preventing coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and BCR. The assays can also be used to identify antibodies that enhance coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and BCR and agonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling.","The invention relates to characterizing the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention for Fc\u03b3RII-mediated signaling in human monocytes\/macrophages. Coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB with a receptor bearing the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) acts to down-regulate Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis using SHIP as its effector (Tridandapani et al. (2002) \u201c,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 277(7):5082-5089). Coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIA with Fc\u03b3RIIB results in rapid phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue on Fc\u03b3RIIB's ITIM motif, leading to an enhancement in phosphorylation of SHIP, association of SHIP with Shc, and phosphorylation of proteins having the molecular weight of 120 and 60-65 kDa. In addition, coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIA with Fc\u03b3RIIB results in down-regulation of phosphorylation of Akt, which is a serine-threonine kinase that is involved in cellular regulation and serves to suppress apoptosis.","The invention further encompasses characterizing the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention for their inhibition of Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes\/macrophages. For example, cells from a human monocytic cell line, THP-1 can be stimulated either with Fab fragments of mouse monoclonal antibody IV.3 against Fc\u03b3RII and goat anti-mouse antibody (to aggregate Fc\u03b3RIIA alone), or with whole IV.3 mouse monoclonal antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to coaggregate Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB). In this system, modulation of down stream signaling molecules, such as tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc\u03b3RIIB, phosphorylation of SHIP, association of SHIP with Shc, phosphorylation of Akt, and phosphorylation of proteins having the molecular weight of 120 and 60-65 kDa can be assayed upon addition of antibodies of the invention to the stimulated cells. In addition, Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent phagocytic efficiency of the monocyte cell line can be directly measured in the presence and absence of the antibodies of the invention.","Another exemplary assay for determining inhibition of Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes\/macrophages by the antibodies of the invention can comprise the following: stimulating THP-1 cells with either Fab of IV.3 mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to aggregate Fc\u03b3RIIA alone and elicit Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated signaling); or with mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody (to coaggregate Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB and inhibiting Fc\u03b3RIIA-mediated signaling. Cells that have been stimulated with mouse anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody can be further pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention. Measuring Fc\u03b3RIIA-dependent activity of stimulated cells that have been pre-incubated with antibodies of the invention and cells that have not been pre-incubated with the antibodies of the invention and comparing levels of Fc\u03b3RIIA-dependent activity in these cells would indicate a modulation of Fc\u03b3RIIA-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention.","The exemplary assay described can be used for example, to identify antibodies that block ligand binding of Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and antagonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling by preventing coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIA. This assay likewise identifies antibodies that enhance coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIA and agonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling.","In another embodiment of the invention, the invention relates to characterizing the function of the antibodies of the invention by measuring the ability of THP-1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG-opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by methods previously described (Tridandapani et al. (2000) \u201c-,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 275: 20480-20487). For example, an exemplary assay for measuring phagocytosis comprises of: treating THP-1 cells with the antibodies of the invention or with a control antibody that does not bind to Fc\u03b3RII, comparing the activity levels of said cells, wherein a difference in the activities of the cells (e.g., rosetting activity (the number of THP-1 cells binding IgG-coated SRBC), adherence activity (the total number of SRBC bound to THP-1 cells), and phagocytic rate) would indicate a modulation of Fc\u03b3RIIA-dependent activity by the antibodies of the invention. This assay can be used to identify, for example, antibodies that block ligand binding of Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor and antagonize Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This assay can also identify antibodies that enhance Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated inhibition of Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling.","In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention modulate Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent activity in human monocytes\/macrophages in at least one or more of the following ways: modulation of downstream signaling molecules (e.g., modulation of phosphorylation state of Fc\u03b3RIIB, modulation of SHIP phosphorylation, modulation of SHIP and Shc association, modulation of phosphorylation of Akt, modulation of phosphorylation of additional proteins around 120 and 60-65 kDa) and modulation of phagocytosis.","The invention encompasses characterization of the antibodies of the invention using assays known to those skilled in the art for identifying the effect of the antibodies on effector cell function of therapeutic antibodies, e.g., their ability to enhance tumor-specific ADCC activity of therapeutic antibodies. Therapeutic antibodies that may be used in accordance with the methods of the invention include but are not limited to anti-tumor antibodies, anti-viral antibodies, anti-microbial antibodies (e.g., bacterial and unicellular parasites), examples of which are disclosed herein. In particular, the invention encompasses characterizing the antibodies of the invention for their effect on Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector cell function of therapeutic antibodies, e.g., tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies. Examples of effector cell functions that can be assayed in accordance with the invention, include but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, opsonization, opsonophagocytosis, C1q binding, and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Any cell-based or cell free assay known to those skilled in the art for determining effector cell function activity can be used (For effector cell assays, see Perussia et al.

(2000) \u201c--() () ,\u201d Methods Mol. Biol. 121: 179-192). \u201cAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\u201d and \u201cADCC\u201d as used herein carry their ordinary and customary meaning in the art and refer to an in vitro cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc\u03b3Rs (e.g., monocytic cells such as Natural Killer (NK) cells and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. In principle, any effector cell with an activating Fc\u03b3R can be triggered to mediate ADCC. The primary cells for mediating ADCC are NK cells which express only Fc\u03b3RIII, whereas monocytes, depending on their state of activation, localization, or differentiation, can express Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3RIII. For a review of Fc\u03b3R expression on hematopoietic cells see, e.g., Ravetch et al. (1991) \u201c,\u201d Annu. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-492, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more Fc\u03b3Rs and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least Fc\u03b3RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Effector cells that may be used in the methods of the invention include but are not limited to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof, e.g., from blood or PBMCs as described herein. Preferably, the effector cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention are peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that are preferably purified from normal human blood, using standard methods known to one skilled in the art, e.g., using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. For example, PBMCs may be isolated by layering whole blood onto Ficoll-Hypaque and spinning the cells at 500 g, at room temperature for 30 minutes. The leukocyte layer can be harvested as effector cells. Other effector cells that may be used in the ADCC assays of the invention include but are not limited to monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). MDMs that are used as effector cells in the methods of the invention, are preferably obtained as frozen stocks or used fresh, (e.g., from Advanced Biotechnologies, MD). In most preferred embodiments, elutriated human monocytes are used as effector cells in the methods of the invention. Elutriated human monocytes express activating receptors, Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIA and the inhibitory receptor, Fc\u03b3RIIB. Human monocytes are commercially available and may be obtained as frozen stocks, thawed in basal medium containing 10% human AB serum or in basal medium with human serum containing cytokines. Levels of expression of Fc\u03b3Rs in the cells may be directly determined; e.g. using FACS analysis. Alternatively, cells may also be allowed to mature to macrophages in culture. The level of Fc\u03b3RIIB expression may be increased in macrophages. Antibodies that may be used in determining the expression level of Fc\u03b3Rs include but are not limited to anti-human Fc\u03b3RIIA antibodies, e.g., IV.3-FITC; anti-Fc\u03b3RI antibodies, e.g., 32.2 FITC; and anti-Fc\u03b3RIIIA antibodies, e.g., 3G8-PE.","Target cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention include, but are not limited to, breast cancer cell lines, e.g., SK-BR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-30 (see, e.g., Tremp et al. (1976) \u201c,\u201d Recent Results Cancer Res. 57:33-41); B-lymphocytes; cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma, e.g., Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL-86 (see, e.g., Epstein et al. (1965) \u201c(1) ,\u201d J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 34: 231-240), Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL-213 (see, e.g., Klein et al. (1968) \u201c-,\u201d Cancer Res. 28: 1300-1310); ovarian carcinoma cell lines, e.g., OVCAR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-161 (see, e.g., Hamilton et al. (1983) \u201c(-3) ,\u201d Cancer Res. 43(11):5379-5389), SK-OV-3, PA-1, CAOV3, OV-90, and IGROV-1, available from the NCI repository. (See, Benard et al. (1985) \u201c1,\u201d Cancer Research, 45:4970-4979; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) The target cells must be recognized by the antigen binding site of the antibody to be assayed. The target cells for use in the methods of the invention may have low, medium, or high expression level of a cancer antigen. The expression levels of the cancer antigen may be determined using common methods known to one skilled in the art, e.g., FACS analysis. For example, the invention encompasses the use of ovarian cancer cells such as IGROV-1, wherein Her2\/neu is expressed at different levels, or OV-CAR-3 (ATCC Assession Number HTB-161; characterized by a lower expression of Her2\/neu than SK-BR-3, the breast carcinoma cell line). Other ovarian carcinoma cell lines that may be used as target cells in the methods of the invention include OVCAR-8 (Hamilton et al. (1983) \u201c(-3) ,\u201d Cancer Res. 43(11):5379-5389, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety); SK-OV-3 (ATCC Accession Number HTB-77); Caov-3 (ATCC Accession Number HTB-75); PA-1 (ATCC Accession Number CRL-1572); OV-90 (ATCC Accession Number CRL-11732); and OVCAR-4. Other breast cancer cell lines that may be used in the methods of the invention include BT-549 (ATCC Accession Number HTB-122), MCF7 (ATCC Accession Number HTB-22), and Hs578T (ATCC Accession Number HTB-126), all of which are available from the NCI repository and ATCC and incorporated herein by reference. Other cell lines that may be used in the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to: CCRF-CEM (leukemia); HL-60 (TB, leukemia); MOLT-4 (leukemia); RPMI-8226 (leukemia); SR (leukemia); A549 (Non-small cell lung); EKVX (Non-small cell lung); HOP-62 (Non-small cell lung); HOP-92 (Non-small cell lung); NCl-H226 (Non-small cell lung); NCl-H23 (Non-small cell lung); NCl-H322M (Non-small cell lung); NCl-H460 (Non-small cell lung); NCl-H522 (Non-small cell lung); COLO 205 (Colon); HCC-2998 (Colon); HCT-116 (Colon); HCT-15 (Colon); HT29 (Colon); KM12 (Colon); SW-620 (Colon); SF-268 (CNS); SF-295 (CNS); SF-539 (CNS); SNB-19 (CNS); SNB-75 (CNS); U251 (CNS); LOX 1MV1 (Melanoma); MALME-3M (Melanoma); M14 (Melanoma); SK-MEL-2 (Melanoma); SK-MEL-28 (Melanoma); SK-MEL-5 (Melanoma); UACC-257 (Melanoma); UACC-62 (Melanoma); IGR-OV1 (Ovarian); OVCAR-3, 4, 5, 8 (Ovarian); SK-OV-3 (Ovarian); 786-0 (Renal); A498 (Renal); ACHN (Renal); CAK1-1 (Renal); SN12C(Renal); TK-10 (Renal); UO-31 (Renal); PC-3C (Prostate); DU-145 (Prostate); NCl\/ADR-RES (Breast); MDA-MB-231\/ATCC (Breast); MDA-MB-435 (Breast); DMS 114 (Small-cell lung); and SHP-77 (Small-cell lung); all of which are available from the NCl and incorporated herein by reference.","An exemplary assay for determining the effect of the antibodies of the invention on the ADCC activity of therapeutic antibodies is based on a Cr release assay comprising: labeling target cells with [Cr]NaCrO(this cell-membrane permeable molecule is commonly used for labeling since it binds cytoplasmic proteins and although spontaneously released from the cells with slow kinetics, it is released massively following target cell lysis); preferably, the target cells express one or more tumor antigens, osponizing the target cells with one or more antibodies that immunospecifically bind the tumor antigens expressed on the cell surface of the target cells, in the presence and absence of an antibody of the invention, e.g., 2B6, 3H7, combining the opsonized radiolabeled target cells with effector cells in a microtitre plate at an appropriate ratio of target cells to effector cells; incubating the mixture of cells preferably for 16-18 hours, preferably at 37\u00b0 C.; collecting supernatants; and analyzing the radioactivity in the supernatant samples. The cytotoxicity of the therapeutic antibodies in the presence and absence of the antibodies of the invention can then be determined, for example using the following formula: Percent specific lysis=(Experimental lysis-antibody-independent lysis\/maximal lysis\u2014antibody independent lysis)\u00d7100%. A graph can be generated by varying either the target: effector cell ratio or antibody concentration.","In yet another embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are characterized for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in accordance with the method described earlier, see, e.g., Ding et al. (1998) \u201c-2,\u201d Immunity 8:403-411; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses characterizing the function of the antibodies of the invention in enhancing ADCC activity of therapeutic antibodies in an in vitro based assay and\/or in an animal model.","In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses determining the function of the antibodies of the invention in enhancing tumor specific ADCC using an ovarian cancer model and\/or breast cancer model.","Preferably, the ADCC assays of the invention are performed using more than one cancer cell line, characterized by the expression of at least one cancer antigen, wherein the expression level of the cancer antigen is varied among the cancer cell lines used. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, performing ADCC assays in more than one cell line wherein the expression level of the cancer antigen is varied, will allow determination of stringency of tumor clearance of the antibodies of the invention. In one embodiment, the ADCC assays of the invention are done using cancer cell lines with different levels of expression of a cancer antigen.","In an exemplary assay, OVCAR3, an ovarian carcinoma cell line can serve as the tumor target expressing the tumor antigens, Her2\/neu and TAG-72; human monocytes, that express the activating Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIA and inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIB, can be used as effectors; and tumor specific murine antibodies, ch4D5 and chCC49, can be used as the tumor specific antibodies. OVCAR-3 cells are available from ATCC (Accession Number HTB-161). Preferably, OVCAR-3 cells are propagated in medium supplemented with 0.01 mg\/ml bovine insulin. 5\u00d710viable OVCAR-3 cells may be injected subcutaneously (s.c) into age and weight matched nude athymic mice with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). The estimated weight of the tumor can be calculated by the formula: length-(width)\/2, and preferably does not exceed 3 grams. Anchorage-dependent tumor can be isolated after 6-8 weeks, and the cells can be dissociated by adding 1 \u03bcg of Collagenase (Sigma) per gram of tumor and a 5 mg\/mL RNase, passed through a cell strainer and nylon mesh to isolate cells. Cells can then be frozen for long-term storage for s.c. injection for establishment of the xenograft model.","Hybridomas secreting CC49 and 4D5 antibodies are available with ATCC Accession Numbers HB-9459 and CRL-3D463 and the heavy chain and light chain nucleotide sequences are in the public domain (Murray et al. (1994) \u201c131-49 ,\u201d Cancer 73 (35):1057-1066, Yamamoto et al. (1986) \u201c---2 ,\u201d Nature, 319:230-234; both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Preferably, the 4D5 and CC49 antibodies are chimerized using standard methods known to one skilled in the art so that the human Fc sequence, e.g., human constant region of IgG1, is grafted onto the variable region of the murine antibodies in order to provide the effector function. The chimeric 4D5 and CC49 antibodies bind via their variable region to the target cell lines and via their Fc region to Fc\u03b3Rs expressed on human effector cells. CC49 is directed to TAG-72; a high molecular weight mucin that is highly expressed on many adenocarcinoma cells and ovarian carcinoma (Lottich et al. (1985) \u201c--72,\u201d Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 6(1):49-56; Mansi et al. (1989) \u201c131I-B72.3,\u201d Int. J. Rad. Appl. Instrum B. 16(2):127-135; Colcher et al. (1991) \u201c-72,\u201d Int. J. Rad. Appl. Instrum B. 18:395-441; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). 4D5 is directed to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Carter et al. (1992) \u201c-1852 ,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4285-4289 which is incorporated herein by reference). Antibodies of the invention can then be utilized to investigate the enhancement of ADCC activity of the tumor specific antibodies, by blocking the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIB. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, upon activation of effector cells that express at least one activating Fc\u03b3R, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIA, the expression of the inhibitory receptor (Fc\u03b3RIIB) is enhanced and this limits the clearance of tumors as the ADCC activity of Fc\u03b3RIIA is suppressed. However, antibodies of the invention can serve as a blocking antibody, i.e., an antibody that will prevent the inhibitory signal from being activated and thus the activation signal, e.g., ADCC activity, will be sustained for a longer period and may result in potent tumor clearance.","Preferably, the antibodies of the invention for use in enhancement of ADCC activity have been modified to comprise at least one amino acid modification, so that their binding to Fc\u03b3R has been diminished, most preferably abolished. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention have been modified to comprise at least one amino acid modification that reduces the binding of the constant domain to an activating Fc\u03b3R, e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIA, as compared to a wild type antibody of the invention while retaining maximal Fc\u03b3RIIB blocking activity. Antibodies of the invention may be modified in accordance with any method known to one skilled in the art or disclosed herein. Any amino acid modification which is known to disrupt effector function may be used in accordance with the methods of the invention such as those disclosed in U.S. Application Ser. Nos. 60\/439,498 (filed Jan. 9, 2003); and 60\/456,041 (filed Mar. 19, 2003); both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are modified so that position 265 is modified, e.g., position 265 is substituted with alanine. In preferred embodiments, the murine constant region of an antibody of the invention is swapped with the corresponding human constant region comprising a substitution of the amino acid at position 265 with alanine, so that the effector function is abolished while Fc\u03b3RIIB blocking activity is maintained. A single amino acid change at position 265 of IgG1 heavy chain has been shown to significantly reduce binding to Fc\u03b3R based on ELISA assays and has resulted in tumor mass reduction. (Shields et al. (2001) \u201c1 1 276(9):6591-604; and Clynes et al. (2000) \u201c,\u201d Nature Medicine 6(4):443-446; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) In other embodiments, antibodies of the invention are modified so that position 297 is modified, e.g., position 297 is substituted with glutamine, so that the N-linked glycosylation site is eliminated (see, e.g., Jefferis et al. (1995) \u201c,\u201d Immunol. Lett. 44(2-3):111-117; Lund et al. (1996) \u201c,\u201d J. Immunol., 157:4963-4969; Wright et al. (1994) \u201c2--1,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 180:1087-1096; White et al. (1997) \u201c-,\u201d J. Immunol. 158:426-435; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Modification at this site has been reported to abolish all interaction with Fc\u03b3Rs. In preferred embodiments, the murine constant region of an antibody of the invention is swapped with the corresponding human constant region comprising a substitution of the amino acid at position 265 and\/or 297, so that the effector function is abolished while Fc\u03b3RIIB blocking activity is maintained.","An exemplary assay for determining the ADCC activity of the tumor specific antibodies in the presence and absence of the antibodies of the invention is a non-radioactive europium based fluorescent assay (BATDA, Perkin Elmer) and may comprise the following: labeling the targets cells with an acteoxylmethyl ester of fluorescence-enhancing ester that forms a hydrophilic ligand (TDA) with the membrane of cells by hydrolysis of the esters; this complex is unable to leave the cell and is released only upon lysis of the cell by the effectors; adding the labeled targets to the effector cells in presence of anti-tumor antibodies and an antibody of the invention; incubating the mixture of the target and effector cells a for 6 to 16 hours, preferably at 37\u00b0 C. The extent of ADCC activity can be assayed by measuring the amount of ligand that is released and interacts with europium (DELFIA\u00ae reagent; PerkinElmer). The ligand and the europium form a very stable and highly fluorescent chelate (EuTDA) and the measured fluorescence is directly proportional to the number of cells lysed. Percent specific lysis can be calculated using the formula: (Experimental lysis-antibody-independent lysis\/maximal lysis antibody-independent lysis\u00d7100%).","In some embodiments, if the sensitivity of the fluorescence-based ADCC assay is too low to detect ADCC activity of the therapeutic antibodies, the invention encompasses radioactive-based ADCC assays, such as Cr release assay. Radioactive-based assays may be done instead of or in combination with fluorescent-based ADCC assays.","An exemplary Cr release assay for characterizing the antibodies of the invention can comprise the following: labeling 1-2\u00d710target cells such as OVCAR-3 cells with Cr; opsonizing the target cells with antibodies 4D5 and CC49 in the presence and absence of an antibody of the invention and adding 5\u00d710cells to 96 well plate. Preferably 4D5 and CC49 are at a concentration varying from 1-15 \u03bcg\/mL; adding the opsonized target cells to monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) (effector cells); preferably at a ratio varying from 10:1 to 100:1; incubating the mixture of cells for 16-18 hours at 37\u00b0 C.; collecting supernatants; and analyzing the radioactivity in the supernatant. The cytotoxicity of 4D5 and CC49 in the presence and absence of an antibody of the invention can then be determined, for example using the following formula percent specific lysis=(experimental lysis\u2212antibody independent lysis\/maximal lysis\u2212antibody independent lysis)\u00d7100%.","In some embodiments, the in vivo activity of the Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies of the invention is determined in xenograft human tumor models. Tumors may be established using any of the cancer cell lines described supra. In some embodiments, the tumors will be established with two cancer cell lines, wherein the first cancer cell line is characterized by a low expression of a cancer antigen and a second cancer cell line, wherein the second cancer cell line is characterized by a high expression of the same cancer antigen. Tumor clearance may then be determined using methods known to one skilled in the art, using an anti-tumor antibody which immunospecifically binds the cancer antigen on the first and second cancer cell line, and an appropriate mouse model, e.g., a Balb\/c nude mouse model (e.g., Jackson Laboratories, Taconic), with adoptively transferred human monocytes and MDMs as effector cells. Any of the antibodies described supra may then be tested in this animal model to evaluate the role of anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody of the invention in tumor clearance. Mice that may be used in the invention include, for example, Fc\u03b3RIII\u2212\/\u2212 (where Fc\u03b3RIIIA is knocked out); Fc\u03b3\u2212\/\u2212nude mice (where Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIIA are knocked out); or human Fc\u03b3RIIB knock in mice or a transgenic knock-in mice, where mouse fcgr2 and fcgr3 loci on chromosome 1 are inactivated and the mice express human Fc\u03b3RIIA, human Fc\u03b3RIIA human Fc\u03b3RIIB, human Fc\u03b3RIIC, human Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and human Fc\u03b3RIIIB.","An exemplary method for testing the in vivo activity of an antibody of the invention may comprise the following: establishing a xenograft murine model using a cancer cell line characterized by the expression of a cancer antigen and determining the effect of an antibody of the invention on an antibody specific for the cancer antigen expressed in the cancer cell line in mediating tumor clearance. Preferably, the in vivo activity is tested parallel using two cancer cell lines, wherein the first cancer cell line is characterized by a first cancer antigen expressed at low levels and a second cancer cell line, characterized by the same cancer antigen expressed at a higher level relative to the first cancer cell line. These experiments will thus increase the stringency of the evaluation of the role of an antibody of the invention in tumor clearance. For example, tumors may be established with the IGROV-1 cell line and the effect of an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody of the invention in tumor clearance of a Her2\/neu specific antibody may be assessed. In order to establish the xenograft tumor models, 5\u00d710viable cells, e.g., IGROV-1, SKBR3, may be injected, e.g., s.c. into mice, e.g., 8 age and weight matched femal nude athymic mice using for example Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). The estimated weight of the tumor may be determined by the formula: length\u00d7(width)\/2; and preferably does not exceed 3 grams. Injection of IGROV-1 cells s.c. gives rise to fast growing tumors while the i.p. route induces a peritoneal carcinomatosis which kills mice in 2 months (Benard et al. (1985) \u201c1,\u201d Cancer Research, 45:4970-4979). Since the IGROV-1 cells form tumors within 5 weeks, at day 1 after tumor cell injection, monocytes as effectors are co-injected i.p. along with a therapeutic antibody specific for Her2\/neu, e.g., Ch4D5, and an antibody of the invention; e.g. chimeric 2B6 or 3H7 as described supra. Preferably, the antibodies are injected at 4 \u03bcg each per gram of mouse body weight (mbw). The initial injection will be followed by weekly injections of antibodies for 4-6 weeks thereafter at 2 \u03bcg\/wk. Human effector cells will be replenished once in 2 weeks. A group of mice will receive no therapeutic antibody but will be injected with a chimeric 4D5 comprising a N297A mutation and human IgG1 as isotype control antibodies for the anti-tumor and anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies, respectively. Mice may be placed in groups of 4 and monitored three times weekly.","Table 5 below is an exemplary setup for tumor clearance studies in accordance with the invention. As shown in Table 5, six groups of 8 mice each will be needed for testing the role of an antibody of the invention in tumor clearance, wherein one target and effector cell combination is used and wherein two different combinations of the antibody concentration are used. In group A, only tumor cells are injected; in group B tumor cells and monocytes are injected; in group C, tumor cells, monocytes, an anti-tumor antibody (ch4D5) are injected; in group D, tumor cells, monocytes, anti-tumor antibody, and an anti-Fc\u03b3RII antibody are injected; in group E, tumor cells, monocytes and an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody are injected; in group F, tumor cells, monocytes, Ch4D5 (297Q), and human IgG1 are injected. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that various antibody concentrations of various antibody combinations may be tested in the tumor models described. Preferably, studies using a breast cancer cell line, e.g., SKBR3, is carried out in parallel to the above-described experiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0408","num":"0452"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00020","num":"00020"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Exemplary Experimental Set Up In Mice"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"ch4D5","ch2B6","Human"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"ch4D5","(N297Q at","(N297Q at","(IgG1 4 \u03bcg\/gm"]},{"entry":["8 mice","Tumor",{},"(4 \u03bcg\/gm","4 \u03bcg\/gm of","4 \u03bcg\/gm","of"]},{"entry":["per","cell s.c","Monocytes","of mbw","mbw day 1","of mbw","mbw day 1"]},{"entry":["group","day 0","i.p at day 1","day 1 i.p.)","i.p.)","day 1 i.p.)","i.p.)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["A","+","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212"]},{"entry":["B","+","+","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212"]},{"entry":["C","+","+","+","\u2212","\u2212","\u2212"]},{"entry":["D","+","+","+","\u2212","+","\u2212"]},{"entry":["E","+","+","\u2212","\u2212","+","\u2212"]},{"entry":["F","+","+","\u2212","+","\u2212","+"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The endpoint of the xenograft tumor models is determined based on the size of the tumors, weight of mice, survival time and histochemical and histopathological examination of the cancer, using methods known to one skilled in the art.

Criteria for tumor growth may be abdominal distention, presence of palpable mass in the peritoneal cavity. Preferably, estimates of tumor weight versus days after inoculation will be calculated.

The resulting murine effector cells will express endogenous activating Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIIA and inhibitory human Fc\u03b3RIIB receptors.","The in vivo activity of the antibodies of the invention may be further tested in a xenograft murine model with human primary tumor derived cells, such as human primary ovarian and breast carcinoma derived cells. Ascites and pleural effusion samples from cancer patients may be tested for expression of Her2\/neu, using methods known to one skilled in the art. Samples from ovarian carcinoma patients may be processed by spinning down the ascites at 6370 g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., lysing the red blood cells, and washing the cells with PBS. Once the expression of Her2\/neu in tumor cells is determined, two samples, a median and a high expressor may be selected for s.c. inoculation to establish the xenograft tumor model. The isolated tumor cells will then be injected i.p. into mice to expand the cells. Approximately 10 mice may be injected i.p. and each mouse ascites further passaged into two mice to obtain ascites from a total of 20 mice which can be used to inject a group of 80 mice. Pleural effusion samples may be processed using a similar method as ascites. The Her2\/neu+ tumor cells from pleural effusion samples may be injected into the upper right & left mammary pads of the mice.","In some embodiments, if the percentage of neoplastic cells in the ascites or pleural effusion samples is low compared to other cellular subsets, the neoplastic cells may be expanded in vitro. In other embodiments, tumor cells may be purified using CC49 antibody (anti-TAG-72)-coated magnetic beads as described previously, see, e.g., Barker et al. (2001) \u201c--,\u201d Gynecol. Oncol. 82:57-63, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, magnetic beads coated with CC49 antibody can be used to separate the ovarian tumor cells that will be detached from the beads by an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C. In some embodiments, if the tumor cells lack the TAG-72 antigen, negative depletion using a cocktail of antibodies, such as those provided by Stem Cell Technologies, Inc., Canada, may be used to enrich the tumor cells.","In other embodiments, other tumors markers besides Her2\/neu may be used to separate tumor cells obtained from the ascites and pleural effusion samples from non-tumor cells. In the case of pleural effusion or breast tissue, it has been recently reported that CD44 (an adhesion molecule), B38.1(a breast\/ovarian cancer-specific marker), CD24 (an adhesion molecule) may be used as markers, see, e.g., Al Hajj, et al. (2003) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:3983-3988; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Once tumor cells are purified they may be injected s.c. into mice for expansion.","Preferably, immunohistochemistry and histochemistry is performed on ascites and pleural effusion of patients to analyze structural characteristics of the neoplasia. Such methods are known to one skilled in the art and encompassed within the invention. The markers that may be monitored include for example cytokeratin (to identify ovarian neoplastic and mesothelial cells from inflammatory and mesenchymal cells); calretinin (to separate mesothelial from Her2neu positive neoplastic cells); and CD45 (to separate inflammatory cells from the rest of the cell population in the samples). Additional markers that may be followed include CD3 (T cells), CD20 (B cells), CD56 (NK cells), and CD14 (monocytes). It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the immunohistochemistry and histochemistry methods described supra, are analogously applied to any tumor cell for use in the methods of the invention. After s.c. inoculation of tumor cells, mice are followed for clinical and anatomical changes. As needed, mice may be necropsied to correlate total tumor burden with specific organ localization.","In a specific embodiment, tumors are established using carcinoma cell lines such as IGROV-1, OVCAR-8, SK-B, and OVCAR-3 cells and human ovarian carcinoma ascites and pleural effusion from breast cancer patients. The ascites preferably contain both the effectors and the tumor targets for the antibodies being tested. Human monocytes will be transferred as effectors.","The in vivo activity of the antibodies of the invention may also be tested in an animal model, e.g., Balb\/c nude mice, injected with cells expressing Fc Fc\u03b3RIIB, including but not limited to SK-BR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-30 (see, e.g., Tremp et al. (1976) \u201c,\u201d Recent Results Cancer Res. 57:33-41); B-lymphocytes; cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma, e.g., Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL-86 (see, e.g., Epstein et al. (1965) \u201c(1) ,\u201d J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 34: 231-240), Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL-213 (see, e.g., Klein et al. (1968) \u201c-,\u201d Cancer Res. 28: 1300-1310); ovarian carcinoma cell lines, e.g., OVCAR-3 with ATCC accession number HTB-161 (see, e.g., Hamilton et al. (1983) \u201c(-3) ,\u201d Cancer Res. 43(11):5379-5389), SK-OV-3, PA-1, CAOV3, OV-90, and IGROV-1 (available from the NCI repository; Benard et al. (1985) \u201c1,\u201d Cancer Research, 45:4970-4979; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","An exemplary assay for measuring the in vivo activity of the antibodies of the invention may comprise the following: Balb\/c Nude female mice (Taconic, Md.) are injected at day 0 with cells expressing Fc\u03b3RIIB such as 5\u00d710Daudi cells for example by the subcutaneous route. Mice (e.g., 5 mice per group) also receive i.p. injection of PBS (negative control), ch 4.4.20 (anti-FITC antibody) as a negative control, and as a positive control another therapeutic cancer antibody such as those disclosed herein, e.g., RITUXAN\u00b0 (rituximab), (e.g., at 10 \u03bcg\/g) or 10 \u03bcg\/g ch2B6 once a week starting at day 0. Mice are observed, e.g., twice a week following injection, and tumor size (length and width) is determined using, for example, a caliper. Tumor weight in mg is estimated using the formula: (length\u00d7width)\/2.","Preferably, the antibodies of the invention have an enhanced efficacy in decreasing tumor relative to a cancer therapeutic antibody when administered at the same dose, e.g., 10 \u03bcg\/g, over a time period of at least 14 days, at least 21 days, at least 28 days, or at least 35 days. In most preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention reduce tumor size by at least 10 fold, at least 100 fold, at least 1000 fold relative to administration of a cancer therapeutic antibody at the same dose. In yet another preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention completely abolish the tumor.","The present invention also includes polynucleotides that encode the antibodies of the invention (e.g., mouse monoclonal antibody produced from clone 2B6, 3H7, 1D5, 2E1, 2H9, 2D11, or 1F2 having ATCC accession numbers PTA-4591, PTA-4592, PTA-5958, PTA-5961, PTA-5962, PTA-5960, and PTA-5959, respectively), or other monoclonal antibodies produced by immunization methods of the invention, and humanized versions thereof, and methods for producing same.","The present invention encompasses the polynucleotide encoding the heavy chain of the 2B6 antibody, with ATCC accession number PTA-4591, as disclosed in SEQ ID NO:57. The present invention also encompasses the polynucleotide encoding the light chain of the 2B6 antibody with ATCC accession number PTA-4591, as disclosed in SEQ ID NO:25.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0421","num":"0465"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00021","num":"00021"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":["SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200357:",{}]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"238pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["caggtccaat\u2003tgcagcagcc\u2003tgtgactgag\u2003ctggtgaggc\u2003cgggggcttc","50",{}]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["agtgatgttg\u2003tcctgcaagg\u2003cttctgacta\u2003ccccttcacc\u2003aactactgga","100"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["tacactgggt\u2003aaagcagagg\u2003cctggacaag\u2003gcctggagtg\u2003gatcggagtg","150"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["attgatcctt\u2003ctgatactta\u2003tccaaattac\u2003aataaaaagt\u2003tcaagggcaa","200"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["ggccacattg\u2003actgtagtcg\u2003tatcctccag\u2003cacagcctac\u2003atgcagctca","250"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["gcagcctgac\u2003atctgacgat\u2003tctgcggtct\u2003attactgtgc\u2003aagaaacggt","300"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["gattccgatt\u2003attactctgg\u2003tatggactac\u2003tggggtcaag\u2003gaacctcagt","350"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["caccgtctcc\u2003tca","363"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200325",{}]},{"entry":["gacatcttgc\u2003tgactcagtc\u2003tccagccatc\u2003ctgtctgtga\u2003gtccaggaga","50"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["gagagtcagt\u2003ttttcctgca\u2003ggaccagtca\u2003gagcattggc\u2003acaaacatac","100"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["actggtatca\u2003gcaaagaaca\u2003aatggttttc\u2003caaggcttct\u2003cataaagaat","150"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["gtttctgagt\u2003ctatctctgg\u2003gatcccttcc\u2003aggtttagtg\u2003gcagtggatc","200"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["agggacagat\u2003tttattctta\u2003gcatcaacag\u2003tgtggagtct\u2003gaagatattg","250"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["cagattatta\u2003ttgtcaacaa\u2003agtaatacct\u2003ggccgttcac\u2003gttcggaggg","300"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["gggaccaagc\u2003tggaaataaa\u2003a","321"]}]}}]}}},"The methods of the invention also encompass polynucleotides that hybridize under various stringency, e.g., high stringency, intermediate or lower stringency conditions, to polynucleotides that encode an antibody of the invention. The hybridization can be performed under various conditions of stringency. By way of example and not limitation, procedures using conditions of low stringency are as follows (see also Shilo et al. (1981) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 78, 6789-6792). Filters containing DNA are pretreated for 6 h at 40\u00b0 C. in a solution containing 35% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500 \u03bcg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations are carried out in the same solution with the following modifications: 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.2% BSA, 100 \u03bcg\/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% (wt\/vol) dextran sulfate, and 5-20\u00d710cpm P-labeled probe is used. Filters are incubated in hybridization mixture for 18-20 h at 40\u00b0 C., and then washed for 1.5 h at 55\u00b0 C. in a solution containing 2\u00d7SSC, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. The wash solution is replaced with fresh solution and incubated an additional 1.5 h at 60\u00b0 C. Filters are blotted dry and exposed for autoradiography. If necessary, filters are washed for a third time at 65-68\u00b0 C. and re-exposed to film. Other conditions of low stringency which may be used are well known in the art (e.g., as employed for cross-species hybridizations). By way of example and not limitation, procedures using conditions of high stringency are as follows. Prehybridization of filters containing DNA is carried out for 8 h to overnight at 65\u00b0 C. in buffer composed of 6\u00d7SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 \u03bcg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters are hybridized for 48 h at 65\u00b0 C. in prehybridization mixture containing 100 \u03bcg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 5-20\u00d710cpm of P-labeled probe. Washing of filters is done at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 h in a solution containing 2\u00d7SSC, 0.01% PVP, 0.01% Ficoll, and 0.01% BSA. This is followed by a wash in 0.1\u00d7SSC at 50\u00b0 C. for 45 min before autoradiography. Other conditions of high stringency which may be used are well known in the art. Selection of appropriate conditions for such stringencies is well known in the art (see e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, 2Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York; see also, Ausubel et al., eds., series of laboratory technique manuals, Current Protocols, \u00a91994-1997 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.; see especially, Dyson, 1991,\u201d In: , Vol. 2, T. A. Brown, ed., pp. 111-156, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK).","The polynucleotides may be obtained, and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined, by any method known in the art.","A polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source (e.g., a cDNA library generated from, or nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from, any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention, e.g., 2B6 or 3H7) by hybridization with Ig specific probes and\/or PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.","Once the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is determined, the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, site directed mutagenesis, PCR, etc. (see, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, 2Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., eds., 1998, , John Wiley & Sons, NY, which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence, for example to create amino acid substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions.","In a specific embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions, and preferably human framework regions (see, e.g., Chothia et al. (1998) \u201c,\u201d J. Mol. Biol. 278: 457-479 for a listing of human framework regions). Preferably, the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds to Fc\u03b3RIIB with greater affinity than said antibody binds Fc\u03b3RIIA. Preferably, as discussed supra, one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions, and, preferably, the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibodies of the invention to Fc\u03b3RIIB. Representative plasmids, pMGx608 (pCI-neo [Invitrogen, Inc.] containing a humanized 2B6 heavy chain with human VH1-18 and JH6 germline sequences as frameworks, 2B6 mouse CDRs and human IgG1 Fc constant region) and pMGx611 (pCI-neo containing a humanized 2B6 light chain with human VK-A26 and JK4 as frameworks, human kappa as constant region, and mouse 2B6 light chain CDRs with N\u2192Y and V\u2192A in CDR2), having ATCC Accession numbers PTA-5963 and PTA-5964, respectively, were deposited under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty with the American Type Culture Collection (10801 University Blvd., Manassas, Va. 20110-2209) on May 7, 2004, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The antibody formed by these heavy and light chains is designated h2B6YA.","In another embodiment, human libraries or any other libraries available in the art, can be screened by standard techniques known in the art, to clone the nucleic acids encoding the antibodies of the invention.","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody of the invention has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. (See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1990, 2Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds., 1998, , John Wiley & Sons, NY).","An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of an antibody can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques (e.g., electroporation, liposomal transfection, and calcium phosphate precipitation) and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the antibody of the invention. In specific embodiments, the expression of the antibody is regulated by a constitutive, an inducible or a tissue, specific promoter.","The host cells used to express the recombinant antibodies of the invention may be either bacterial cells such as , or, preferably, eukaryotic cells, especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular, mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins (Cockett et al. (1990) \u201c,\u201d Biotechnology 8:662-667).","A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibodies of the invention. Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the antibodies may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express the antibodies of the invention in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., and ) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; yeast (e.g., ) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing the immunoglobulin coding sequences; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing immunoglobulin coding sequences; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 293T, 3T3 cells, lymphotic cells (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715), Per C.6 cells (rat retinal cells developed by Crucell) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).","In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the expression vector pUR278 (Ruther et al. (1983) \u201c,\u201d EMBO J. 2:1791-1794), in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye et al. (1985) \u201c-,\u201d Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101-3110; Van Heeke et al. (1989) \u201c,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 24:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free gluta-thione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.","In an insect system, nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (e.g., the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (e.g., the polyhedrin promoter).","In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription\/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts. (e.g., see Logan et al. (1984) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3655-3659). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bitter et al. (1987) \u201c,\u201d Methods in Enzymol. 153:516-544).","In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 293T, 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.","For long-term, high-yield production of recombinant proteins, stable expression is preferred. For example, cell lines which stably express an antibody of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibodies of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibodies of the invention.","A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al. (1977) \u201c,\u201d Cell 11:223-232), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska et al. (1962) \u201c-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48:2026-2034), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al. (1980) \u201c,\u201d Cell 22:817-823) genes can be employed in tk\u2212, hgprt\u2212 or aprt\u2212 cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes: dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al. (1980) \u201c-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:3567-3570; O'Hare et al. (1981) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1527-1531); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan et al. (1981) \u201c-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:2072-2076); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Tachibana et al. (1991) \u201c-2-,\u201d Cytotechnology 6(3):219-226; Tolstoshev (1993) \u201c,\u201d Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596; Mulligan (1993) \u201c,\u201d Science 260:926-932; and Morgan et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217). Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), 1993, , John Wiley & Sons, NY; Kriegler, 1990, , Chapters 12 and 13, Dracopoli et al. (eds), 1994, Stockton Press, NY; and in , John Wiley & Sons, NY.; Colbere-Garapin et al. (1981) \u201c,\u201d J. Mol. Biol. 150:1-14; and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al. (1984) \u201c418 -,\u201d Gene 30: 147-156).","The expression levels of an antibody of the invention can be increased by vector amplification (for a review, see Bebbington and Hentschel, \u201c,\u201d in , Vol. 3. (Academic Press, New York, 1987)). When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable, increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody, production of the antibody will also increase (Crouse et al. (1983) \u201c,\u201d Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:257-266).","The host cell may be co-transfected with two expression vectors of the invention, the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively, a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations, the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain (Proudfoot (1986) \u201c,\u201d Nature 322:562-565; Kohler (1980) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:2197-2199). The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.","Once the antibody of the invention has been recombinantly expressed, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an antibody, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.","The present invention encompasses antibody-based therapies which involve administering one or more of the antibodies of the invention to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, for preventing, treating, or ameliorating symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection, associated with aberrant levels or activity of Fc\u03b3RIIB and\/or treatable by altering immune function associated with Fc\u03b3RIIB activity or enhancing cytotoxic activity of a second therapeutic antibody or enhancing efficacy of a vaccine composition or breaking tolerance to an antigen. In some embodiments, therapy by administration of one or more antibodies of the invention is combine with administration of one or more therapies such as, but not limited to, chemotherapies, radiation therapies, hormonal therapies, and\/or biological therapies\/immunotherapies.","Prophylactic and therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, proteinaceous molecules, including, but not limited to, peptides, polypeptides, proteins, including post-translationally modified proteins, antibodies, etc.; small molecules (less than 1000 daltons), inorganic or organic compounds; nucleic acid molecules including, but not limited to, double-stranded or single-stranded DNA, double-stranded or single-stranded RNA, as well as triple helix nucleic acid molecules. Prophylactic and therapeutic compounds can be derived from any known organism (including, but not limited to, animals, plants, bacteria, fungi, and protista, or viruses) or from a library of synthetic molecules.","Antibodies may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein. As detailed below, the antibodies of the invention can be used in methods of treating cancer (particularly to enhance passive immunotherapy or efficacy of a cancer vaccine), autoimmune disease, inflammatory disorders or allergies (e.g., to enhance efficacy of a vaccine for treatment of allergy).","Fc\u03b3RIIB (CD32B) has been found to be expressed in the following tissue types: adipose, b-cell, bone, brain, cartilage, colon, endocrine, eye, fetus, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary, germ cell, head and neck, kidney, lung, lymph node, lymphoreticular, mammary gland, muscle, nervous, ovary, pancreas, pancreatic islet, pituitary gland, placenta, retina, skin, soft tissue, synovium, and uterus (data collected from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project of the National Cancer Institute). Thus, the antibodies of the invention can be used to agonize or antagonize the activity of Fc\u03b3RIIB in any of these tissues. For example, Fc\u03b3RIIB is expressed in the placenta and may play a role in transport of IgG to the fetus and also in scavenging immune complexes (Lyden et al. (2001) \u201c2,\u201d J. Immunol. 166:3882-3889). In certain embodiments of the invention, an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody can used as an abortifacient.","The present inventors have found that neutrophils surprisingly do not express significant levels of FC\u03b3RIIB. Accordingly, the invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions for use in these methods, comprising an amount of CD32-specific antibody that binds to and has activity on tumor cells or non-neutrophil cell types, such as macrophages, but does not detectably bind or have detectable activity on neutrophils. In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the invention can be used to deplete CD32B+ cells, such as macrophages or CD32B-expressing tumor cells.","Antibodies of the present invention that function as a prophylactic and or therapeutic agent of a disease, disorder, or infection can be administered to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with the disease, disorder, or infection. Antibodies of the invention can be administered in combination with one or more other prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents useful in the treatment, prevention or management of a disease, disorder, or infection associated with aberrant levels or activity of Fc\u03b3RIIB and\/or treatable by altering immune function associated with Fc\u03b3RIIB activity. In certain embodiments, one or more antibodies of the invention are administered to a mammal, preferably a human, concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer. The term \u201cconcurrently\u201d is not limited to the administration of prophylactic or therapeutic agents at exactly the same time, but rather it is meant that antibodies of the invention and the other agent are administered to a subject in a sequence and within a time interval such that the antibodies of the invention can act together with the other agent to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example, each prophylactic or therapeutic agent may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time; however, if not administered at the same time, they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapeutic agent can be administered separately, in any appropriate form and by any suitable route.","In various embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered less than 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour apart, at about 1 hour to about 2 hours apart, at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart, at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart, at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart, at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart, at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart, at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart, at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart, at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart, at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart, at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart, no more than 24 hours apart or no more than 48 hours apart. In preferred embodiments, two or more components are administered within the same patient visit.","The dosage amounts and frequencies of administration provided herein are encompassed by the terms therapeutically effective and prophylactically effective. The dosage and frequency further will typically vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapeutic or prophylactic agents administered, the severity and type of cancer, the route of administration, as well as age, body weight, response, and the past medical history of the patient. Suitable regimens can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and by following, for example, dosages reported in the literature and recommended in the (56ed., 2002).","The antibodies of this invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, Fc fusion proteins, or with lymphokines, cytokines or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-7, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2), which enhance Fc\u03b3RIIB, for example, serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies and, increase immune response. In certain embodiments, a cytokine is conjugated to an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody.","The antibodies of this invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with one or more drugs used to treat a disease, disorder, or infection such as, for example anti-cancer agents, anti-inflammatory agents or anti-viral agents, e.g., as detailed below.","Antibodies of the invention can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic antibodies known in the art to prevent, inhibit or reduce the growth of primary tumors or metastasis of cancerous cells. In one embodiment, antibodies of the invention can be used in combination with antibodies used in cancer immunotherapy. The invention encompasses the use of the antibodies of the invention in combination with another therapeutic antibody to enhance the efficacy of such immunotherapy by increasing the potency of the therapeutic antibody's effector function, e.g., ADCC, CDC, phagocytosis, opsonization, etc. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action antibodies of the invention block Fc\u03b3RIIB, preferably on monocytes and macrophages and thus enhance the therapeutic benefits a clinical efficacy of tumor specific antibodies by, for example, enhancing clearance of the tumors mediated by activating Fc\u03b3Rs. Accordingly, the invention provides methods of preventing or treating cancer characterized by a cancer antigen, when administered in combination with another antibody that specifically binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic. The antibodies of the invention are useful for prevention or treatment of cancer, particularly in potentiating the cytotoxic activity of cancer antigen-specific therapeutic antibodies with cytotoxic activity to enhance tumor cell killing by the antibodies of the invention and\/or enhancing for example, ADCC activity or CDC activity of the therapeutic antibodies. In certain embodiments of the invention, antibodies of the invention are administered with Fc fusion proteins. In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the invention, when administered alone or in combination with a cytotoxic therapeutic antibody, inhibits or reduces the growth of primary tumor or metastasis of cancerous cells by at least 99%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to the growth of primary tumor or metastasis in absence of said antibody of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, antibodies of the invention in combination with a cytotoxic therapeutic antibody inhibit or reduce the growth of primary tumor or metastasis of cancer by at least 99%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, at least 50%, at least 45%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 35%, at least 30%, at least 25%, at least 20%, or at least 10% relative to the growth or metastasis in absence of said antibodies.","The transition from a normal to a malignant state is a multistep process involving genetic and epigenetic changes. In fact, numerous alterations occur in the cellular regulatory circuits that facilitate this progression which enables tumor cells to evade the commitment to terminal differentiation and quiescence that normally regulate tissue homeostasis. Certain genes have been implicated in invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells such as CSF-1 (colony stimulating factor 1 or macrophage colony stimulating factor). Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, CSF-1 may mediate tumor progression and metastasis by recruiting macrophages to the tumor site where they promote progression of tumor. It is believed that macrophages have a trophic role in mediating tumor progression and metastasis perhaps by the secretion of angiogenic factors, e.g., thymidine phosphorylase, vascular endothelial-derived growth factor; secretion of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor that could act as a paracrine factor on tumor cells, and thus promoting tumor cell migration and invasion into blood vessels. (See, e.g., Lin et al. (2001) \u201c-1 ,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 193(6): 727-739; Lin et al. (2002) \u201c-1 ,\u201d Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasm 7(2): 147-162; Scholl et al. (1993) \u201c--1 ?\u201d Molecular Carcinogenesis, 7: 207-211; Clynes et al. (2000) \u201c,\u201d Nature Medicine, 6(4): 443-446; Fidler et al. (1985) \u201c,\u201d Cancer Research, 45: 4714-4726).","The invention encompasses using the antibodies of the invention to block macrophage mediated tumor cell progression and metastasis. The antibodies of the invention are particularly useful in the treatment of solid tumors, where macrophage infiltration occurs. The antagonistic antibodies of the invention are particularly useful for controlling, e.g., reducing or eliminating, tumor cell metastasis, by reducing or eliminating the population of macrophages that are localized at the tumor site. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are used alone to control tumor cell metastasis. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action the antagonistic antibodies of the invention, when administered alone bind the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIB on macrophages and effectively reduce the population of macrophages and thus restrict tumor cell progression. The antagonistic antibodies of the invention reduce, or preferably eliminate macrophages that are localized at the tumor site, since Fc\u03b3RIIB is preferentially expressed on activated monocytes and macrophages including tumor-infiltrating macrophages. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are used in the treatment of cancers that are characterized by the overexpression of CSF-1, including but not limited to breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers.","The invention further encompasses antibodies that effectively deplete or eliminate immune cells other than macrophages that express Fc\u03b3RIIB, e.g., dendritic cells and B-cells. Effective depletion or elimination of immune cells using the antibodies of the invention may range from a reduction in population of the immune cells by 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, preferably 90%, and most preferably 99%. Thus, the antibodies of the invention have enhanced therapeutic efficacy either alone or in combination with a second antibody, e.g., a therapeutic antibody such as anti-tumor antibodies, anti-viral antibodies, and anti-microbial antibodies. In some embodiments, the therapeutic antibodies have specificity for a cancer cell or an inflammatory cell. In other embodiments, the second antibody binds a normal cell. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, when the antibodies of the invention are used alone to deplete Fc\u03b3RIIB-expressing immune cells, the population of cells is redistributed so that effectively the cells that are remaining have the activating Fc receptors and thus the suppression by Fc\u03b3RIIB is alleviated. When used in combination with a second antibody, e.g., a therapeutic antibody the efficacy of the second antibody is enhanced by increasing the Fc-mediated effector function of the antibody.","The antibodies and fragments thereof of the invention and methods of treatment are believed to be effective for the treatment of both liquid and solid cancers.

For example, the antibodies of the invention can be used with any of the antibodies in Table 7, that have demonstrated therapeutic utility in cancer treatment. The antibodies of the invention enhance the efficacy of treatment of the therapeutic cancer antibodies by enhancing at least one antibody-mediated effector function of said therapeutic cancer antibodies. In one particular embodiment, the antibodies enhance the efficacy of treatment by enhancing the complement dependent cascade of said therapeutic cancer antibodies. In another embodiment of the invention, the antibodies of the invention enhance the efficacy of treatment by enhancing the phagocytosis and opsonization of the targeted tumor cells.

For example, the invention encompasses the use of CpG 7909, CpG 8916, CpG 8954 (Coley Pharmaceuticals) in the methods and compositions of the invention for the treatment and\/or prevention of cancer (See also Warren et al. (2002) \u201c-,\u201d Semin. Oncol., 29(1 Suppl 2):93-97; Warren et al. (2000) \u201c,\u201d Clin. Lymphoma, 1(1):57-61, which are incorporated herein by reference).","Antibodies of the invention can be used in combination with a therapeutic antibody that does not mediate its therapeutic effect through cell killing to potentiate the antibody's therapeutic activity. In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses use of the antibodies of the invention in combination with a therapeutic apoptosis inducing antibody with agonistic activity, e.g., an anti-Fas antibody. Anti-Fas antibodies are known in the art and include for example, Jo2 (Ogasawara et al. (1993) \u201c-,\u201d Nature 364: 806-809) and HFE7 (Ichikawa et al. (2000) \u201c-,\u201d Int. Immunol. 12: 555-562). Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanisms of action, Fc\u03b3RIIB has been implicated in promoting anti-Fas mediated apoptosis, (see, e.g., Xu et al. (2003) \u201c--,\u201d J. Immunol. 171: 562-568). In fact, the extracellular domain of Fc\u03b3RIIB may serve as a cross-linking agent for Fas receptors, leading to a functional complex and promoting Fas dependent apoptosis. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention block the interaction of anti-Fas antibodies and Fc\u03b3RIIB, leading to a reduction in Fas-mediated apoptotic activity. Antibodies of the invention that result in a reduction in Fas-mediated apoptotic activity are particularly useful in combination with anti-Fas antibodies that have undesirable side effects, e.g., hepatotoxicity. In other embodiments, the antibodies of the invention enhance the interaction of anti-Fas antibodies and Fc\u03b3RIIB, leading to an enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptotic activity. Combination of the antibodies of the invention with therapeutic apoptosis inducing antibodies with agonisitc activity have an enhanced therapeutic efficacy.","Therapeutic apoptosis inducing antibodies used in the methods of the invention may be specific for any death receptor known in the art for the modulation of apoptotic pathway, e.g., TNFR receptor family.","The invention provides a method of treating diseases with impaired apoptotic mediated signaling, e.g., cancer, autoimmune disease. In a specific embodiment, the invention encompasses a method of treating a disease with deficient Fas-mediated apoptosis, said method comprising administering an antibody of the invention in combination with an anti-Fas antibody.","In some embodiments, the agonistic antibodies of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of tumors of non-hematopoietic origin, including tumors of melanoma cells. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the efficacy of the agonistic antibodies of the invention is due, in part, to activation of Fc\u03b3RIIB inhibitory pathway, as tumors of non-hematopoietic origin, including tumors of melanoma cells express Fc\u03b3RIIB. Recent experiments have in fact shown that expression of Fc\u03b3RIIB in melanoma cells modulates tumor growth by direct interaction with anti-tumor antibodies (e.g., by binding the Fc region of the anti-tumor antibodies) in an intracytoplasmic-dependent manner (Cassard et al. (2002) \u201c() ,\u201d J. Clin. Invest. 110(10): 1549-1557).","In some embodiments, the invention encompasses use of the antibodies of the invention in combination with therapeutic antibodies that immunospecifically bind to tumor antigens that are not expressed on the tumor cells themselves, but rather on the surrounding reactive and tumor supporting, non-malignant cells comprising the tumor stroma. The tumor stroma comprises endothelial cells forming new blood vessels and stromal fibroblasts surrounding the tumor vasculature. In a specific embodiment, an antibody of the invention is used in combination with an antibody that immunospecifically binds a tumor antigen on an endothelial cell. In a preferred embodiment, an antibody of the invention is used in combination with an antibody that immunospecifically binds a tumor antigen on a fibroblast cell, e.g., fibroblast activation protein (FAP). FAP is a 95 KDa homodimeric type TI glycoprotein which is highly expressed in stromal fibroblasts of many solid tumors, including, but not limited to lung, breast, and colorectal carcinomas. (See, e.g., Scanlan et al. (1994) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. USA, 91: 5657-5661; Park et al. (1999) \u201c,\u201d J. Biol. Chem., 274: 36505-36512; Rettig et al. (1988) \u201c-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 3110-3114; Garin-Chesa et al. (1990) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 7235-7239). Antibodies that immunospecifically bind FAP are known in the art and encompassed within the invention, (see, e.g., Wuest et al. (2001) \u201c,\u201d Journal of Biotechnology, 159-168; Mersmann et al. (2001) \u201cHuman Antibody Derivatives Against The Fibroblast Activation Protein For Tumor Stroma Targeting Of Carcinomas,\u201d Int. J. Cancer, 92: 240-248; U.S. Pat. No. 6,455,677; all of which are incorporated herein in by reference in their entireties).","Recently, IgEs have been implicated as mediators of tumor growth and, in fact, IgE-targeted immediate hypersensitivity and allergic inflammation reactions have been proposed as possible natural mechanisms involved in anti-tumor responses (For a review see, e.g., Vena et al. (1992) \u201c-,\u201d Am. Journal of Epidemiol. 122: 66-74; Eriksson et al. (1995) \u201c,\u201d Allergy 50: 718-722). In fact, a recent study has shown loading tumor cells with IgEs reduces tumor growth, leading in some instances to tumor rejection. According to the study, IgE loaded tumor cells not only possess a therapeutic potential but also confer long term antitumor immunity, including activation of innate immunity effector mechanism and T-cell mediated adaptive immune response, (see Reali et al. (2001) \u201c,\u201d Cancer Res. 61: 5517-5522; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The antagonistic antibodies of the invention may be used in the treatment and\/or prevention of cancer in combination with administration of IgEs in order to enhance the efficacy of IgE-mediated cancer therapy. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action the antibodies of the invention enhance the therapeutic efficacy of IgE treatment of tumors, by blocking the inhibitory pathway. The antagonistic antibodies of the invention may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of IgE mediated cancer therapy by:\n\n","Cancer therapies and their dosages, routes of administration and recommended usage are known in the art and have been described in the literature, see, e.g., (56ed., 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference).","A. B Cell Malignancies","The present invention encompasses therapies which involve administering an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody, to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, to prevent, treat, manage or ameliorate a B-cell malignancy, or one or more symptoms thereof. These therapies are an enhancement over current therapies. In certain cases, patients who are refractory to current therapies can be treated with the methods of the invention. In some embodiments, therapy by administration of one or more antibodies of the invention is combined with administration of one or more therapies such as, but not limited to, chemotherapies, radiation therapies, hormonal therapies, and\/or biological therapies\/immunotherapies.","The present invention encompasses treatment protocols that provide better prophylactic and therapeutic profiles than current single agent therapies or combination therapies for a B-cell malignancy, or one or more symptoms thereof. The invention provides Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody based therapies for the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a B-cell malignancy, or one or more symptoms thereof. In particular, the invention provides prophylactic and therapeutic protocols for the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a B-cell malignancy, or one or more symptoms thereof, comprising the administration of a Fc\u03b3RIIB-specific antibody, an analog, derivative or an antigen-fragment thereof to a subject in need thereof.","The agonistic antibodies of the invention are useful for treating or preventing any B cell malignancies, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other B-cell malignancies include small lymphocytic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, mantle cell lymphomas diffuse small cleaved cell lymphomas, most follicular lymphomas and some diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Fc\u03b3RIIB, is a target for deregulation by chromosomal translocation in malignant lymphoma, particularly in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (See Callanan et al. (2000) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 97(1):309-314). Thus, the antibodies of the invention are useful for treating or preventing any chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B cell lineage. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B cell lineage are reviewed by Freedman (See Freedman (1990) \u201c,\u201d Hemtaol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 4:405-429). Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of action, the agonistic antibodies of the invention inhibit or prevent B cell malignancies inhibiting B cell proliferation and\/or activation. The invention also encompasses the use of the agonistic antibodies of the invention in combination with other therapies known (e.g., chemotherapy and radiotherapy) in the art for the prevention and\/or treatment of B cell malignancies. The invention also encompasses the use of the agonistic antibodies of the invention in combination with other antibodies known in the art for the treatment and or prevention of B-cell malignancies. For example, the agonistic antibodies of the invention can be used in combination with the anti-C22 or anti-CD19 antibodies disclosed by Goldenberg et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,393), anti-CD20 antibodies, anti-CD33 antibodies, or anti-CD52 antibodies.","Antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with for example but not by way of limitation, ONCOSCINT\u00ae (111In-satumomab pantedide) (target: CEA), VERLUMA\u00ae (99Tc-nofetumomab merpentan) (target: GP40), PROSTASCINT\u00ae (capromab pentedide) (target: PSMA), CEA-SCAN\u00ae (arcitumomab) (target: CEA), RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) (target: CD20), HERCEPTIN\u00ae (trastuzumab) (target: HER-2), CAMPATH\u00ae (alemtuzumab (target: CD52), MYLOTARG\u00ae (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) (target: CD33), and ZEVALIN\u00ae (ibritumomab tiuxetan) (target: CD20).","B. Autoimmune Disease and Inflammatory Diseases","The agonistic antibodies of the invention may be used to treat or prevent autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. The present invention provides methods of preventing, treating, or managing one or more symptoms associated with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder in a subject, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of the antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention. The invention also provides methods for preventing, treating, or managing one or more symptoms associated with an inflammatory disorder in a subject further comprising, administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more anti-inflammatory agents. The invention also provides methods for preventing, treating, or managing one or more symptoms associated with an autoimmune disease further comprising, administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more immunomodulatory agents.","The antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with any of the antibodies known in the art for the treatment and\/or prevention of autoimmune disease or inflammatory disease. A non-limiting example of the antibodies or Fc fusion proteins that are used for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory disorders is presented in Table 6A, and a non-limiting example of the antibodies or Fc fusion proteins that are used for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorder is presented in Table 6B. The antibodies of the invention can for example, enhance the efficacy of treatment of the therapeutic antibodies or Fc fusion proteins presented in Tables 6A and 6B. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibodies of the invention can enhance the immune response in the subject being treated with any of the antibodies or Fc fusion proteins in Tables 6A or 6B.","Antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with, for example, but not by way of limitation, ORTHOCLONE OKT3\u00ae (muromonab), REOPRO\u00ae (abciximab), ZENAPEX\u00ae (declizumab), SIMULEC\u00ae (basiliximab), RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab), SYNAGIS\u00ae (palivizumab), and REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab).","Antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (\u201cCpG\u201d)-based products that have been developed (Coley Pharmaceuticals) or are currently being developed as activators of innate and acquired immune responses. For example, the invention encompasses the use of CpG 7909, CpG 8916, CpG 8954 (Coley Pharmaceuticals) in the methods and compositions of the invention for the treatment and\/or prevention of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (Weeratna et al. (2001) \u201c-2 ,\u201d FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol., 32(1):65-71, which is incorporated herein by reference).","Examples of autoimmune disorders that may be treated by administering the antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to, alopecia areata, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune Addison's disease, autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Behcet's disease, bullous pemphigoid, cardiomyopathy, celiac sprue-dermatitis, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cicatrical pemphigoid, CREST syndrome, cold agglutinin disease, Crohn's disease, discoid lupus, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibromyalgia-fibromyositis, glomerulonephritis, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), IgA neuropathy, juvenile arthritis, lichen planus, lupus erthematosus, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 or immune-mediated diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus vulgaris, pernicious anemia, polyarteritis nodosa, polychrondritis, polyglandular syndromes, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, primary agammaglobulinemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Raynauld's phenomenon, Reiter's syndrome, Rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, stiff-man syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus erythematosus, takayasu arteritis, temporal arteristis\/giant cell arteritis, ulcerative colitis, uveitis, vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis, vitiligo, and Wegener's granulomatosis. Examples of inflammatory disorders include, but are not limited to, asthma, encephilitis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic disorders, septic shock, pulmonary fibrosis, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, undifferentiated arthropathy, arthritis, inflammatory osteolysis, and chronic inflammation resulting from chronic viral or bacteria infections. As described herein, some autoimmune disorders are associated with an inflammatory condition. Thus, there is overlap between what is considered an autoimmune disorder and an inflammatory disorder. Therefore, some autoimmune disorders may also be characterized as inflammatory disorders. Examples of inflammatory disorders which can be prevented, treated or managed in accordance with the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, asthma, encephilitis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic disorders, septic shock, pulmonary fibrosis, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, undifferentiated arthropathy, arthritis, inflammatory osteolysis, and chronic inflammation resulting from chronic viral or bacteria infections.","In certain embodiments of the invention, the antibodies of the invention may be used to treat an autoimmune disease that is more prevalent in one sex. For example, the prevalence of Graves' disease in women has been associated with expression of Fc\u03b3RIIB2 (see Estienne et al. (2002) \u201c-2 ,\u201d FASEB J. 16:1087-1092).","Antibodies of the invention can also be used to reduce the inflammation experienced by animals, particularly mammals, with inflammatory disorders.

Allergy","The invention provides methods for treating or preventing an IgE-mediated and or Fc\u03b5RI-mediated allergic disorder in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of the agonistic antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, antibodies of the invention are useful in inhibiting Fc\u03b5RI-induced mast cell activation, which contributes to acute and late phase allergic responses (Metcalfe et al. (1997) \u201c,\u201d Physiol. Rev. 77:1033-1079). Preferably, the agonistic antibodies of the invention have enhanced therapeutic efficacy and\/or reduced side effects in comparison with the conventional methods used in the art for the treatment and\/or prevention of IgE mediated allergic disorders. Conventional methods for the treatment and\/or prevention of IgE mediated allergic disorders include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., oral and inhaled corticosteroids for asthma), antihistamines (e.g., for allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis), cysteinyl leukotrienes (e.g., for the treatment of asthma); anti-IgE antibodies; and specific immunotherapy or desensitization.","Examples of IgE-mediated allergic responses include, but are not limited to, asthma, allergic rhinitis, gastrointestinal allergies, eosinophilia, conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, anaphylaxis, or golmerular nephritis.","The invention encompasses molecules, e.g., immunoglobulins, engineered to form complexes with Fc\u03b5RI and human Fc\u03b3RIIB, i.e., specifically bind Fc\u03b5RI and human Fc\u03b3RIIB. Preferably, such molecules have therapeutic efficacy in IgE and Fc\u03b5RI-mediated disorders. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the therapeutic efficacy of these engineered molecules is, in part, due to their ability to inhibit mast cell and basophil function.","In a specific embodiment, molecules that specifically bind Fc\u03b5RI and human Fc\u03b3RIIB are chimeric fusion proteins comprising a binding site for Fc\u03b5RI and a binding site for Fc\u03b3RIIB. Such molecules may be engineered in accordance with standard recombinant DNA methodologies known to one skilled in the art. In a preferred specific embodiment, a chimeric fusion protein for use in the methods of the invention comprises an F(ab\u2032) single chain of an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB monoclonal antibody of the invention fused to a region used as a bridge to link the huFc\u03b5 to the C-terminal region of the F(ab\u2032) single chain of the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB monoclonal antibody. One exemplary chimeric fusion protein for use in the methods of the invention comprises the following: V\/C(Fc\u03b3RIIB)-hinge-V\/C(Fc\u03b3RIIB)-LINKER-C\u03b52-C\u03b53-C\u03b54. The linker for the chimeric molecules may be five, ten, preferably fifteen amino acids in length. The length of the linker may vary to provide optimal binding of the molecule to both Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI. In a specific embodiment, the linker is a 15 amino acid linker, consisting of the sequence: (GlySer). Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, the flexible peptide linker facilitates chain pairing and minimizes possible refolding and it will also allow the chimeric molecule to reach the two receptors, i.e., Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI on the cells and cross-link them. Preferably, the chimeric molecule is cloned into a mammalian expression vector, e.g., pCI-neo, with a compatible promoter, e.g., cytomegalovirus promoter. The fusion protein prepared in accordance with the methods of the invention will contain the binding site for Fc\u03b5RI (CH\u03b52CH\u03b53) and for Fc\u03b3RIIB (VL\/CL,-hinge-VH\/CH). The nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein prepared in accordance with the methods of the invention is preferably transfected into 293 cells and the secreted protein is purified using common methods known in the art.","Binding of the chimeric molecules to both human Fc\u03b5RI and Fc\u03b3RIIB may be assessed using common methods known to one skilled in the art for determining binding to an Fc\u03b3R. Preferably, the chimeric molecules of the invention have therapeutic efficacy in treating IgE mediated disorders, for example, by inhibiting antigen-driven degranulation and inhibition of cell activation. The efficacy of the chimeric molecules of the invention in blocking IgE driven Fc\u03b5RI-mediated mast cell degranulation may be determined in transgenic mice, which have been engineered to express the human Fc\u03b5R\u03b1 and human Fc\u03b3RIIB, prior to their use in humans.","The invention provides the use of bispecific antibodies for the treatment and\/or prevention of IgE-mediated and\/or Fc\u03b5RI-mediated allergic disorders. A bispecific antibody (BsAb) binds to two different epitopes usually on distinct antigens. BsAbs have potential clinical utility and they have been used to target viruses, virally infected cells and bacterial pathogens as well as to deliver thrombolitic agents to blood clots (Cao (1998) \u201c,\u201d Bioconj. Chem. 9: 635-644; Koelemij et al. (1999) \u201c,\u201d J. Immunother., 22, 514-524; Segal et al. (1999) \u201c,\u201d Curr. Opin. Immunol., 11, 558-562). The technology for the production of BsIgG and other related bispecific molecules is available (see, e.g., Carter et al. (2001) \u201c,\u201d J. of Immunol. Methods, 248, 7-15; Segal et al. (2001) \u201c,\u201d J. of Immunol. Methods, 248, 71-76, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). The instant invention provides bispecific antibodies containing one F(ab\u2032) of the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody and one F(ab\u2032) of an available monoclonal anti-huIgE antibody which aggregates two receptors, Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b5RI, on the surface of the same cell. Any methodology known in the art and disclosed herein may be employed to generate bispecific antibodies for use in the methods of the invention. In a specific embodiment, the BsAbs will be produced by chemically cross-linking F(ab\u2032) fragments of an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody and an anti-huIgE antibody as described previously, see, e.g., Glennie et al., 1995, , Oxford University press, Oxford, p. 225; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The F(ab\u2032) fragments may be produced by limited proteolysis with pepsin and reduced with mercaptoethanol amine to provide Fab\u2032 fragments with free hinge-region sulfhydryl (SH) groups. The SH group on one of the Fab\u2032 (SH) fragments may be alkylated with excess O-phenylenedimaleimide (O-PDM) to provide a free maleimide group (mal). The two preparations Fab\u2032(mal) and Fab\u2032(SH) may be combined at an appropriate ratio, preferably 1:1 to generate heterodimeric constructs. The BsAbs can be purified by size exclusion chromatography and characterized by HPLC using methods known to one skilled in the art.","In particular, the invention encompasses bispecific antibodies comprising a first heavy chain-light chain pair that binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with greater affinity than said heavy chain-light chain pair binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, and a second heavy chain-light chain pair that binds IgE receptor, with the provision that said first heavy chain-light chain pair binds Fc\u03b3RIIB first. The bispecific antibodies of the invention can be engineered using standard techniques known in the art to ensure that the binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB precedes the binding to the IgE receptor. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that it is possible to engineer the bispecific antibodies, for example, such that said bispecific antibodies bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with greater affinity than said antibodies bind IgE receptor. Additionally, the bispecific antibodies can be engineered by techniques known in the art, such that the hinge size of the antibody can be increased in length, for example, by adding linkers, to provide the bispecific antibodies with flexibility to bind the IgE receptor and Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor on the same cell.","The antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with other therapeutic antibodies or drugs known in the art for the treatment or prevention of IgE-mediated allergic disorders. For example, the antibodies of the invention can be used in combination with any of the following: azelastine (ASTELIN\u00ae), beclomethasone dipropionate inhaler (VANCERIL\u00ae), beclomethasone dipropionate nasal inhaler\/spray (VANCENASE\u00ae), Beconase budesonide nasal inhaler\/spray (RHINOCORT\u00ae), cetirizine (ZYRTEC\u00ae), chlorpheniramine, pseudoephedrine, Deconamine (SUDAFED\u00ae), cromolyn (ASALCROM\u00ae, INTAL\u00ae, OPTICROM\u00ae), desloratadine (CLARINEX\u00ae), fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine (ALEGRA-D\u00ae), fexofenadine (ALLEGRA\u00ae), flunisolide nasal spray (NASALIDE\u00ae), fluticasone propionate nasal inhaler\/spray (FLONASE\u00ae), fluticasone propionate oral inhaler (FLOVENT\u00ae), hydroxyzine (VISTARIL\u00ae, ATARAX\u00ae), loratadine, pseudoephedrine (CLARITIN-D\u00ae), loratadine (CLARITIN\u00ae), prednisolone (PREDNISOLONE\u00ae, PEDIAPRED\u00ae Oral Liquid, MEDROL\u00ae prednisone, DELTASONE\u00ae, Liquid Predsalmeterol), salmeterol xinafoate (SEREVENT\u00ae), triamcinolone acetonide inhaler (AZMACORT\u00ae), triamcinolone acetonide nasal inhaler\/spray (NASACORT\u00ae, or NASACORT AQ\u00ae). Antibodies of the invention can be used in combination with cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (\u201cCpG\u201d)-based products that have been developed (Coley Pharmaceuticals) or are currently being developed as activators of innate and acquired immune responses. For example, the invention encompasses the use of CpG 7909, CpG 8916, CpG 8954 (Coley Pharmaceuticals) in the methods and compositions of the invention for the treatment and\/or prevention of IgE-mediated allergic disorders (See also Weeratna et al.

Vaccine Therapy","The invention provides a method for enhancing an immune response to a vaccine composition in a subject, said method comprising administering to said subject an antibody or a fragment thereof that specifically binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with greater affinity than said antibody or a fragment thereof binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, and a vaccine composition, wherein said antibody or a fragment thereof enhances the immune response to said vaccine composition. In one particular embodiment, said antibody or a fragment thereof enhances the immune response to said vaccine composition by enhancing antigen presentation\/and or antigen processing of the antigen to which the vaccine is directed at. Any vaccine composition known in the art is useful in combination with the antibodies or fragments thereof of the invention.","In one embodiment, the invention encompasses the use of the antibodies of the invention in combination with any cancer vaccine known in the art, e.g., CANVAXIN\u2122 (Cancer Vax, Corporation, melanoma and colon cancer); ONCOPHAGE\u00ae (HSPPC-96; Antigenics; metastatic melanoma); HER-2\/neu cancer vaccine, etc. The cancer vaccines used in the methods and compositions of the invention can be, for example, antigen-specific vaccines, anti-idiotypic vaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, or DNA vaccines. The invention encompasses the use of the antibodies of the invention with cell-based vaccines as described by Segal et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,080), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The cell-based vaccines used in combination with the antibodies of the invention can be either autologous or allogeneic. Briefly, the cancer-based vaccines as described by Segal et al. are based on Opsonokine\u2122 product by Genitrix, LLC. Opsonokines\u2122 are genetically engineered cytokines that, when mixed with tumor cells, automatically attach to the surface of the cells. When the \u201cdecorated\u201d cells are administered as a vaccine, the cytokine on the cells activates critical antigen presenting cells in the recipient, while also allowing the antigen presenting cells to ingest the tumor cells. The antigen presenting cells are then able to instruct \u201ckiller\u201d T cells to find and destroy similar tumor cells throughout the body. Thus, the Opsonokine\u2122 product converts the tumor cells into a potent anti-tumor immunotherapeutic.","In one embodiment, the invention encompasses the use of the antibodies of the invention in combination with any allergy vaccine known in the art. The antibodies of the invention, can be used, for example, in combination with recombinant hybrid molecules coding for the major timothy grass pollen allergens used for vaccination against grass pollen allergy, as described by Linhart et al. (2002) \u201c,\u201d FASEB Journal, 16(10):1301-1303, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition, the antibodies of the invention can be used in combination with DNA-based vaccinations described by Horner et al. (2002) \u201c-,\u201d Allergy, 57 Suppl, 72:24-29, which is incorporated by reference. Antibodies of the invention can be used in combination with Bacille Clamett-Guerin (\u201cBCG\u201d) vaccination as described by Choi et al. (2002) \u201c,\u201d Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunology, 88(6): 584-591); and Barlan et al. (2002) \u201c-,\u201d Journal Asthma, 39(3):239-246, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in entirety, to downregulate IgE secretion. The antibodies of the invention are useful in treating food allergies. In particular, the antibodies of the invention can be used in combination with vaccines or other immunotherapies known in the art (see Hourihane et al. (2002) \u201c,\u201d Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2(3):227-231) for the treatment of peanut allergies.","The methods and compositions of the invention can be used in combination with vaccines, in which immunity for the antigen(s) is desired. Such antigens may be any antigen known in the art. The antibodies of the invention can be used to enhance an immune response, for example, to infectious agents, diseased or abnormal cells such as, but not limited to, bacteria (e.g., gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacteria, aerobic bacteria, , etc.), parasites, fungi (e.g., , etc.), viruses (e.g., DNA viruses, RNA viruses, etc.), or tumors. Viral infections include, but are not limited to, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, or other hepatitis viruses; cytomagaloviruses, herpes simplex virus-1 (-2, -3, -4, -5, -6), human papilloma viruses; Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Parainfluenza virus (PIV), Epstein Barr virus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or any other viral infections.","The invention encompasses methods and vaccine compositions comprising combinations of an antibody of the invention, an antigen and a cytokine. Preferably, the cytokine is IL-4, IL-10, or TGF-\u03b2.","The invention also encompasses the use of the antibodies of the invention to enhance a humoral and\/or cell mediated response against the antigen(s) of the vaccine composition. The invention further encompasses the use of the antibodies of the invention to either prevent or treat a particular disorder, where an enhanced immune response against a particular antigen or antigens is effective to treat or prevent the disease or disorder. Such diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to, viral infections, such as HIV, CMV, hepatitis, herpes virus, measles, etc., bacterial infections, fungal and parasitic infections, cancers, and any other disease or disorder amenable to treatment or prevention by enhancing an immune response against a particular antigen or antigens.","Certain cancers may be associated with an ability of the tumors to circumvent an immune response against their antigens, i.e., tolerance to these antigens exists. (See Mapara et al. (2004) \u201c,\u201d J. Clin. Oncol. 22:1136-1151.) Accordingly, a goal in tumor immunotherapy is to break tolerance to tumor antigens in order to induce an antitumor response. Eliciting an immune response against a foreign antigen that is otherwise recognized by the host as a \u201cself\u201d antigen breaks tolerance to that antigen.","Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention provides a method for breaking tolerance to an antigen in a patient by administering to a patient in need thereof (i.) an antigen-antibody complex comprising the antigen and (ii.) an antibody or fragment thereof that specifically binds the extracellular domain of human Fc\u03b3RIIB and blocks the Fc binding site of human Fc\u03b3RIIB, thereby breaking tolerance in said patient to the antigen. The antibody or fragment thereof can be administered before, concurrently with, or after administration of said antigen-antibody complex.","Antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, coexpress activating and inhibitory Fc gamma receptors. Without being bound by theory, when antibodies that block Fc binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB are present, the antigen-antibody complexes comprising an antigen are primarily taken up by non-inhibitory receptors on antigen-presenting cells elicting an immune response to the antigen.","In certain embodiments, the antigen is an antigen that is associated with a cancer or a neoplastic disease. In another aspect, the antigen is specific to a cancer cell or a neoplastic cell. The antigen can also be an antigen of a pathogen, such as, e.g., a virus, a bacterium, or a protozoa. Representative antigens have been disclosed herein.","The invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions comprising antibodies of the invention. The invention also provides methods of treatment, prophylaxis, and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder or infection by administering to a subject an effective amount of a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a fusion protein or conjugated molecules of the invention. In a preferred aspect, an antibody or fusion protein or conjugated molecule, is substantially purified (i.e., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side effects). In a specific embodiment, the subject is an animal, preferably a mammal such as non-primate (e.g., cows, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, rats etc.) and a primate (e.g., monkey such as, a cynomolgous monkey and a human). In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human.","Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a composition comprising antibodies of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or fusion protein, receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu et al. (1987) \u201c-,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc.","In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are formulated in liposomes for targeted delivery of the antibodies of the invention. Liposomes are vesicles comprised of concentrically ordered phospholipid bilayers which encapsulate an aqueous phase. Liposomes typically comprise various types of lipids, phospholipids, and\/or surfactants. The components of liposomes are arranged in a bilayer configuration, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes are particularly preferred delivery vehicles due, in part, to their biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and low toxicity. Methods for preparation of liposomes are known in the art and are encompassed within the invention, see, e.g., Eppstein et al. (1985) \u201c-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 3688-3692; Hwang et al. (1980) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77: 4030-4034; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The invention also encompasses methods of preparing liposomes with a prolonged serum half-life, i.e., enhanced circulation time, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. Preferred liposomes used in the methods of the invention are not rapidly cleared from circulation, i.e., are not taken up into the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). The invention encompasses sterically stabilized liposomes that are prepared using common methods known to one skilled in the art. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, sterically stabilized liposomes contain lipid components with bulky and highly flexible hydrophilic moieties, which reduces the unwanted reaction of liposomes with serum proteins, reduces oposonization with serum components and reduces recognition by MPS. Sterically stabilized liposomes are preferably prepared using polyethylene glycol. For preparation of liposomes and sterically stabilized liposomes see, e.g., Bendas et al. (2001) \u201c,\u201d BioDrugs, 15(4): 215-224; Allen et al. (1987) \u201c,\u201d FEBS Lett. 223: 42-46; Klibanov et al. (1990) \u201c,\u201d FEBS Lett., 268: 235-237; Blume et al.

Acta, 1190: 99-107; Maruyama et al. (1991) \u201c,\u201d Chem. Pharm. Bull., 39: 1620-1622; Klibanov et al. (1991) \u201c() 5000 ,\u201d Biochim Biophys Acta, 1062; 142-148; Allen et al. (1994) \u201c,\u201d Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., 13: 285-309; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The invention also encompasses liposomes that are adapted for specific organ targeting, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,544,545, or specific cell targeting, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005\/0074403. Particularly useful liposomes for use in the compositions and methods of the invention can be generated by reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. In some embodiments, a fragment of an antibody of the invention, e.g., F(ab\u2032), may be conjugated to the liposomes using previously described methods, see, e.g., Martin et al. (1982) \u201c,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 257: 286-288, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The antibodies of the invention may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Immunoliposomes refer to a liposomal composition, wherein an antibody of the invention or a fragment thereof is linked, covalently or non-covalently to the liposomal surface. The chemistry of linking an antibody to the liposomal surface is known in the art and encompassed within the invention, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,787,153; Allen et al., 1995, SL, Boca Rotan: CRC Press, 233-44; Hansen et al. (1995) \u201c,\u201d Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1239: 133-144; which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In most preferred embodiments, immunoliposomes for use in the methods and compositions of the invention are further sterically stabilized. Preferably, the antibodies of the invention are linked covalently or non-covalently to a hydrophobic anchor, which is stably rooted in the lipid bilayer of the liposome. Examples of hydrophobic anchors include but are not limited to phospholipids, e.g., phosoatidylethanolamine (PE), phospahtidylinositol (PI). To achieve a covalent linkage between an antibody and a hydrophobic anchor, any of the known biochemical strategies in the art may be used, see, e.g., J. Thomas August, ed., 1997, GT: AP, Volume 40, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., p. 399-435, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety For example, a functional group on an antibody molecule may react with an active group on a liposome associated hydrophobic anchor, e.g., an amino group of a lysine side chain on an antibody may be coupled to liposome associated N-glutaryl-phosphatidylethanolamine activated with water-soluble carbodiimide; or a thiol group of a reduced antibody can be coupled to liposomes via thiol reactive anchors such as pyridylthiopropionyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. See, e.g., Dietrich et al. (1996) \u201c-,\u201d Biochemistry, 35: 1100-1105; Loughrey et al. (1987) \u201c-,\u201d Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 901: 157-160; Martin et al. (1982) \u201c,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 257: 286-288; Martin et al. (1981) \u201c,\u201d Biochemistry, 20: 4429-4438; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, immunoliposomal formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are particularly effective as therapeutic agents, since they deliver the antibody to the cytoplasm of the target cell, i.e., the cell comprising the Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor to which the antibody binds. The immunoliposomes preferably have an increased half-life in blood, specifically target cells, and can be internalized into the cytoplasm of the target cells thereby avoiding loss of the therapeutic agent or degradation by the endolysosomal pathway.","The invention encompasses immunoliposomes comprising an antibody of the invention or a fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the immunoliposomes further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents, such as those disclosed herein.","The immunoliposomal compositions of the invention comprise one or more vesicle forming lipids, an antibody of the invention or a fragment or derivative thereof, and optionally a hydrophilic polymer. A vesicle-forming lipid is preferably a lipid with two hydrocarbon chains, such as acyl chains and a polar head group. Examples of vesicle forming lipids include phospholipids, e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, and glycolipids, e.g., cerebrosides, gangliosides. Additional lipids useful in the formulations of the invention are known to one skilled in the art and encompassed within the invention. In some embodiments, the immunoliposomal compositions further comprise a hydrophilic polymer, e.g., polyethylene glycol, and ganglioside GM1, which increases the serum half-life of the liposome. Methods of conjugating hydrophilic polymers to liposomes are well known in the art and encompassed within the invention. For a review of immunoliposomes and methods of preparing them, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003\/0044407; PCT International Publication No. WO 97\/38731, Vingerhoeads et al.

Thomas August, ed., 1997, , Volume 40, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., p. 399-435, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","Methods of administering an antibody of the invention include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural, and mucosal (e.g., intranasal and oral routes). In a specific embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985, 20; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos.

In one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted, e.g., with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, the antibodies of the invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, more preferably at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized antibodies of the invention should be stored at between 2 and 8\u00b0 C. in their original container and the antibodies should be administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, antibodies of the invention are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the antibody, fusion protein, or conjugated molecule. Preferably, the liquid form of the antibodies are supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg\/ml, more preferably at least 2.5 mg\/ml, at least 5 mg\/ml, at least 8 mg\/ml, at least 10 mg\/ml, at least 15 mg\/kg, at least 25 mg\/ml, at least 50 mg\/ml, at least 100 mg\/ml, at least 150 mg\/ml, at least 200 mg\/ml of the antibodies.","The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","For antibodies encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.0001 mg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 10 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 2 mg\/kg, 0.0001 and 1 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.75 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg and 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.0001 mg\/kg to 0.25 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.15 mg\/kg, 0.0001 to 0.10 mg\/kg, 0.001 to 0.5 mg\/kg, 0.01 to 0.25 mg\/kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg\/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","In one embodiment, the dosage of the antibodies of the invention administered to a patient are 0.01 mg to 1000 mg\/day, when used as single agent therapy. In another embodiment the antibodies of the invention are used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said antibodies are used as a single agent therapy.","In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering an antibody of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the antibody or the fusion protein does not absorb.","In another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (See Langer (1990) \u201c,\u201d Science 249:1527-1533; Treat et al., in in the and , Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 3 17-327; see generally ibid.).","In yet another embodiment, the compositions can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more antibodies of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; PCT publication WO 91\/05548; PCT publication WO 96\/20698; Ning et al. (1996) \u201c-,\u201d Radiotherapy & Oncology 39:179-189, Song et al.

(1997) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Int'l. Symp. Control Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, a pump may be used in a controlled release system (See Langer, supra; Sefton (1987) \u201c,\u201d CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201-240; Buchwald et al. (1980) \u201c-,\u201d Surgery 88:507-516; and Saudek et al. (1989) \u201c,\u201d N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574-579). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled release of antibodies (see e.g., , Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); \u201c, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger et al. (1983) \u201cRanger et al. (1983) \u201c,\u201d J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61-126; See also Levy et al. (1985) \u201c-,\u201d Science 228:190-192; During et al. (1989) \u201c,\u201d Ann. Neurol. 25:351-356; Howard et al. (1989) \u201c-,\u201d J. Neurosurg. 7(1):105-112); U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,377; U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,597; U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,015; U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,463; U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99\/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99\/20253). Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target (e.g., the lungs), thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in , supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). In another embodiment, polymeric compositions useful as controlled release implants are used according to Dunn et al. (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,155). This particular method is based upon the therapeutic effect of the in situ controlled release of the bioactive material from the polymer system. The implantation can generally occur anywhere within the body of the patient in need of therapeutic treatment. In another embodiment, a non-polymeric sustained delivery system is used, whereby a non-polymeric implant in the body of the subject is used as a drug delivery system. Upon implantation in the body, the organic solvent of the implant will dissipate, disperse, or leach from the composition into surrounding tissue fluid, and the non-polymeric material will gradually coagulate or precipitate to form a solid, microporous matrix (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,533).","Controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990) \u201c,\u201d Science 249:1527-1533. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,526,938; International Publication Nos. WO 91\/05548 and WO 96\/20698; Ning et al. (1996) \u201c-,\u201d Radiotherapy & Oncology 39:179-189; Song et al.

Mater. 24:759-760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In a specific embodiment where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding an antibody, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded antibody, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see e.g., Joliot et al. (1991) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864-1868), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.","For antibodies, the therapeutically or prophylactically effective dosage administered to a subject is typically 0.1 mg\/kg to 200 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a subject is between 0.1 mg\/kg and 20 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight and more preferably the dosage administered to a subject is between 1 mg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg of the subject's body weight. The dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced also by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the lung) of the antibodies or fusion proteins by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.","Treatment of a subject with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of antibodies of the invention can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with antibodies of the invention in the range of between about 0.1 to 30 mg\/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered once a week, twice a week, once every two weeks, once a month, once every six weeks, once every two months, twice a year or once per year. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of the antibodies used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment.","The compositions of the invention include bulk drug compositions useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., impure or non-sterile compositions) and pharmaceutical compositions (i.e., compositions that are suitable for administration to a subject or patient) which can be used in the preparation of unit dosage forms. Such compositions comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agent disclosed herein or a combination of those agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, compositions of the invention comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of antibodies of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In one particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises of a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody or a fragment thereof that binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with a greater affinity than said antibody or a fragment thereof binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, a cytotoxic antibody that specifically binds a cancer antigen, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, said pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more anti-cancer agents.","In another particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises: (i) a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody or fragment thereof that specifically binds the extracellular domain of human Fc\u03b3RIIB and blocks the Fc binding site of human Fc\u03b3RIIB; (ii) a cytotoxic antibody that specifically binds a cancer antigen; and (iii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","In a specific embodiment, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant (e.g., Freund's adjuvant (complete and incomplete), excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like.","Generally, the ingredients of compositions of the invention are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.","The compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.","The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions and kits comprising a Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonist for use in the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a B-cell malignancy, or one or more symptoms thereof. In particular, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions and kits comprising an Fc\u03b3RIIB antagonist, an analog, derivative or an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof.","In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding antibodies or fusion proteins, are administered to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or infection, by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or fusion protein that mediates a therapeutic or prophylactic effect.","Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.","For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d Clinical Pharmacy 12:488-505; Wu et al. (1991) \u201c,\u201d Biotherapy 3:87-95; Tolstoshev (1993) \u201c,\u201d Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596; Mulligan (1993) \u201c,\u201d Science 260:926-932; and Morgan et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217. Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. (eds.), CPMB, John Wiley & Sons, NY (1993); and Kriegler, GTE, A LM, Stockton Press, NY (1990).","In a preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding an antibody, said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the antibody coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Koller et al. (1989) \u201c2-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al. (1989) \u201c-2 ,\u201d Nature 342:435-438).","In another preferred aspect, a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding a fusion protein, said nucleic acids being a part of an expression vector that expression the fusion protein in a suitable host. In particular, such nucleic acids have promoters, preferably heterologous promoters, operably linked to the coding region of a fusion protein, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and optionally, tissue-specific. In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the coding sequence of the fusion protein and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the fusion protein encoding nucleic acids.","Delivery of the nucleic acids into a subject may be either direct, in which case the subject is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid-carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case, cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the subject. These two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection using defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral vectors (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection of naked DNA, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or by coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor-mediated endocytosis (See, e.g., Wu et al. (1987) \u201c-,\u201d J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432) (which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors), etc. In another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005\/0002903; PCT Publications WO 92\/06180; WO 92\/22635; WO 92\/20316; WO 93\/14188; WO 93\/20221). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination (Koller et al. (1989) \u201c2-,\u201d Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935; and Zijlstra et al. (1989) \u201c-2 ,\u201d Nature 342:435-438).","In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or a fusion protein are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (See Miller et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d Meth. Enzymol. 217:581-599). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody or a fusion protein to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitate delivery of the nucleotide sequence into a subject. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. (1994) \u201c-1 ,\u201d Biotherapy 6:291-302, which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy include: Clowes et al. (1994) \u201c-,\u201d J. Clin. Invest. 93:644-651; Keim et al. (1994) \u201c-,\u201d Blood 83:1467-1473; Salmons et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d Human Gene Therapy 4:129-141; and Grossman et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110-114.","Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. For a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy see Kozarsky et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499-503. The use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys has been demonstrated by Bout et al. (1994) \u201c-,\u201d Human Gene Therapy 5:3-10. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. (1991) \u201c-1-,\u201d Science 252:431-434; Rosenfeld et al. (1992) \u201c,\u201d Cell 68:143-155; Mastrangeli et al. (1993) \u201c-,\u201d J. Clin. Invest. 91:225-234; PCT Publication WO94\/12649; and Wang et al. (1995) \u201c-,\u201d Gene Therapy 2:775-783. In a preferred embodiment, adenovirus vectors are used.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has also been proposed for use in gene therapy (see, e.g., Walsh et al. (1993) \u201c,\u201d Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289-300 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146).","Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a subject.","In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to, transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector, containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcellmediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion, etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells (See, e.g., Loeffler et al. (1993) \u201c-,\u201d Meth. Enzymol. 217:599-618, Cotten et al. (1993) \u201c-,\u201d Meth. Enzymol. 217:618-644) and may be used in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.","The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a subject by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells) are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc.","In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the subject.","In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or a fusion protein are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and\/or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention (See e.g., PCT Publication WO 94\/08598; Stemple et al. (1992) \u201c,\u201d Cell 7(1):973-985; Rheinwald (1980) \u201c,\u201d Meth. Cell Bio. 21A:229-254; and Pittelkow et al. (1986) \u201c,\u201d Mayo Clinic Proc. 61:771-777).","In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.","The invention provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with antibodies of the invention. Additionally, one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of a disease can also be included in the pharmaceutical pack or kit. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.","The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment, a kit comprises one or more antibodies of the invention. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer, in one or more containers. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises one or more cytotoxic antibodies that bind one or more cancer antigens associated with cancer. In certain embodiments, the other prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a chemotherapeutic. In other embodiments, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a biological or hormonal therapeutic.","Several aspects of the pharmaceutical compositions or prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, e.g., in a cell culture system, and then in vivo e.g., in an animal model organism, such as a rodent animal model system, for the desired therapeutic activity prior to use in humans. For example, assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific pharmaceutical composition is indicated, include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a pharmaceutical composition, and the effect of such composition upon the tissue sample is observed, e.g., inhibition of or decrease in growth and\/or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network formation in three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective prophylactic or therapeutic molecule(s) for each individual patient. Alternatively, instead of culturing cells from a patient, therapeutic agents and methods may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. In various specific embodiments, in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., T cells), to determine if a pharmaceutical composition of the invention has a desired effect upon such cell types. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and\/or growth; for example, cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H-thymidine incorporation, by direct cell count, by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto-oncogenes (e.g., fos, myc) or cell cycle markers; cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining, differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology, decreased growth and\/or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network formation in three-dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation, etc. Additional assays include raft association, CDC, ADCC and apoptosis assays as known in the art and described in the Examples.","Combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include, but are not limited to, rats, mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, pigs, dogs, rabbits, etc. Any animal system well-known in the art may be used. In a specific embodiment of the invention, combinations of prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents are tested in a mouse model system. Such model systems are widely used and well-known to the skilled artisan. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents can be administered repeatedly. Several aspects of the procedure may vary such as the temporal regime of administering the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents, and whether such agents are administered separately or as an admixture.","Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are for example, transgenic mice expressing Fc\u03b3R on mouse effector cells, e.g., any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,396 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Transgenic mice for use in the methods of the invention include but are not limited to mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIIA, mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIA, mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIIA, mice carrying human Fc\u03b3RIIB and human Fc\u03b3RIIA.","Once the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents of the invention have been tested in an animal model they can be tested in clinical trials to establish their efficacy. Establishing clinical trials will be done in accordance with common methodologies known to one skilled in the art, and the optimal dosages and routes of administration as well as toxicity profiles of the compositions of the invention can be established using routine experimentation.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be determined by using various experimental animal models of inflammatory arthritis known in the art and described in Crofford and Wilder, (1993) \u201c\u201d, in , McCarty et al. (eds.), Chapter 30. Experimental and spontaneous animal models of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune rheumatic diseases can also be used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention. The following are some assays provided as examples, and not by limitation.","The principle animal models for arthritis or inflammatory disease known in the art and widely used include: adjuvant-induced arthritis rat models, collagen-induced arthritis rat and mouse models and antigen-induced arthritis rat, rabbit and hamster models, all described in Crofford and Wilder, (1993) \u201c\u201d, in , McCarty et al. (eds.), Chapter 30, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be assessed using a carrageenan-induced arthritis rat model. Carrageenan-induced arthritis has also been used in rabbit, dog and pig in studies of chronic arthritis or inflammation. Quantitative histomorphometric assessment is used to determine therapeutic efficacy. The methods for using such a carrageenan-induced arthritis model is described in Hansra et al. (2000) \u201c-,\u201d Inflammation, 24(2): 141-155. Also commonly used are zymosan-induced inflammation animal models as known and described in the art.","The anti-inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can also be assessed by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema in the rat, using a modification of the method described in Winter et al., (1962) \u201c--\u201d Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol Med. 111: 544-547. This assay has been used as a primary in vivo screen for the anti-inflammatory activity of most NSAIDs, and is considered predictive of human efficacy. The anti-inflammatory activity of the test prophylactic or therapeutic agents is expressed as the percent inhibition of the increase in hind paw weight of the test group relative to the vehicle dosed control group.","Additionally, animal models for inflammatory bowel disease can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention (Kim et al. (1992) \u201c,\u201d Scand. J. Gastroentrol. 27:529-537; Strober (1985) \u201c,\u201d Dig. Dis. Sci. 30(12 Suppl):3S-10S). Ulcerative cholitis and Crohn's disease are human inflammatory bowel diseases that can be induced in animals. Sulfated polysaccharides including, but not limited to amylopectin, carrageen, amylopectin sulfate, and dextran sulfate or chemical irritants including but not limited to trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) and acetic acid can be administered to animals orally to induce inflammatory bowel diseases.","Animal models for asthma can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention. An example of one such model is the murine adoptive transfer model in which aeroallergen provocation of TH1 or TH2 recipient mice results in TH effector cell migration to the airways and is associated with an intense neutrophilic (TH1) and eosinophilic (TH2) lung mucosal inflammatory response (Cohn et al. (1997) \u201c2 (2) 4 ,\u201d J. Exp. Med. 186:1737-1747).","Animal models for autoimmune disorders can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention. Animal models for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, thyroid autoimmunity, systemic lupus eruthematosus, and glomerulonephritis have been developed (Flanders et al. (1999) \u201c,\u201d Autoimmunity 29:235-246; Rasmussen et al. (1999) \u201c,\u201d Biochimie 81:511-515; Foster (1999) \u201c,\u201d Semin. Nephrol. 19: 12-24).","Further, any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for autoimmune and\/or inflammatory diseases.","Toxicity and efficacy of the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic protocols of the instant invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\/ED. Prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.","The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and\/or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC(i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.","The anti-cancer activity of the therapies used in accordance with the present invention also can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer such as the SCID mouse model or transgenic mice or nude mice with human xenografts, animal models, such as hamsters, rabbits, etc. known in the art and described in RTMADD(1999) Fiebig and Burger, eds., (1999) Karger; , (1991) Boven and Winograd, eds.; and , (1997) Teicher, ed., herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo, for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans.

Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase; radioisotopes, such as iodine (I, I), carbon (C), sulfur (S), tritium (H), indium (In), and technetium (Tc); luminescent labels, such as luminol; and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine.","One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease, disorder, or infection in a human.

Background level can be determined by various methods including, comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.","It is well understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled antibody will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., \u201c.\u201d (Chapter 13 in , S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc.

A mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with greater affinity than said monoclonal antibody binds Fc\u03b3RIIA, was generated. Transgenic Fc\u03b3RIIA mice (generated in Dr. Ravetch Laboratory, Rockefeller University) were immunized with Fc\u03b3RIIB purified from supernatant of 293 cells that had been transfected with cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of the human Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor, residues 1-180. Hybridoma cell lines from spleen cells of these mice were produced and screened for antibodies that specifically bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with greater affinity than the antibodies bind Fc\u03b3RIIA.","Antibody Screening and Characterization","Materials and Methods:","Supernatants from hybridoma cultures are screened for immunoreactivity against Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB using ELISA assays. In each case, the plate is coated with 100 ng\/well of Fc\u03b3RIIA or Fc\u03b3RIIB. The binding of the antibody to the specific receptor is detected with goat anti-mouse HRP conjugated antibody by monitoring the absorbance at 650 nm.","In the blocking ELISA experiment, the ability of the antibody from the hybridoma supernatant to block binding of aggregated IgG to Fc\u03b3RIIB is monitored. The plate is blocked with the appropriate \u201cblocking agent\u201d, washed three times (200 \u03bcl\/well) with wash buffer (PBS plus 0.1% Tween). The plate is pre-incubated with hybridoma supernatant for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. Subsequent to blocking, a fixed amount of aggregated biotinylated human IgG (1 \u03bcg\/well) is added to the wells to allow the aggregate to bind to the Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor. This reaction is carried out for two hours at 37\u00b0 C. Detection is then monitored, after additional washing, with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate, which detects the bound aggregated IgG. The absorbance at 650 nm is proportional to the bound aggregated IgG.","In a \u03b2-hexoaminidase release assay the ability of an antibody from the hybridoma supernatant to inhibit Fc\u03b5-induced release of \u03b2-hexoaminidase is monitored. RBL-2H3 cells are transfected with human Fc\u03b3RIIB; cells are stimulated with various concentration of goat anti-mouse F(ab)fragment ranging from 0.03 \u03bcg\/mL to 30 \u03bcg\/mL; sensitized with either mouse IgE alone (at 0.01 \u03bcg\/mL) or with an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody. After 1 hour incubation at 370 temperature, the cells are spun down; the supernatant is collected; and the cells are lysed. The \u03b2-hexoaminidase activity released in the supernatant is determined in a colorometric assay using p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-\u03b2 D-glucoasminide. The release \u03b2-hexoaminidase activity is expressed as a percentage of the released activity relative to the total activity.","BIAcore Analysis:","Antibody binding to CD32A-H131, CD32A-R131 or CD32B was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore 3000 biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) by using soluble extracellular domains of the receptors expressed in 293H cells. The capturing antibody, a F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of a goat anti-mouse Fc-specific antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa.), was immobilized on the CM-5 sensor chip according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the carboxyl groups on the sensor chip surface were activated with an injection of a solution containing 0.2M N-ethyl-N-(3diethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide and 0.05M N-hydroxy-succinimide. The F(ab\u2032)2 fragment was then injected over the activated CM-5 surface in 10 mM sodium-acetate, pH 5.0, at flow rate 5 \u03bcl\/min for 420 sec, followed by 1 M ethanolamine for deactivation. Binding experiments were performed in HBS-P buffer containing 110 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% P20 surfactant. Each monoclonal antibody was captured on the CM-5 chip by injecting a 300 nM-antibody solution at flow rate 5 \u03bcl\/min for 240 sec, followed by an injection of the monomeric soluble receptors at concentration of 100 nM and a flow rate 50 \u03bcl\/min for 120 sec with dissociation time 180 sec. Regeneration of the F(ab\u2032)2 GAM surface was performed by pulse injection of 50 mM glycine, pH 1.5 and 50 mM NaOH. Reference curves were obtained by injection of each soluble receptor over the immobilized F(ab\u2032)2 GAM surface with no captured antibody. Reference curves were subtracted and responses were normalized to the same level of captured antibody. To obtain kinetic parameters of binding of soluble receptors to captured antibodies, binding curves to corresponding IgG at corresponding concentrations were subtracted. Resulted curves were analyzed by separate ka\/kd fit. KD values were calculated as average of four curves at two different concentrations.","FACS Analysis","CHO cells, expressing Fc\u03b3RIIB are stained with various antibodies and analyzed by FACS. In one series of experiment, the cells are directly labeled to determine if the monoclonal antibodies recognize the receptor.","In the blocking FACS experiment, the ability of the antibody from the hybridoma supernatant to block the binding of aggregated IgG to Fc\u03b3RIIB is monitored. About 1 million cells (CHO cells expressing Fc\u03b3RIIB) for each sample are incubated on ice for 30 minutes with 2 \u03bcg of the isotype control (mouse IgG1) or with the 2B6 or 3H7 antibody. Cells are washed once with PBS+1% BSA and incubated with 1 \u03bcg of aggregated biotinylated human IgG for 30 minutes on ice. Cells are washed and the secondary antibodies are added, goat anti-mouse-FITC to detect the bound antibody and Streptavidin-PE conjugated to detect the bound aggregated biotinylated human IgG and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cells are washed and analyzed by FACS.","B Lymphocytes are stained to detect the presence of Fc\u03b3RIIB and CD20. 200 \u03bcl of \u201cbuffy coat\u201d for each sample is incubated on ice with 2 \u03bcg of isotype control or the monoclonal antibodies, 2B6 or 3H7. Cells are washed once with PBS+1% BSA and incubated with 11 of goat anti mouse-PE antibody for 30 minutes on ice. Cells are washed once and CD20-FITC antibody (2 \u03bcg) is added to the samples and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. All samples are washed with PBS+1% BSA once and the cells are analyzed by FACS.","Human PBMCs were stained with 2B6, 3H7, and IV.3 antibodies, followed by a goat anti-mouse-Cyanine (Cy5) conjugated antibody (two color staining using anti-CD20-FITC conjugated for B lymphocytes, anti-CD14-PE conjugated for monocytes, anti-CD56-PE conjugated for NK cells and anti-CD16-PE conjugated for granulocytes.","ADCC Assay","4-5\u00d710target cells expressing Her2\/neu antigen (IGROV-1 or SKBR-3 cells) are labeled with bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-t-6\u2033-dicarboxylate (DELFIA BATDA Reagent, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). BATDA reagent is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. preferably under 5% CO, for at least 30 minutes. The cells are then washed with a physiological buffer, e.g., PBS with 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole, and media containing 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole. The labeled target cells are added to effector cells, e.g., PBMC, to produce effector:target ratios of approximately 50:1, 75:1, or 100:1. PBMC is isolated by layering whole blood onto Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) and spinning at room temperature for 30 mins at 500 g. The leukocyte layer is harvested as effectors for Europium-based ADCC assays. Frozen or freshly isolated elutriated monocytes (Advanced Biotechnologies, MD) is used as effectors with the tumor target cell lines at varying effector to target ratio of 100:1 to 10:1 and the concentration of the antibodies is titrated from 1-\u03bcg\/ml. Monocytes obtained as frozen stocks stimulated with cytokines is used as effector cells in ADCC assays. If frozen monocytes perform optimally they will be routinely used otherwise fresh cells will be used. MDM will be prepared by treatment with cytokines GM-CSF or M-CSF that are known to enhance the viability and differentiation of monocytes in culture. MDM will be stimulated with cytokines and the expression of the various Fc\u03b3Rs (I, IIA, IIB, and IIIA) determined by FACS analysis.","The effector and target cells are incubated for at least two hours, and up to 16 hours, at 37\u00b0 C., under 5% COin the presence of an anti-tumor antibody, specific for an antigen expressed on the target cells, Her2\/neu, and in the presence or absence of an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody. A chimeric 4D5 antibody that has been engineered to contain the N297A mutation which is used as a negative control since this antibody binds the tumor target cells via its variable region. Loss of glycosylation at this site abolishes binding of the Fc region of the antibody to Fc\u03b3R. Commercially available human IgG1\/k serves as an isotype control for the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody. Cell supernatants are harvested and added to an acidic europium solution (e.g., DELFIA Europium Solution, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). The fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (e.g., Victor 1420, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac). Maximal release (MR) and spontaneous release (SR) are determined by incubation of target cells with 1% TX-100 and media alone, respectively. Antibody independent cellular cytotoxicity (AICC) is measured by incubation of target and effector cells in the absence of antibody. Each assay is preferably performed in triplicate. The mean percentage specific lysis is calculated as: Experimental release (ADCC)-AICC)\/(MR-SR)\u00d7100.","The direct binding of different batches of hybridoma cultures to Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB were compared using an ELISA assay (). Supernatants numbered 1, 4, 7, 9, and 3 were tested for specific binding and their binding was compared to a commercially available antibody, FL18.26. As shown in , supernatant from clone 7 has the maximal binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB, which is about four times higher under saturating conditions than the binding of the commercially available antibody to Fc\u03b3RIIB. However, the supernatant from clone 7 has hardly any affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIA, as seen in , whereas the commercially available antibody binds Fc\u03b3RIIA at least 4 times better.","Direct binding of the antibody produced from the 3H7 clone to Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB. The binding of crude 3H7 supernatant () and purified 3H7 supernatant was measured (). In each case, the supernatant was supplied at a concentration of 70 \u03bcg\/ml and diluted up to 6-fold. As shown in , upon saturating conditions, the 3H7 supernatant binds Fc\u03b3RIIB four times better than it binds Fc\u03b3RIIA. Upon purification with a protein G column, the absolute binding of the 3H7 supernatant to each immunogen improves.","Blocking of aggregated human IgG binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB by the antibody produced from the 3H7 clone. If the antibody present in the hybridoma supernatant binds Fc\u03b3RIIB at the IgG binding site and blocks IgG binding, then the aggregated IgG cannot bind the receptor and hence no absorbance at 650 can be detected. The antibody in effect is a \u201cblocking agent\u201d that blocks the IgG binding site on Fc\u03b3RIIB. As a control, the ELISA was carried out with no blocking, with a control supernatant, and with supernatant from the 3H7 clone. As shown in , the 3H7 supernatant completely blocks IgG binding, since aggregated IgG cannot bind the receptor as evident from the lack of absorbance at 650 nm. The control supernatant however fails to block IgG binding; aggregated IgG binds the receptor as evident by the reading at 650 nm. The control supernatant behaves similarly to the condition where no blocking was done.","Comparison of the direct binding of the antibody produced from the 3H7 clone to bacterial and mammalian Fc\u03b3RIIB. As shown in , the supernatant from the 3H7 clone, binds comparably to mammalian and bacterial Fc\u03b3RIIB. Upon saturating conditions, the 3H7 supernatant binds bacterial and mammalian Fc\u03b3RIIB about three times better than it binds Fc\u03b3RIIA. The monoclonal antibody from the 3H7 clone is thus able to specifically bind to mammalian Fc\u03b3RIIB which has been post-transnationally modified (e.g., glycosylation).","Direct binding of the antibody produced from the 3H7 clone to Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB, and Fc\u03b3RIIIA. The direct binding of supernatant from the hybridoma cultures from the 3H7 cell line to Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB were compared using an ELISA assay (). The antibody produced from clone 3H7 has no affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIA, and binds Fc\u03b3RIIB with about 4 times greater affinity than it binds Fc\u03b3RIIA.","Comparison of direct binding of the antibody produced from clone 2B6 compared to other three commercially available monoclonal antibodies against Fc\u03b3RII. The binding of the antibody produced from clone 2B6 to Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB is compared to that of three other commercially available antibodies, AT10, FL18.26, and IV.3, against Fc\u03b3RII in an ELISA assay. As seen in , the antibody produced from clone 2B6 binds Fc\u03b3RIIB up to 4.5 times better than the other commercially available antibodies. Additionally, the antibody produced from clone 2B6 has minimal affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIA, whereas the other three commercially available antibodies bind Fc\u03b3RIIA in a saturatable manner and twice as much as the antibody from clone 2B6 binds Fc\u03b3RIIA ().","Blocking of aggregated human IgG to Fc\u03b3RIIB by the antibody produced from clone 2B6. The ability of the antibody produced from clone 2B6 to block binding of the aggregated IgG to Fc\u03b3RIIB was investigated by a blocking ELISA assay and compared to that of the antibody produced by clone 3H7. As shown in , the control supernatant does not bind Fc\u03b3RIIB on the IgG binding site and the aggregated IgG can bind the receptor and hence absorbance at 650 nm is maximal. Clone 3H7, however, blocks the IgG binding up to 75%. Clone 2B6 completely blocks the binding of the IgG binding site and does not allow the aggregated IgG to bind the receptor, and even at very high dilutions no absorbance is detected at 650 nm.  represents the data in a bar diagram.","Competition of 2B6 antibody and aggregated IgG in binding Fc\u03b3RIIB using double-staining FACS assays. A double staining FACS assay was used to characterize the antibody produced from clone 2B6 in CHO cells that had been transfected with full-length mammalian Fc\u03b3RIIB.","As shown in , the antibody produced from clone 2B6 effectively blocks the binding of aggregated IgG to the Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor in CHO cells since no staining is observed for biotinylated aggregated IgG after the cells were pre-incubated with the monoclonal antibody. The cells are only stained in the lower right panel, indicating that most of the cells were bound to the monoclonal antibody from the 2B6 clone. In the control experiments (), using IgG1 as the isotype control, when the cells are stained with the isotype labeled IgG, no staining is observed since the monomeric IgG does not bind Fc\u03b3RIIB with any detectable affinity, whereas in , about 60% of the cells are stained with aggregated IgG, which is capable of binding Fc\u03b3RIIB.","Specificity and selectivity for CD32B by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Specificity and relative affinities for human CD32B vs. CD32A were studied by surface plasmon resonance analysis. All antibodies were captured on the chip surface by an immobilized F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of a goat anti-mouse antibody. Soluble monomeric forms of human CD32A-H131, CD32A-R131 or CD32B were injected to monitor the interaction with the captured antibodies. As shown in , 2B6 interacted with CD32B () in the absence of detectable binding to CD32A (). A well-characterized commercial anti-huCD32 antibody, KB61, was also used in the assay for comparison. KB61 showed binding to both receptors. Therefore, 2B6 reacts exclusively with CD32B in the absence of detectable CD32A recognition.","Monoclonal anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies and CD20 co-stain Human B Lymphocytes. A double staining FACS assay was used to characterize the antibody produced from clones 2B6 and 3H7 in human B lymphocytes. Cells were stained with anti-CD20 antibody which was FITC conjugated, to select the B-lymphocyte population, as well as the antibodies produced from clone 3H7 and 2B6, labeled with goat anti-mouse peroxidase. The horizontal axis represents the intensity of the anti-CD20 antibody fluorescence and the vertical axis represents the intensity of the monoclonal antibody fluorescence. As shown in , cells are double stained with the anti-CD20 antibody as well as the antibodies produced from clones 2B6 and 3H7, however, the antibody produced from clone 2B6 shows more intense staining than that produced from clone 3H7.  shows the staining of the isotype control, mouse IgG1.","Staining of CHO cells expressing Fc\u03b3RIIB. CHO cells, stably expressing Fc\u03b3RIIB were stained with IgG1 isotype control () or with supernatant from the 3H7 hybridoma (). Goat anti-mouse peroxidase conjugated antibody was used as a secondary antibody. The cells were then analyzed by FACS; cells that are stained with the supernatant from the 3H7 hybridoma show a strong fluorescence signal and a peak shift to the right; indicating the detection of Fc\u03b3RIIB in the CHO cells by the supernatant produced from the 3H7 hybridoma. Cells stained with the supernatant from the 2B6 hybridoma, also show a significant fluorescence, as compared to cells stained with IgG1, and a peak shift to the right, indicating the detection of Fc\u03b3RIIB in the CHO cells by the supernatant produced from the 2B6 hybridoma.","CHO cells expressing hyFc\u03b3RIIB were incubated with the anti CD32B antibodies, 2B6 or 3H7. Cells were washed and 9 \u03bcg\/ml of aggregated human IgG were added to the cells on ice. The human aggregated IgG were detected with goat anti human-IgG GITC conjugated. Samples were analyzed by FACS cells labeled with 2B6 or 3H7 showed a significant fluorescence peak in the presence of aggregated human IgG (). 2BG antibody completely blocks binding of aggregated IgG as evidenced by the fluorescent peak shift to the left. Whereas the 3H7 antibody partially blocks binding of aggregated IgG as shown by the intermediate fluorescent peak. The other antibodies, 1D5, 1F2, 2E1, 2H9, and 2D11 do not block binding of aggregated IgG. The amount of each antibody bound to the receptor on the cells was also detected (inset) on a separate set of samples using a goat anti-mouse PE conjugated antibody.","Recognition of CD32B on the cell surface. Experiments were carried out to test the ability of the antibodies to discriminate CD32B from CD32A expressed on cells and to recognize the native CD32B molecule on human cell lines. To assess the antibodies' specificity, 2B6 and the pan-anti-CD32 antibody, FLI.826, were tested in FACS analysis with 293-HEK human cells stably transfected with expression vectors encoding the human CD32A-Ror CD32B proteins, Daudi, Raji and THP-1 ().","2B6 reacted with 293-HEK transfected with CD32B as well as Daudi and Raji cells (Burkitt's lymphoma-derived lymphoblastoid lines expressing CD32B), while it did not stain THP1 monocytic cells lines, which are known to express exclusively CD32A (Hform). By contrast, FLI8.26 reacted with all cell lines indicating no preference between CD32A and CD32B.","FACS profiles using 2B6, 3H7, and IV.3 antibodies on human peripheral blood leukocyte. The FACS profile of the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies and IV.3 antibody shows their ability to discriminate between the two Fc\u03b3RII isoforms, IIB and IIA expressed on the human hematopoietic cells. IV.3, one of the first antibodies (commercially available) used to define Fc\u03b3RII, shows preferential binding to Fc\u03b3RIIA.","There are characteristic and functionally significant differences in isoform expression between major human hematopoietic cell types. Human B lymphocytes express exclusively the huFc\u03b3RIIB isoform while human monocytes express predominantly the huFc\u03b3RIIA isoform. Granulocytes are strongly positive for Fc\u03b3RIIA and limited evidence suggest that Fc\u03b3RIIB is marginally expressed in this population (Pricop et al., (2000) \u201c1 2 ,\u201d J. Immunol. 166:531-537). To further characterize the reactivity of the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies, huPBL were stained with the anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibodies 2B6 and 3H7 and with IV.3, which preferentially (but not exclusively) recognizes the Fc\u03b3RIIA isoform of the receptor, leukocytes populations were selected based on FSC vs. SSC gating () and identified with specific markers: CD20 (B cells) (, D and F), CD56 () or CD16 (NK cells, lymphocyte gate), CD14 (monocytes) (, M and O) and CD16 (granulocytes, granulocyte gate) (, E, G, L, N and P). CD20-positive cells (B cells) were uniformly stained with 2B6, 3H7. IV.3 also stained the majority of CD20-positive cells. No staining was observed for CD16\/CD56-positive NK cells, while only a fraction of CD14-(monocytes) and CD16-(granulocytes) positive cells were stained with 2B6, 3H7. In contrast, IV.3 strongly stained the vast majority of CD-14-positive monocytes and the totality of CD16-positive granulocytes (FIGS. J and O-P). This differential pattern of reactivity between 2B6 and 3H7 on the one side and IV.3 on the other indicates that the new monoclonal antibodies react strongly with Fc\u03b3RIIB, but not with FC\u03b3RIIA, while IV.3 cannot discriminate between Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB isoforms in vivo.","Inhibition Of \u03b2-Hexosaminidase Release By 2B6. To examine the potential role of an anti-CD32B antibody in modulating immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions, the effect of inducing a co-aggregation of activating (Fc\u03b5RI) and inhibitory receptors (Fc\u03b3RIIB) was investigated. The rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3, was chosen as a model system due its extensive use in the art as an allergy model designed to study the underlying mechanism of IgE-mediated mast cell activation (Ott et al. (2002) \u201c62,\u201d J. Immunol. 168:4430-9). Transfected RBL cells expressing Fc\u03b3RIIB were suspended in fresh media containing 0.01 \u03bcg\/ml of murine anti-DNP IgE and plated in 96 well plates at a concentration of 2\u00d7104 cells\/well. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C. in the presence of CO2, cells were washed twice with pre-warmed release buffer (10 mM HEPES, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.4 mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 5.6 mM glucose, 1.8 mM calcium chloride, 1.3 mM magnesium sulfate and 0.04% BSA, pH 7.4) and treated at 37\u00b0 C. with serial dilutions of BSA-DNP-FITC complexed with chimeric 4-4-20 antibody or BSA-DNP-FITC complexed with chimeric D265A 4-4-20 antibody in 100 \u03bcL buffer\/well in the presence of 2B6 antibody, 1F2 antibody or murine IgG1 isotype control. Alternatively cells were challenged with F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of a polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG to aggregate Fc\u03b5RI (Genzyme). Crosslinking of the Fc\u03b5Rs occurs because the polyclonal antibody recognizes the light chain of the murine IgE antibody bound to Fc\u03b5RI. This experiment is schematically shown in .","The reaction was stopped after 30 minutes by placing the cells on ice. 50 \u03bcL of supernatant from each well was removed and the cells were osmotically lysed. Cell lysates were incubated with p-Nitrophenyl-N-Acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide (5 mM) for 90 minutes, the reaction was stopped with glycine (0.1M, pH 10.4) and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured after three minutes. The percentage of \u03b2-hexosaminidase released was calculated as total media OD\/total supernatant OD\/total supernatant+total cell lysate OD.","Results","To test the ability of ch2B6 to limit the inflammatory or allergic responses triggered by the activating receptor, F(ab\u2032)2 fragments were used to coaggregate activating receptors or combinations of inhibitory and activating receptors as described above. When cells were sensitized only with IgE, the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG recognized the light chain of the murine IgE bound to Fc\u03b5RI, aggregated these activating receptors, and \u03b2-hexosaminidase release, a marker for degranulation (Aketani et al. (2001) \u201c-23 -,\u201d Immunol. Lett. 75: 185-189), increased with increasing IgE (). In contrast, when cells were sensitized with IgE after incubation with 2B6 or 1F2, the F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, in effect, co-cross-linked the rat Fc\u03b5RI with CD32B and resulted in a significant decrease in \u03b2-hexosaminidase release when compared to sensitized cells preincubated with an irrelevant murine IgG1 isotype control matched antibody. No degranulation over background levels was detected in cells treated with the anti-CD32B antibodies alone (data not shown). Therefore, the human inhibitory receptor, CD32B, can induce a negative signal in rat basophilic cells, validating these transfectants as a model for the study of anti-human CD32B antibodies.","To test whether anti-CD32B antibodies may also be able to improve such reactions, the co-engagement of the inhibitory receptor with an activating receptor was prevented by a blockade of CD32B. Co-engagement of these receptors is thought to physiologically occur when antigens simultaneously interact with surface-bound IgE through antigenic epitopes and with CD32B through Fc determinants of antigen-specific IgG complexed with the antigen itself (). To mimic this situation, the RBL-2H3 model was manipulated to obtain co-engagement of Fc\u03b5RI and CD32B by developing an antigen surrogate that could be complexed with IgE, IgG, or both. HuCD32B+RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with a murine IgE anti-DNP monoclonal antibody. The challenge antigen, BSA-DNP, was further conjugated to FITC to provide additional epitopes recognized by a chimeric version of 4-4-20, a murine anti-fluorescein antibody whose Fc portion had been substituted with human IgG1 Fc to allow for optimal binding to human CD32B. A chimeric version of 4-4-20 with a human IgG1 Fc bearing a mutation in position 265 (asparagine to alanine) was also generated. This chimeric D265A 4-4-20 antibody lacks the ability to bind Fc\u03b3Rs, including CD32B. BSA-DNP-FITC induced a dose-dependent release of \u03b2-hexosaminidase from IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells ().","The same extent of degranulation was observed when the challenge antigen was BSA-DNP-FITC complexed with chimeric D265A 4-4-20, showing that BSA-DNP-FITC-chimeric D265A 4-4-20, as expected, was unable to recruit CD32B to the activating receptor. In the presence of BSA-DNP-FITC complexed with chimeric 4-4-20, a substantial reduction in \u03b2-hexosaminidase release was observed (). Thus, the polyvalent antigen is capable of aggregating Fc\u03b5RI with ensuing degranulation, while the surrogate antigen complexed with IgG co-aggregates CD32B resulting in diminished degranulation. To block CD32B while minimizing the chances of simultaneously engaging the Fc\u03b3R, F(ab)2 fragments of 2B6 where prepared and cells pre-incubated with 2B6 F(ab)2, prior to activation with the immunocomplexed antigen. Under these conditions, the percentage of \u03b2-hexosaminidase release was restored to the maximum levels observed in cells treated with the polyvalent antigen alone (). At higher concentrations of immunocomplexed antigen a diminished degranulation was still observed, presumably due to competition between ch4-4-20 and 2B6 F(ab)2 for the Fc binding site of CD32B. These data show that 2B6 is capable of functionally blocking the Fc binding site of CD32B, preventing the co-ligation of activating and inhibitory receptors by an IgG-complexed antigen. The proposed mode of action may have use in the regulation of immunecomplex-mediated cell activation.","In order to determine whether IGROV-1, OVCAR-8, and SKBR-3 cells express the Her2\/neu antigen, cells were stained with either purified 4D5 or ch4D5 antibody on ice; the unbound antibody was washed out with PBS\/BSA buffer containing sodium azide, and the binding of 4D5 or ch4D5 was detected by goat anti-mouse or goat anti-human antibody conjugated to PE (Jackson Laboratories), respectively. An irrelevant IgG1 antibody (Becton Dickinson) served as a control for non-specific binding. As shown in , the ovarian tumor cell lines express less Her2\/neu antigens than the breast carcinoma cell line and evaluating these cell lines in parallel will determine the stringency of tumor clearance by an anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB antibody of the invention.","Human monocytes are the effector population involved in ADCC that express both activating and inhibitory receptors. The expression of Fc\u03b3Rs was tested by FACS analysis using several lots of frozen monocytes as these cells will be adoptively transferred as effectors to investigate the role of ch2B6 in tumor clearance. Commercially obtained frozen elutriated monocytes were thawed in basal medium containing 10% human AB serum and in basal medium with human serum and 25-50 ng\/ml GM-CSF. Cells were either stained directly or allowed to mature to macrophages for 7-8 days (MDM), lifted off the plastic, and then stained with IV.3-FITC (anti-hu Fc\u03b3RIIA), 32.2-FITC (anti-Fc\u03b3RI), CD16-PE (Pharmingen) or 3G8 (anti-Fc\u03b3RIII)-goat anti-mouse-PE, 3H7 (anti-Fc\u03b3RIIB), and CD14 marker for monocytes (Pharmingen), along with relevant isotype controls. A representative FACS profile of MDM from two donors, depicting Fc\u03b3R expression on freshly thawed monocytes and cultured monocytes, is shown in .","These results indicate that Fc\u03b3RIIB is modestly expressed in monocytes (5-30% depending on the donor). However, this expression increases as they mature into macrophages. Preliminary data show that tumor-infiltrating macrophages in human tumor specimens are positively stained for Fc\u03b3RIIB (data not shown). The pattern of Fc\u03b3Rs and the ability to morphologically differentiate into macrophages was found to be reproducible in several lots of frozen monocytes. These data indicate that this source of cells is adequate for adoptive transfer experiments.","Ch4D5 mediates effective ADCC with ovarian and breast cancer cells lines using PBMC. The ADCC activity of anti-Her2\/neu antibody was tested in a europium based assay. The ovarian cell line, IGROV-1, and the breast cancer cell line, SKBR-3, were used as labeled targets in a 4 hour assay with human PBL as effector cells.  indicate that ch4D5 is functionally active in mediating lysis of targets expressing Her2\/neu. The effect of an antibody of the invention on the ADCC activity of the anti-Her2\/neu antibody is subsequently measured.","A chimeric anti-CD32B antibody (ch2B6) and its aglycosylated form (ch2B6Agly) were tested for the ability to mediate in vitro antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CD32B-expressing, B-cell lymphoma lines, Daudi and Raji. A humanized anti-CD32B antibody (h2B6) and its aglycosylated form (hu2B6YA) were also tested in Daudi cells.","The protocol for assessment of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is similar to that previously described in (Ding et al. (1998) \u201c-2,\u201d Immunity 8:403-411) and described herein. Briefly, target cells from the CD32B expressing B-cell lymphoma lines, Daudi and Raji, were labeled with the europium chelate bis(acetoxymethyl) 2,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine-6,6\u2033-dicarboxylate (DELFIA BATDA Reagent, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac) or Indium-111. The labeled target cells were then opsonized (coated) with either chimeric anti-CD32B (ch2B6) or aglycosylated chimeric anti-CD32B (ch2B6Agly) antibodies at the indicated concentrations as shown in  or with ch2B6, ch2B6Agly, hu2B6 and hu2b6YA as shown in . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), isolated by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia) gradient centrifugation, were used as effector cells (Effector to Target ratio of 75 to 1). Following a 3.5 hour incubation at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO2, cell supernatants were harvested and added to an acidic europium solution (DELFIA Europium Solution, Perkin Elmer\/Wallace). The fluorescence of the Europium-TDA chelates formed was quantitated in a time-resolved fluorometer (Victor2 1420, Perkin Elmer\/Wallac) or gamma counter (Wizard 1470, Wallace). Maximal release (MR) and spontaneous release (SR) were determined by incubation of target cells with 2% Triton X-100 and media alone, respectively. Antibody independent cellular cytotoxicity (AICC) was measured by incubation of target and effector cells in the absence of antibody. Each assay is performed in triplicate. The mean percentage specific lysis is calculated as: (ADCC-AICC)\/(MR-SR)\u00d7100.","As shown in , chimeric anti-CD32B antibody ch2B6 mediates ADCC in vitro against CD32B-expressing, B-cell lymphoma lines, Daudi and Raji, at concentrations greater than approximately 10 ng\/ml. This activity is likely to be Fc-dependent since the aglycoslyated version of this antibody, ch2B6Agly, which is unable to interact with the Fc-receptors has reduced activity in this assay. As shown in , the human aglycosylated form is able to interact with the Fc-receptors.","Six to eight week old female Balb\/c nude mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me.; Taconic) is utilized for establishing the xenograft ovarian and breast carcinoma models. Mice are maintained at BIOCON, Inc. Rockville, Md. (see attached protocol). Mice are housed in Biosafety Level-2 facilities for the xenograft model using the ascites-derived ovarian cells and pleural effusion-derived breast cancer cells as sources of tumors. Mice are placed in groups of 4 for these experiments and monitored three times weekly. The weight of the mice and survival time are recorded and criteria for growing tumors is abdominal distention and palpable tumors. Mice showing signs of visible discomfort or that reach 5 grams in tumor weight are euthanized with carbon dioxide and autopsied. The antibody-treated animals are placed under observation for an additional two months after the control group.","Establishment of the xenograft tumor model with tumor cell lines. In order to establish the xenograft tumor model, 5\u00d710viable IGROV-1 or SKBR-3 cells are injected s.c into three age- and weight-matched female nude athymic mice with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). The estimated weight of the tumor is calculated by the formula: length\u00d7(width)\/2 not to exceed 3 grams. For in vivo passaging of cells for expansion, anchorage-dependent tumor is isolated and the cells dissociated by adding 1 \u03bcg of collagenase (Sigma) per gram of tumor at 37\u00b0 C. overnight.","Injection of IGROV-1 cells subcutaneously gives rise to fast growing tumors while the intraperitoneal route induces a peritoneal carcinomatosis which kills the mice in 2 months. Since the IGROV-1 cells form tumors within 5 weeks, at day 1 after tumor cell injection, monocytes as effectors are co-injected i.p. along with therapeutic antibodies ch4D5 and ch2B6 at 4 \u03bcg each per gm of mouse body weight (mbw) (Table 8). The initial injection is followed by weekly injections of antibodies for 4-6 weeks thereafter. Human effectors cells are replenished once in two weeks.

In order to translate these studies into the clinic, the xenograft model are evaluated with ascites- and pleural effusion-derived tumor cells from two ovarian and two breast carcinoma patients, respectively. Pleural effusion, as a source of breast cancer cells, and implantation of malignant breast tissue have been used to establish xenograft murine models successfully, see, e.g., Sakakibara et al.

FACS analysis is used to determine the percentage of Her2\/neu+ neoplastic cells in the clinical samples. Samples with high percentage of Her2\/neu+ neoplastic cells are selected for initiation of tumors in Balb\/c mice.","Histochemistry and Immunochemistry. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry is performed on ascites and pleural effusion of patients with ovarian carcinoma to analyze structural characteristics of the neoplasia. The markers that are monitored are cytokeratin (to identify ovarian neoplastic and mesothelial cells from inflammatory and mesenchymal cells); calretinin (to separate mesothelial from Her2\/neu positive neoplastic cells); and CD45 (to separate inflammatory cells from the rest of the cell population in the samples). Additional markers that will be followed will include CD3 (T cells), CD20 (B cells), CD56 (NK cells), and CD14 (monocytes).","For immunohistochemistry staining, frozen sections and paraffinized tissues are prepared by standard techniques. The frozen as well as the de-paraffinized sections are stained in a similar staining protocol. The endogenous peroxidase of the tissues is quenched by immersing the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide and washed with PBS for 5 minutes. Sections are blocked and the primary antibody ch4D5 is added in blocking serum for 30 minutes followed by washing the samples with PBS three times. The secondary anti-human antibody conjugated with biotin is added for 30 minutes and the slides are washed in PBS for 5 minutes. Avidin-Biotin peroxidase complex (Vector Labs) is added for 30 minutes followed by washing. The color is developed by incubating the slides in fresh substrate DAB solution and the reaction is stopped by washing in tap water. For H& E staining, the slides are deparaffinized and then hydrated in different alcohol concentrations. The slides are washed in tap water and placed in hematoxylin for 5 minutes. Excess stain is removed with acid-alcohol, followed by ammonia, and water. The slides are placed in Eosin and followed by 90 to 100% alcohol washes for dehydration. Finally, the slides are placed in xylene and mounted with fixative for long-term storage. In all cases, the percentage of tumor cells is determined by Papanicolaou stain.","Histochemical Staining.

As shown in , Daudi cells form subcutaneous tumors in Balb\/c nude females starting around day 21 post tumor cell injection. At day 35, subcutaneous tumors were detected in mice receiving PBS (5 mice out of 5) or 10 \u03bcg\/g ch4.4.20 (5 mice out of 5). Tumors were rarely detected in mice receiving 10 \u03bcg\/g RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) (1 mouse out of 5) and were not detected in mice receiving 10 \u03bcg\/g ch2B6 (0 mice out of 5).","Experimental design. Eight week old Balb\/c FoxN1 female mice (Taconic, Germantown, N.Y.) were injected subcutaneously at day 0 with 5\u00d7106 Daudi cells as well as intra-peritoneally with 2B6 antibody variants (ch2B6, chN297Q, h2B6, h2B6YA, h2B6YA 31\/60, h2B6YA 38\/60, h2B6YA 55\/60, or h2B6 YA 71 at 2.5 \u03bcg, 7.5 \u03bcg, or 25 \u03bcg), Rituximab (positive control at 2.5 \u03bcg, 7.5 \u03bcg, 25 \u03bcg, or 250 \u03bcg) or PBS (negative control). Mice were then treated with antibodies or PBS once a week until day 42 (total of 7 injections) and tumor size was measured twice a week using a caliper. Tumor weight was estimated using the formula: (width\u00d7length)\/2.","RESULTS. To evaluate the efficacy of anti-CD32B mAb variants in the prevention of tumor cell growth in vivo, Balb\/c FoxN1 mice were simultaneously injected with Daudi cells and anti-CD32B mAb variants (). Treatment with the positive control, Rituximab, significantly reduced tumor cell growth in a dose dependent fashion (). Three different variants of anti-CD32B mAb 2B6 (chimeric 2B6 (ch2B6), humanized 2B6 (h2B6), and a variant in the Fv region (h2B6YA)) were all effective at slowing tumor growth (). The h2B6YA variant showed a remarkable reduction in tumor growth at a dose of 2.5 \u03bcg (0.1 \u03bcg\/gm). The same dose of Rituximab was not as effective at preventing tumor growth. Four different h2B6YA mAb variants with Fc mutations (h2B6YA 31\/60, h2B6YA 38\/60, h2B6YA 55\/60, and h2B6YA 71) were analyzed to determine if anti-tumor activity in vivo could be improved. Mutants h2B6YA 31\/60, h2B6YA 38\/60, and h2B6YA 55\/60 functioned as well or better than h2B6YA, which contained a wild type Fc (, D, E, and F). Mutant h2B6YA 71 showed dose independent activity (). Tumor cell growth was slowed at doses of 2.5 \u03bcg and 25 \u03bcg; however, little or no effect on tumor growth was noted at the 7.5 \u03bcg dose ().","These results demonstrate that h2B6YA 31\/60 and h2B6YA 55\/60 have improved in vivo anti-tumor activity compared to ch2B6 or h2B6YA.","Experimental design. Daudi tumors were collected from mice treated with h2B6 or h2B6YA at 25 \u03bcg. CD20 and CD32B expression was compared with those of Daudi cell expanded in vitro. FACS analysis was performed as described herein.","RESULTS. As shown in , cells expanded in vivo maintain CD20 and CD32B expression even after anti-CD32B treatment.","The ability of CD32B-specific antibodies to react with CD32B on cells isolated from patients with B-CLL was tested by staining isolated cells in FACS analysis.","Protocol for isolating B-cells from patients. Mononuclear leukocytes from peripheral blood leukocytes from normal donors and B-cell neoplasia patients were isolated by using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amesrham Pharmacia Biotech) gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. An aliquot of freshly isolated PBMCs from each patient was washed in PBS containing 10% human serum and analyzed immediately for CD32B expression by standard FACS analysis. Single-cell suspension from lymph node biopsy specimens will be prepared in similar manner, will be immediately analyzed, and will be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen.","Two cytospin slides were obtained from each samples and one stained immediately with May-Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) for morphological evaluation. Prior to analysis, an aliquot of patient's cells was thawed, the viability evaluated upon thawing and, if necessary (viability upon recovery <80%), subjected to Ficoll-Paque PLUS centrifugation. The amount of tumor cells was estimated by clonality by using anti-kappa or lambda chain antibodies in FACS analysis. Leukocyte phenotyping was performed by using directed conjugated anti-CD3, CD20, CD56, CD14, and CD16 antibodies and proper FSC and SCC gating. B-CLL B-cells were further analyzed for CD5, CD23, CD25, CD27, CD38, CD69, and CD71 (Damle et al. (2002) \u201c--,\u201d Blood 99:4087-4093; Chiorazzi et al. (2003) \u201c,\u201d Ann. Rev. Immunol. 21:841-894). Computerized logs were maintained recording the number of vials, number of cells per vial, and cell viability before and after cryopreservation, number of tumor cells or leukocyte phenotype.","Protocol for FACS analysis. Cells were incubated with the anti-CD32B monoclonal antibody, 2B6, followed by a secondary (Cy5 conjugated) goat-anti mouse (Fab)2 fragment antibody. After washes, FITC or PE-conjugated lineage-specific antibodies (anti-CD3, CD19, CD 20 and CD5) were added and the samples were analyzed by using FACSCalibur in a two-color format. CD3-positive cells (T cells) are used as an internal control as they do not express CD32B and do not react with 2B6 antibody. CD20, CD19 and CD5 antibodies identify B cell lineage sub-populations. Preliminary studies were conducted in >10 healthy human subjects to calibrate the amount of individual anti-CD32B antibodies based on the reactivity with the donor's B cells identified by CD20-positivity. For each antibody, the smallest amount of antibody that gave 100% reactivity and the highest MCF value in titration experiments was selected for subsequent use.","RESULTS. As shown in , B cells isolated from B-CLL patients stained intensely with anti-CD32B antibodies. Cells from all five patients are consistently CD32B-positive being reactive with 2B6 antibody, but express B cell-lineage markers only to various degrees. The results indicate that CD32B is expressed on B-cells isolated from patients with B-CLL.","To investigate expression of CD32B in lymph nodes from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, histological analysis and immunohistochemistry was performed on a series of lymphatic tissues from patients with a confirmed diagnosis of B cell neoplasia based on histological and FACS analysis criteria.","Tissue specimens. Frozen lymph nodes were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN), Mid-Atlantic Division (Charlottesville, Va.). The tissue was received in dry ice, and upon arrival sectioned in two portions, one for histopathological analysis of the tumor and the other portion for Immunohistochemistry analysis.","Histopathological analysis and Immunohistochemistry. All eleven cases were fixed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) and paraffinized in a tissue processor (Miles Scientific). After paraffinization, tissue blocks were sectioned with a Leica Microtome (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, Ill.) at 5 microns. The sections were placed in slides, deparaffinized with xylene and proceeded with an Hematoxylin and Eosin (H-E) tissue staining protocol (Luna, Histopathologic methods and Color Atlas Of Special Stains and Tissue Artifacts, (1992) American Histolabs, Inc., Publications Division, Kolb Center, 7605-F Airpark Road, Gaithersburg, Md. 2087). Daudi B cells, a malignant cell line involved in B cell lymphomas, were used as positive controls. Normal tonsil and lymph nodes were used as additional controls to understand the distribution of the cells expressing CD20 and CD32B in normal tissues.","The remaining portions of these samples were placed in cryomolds and embedded in OCT cryocompound (Tissue-Tek). Once the blocks were ready, each was sectioned under a Cryostat (Leica Microsystems) at 6 microns. The slides were placed in 4\u00b0 C. acetone and fixed for 10 minutes. Hours after fixation the slides were air dried and washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Then endogenous peroxide activity was blocked by 30 minute incubation in a 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution. The slides were washed in PBS and incubated for 30 minutes with 10% normal goat serum in 2% normal human serum. After this step, the slides were divided in two groups. Two monoclonal antibodies were utilized and incubated on the same tissue in parallel, an anti-CD20 (1F5, ATCC NO. HB-9645, purified at Macrogenics) and the murine monoclonal anti-CD32B antibody, 2B6. Each group was incubated with one monoclonal antibody and their respective Isotype control, IgG1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) for the 2B6\/anti-CD32B group and IgG2a (BD Biosciences) for the 1F5\/anti-CD20 group. Mouse IgG1 and murine IgG2a were used as Isotype controls for anti-CD32B and anti-CD20, respectively. After one hour of incubation at room temperature, the slides were washed in PBS and incubated with a secondary antibody Goat anti Mouse labeled peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.). After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated in amino-9-ethylcarbazol (AEC) and hydrogen peroxide (Koretz et al. (1987) \u201c3--9-() ,\u201d Histochemistry 86:471-478). Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain.","The expression of anti CD20 and CD32B was scored under a light microscope at low power magnification based on the following criteria: a score of zero (\u2212) meant no detectable reactivity; a score of plus\/minus (+\/\u2212) meant detectable reaction in 1-10% of the cells; one plus (+) was equivalent to 10-30% positive cells; two pluses (++) for tissue with positive cells ranging from 30-70%; and three pluses (+++) for those tissues where 70% to 100% were positive.","RESULTS. Both positive controls, i.e., a malignant cell line involved in B cell lymphomas (Daudi cells; ) and normal tissues known to contain lymphatic tissue (tonsil: ; lymph nodes: ), responded positively to anti-Cd32B and anti-CD20 antibodies by immunohistochemistry. Normal tonsil tissues and lymph nodes stain differently with anti-CD32B antibodies and anti-CD20 antibodies. Lymphatic follicles showing germinal centers react with anti-CD20, while the cells in the follicles surrounding germinal centers react with anti-CD32B. Thus, morphological differences can be detected by immunohistochemistry with these two antibodies.","A total of ten lymph nodes and one spleen (11 cases) obtained from CHTN were analyzed. See .

In the small lymphocytic lymphoma category, one had plasmacytoid features. All hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides were reviewed for confirmation of the diagnosis.","The expression of CD20 was negative in 18% of the cases and weakly positive in \u02dc30%, and intermediate\/strongly positive in the remaining 50% of the cases. CD32B was detected in 80% of the cases and was found to be negative in only two cases.","CD32B expression was detected on 80% of NHL test cases. Expression of CD32B was often detected in more cells than CD20 was detected. CD32B may be a useful target of treatment of NHL.","CD32B-specific antibodies will be screened for reactivity, raft association, CDC, and induction of apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma lines and cells from patients with B-cell malignancies. Isolation of cells from patients and reactivity screening is described above.","Raft association. A measure of the ability of the antibody to trigger redistribution of the antigen into specialized membrane microdomains, lipid raft association is conveniently performed by measuring the amount of antibody recovered into the detergent-insoluble cellular fraction after lysis with 0.5% TX-100 at 4\u00b0 C. (Veri et al. (2001) \u201c--1 ,\u201d Mol. Cell Bio. 21:6939-6950; Cragg et al. (2004) \u201c-20 ,\u201d Blood 103:2738-2743). In a typical experiment, cells will be coated on ice with the antibody of interest and washed. An aliquot will be subjected to additional cross-linking with an appropriate secondary antibody. Pelleted cells will be subjected to TX-100 detergent fractionation. Parallel samples will be solubilized with glucopyranoside, a detergent known to destroy lipid rafts, or directly with SDS-based Laemmli sample buffer to obtain the total amount of cell-associated antibody. The insoluble fractions will be analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Redistribution to lipid rafts with or without additional cross-linking will be recorded by densitometric comparisons.","CDC. CDC will be assessed by one of several methods known in the art, such as propidium iodide (PI) exclusion in FACS analysis (Cragg et al. (2004) \u201c-20 ,\u201d Blood 103:2738-2743) or traditional radiolabel release (e.g., Cr and In release). In brief, cells will be incubated with titrating amounts of the antibodies of interest for 15 min at 37\u00b0 C. followed by the addition of serum (20% final concentration) as a source of complement and the incubation continued for additional 5 min prior to analysis. Owing to the high variation of human serum, Pel-Freeze rabbit serum will be used as a standard source of complement. Pooled normal human AB serum will also be prepared. Each batch of serum will be tested in red blood cell lysis against rabbit serum for quality assurance.","Apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by soluble or plate immobilized anti-CD32B antibodies will be studied by standard FACS-based methodology by using annexin V membrane translocation and PI staining (Cragg et al. (2004) \u201c-20 ,\u201d Blood 103:2738-2743) in multi-color analysis to identify the population of interest (e.g. Cy5-CD19). Briefly, cells will be treated for different intervals of time (2 to 18 hours) with titrating amounts of the antibody of interest in free solution or immobilized on 96-well plates. Cells will then be recovered by gentle scraping and\/or centrifugation and stained with 1 ug\/ml of FITC-annexin V plus 10 ug\/ml of PI to distinguish between early apoptosis and secondary necrosis.","The ability to prevent tumors in a mouse model of lymphoma is an important criterion to determine the potential for an antibody to proceed into clinical studies.","A number of well characterized Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines are available for use as models of NHL (Epstein et al. (1966) \u201c(),\u201d J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 37:547-559; Klein et al. (1968) \u201c-,\u201d Cancer Res. 28:1300-1310; Klein et al. (1975) \u201c---,\u201d Intervirology 5:319-334; Nilsson et al.

A xenograft model of lymphoma formation has been established in nude mice similar to previously reported models (Vallera et al. (2003) \u201c-90--45 ,\u201d Cancer Biother. Radiopharm. 18:133-145; Vuist et al. (1989) \u201c2 -(-19) ,\u201d Cancer Res. 49:3783-3788).","In brief, the Burkitt's lymophoma cell line, Daudi (5-10\u00d710cells), will be transplanted subcutaneously into an immunodeficient nu\/nu mouse strain. The BALB\/c nu\/nu mouse strain will be used together with adoptively transferred human PBMC purified from a healthy donor as effector cells. A prevailing effector cell population in human PBMC is represented by NK cells, which exert ADCC via their CD16A (Fc\u03b3RIIIa). A nu\/nu mouse strain in which the murine CD16A gene has been knocked out and which has been genetically engineered to express human CD16A will also be used. This CD16A\u2212\/\u2212 huCD16Atg, nu\/nu mouse allows for the examination of anti-tumor activity in the context of a human Fc receptor without the need for the adoptive transfer of human cells.","Mice will be treated with the selected chimerized antibody injected i.p. on day 1, 4, 7, and 15. A starting dose of 4 ug\/g of body weight will be used, but additional doses will be tested to establish the relative potency of the antibodies in this model. RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) and CAMPATH\u00ae (alemtuzumab) will be used for comparison. Furthermore, potential synergism of combination therapy with RITUXAN\u00ae (rituximab) or CAMPATH\u00ae (alemtuzumab) will also be studied. In these studies, tumor growth and morbidity will be monitored to compare antibody treated and control groups. Mice will be sacrificed immediately if moribund or at the completion of the studies. The tumors will then be excised and gross and microscopic necropsy performed. Cytopathology on paraffin-embedded sections and immunohistochemistry on frozen sections will be performed for a morphological and immunological evaluation of the tumor and cellular infiltrates.","The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described which are intended as single illustrations of individual aspects of the invention, and functionally equivalent methods and components are within the scope of the invention.
