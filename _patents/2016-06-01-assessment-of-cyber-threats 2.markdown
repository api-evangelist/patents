{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to assessing cyber threats and the risks they pose to organizations.","Computer-based threats to organizations have increased significantly in recent years. Organizations frequently are unable to determine the potential damage caused by cyber threats or the manner in which different attacks will evolve over time. While organizations may deploy some systems or procedures in attempt to mitigate computer-based threats, it is often difficult to determine the extent that mitigation measures may be effective in actually protecting an organization from intrusion and loss.","In some implementations, a system for assessing cyber threats can take into account the progression of computer-based threats over time. The system can be used to determine, for a particular organization and its unique assets and network topology, measures of effects of various cyber threats. The system can further take into account threat mitigation measures employed by the organization and the likely effectiveness of these mitigation measures.","Implementations may include methods, systems, and media for specifying (1) an organization's computing infrastructure topology, at the level of individual deployed hardware, operating system, and application software units, or and\/or aggregations thereof (each node of the topology may be called an access node); (2) a set of multi-stage cyber threats to which the organization is subject, including description of modes of operation, specific vulnerabilities used, and rates of incidence (each such threat instance may be called a threat thread comprising threat stages); (3) a set of hardware, software, personnel-based, physical, or organizational security mitigations deployed to partially or fully counteract the threats, including the specification of rates of effectiveness against particular threat types or exploits (each instance of such may be called a mitigation node); (4) the location and value of organizational assets, including electronic documents containing intellectual property, personally identifying information, or other computer-stored assets of determinate value (each such location may be termed an access node); and (5) the expression of the interrelatedness of these elements as a set of Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) encoding the possible forms of the time-evolution of the threats throughout the organization. Some or all of the information may be expressed in, for example, Java Simple Object Notation (JSON).","One or more embodiments may include methods, systems, and media for establishing, from the instances of the specifications of an organization's computing infrastructure topology, a set of multi-stage cyber threats, a set of hardware, software, personnel-based, physical, or organizational security mitigations, the location and value of organizational assets, and the expression of the interrelatedness of these elements as a set of DBNs, a confidence interval on the total losses of organizational assets due to the threats, over a fixed time window, via repeated Monte Carlo sampling of the DBNs.","In one general aspect, a method performed by one or more computers includes: receiving data indicating a time window; accessing, by the one or more computers, data indicating at least one dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) that specifies relationships among (i) infrastructure nodes representing the computing infrastructure of an organization, (ii) asset nodes indicating characteristics of the assets of the organization, (iii) threat nodes representing the computer-based threats, and (iv) mitigation nodes representing threat mitigation measures of the organization; performing a plurality of simulations using the DBN, each simulation involving propagating data through the DBN for various time steps within the time window; sampling outcomes of the plurality of simulations according to the state of the DBN representing the end of the time window; based on the sampled outcomes of the simulations, determining a measure of impact of the computer-based threats to the organization over the time window; and providing, for output to a user, the determined measure of impact of the computer-based threats to the organization over the time window.","In some implementations, determining the measure of impact of the computer-based threats comprises determining a confidence interval for losses of the organization due to the computer-based threats.","In some implementations, each asset node has an amount of value assigned. Performing the plurality of simulations comprises, for each of the plurality of the simulations, determining based on parameters assigned to the threat nodes and the mitigation nodes, whether a computer-based threat is successful in accessing the asset nodes. Sampling outcomes of the plurality of simulations comprises, for each simulation, determining a combined amount of value for the asset nodes that were determined to be accessed by the computer-based threats during the simulation.","In some implementations, performing the plurality of simulations and sampling the outcomes comprise performing Monte Carlo simulations and sampling of the DBN.","In some implementations, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to determine a distribution of a total value that may be lost to the threats represented by the threat nodes, over the time window.","In some implementations, the method includes: determining a threshold value indicating a minimum level of accuracy; and determining a number of simulations needed to reach the minimum level of accuracy indicated by the threshold value. Performing the plurality of simulations comprises performing at least the determined number of simulations.","In some implementations, a particular cyber threat is represented in the DBN as a set of multiple threat nodes, each of the multiple threat nodes representing characteristics of a different stage.","In some implementations, the DBN represents a conditional probability distribution of each random variables is time-dependent for a discrete time index, and values determined for at least some of the nodes are conditioned on (i) the values of the node's parents at a current time index, and (ii) values determined for the node for one or more prior time indexes.","In one general aspect, a method performed by one or more computers includes: receiving, by the one or more computers, data indicating computing infrastructure of an organization and assets of the organization; receiving, by the one or more computers, data indicating computer-based threats to the organization and threat mitigation measures of the organization; generating, by the one or more computers, at least one dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) comprising (i) infrastructure nodes representing the computing infrastructure of the organization, (ii) asset nodes indicating characteristics of the assets of the organization, (iii) threat nodes representing the computer-based threats, and (iv) mitigation nodes representing the threat mitigation measures of the organization, the DBN indicating relationships among the nodes; and providing, by the one or more computers, an interface configured to provide data, generated using the DBN, that indicates effects of computer-based threats on the organization.","In some implementations, receiving the data indicating the computing infrastructure, the assets, the computer-based threats, or the threat mitigation measures comprises receiving the data from one or more client devices over a network.","In some implementations, the infrastructure nodes indicate (i) a network topology for the organization and (ii) individual deployed hardware, operating system, and application software units of the organization.","In some implementations, the infrastructure nodes indicate aggregations of networked computing devices of the organization.","In some implementations, the threat nodes indicate set of multi-stage computer-based threats, wherein for at least one of the multi-stage threats, the data indicates a mode of operation of the threat, a specific vulnerability exploited by the threat, and a rate of incidence of the threat.","In some implementations, each of the multi-stage computer-based threats is represented in the DBN by multiple threat nodes, each of the multiple threat nodes indicating characteristics of a different stage of the computer-based threat corresponding to a different time as an attack progresses.","In some implementations, the threat nodes represent multiple computer-based threats from the group consisting of a virus, malware, a network intrusion, data theft, and a denial of service attack.","In some implementations, the mitigation nodes indicate hardware, software, personnel-based, physical, or organizational security mitigations that are deployed, the mitigation nodes specifying one or more rates of effectiveness against particular types of computer-based threats.","In some implementations, the mitigation nodes represent multiple mitigations from the set consisting of an antivirus system, a network intrusion detection system, a firewall, a software patching process, a training program, a training program, a permission restriction scheme, a content-filtering process, an event logging process, a physical restriction, and an application whitelist.","In some implementations, the asset nodes indicate location and value of data assets of the organization, wherein the data assets comprises at least electronic documents and personally identifying information.","In some implementations, the method includes accessing data describing attack trees for different computer-based attacks, each attack tree including a graph describing interactions of a computer-based attack with one or more computers, each graph comprising multiple attack tree nodes that each represent a different stage of the computer-based attack; and wherein generating the DBN comprises generating the DBN based on the attack trees.","In some implementations, each stage of the computer-based attack may be characterized by one of several possible states, wherein one or more of the attack tree nodes is assigned a probability distribution that indicates a likelihood of the node's states conditioned on the states of the node's parents.","In some implementations, generating the DBN comprises generating the DBN to include a particular threat node representing a stage of a particular computer-based attack, the particular threat node having a conditional probability that is time-dependent for a discrete time index and is conditioned on (i) current states of parent nodes for the particular threat node, and (ii) a previous state of the particular threat node.","The details of one or more embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["80","80","81","82","83","84"]},"The system  includes an assessment system  that can include one or more computers. The assessment system  may be part of the network infrastructure of an organization, but in many implementations is operated by a third party. As discussed further below, the assessment system  receives information about the network infrastructure for an organization to model the risks and potential effects of computer-based attacks. This information can include the number and types of devices present, the manner in which they are connected, and so on. It can also indicate threat mitigations employed, e.g., network intrusion detection systems, firewalls, access restriction settings, and so on. Additionally, the assessment system  can receive information about the assets of the organization, including intellectual property stored on the storage devices . The assessment system  uses this information, which can be input directly or received over the network , to generate models of the particular risks that the organization faces due to various cyber threats.","The assessment system  can determine separate models for each of multiple organizations, with each organization's models being tailored for the organization's particular network infrastructure, threat mitigations, assets, and threats to which the organization is exposed. To generate and use these models, the assessment system  can include a variety of modules, which can be implemented using one or more computers. For example, the system  can include an input parser  to parse input about an organization, a network constructor  to build a network model, a sampler  to acquire data representing different scenarios that may affect the organization, and a calculator module  to generate outputs based on the acquired data. These modules and other aspects of the system are discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},"Methods, systems, and\/or media may provide a framework for assessing organizational value at risk due to current and emerging cyber threats. CyberV@R is an example of one such framework. The framework for assessing organizational value at risk due to current and emerging cyber threats may include methods for","(A) specifying, in Java Simple Object Notation (JSON):","(1) an organizational computer network topology,","(2) a set of cyber (that is, computer-based) threats to which the network is or may be subject,","(3) a set of organizational assets deployed on the network and hence exposed to the threats, and","(4) a set of security mitigations in force on the network, which may in whole or part mitigate the threats, and","(B) for constructing, from the foregoing specification, a set of Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), via which:","(5) Monte Carlo simulations may be conducted to assess the distribution of the total value of assets that may be lost to the threats, over a specified period of time, and from which","(6) a confidence interval for losses (alternatively termed \u201ccyber value at risk\u201d or \u201ccybervar\u201d) is ascertained, thus placing an overall value on the threats.","A Bayesian network is a technique for encoding as a graph the interdependency of a set of random variables to obtain a joint probability distribution for an event contained in the joint event space of the variables. Such networks may be constructed from Attack Trees, which are graphs describing the manner in which a cyber threat may interact with an organization's computing topology. Each node of the Attack Tree represents a particular stage of the attack, which may be characterized by one of several possible states (e.g. \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d). In exemplary embodiments, a probability distribution giving the likelihood of the node's states may be assigned to each Attack Tree node, such that the distribution is conditioned on the states of the node's parents.","A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) may be thought of as Bayesian network in which the conditional probability distribution of each random variables is time-dependent (for a discrete time index), and may therefore be conditioned not only on the values of variable's parents, at the current time, but also on the values of the variable itself, at prior times. Hence DBNs may be used to describe Attack Trees that evolve probabilistically through time. DBNs may be represented as one or more data structures. For example, DBNs may be naturally represented in a computer using an Object-Oriented programming language such as Python.","A DBN may define a framework for Monte Carlo simulations. Starting at an initial time, one samples each variable in the network, from top-level parents (roots) to bottom-level children (leaves). Based on the sampled values, the network is evolved one step forward in time, and the process is repeated again, up until a desired stopping time T. The values of each variable at time T represent the final state of the DBN, and this constitutes the outcome of one simulation. If each variable is real-valued, then one may conduct repeated simulations and average the outcomes to obtain an \u201cexpected outcome\u201d for the network (or alternatively perform other, related statistical operations).","Java Simple Object Notation (JSON) is a semi-formal technique for describing the structure of various data elements, the relationships among the elements, and specific sets of instances of the elements and relations. JSON-based notation schemes have been developed, with which one may specify the structure of a JSON document (e.g., specify the document schema).","For example, an organization believes it is subject to an average of r attempts per day to access its computer network without authorization (this is termed the \u201cbackground intrusion attempt rate\u201d). Access to the network may be protected by an authentication scheme, e.g. an 802.xl-based network authentication scheme. The organization recognizes that the scheme, while normally successful at blocking such attempts, may fail with a small, estimated probability pI, due (for example) to compromised account credentials. Product designs deemed to have a value of V are stored on the network. The organization wishes to know the odds of losing more than 95% of the value of the assets, at any time over the next T days, to successful unauthorized access. This value might be used as a gauge of the adequacy of the organization's insurance against such events. Over T, the organization estimates that each day, the background intrusion rate will increase by an amount dr. The organization further estimates that any day on which one or more access attempts succeed, at most dV worth of assets is lost (this quantity may reflect, for example, the dispersion of the designs throughout the network).","The organization may use the methods described below to encode the foregoing information, e.g. as a JSON text file. However, the information may be encoded as any data structure and may be transferred in or as any type of file, as well as through other means of transmission, such as via Remote Procedure Call, sharing of objects, network connections, etc.  depicts an exemplary structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network that may be constructed for a given input in accordance with one or more embodiments. The file is passed as input to a computer program implementing the framework. The program organizes the data into a DBN, e.g. by using the techniques discussed herein. It then proceeds to execute repeated simulation trials, up to a configured number reflecting the desired degree of computational accuracy. Each trial may be conducted in the following manner. For each day t in T, for each node of the DBN, from roots to leaves, a sample is drawn according to the probability distribution associated to the node. For the intrusion node, the sample represents the particular number n of access attempts that occur on day t, given the daily attempt rate r+t dr. Then a sample is drawn from the network node distribution p2. The sample takes value 1 if the network is accessed, and 0 otherwise; the odds of drawing 1 are dependent on n and p1. If the value 1 is drawn, then dV*V(t) is lost on day t, and the remaining value V(t+1) is set to V(t)\u2212dV*V(t). Let the (not necessarily consecutive) days on which losses occur be labeled t_1, t_2, . . . , t_L, respectively. Then for this trial, a total of L=dV*(V_t1)+dV*V(t_2)+ . . . +dV*V(t_L) is lost.","Although examples are provided in which the trials are conducted using days as a time frame, the trials may be conducted at any interval (e.g. seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, months, etc.) and over any interval.","For example, suppose 100 such trials are conducted, resulting in loss amounts L_0 through L_99, where the values are sorted from lowest (least loss) to highest (greatest loss). Then the value L_95 gives an estimate of the \u201c5% cybervar amount\u201d, which is the amount such that the estimated odds of losing more than L_95 over T fall below 5%.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","01","200","300","400","100","200","300","400","100","200","300","400"]},"1.

an Attack Tree may comprise a tree name, threat thread, and type, together with list of the threat thread stages, mitigations, access nodes, and asset nodes that are applicable for the tree, and an edge set specification describing the relationships of the threat stage, mitigation, and\/or access nodes to threat stage nodes and\/or asset nodes (and connectivity types, for edges between access nodes). If different stages of a threat apply to the same element of an IT infrastructure, then the element may be represented by as many access nodes as there are stage nodes, with each access node carrying a distinct UUID (but the same name, if so desired). The graph must be directed and acyclic; the stages of a threat must form a path through the graph from the root to a leaf, and the ordering of the nodes within the path must be compatible with the ordering in the threat thread specification.","1.3 Threat Thread.","A Threat Thread may have the following

instance name (UUID across all threat instances), an associated intent type name, and a set of one or more threat stages. Each threat stage may comprise a stage type name, an instance name (UUID across all node types), an optional A value defining an initial Poisson distribution associated to the stage instance (or alternatively a prior stage-dependent or fixed number), and an optional linear growth rate constant c (when a \/... value has been selected). The stage may also specify that it is skip-able and\/or repeatable; these are an aid in automation of attack tree construction. Each stage also specifies one or more mechanisms of action, which in turn may specify a list of connectivity types. Each mechanism of action may specify a list of access nodes types (with subtype qualifiers) for which the stage is applicable (this type and qualifier information serves to define the \u201cattack surface\u201d types recognized by the threat). One or more arrays of strings may be specified. For the threat stage node to apply to an access node, it must have one array of qualifiers such that all qualifiers in the array are associated with the access node. Qualifier strings are intended to represent operating system types (e.g., \u201cWindows7\u201d or \u201cRedHat5\u201d), application types (e.g. \u201cAdobe\u201d or \u201cMS Word\u201d), or specific vulnerabilities (e.g. \u201cCVE-123\u201d). Each mechanism may also specify a list of mitigation types (with subtype qualifiers) that the mechanism is assumed to defeat. Finally, the threat thread may specify a default (\/..., c) pair for use in all stages where stage-specific values are not provided.","1.4 Mitigation Node.","A Mitigation Node may have the following

Although exemplary embodiments may be described as being implemented in Python, various programming languages may be employed to implement the one or more software modules and\/or to otherwise implement the methodologies described herein. These languages may include, but are not limited to, Java, C++, C, C#, etc. The Input Parser may be embodied as a program, e.g. an executable program invoked from the command line of a computer system or a program invoked via a graphical or web-based interface. In one or more embodiments, the edge set information for Threat Stage and Access Stage nodes may be omitted from the User Input File , in which case the Input Parser may construct a maximal set of Attack Trees (DAGs) containing all legal edges between Threat Stage and Access Nodes, as constrained by the qualifier information provided in the User Input File.","The DBN Network Constructor  may associate to each vertex a table-oriented data structure, representing a discrete, conditional probability distribution (e.g. with one column per possible value of the vertex, and one row for each possible combination of parent values).
