title: Enabling third-party E-store with carrier billing for a mobile device
abstract: Techniques and equipment are described for enabling an application developer to provide mobile device users, using the developer's application, an option to purchase digital content items within the application and have the cost of the purchased content billed directly to their respective mobile communications service accounts. The mobile service account for a user or user's mobile device is maintained by a wireless carrier or operator of the mobile communication network to which the user subscribes for mobile communication services. The charges and other transaction details related to the content purchased by a mobile device user via the mobile application on the user's device appear in a billing or account statement periodically provided to the user by the carrier or operator of the mobile communication network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The advancement of mobile communication devices and networks in recent years has enabled application developers and content providers to distribute content directly to the mobile device of user via content-specific software applications executed on the device. The software applications may relate to virtually any user interest or need, such as education, entertainment, finance, health, instant messaging, social networking, maps, navigation, music, news, document generation, photography, shopping, sports, travel, utilities, and\/or the weather. For example, a user may select a particular application or content item for purchase and download of the item to the user's device through a virtual mobile applications store or other interface on the device. Such an interface may be provided by, for example, the wireless service provider or carrier of the mobile communication network associated with the device.","In addition to being able to offer users a content-specific application for a mobile device, an application developer or content provider is able to offer content for sale to users from within the delivery functionality of an application. The in-app purchasing capability allows developers to sell content within their apps. For example, digital content may be specific to a particular type of mobile communication application running on the mobile device and may include, for example and without limitation, electronic books (or \u201ce-books\u201d) in a mobile e-bookstore application, movie rentals in a mobile streaming video application, a level in a mobile video game application, and digital music or ring-tones in a music application. In this example, the digital content is purchased from execution of the application and is delivered to the mobile application from an associated application server through the mobile communication network.","Commercially available solutions exist for allowing mobile device users to make in-app purchases via a mobile application installed on the user's device and for enabling these purchases to be billed directly to the user's wireless service account managed by the carrier. However, such conventional solutions prove difficult for application developers\/content providers, particularly those of e-store applications having a multitude of different items for sale, to effectively maintain the delivery of up-to-date or current content to mobile device\/application users while also allowing the wireless network carrier to manage billing for the in-app purchases. In an example of an e-store application (e.g., an e-bookstore), the application developer and\/or content distributor generally provides to the carrier a catalog identifying the various items (e.g., e-books) that may be purchased on an individual basis by a user. Consequently, the application developer or content provider must continuously update this catalog each time a new item (or new edition of an e-book in the e-bookstore example) is added, and provide the updated catalog to the carrier in order to ensure the user is properly charged for any particular item purchased through the mobile application.","In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth by way of examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the relevant teachings. However, it should be noted that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and\/or circuitry have been described at a relatively high-level, without detail, in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.","The teachings disclosed herein enable application developers and content providers to sell content and services within their respective applications and still be able to charge the customers through their wireless or mobile service account.","In an exemplary method, pricing information for content items associated with an electronic store application of a third-party provider is stored at a billing system operated by a carrier of a mobile communication network. A user of a mobile device executing the electronic store application can browse and select one of the content items for purchase via a user interface provided by the electronic store application at the mobile device. The stored pricing information for the content items is sent to the mobile device via the mobile communication network in response to a request from a carrier applications client executing at the mobile device. The request is initiated by the electronic store application based on input from the user via the user interface, and communicated to the carrier applications client via an application programming interface at the mobile device. The carrier applications client is also configured to communicate the pricing information from the carrier billing system to the electronic store application via the application programming interface. A purchase request for a content item that is selected by the user from the content items presented by the electronic store application is processed based on the stored pricing information corresponding to the content item. The purchase request itself is generated by the electronic store application and communicated to the carrier applications client via the application programming interface at the mobile device. A license for the user-selected content item is also sent based on the processed purchase request. A billing account associated with the user in the carrier billing system is charged based on the processed purchase request for the selected content item.","Hence, the exemplary technologies enable a mobile communication application developer to provide mobile device users, using the developer's application, an option to purchase digital content or other items within the application and have the cost of the purchased content billed directly to their respective mobile service accounts (i.e., as opposed to being billed via a separate account associated with the application developer or third-party content-provider). The purchase of items within an application is commonly referred to as an \u201cin-application purchase\u201d or simply \u201cin-app purchase.\u201d For example, an application developer or digital content provider can create a software application for a mobile device, which includes a virtual electronic store (or \u201ce-store\u201d) embedded directly within the application. The mobile service account for a user or user's mobile device is generally maintained by a wireless carrier or operator of the mobile communication network to which the user subscribes for mobile communication services. In an example, the charges and other transaction details related to the content purchased by a mobile device user via the mobile application on the user's device (i.e., the in-app purchase) appear in a billing or account statement periodically provided to the user by the carrier or operator of the mobile communication network.","Reference now is made in detail to the examples illustrated in the accompanying drawings and discussed below.  illustrates an exemplary system  for mobile communications between a mobile device and various application or content servers through a mobile communication network. System  includes a mobile computing device and a mobile computing device that are communicatively coupled to an applications store server  and a content server  through a mobile communication network . Application store server  is also communicatively coupled, via mobile communication network , to a billing system  operated by a carrier of mobile communication network . In an example, as will be described in further detail below, applications store server  is configured to communicate with carrier billing system  in order to process purchase requests for in-app items selected by a user at mobile device or mobile device , via an electronic store application executing at the respective mobile device.","Mobile devices and are each coupled to mobile communication network  through a wireless network communications interface of the device. Such an interface may include, for example, a wireless network interface controller integrated with the device or implemented in an expansion card attached to the mobile computing device. Further, such an expansion card may be associated with a wireless or mobile communication service provider or carrier.","Mobile devices and can be any type of computing device having one or more processors, a user input (for example, a mouse, QWERTY keyboard, touch-screen, microphone, or a T9 keyboard), and a communications infrastructure capable of receiving and transmitting data over a wireless or mobile communication network of a carrier. For example, mobile device can include, but is not limited to, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer or other similar type of device capable of processing instructions and receiving and transmitting data to and from humans and other computing devices over mobile communication network . In an example, mobile device can include, but is not limited to, a laptop or similar type of mobile computer equipped with a wireless network interface controller, as described above, which is provided by the carrier or operator of mobile communication network .","Similarly, applications store server  and content server  each can be any type of computing device having at least one processor, a memory and a communications infrastructure for receiving and transmitting data communication over a mobile communication network. For example, servers  and  can include, but are not limited to, a computer, a cluster of computers, a set-top box, or other similar type of device capable of processing instructions and receiving and transmitting data to and from mobile devices and over mobile communication network . In an example, applications store server  is configured to allow a user of mobile device or to select a software application to be downloaded and installed to the device. The software application installed by the user to be executed at the device can be, for example, an e-store application, as described above, which includes various in-app items that may be purchased by the user via an interface provided in the application. In this example, content server  is configured to communicate over network  with the e-store application while it is executing on the user's device so as to enable the user to complete in-app item purchases with carrier billing via the application.","Further, applications store server  may be operated by the carrier or operator of mobile communication network  while content server  is operated by the developer or content provider associated with the e-store application itself. It should be appreciated that any operations performed by applications store server  may occur at a single server operated by the carrier or may be distributed by the carrier across multiple servers that are within the carrier's network. Similarly, the operations performed by content server  may occur at a single server of the application developer or content provider or may be distributed across multiple servers as may be necessary.","Mobile communication network  can be any network or combination of networks that can carry data communication, and may be referred to herein as a mobile communication or wireless network. Mobile communication network  can include multiple interconnected networks including, but not limited to, a wired (e.g., Ethernet) or a wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi or 3G) network. In addition, such interconnected networks can include, but are not limited to, a local area network, medium area network, and\/or wide area network such as the Internet. Network  can support protocols and technology including, but not limited to, Internet or World Wide Web protocols and communication services. Intermediate network routers, gateways, or servers may be provided between components of communication system  depending upon a particular application or environment.","The present techniques may be implemented in any of a variety of available mobile communication networks and\/or on any type of mobile device compatible with such a network. In an example, the network  can be used to provide mobile wireless communications services to mobile devices and as well as to other mobile devices or mobile stations (not shown), for example, via a number of base stations. In a further example, the wireless mobile communication network  might be implemented as a network conforming to the code division multiple access (CDMA) IS-95 standard, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) wireless IP network standard or the Evolution Data Optimized (EVDO) standard, the Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication standard, a time division multiple access (TDMA) standard or other standards used for public mobile wireless communications. The mobile devices and may are capable of voice telephone communications through the network , and for enabling direct carrier billing services for e-store applications, the exemplary devices and are capable of data communications through the particular type of network  (and the users thereof typically will have subscribed to data service through the network).","Physical elements of a RAN operated by one of the mobile service providers or carriers include a number of base stations (not shown). Such a base station can include a base transceiver system (BTS), which can communicate via an antennae system at the site of base station and over an air link with one or more of the mobile devices and , when the mobile devices are within certain connectivity range. Each base station can include a BTS coupled to several antennae mounted on a radio tower within a coverage area often referred to as a \u201ccell.\u201d The BTS is the part of the radio network that sends and receives RF signals to\/from the mobile devices and that are served by the base station.","The radio access networks of mobile communication network  can also include a traffic network, which carries the user communications and data for the mobile stations and between the aforementioned base stations and other elements with or through which the mobile stations communicate. The network  can also include other elements that support functionality other than device-to-device media transfer services such as messaging service messages and voice communications. Specific elements of the network  for carrying the voice and data traffic and for controlling various aspects of the calls or sessions through the network  are omitted here form simplicity. It will be understood that the various network elements can communicate with each other and other aspects of the mobile communications network  and other networks, including, for example and without limitation, a public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the Internet either directly or indirectly.","As will be described in further detail, such applications developers can utilize a specialized software development kit (SDK), provided by the carrier specifically for enabling in-app purchasing for users of mobile devices and with the option of carrier billing. The carrier provided SDK connects to the carrier's applications store server  via a shopping client application, also executed on the mobile devices and . The interaction of the e-store application with the carrier-provided SDK and mobile shopping client enables in-application purchase functionality with automatic carrier billing and associated payment. The carrier is able to collect the payments from the user for the enhanced functionality or additional content purchased when the payments for regular mobile voice and data communications charges (e.g., monthly service charges) are collected.","This is in contrast to many conventional mobile applications, which require the user to a create a separate user account with the application service provider or content distributor in order for the user to initiate any transaction for the delivery of digital content to the user's mobile device via the application. For example, such digital content may be specific to a particular type of mobile communication application and may include, for example and without limitation, electronic books (or \u201ce-books\u201d) in a mobile e-bookstore application, movie rentals in a mobile streaming video application, a level in a mobile game, and digital music or ring-tones in a music application. In this example, the digital content is delivered to the mobile application from an associated application server through the mobile communication network . However, it should be noted that the present techniques are not limited to application-specific content or to digital content. For example, it may be possible to use these techniques to enable a user to purchase real-world products (e.g., retail electronics), which are presented as items for sale in an electronic store front (or \u201ce-store\u201d) application.","Application developers and content providers can sell content and services within their respective applications and still be able to charge the customers through their wireless or mobile service account, as described above. This is made possible by using a single item identifier, or alternatively, a small group of identifiers (e.g., corresponding to different price types associated different billing schemes or pricing models\u2014unlimited vs. monthly vs. temporary or one-time charge), to represent the entire catalog of items associated with a particular application or e-store developer or content provider. The use of a single or small group of identifiers enables the e-store developer to offer new items for in-app purchase to the user without having to continuously provide new or updated catalogs identifying each of the current items for sale on an individual basis. For example, the application developer provides one or more price ranges or price points corresponding to the items available for in-app purchase with the wireless carrier only once (e.g., when the developer initially submits the application to the carrier, such as through an application submission process or interface). This is also a benefit for the carrier or network operator since the amount of information to be tracked for each application developer or content provider is significantly reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["130","202","204","206","208","210"]},"The software application database  may include a database of software applications. Each software application may be configured to be downloaded, installed, and run in a wireless mobile communication device. The software applications may relate to virtually any user interest or need, such as education, entertainment, finance, health, instant messaging, social networking, maps, navigation, music, news, document generation, photography, shopping, sports, travel, utilities, and\/or the weather.","The application selection system  may be configured to allow a user to select one of the software applications in the software application database  for downloading, installation, and use. The application selection system  may provide information that may be used in connection with a user interface to facilitate this selection. The application selection system  may be configured to receive the user's selection of one of the software applications in the software application database  under the control of an application store client running on the wireless mobile communication device.","The application payment system  may be configured to allow the user to purchase a license to use the selected software application. For example, the application payment system  may be configured to interface with a carrier billing system, e.g., carrier billing system  of , as will be described in further detail below, for processing user purchase requests for in-app items. The application payment system  may be configured to allow the user to purchase this license under the control of an application store client running on the wireless mobile communication device. The application payment system  may be configured to provide information that may facilitate this payment through a user interface running in the wireless mobile communication device.","The application payment system  may be configured to allow the user to select and purchase a license for the selected software application and\/or a purchased in-app item. For example, an existing license stored at the user's device for general use of the software application may be replaced by an updated license that is downloaded to the user's device and that enables further use of one or more in-app content items. The in-app purchase history that is stored at the application store server may be used to generate in real-time a license string for enabling the in-app functionality for the application. The license string can then be included along with other licensing information within a license file to be downloaded to the user's device. Such other licensing information may include, for example, the identity of the user, the identity of the selected software application, the payment terms, and the expiration date or next time to check (validate) the license on the application store server for renewing the license. The license may have payment terms that may indicate if it is for a trial version (time based or feature based), partial version, limited feature enabled version, and\/or any additional or different functionality that has been purchased with the software application.","The license signing system  may be configured to sign the license selected by the user. The signing may be done in a manner that facilitates the authentication of the license. For example, the signing may cause a string that contains the license to be signed using a private key on the application store server. The application store client may have the public key to verify the authenticity of the signature. The software application may also or instead have the public key to permit the signature to be re-verified or verified once it is passed on from the application store client.","The download system  may be configured to download the license, after the purchase of the license, along with the selected software application. The license may include information indicative of one or more restrictions on the use of the selected software application by the user, the identity of the user, and the identity of the selected software application. The download system  may be configured to download the selected software application and the license to a mobile communication device under the control of an application store client running on the mobile communication device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","100","130","334","300","130","202","204","206","208","210","300"]},"In the example shown in , system  includes an e-store application server , a user device , a carrier application store , and a carrier billing system . In an example, application server , user device  and carrier application store  are communicatively coupled to a mobile communication network of a carrier, e.g., mobile communication network  of , as described above. As illustrated in , user device  includes an e-store application , a carrier software development kit (SDK) , and a carrier applications (or simply \u201capps\u201d) store client . Carrier applications store  includes a developer submission portal  and a carrier applications store server . Additional details regarding the operations performed by the above-listed components and subcomponents of system  for enabling the purchase of in-app items with carrier billing will be described below with respect to the exemplary process as shown in .","In an example, third-party application developers or digital content providers submit software applications for various types of mobile device platforms to carrier applications store  for distribution to mobile device users or subscribers within the carrier's mobile communication network. For example, the developer may submit different versions of the same application, where each version is implemented to run on a different type of mobile computing platform or operating system supported by the carrier or operator of the mobile communication network. As shown in , such applications are submitted by the developer through developer submission portal . For example, submission portal  may be a website or other interface made available by the carrier to such application developers and content providers for this purpose. Further, the application developers may be associated with a developer community for application developers and content providers who develop software applications targeting mobile device users associated with the carrier.","The developer submission portal  provides an interface that allows developers to submit their respective e-store applications (e.g., as binary executable files) to carrier applications store . Furthermore, the submission portal  allows developers to register (i.e., with carrier billing system  of carrier applications store ) one or more price points or price ranges associated with in-app content items that a developer wishes to offer for sale to users. As will be described in further detail below, the submitted application binary and associated in-app items  that are received at the carrier applications store  via submission portal  are used by the carrier applications store server  to process in-app purchase transactions with carrier billing for the mobile device users or subscribers in the carrier's mobile communication network.","Although system  is described in the context of a digital content delivery system for e-store applications, the teachings disclosed herein can be applied to other types of mobile applications for enabling in-app purchasing functionality with carrier billing. Furthermore, although only applications store server  is depicted in the example shown in , the functionality of carrier applications store server  may be distributed across a plurality of servers that are communicatively coupled to one another in a content management and distribution system or platform operated by the carrier. An example of such a content management platform includes, but is not limited to, the Multimedia Content Manager (MCM) platform from the Acatel-Lucent corporation of Paris, France. Similarly, although submission portal  and carrier billing system  are shown as a single component in system , it is noted that any number of system components may be implemented as necessary by the carrier in the mobile communication network for enabling the techniques as disclosed herein. Such other components and subcomponents have been excluded from this description for ease of explanation and purposes of description.","The mobile applications submitted to portal  include, for example and without limitation, e-store application . In an example, the carrier provides one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) to the application developer for developing applications, such as e-store application , which allow the mobile device users\/subscribers of mobile communication services in the carrier's mobile communication network to make an in-app item purchase with the option of carrier-billing as opposed to the application developer or content provider. For example, the mobile communication application of the developer, via carrier SDK , communicates locally with the carrier-provided application client to submit purchase requests and receive information related to each request, including information for enabling the carrier billing functionality (e.g., from the carrier's app store server and billing system) and the actual content purchased (e.g., from the application content or e-store server). For example, carrier provided SDK  may be an integrated component of e-store application  at user device  and accessible to e-store application  via a carrier provided API, as described above.","In this example, e-store application  is an application client adapted to communicate with e-store application server  for requesting digital content or services associated with an e-store application provided by the application developer or content provider. E-store application server  in this example is an application server associated with the e-store application . E-store application server  may be operated by, for example, the third-party application developer or content provider that submitted the application and in-app item information via developer submission portal  of carrier applications store . As shown in , e-store application server  sends e-store application  an e-store catalog  in response to a request from e-store application  over a mobile communication network (e.g., network  of , as described above). E-store catalog  may be, for example, a virtual catalog or storefront having various in-app items for purchase by the user from within e-store application . The user at device  can use the e-store catalog , e.g., via a graphical interface provided in e-store application , to browse and select an in-app for purchase. The purchased content  is provided by e-store application server  and installed to user device . To enable carrier billing for the purchased content, the in-app items  purchased from e-store application  are sent through carrier SDK  to the carrier applications store client .","In operation, the carrier-provided SDK  in this example enables the developer's e-store application  to request pricing information for the in-app items , which was previously registered for the application at carrier billing system  during the application and in-app content submission process (e.g., as shown in , as will be described below). Additionally, carrier SDK  enables e-store application  to send a purchase request  to carrier applications store server  via the carrier's store or shopping client application . For example, carrier apps store client  may be executing at device  in parallel with or as a background process for e-store application  and carrier SDK . Further, the carrier-provided SDK  enables information associated with the purchase (e.g., name of the purchased item) to be dynamically generated (e.g., at the time the particular in-app item is purchased via e-store application ) for purposes of registering the purchase with the carrier's system (i.e., the carrier apps store  and carrier billing system ). This enables transaction details corresponding to purchased items to appear on the user's account or billing statement provided by the carrier. For example, transaction information and payment details for the purchased in-app items may be included with regular account charges in the user's next monthly billing statement.","The e-store application  submitted by the developer in this example may be one of a plurality of various software applications, including those from different third-party application developers or content providers. The applications are provided by the carrier to its mobile device users or subscribers through an interface of carrier applications store . For example, carrier applications store , via carrier applications store server , provides a virtual storefront or \u201capplications store,\u201d as described previously, which includes the different applications. In an example, the interface is implemented using the carrier's applications store client  installed on a user's mobile device , as shown in . Like the applications submitted by developers to carrier applications store , carrier applications store client , in this example, is also a kind of e-store application for an electronic or virtual storefront of applications, as noted above. Also like the developer-submitted applications, carrier applications store client  may be adapted to operate on various types of mobile devices and platforms that are supported by the carrier.","As shown in , carrier applications store client  is one of various software or client applications (e.g., including e-store application ) installed on user device . For example, carrier applications store client  may be preinstalled onto user device  by the carrier and thus available for use when the device is first purchased by the user. Alternatively, carrier applications store client  may be available through a separate applications shopping client that may be provided, for example, by the device manufacturer or other entity that provides and maintains the operating system and application development platform of user device . In this example, carrier applications store client  is adapted to communicate with carrier applications store server  over a mobile communication network operated by the carrier (e.g., mobile communication network  of system , as shown in  and described above).","In an example, carrier applications store client  acts as an on-device portal (ODP) for carrier applications store . For example, carrier applications store server  may provide an online or virtual catalog of available applications via the ODP of carrier applications store client . Hence, carrier applications store client  enables the user of device  to browse and select one or more applications for download and installation to the device . Also, as will be described in further detail below with respect to , carrier applications store client  further enables the user of device  to complete in-app item purchase transactions with the option of carrier billing.","Reference is now made to  for describing an exemplary process of a third-party application developer for submitting an e-store application (e.g., e-store application  of ) and its associated in-app content purchase items to the carrier's applications store (e.g., carrier applications store  of ). For example, this application and in-app content submission process may be an initial step for enabling direct carrier billing of a user's in-app purchases made within the developer's e-store application.","As shown in , in addition to submitting the application binary file via a developer submission portal provided by the carrier (e.g., developer submission portal  of , as described above), the developer also submits information corresponding to all of the in-app item(s) associated with the application. Such information includes, for example and without limitation, a name or identifier and a price range representing all of the in-app items that are available for purchase within the application. In an example, the developer designates a general name or identifier for the in-app item(s) in addition to a price range including minimum and maximum values corresponding to the prices of the in-app items that are available for purchase within the application.","In a further example, the developer designates a different name and price range combination for the same set of in-app purchase items based on different pricing schemes or models. For example, such pricing schemes may vary across different application developers or content providers based on a developer's pricing needs or business model. Different pricing models that may be offered by a developer for various in-app purchase items include, for example and without limitation, one-time purchases, time-limited purchases for which a particular functionality can be used for only a limited period of time (e.g., for accessing a particular service offered by the application\/service provider), and recurring subscription-based purchases (e.g., for a monthly subscription service to access various forms of digital content).","As shown in  and also in  at data flow  of system , the information received via developer submission portal , including name\/identifier and price point\/range information, corresponding to the in-app purchase items for the developer's e-store application  are registered with the carrier billing system  of carrier applications store . In an example, carrier billing system  maintains a catalog of registered price ranges for in-app items associated with e-store application . Referring back to  in particular, although not shown in the simplified block diagram for system , carrier billing system  may be implemented using additional components including, for example, one or more data stores or databases for storing data records or files corresponding to the in-app purchase items associated with a particular e-store application.","The pricing information submitted to carrier applications store  represents all in-app purchase items for e-store application , including any future in-app items that currently have not been implemented. Therefore, any changes in content or pricing for the previously registered application binary and in-app items do not require the application developer to provide corresponding updates to carrier applications store , including carrier billing system . As such, the developer or content provider can continue expanding the number of in-app items offered through the e-store application  without being limited by the information previously submitted to the carrier.","The above-described capability is in contrast to conventional techniques in which the developer is required to notify the carrier to update its catalog of in-app purchase items and respective pricing data any time there was a change or addition to the set of in-app items offered in the e-store application. Furthermore, this capability allows the developer or content provider of e-store application  to register merely a small amount of pricing information for the in-app purchase items within e-store application . For example, the developer of e-store application  needs to include only one or a relatively small number of price points or ranges when initially submitting the developer's application to carrier applications store  (e.g., through the developer submission portal  of the store), without having to update this pricing information for any new in-app purchase items that may be added to e-store application  at a later time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["500","500","300","500","320","300","322","320"]},"As described above, the application developer submits the e-store application to a developer submission portal (e.g., developer submission portal  of system ) of a carrier applications store (e.g., carrier applications store ) using, for example, process  of . Hence, it will be assumed for purposes of description that the e-store application in process , including the associated in-app items available for purchase, were previously submitted and registered with the carrier's e-store applications store and billing system such a submission process. Further, it will be assumed that this e-store application was previously downloaded and installed to the mobile device by the user. For example, the application may have been installed via a carrier applications store or shopping client (e.g., carrier applications store client  of system ), which is also installed and executable on the device, as described above.","Accordingly, process  begins when the user launches the e-store application for execution on the user's device. Upon launch, the e-store application makes a request to validate its current license for use on the device in the mobile communication network. The validation request is sent to the e-store applications store server via the carrier SDK and carrier applications store client, as described above. Upon successful license validation, the e-store application connects to the e-store server of the application developer to request a catalog or listing of items that can be purchased using the application. For example, the e-store catalog provided by the e-store server may include an image, a brief description, and pricing information for each item available for purchase via the e-store application. Further, the prices for each item as displayed in the e-store application generally would be within at least one of the price ranges previously registered with carrier applications store, as described above.","Next, the user browses and selects an in-app item for purchase via, for example, a graphical user interface of the e-store application as presented on a display screen of the user's device. Once the user has confirmed the purchase, the e-store application connects to a carrier applications store server (i.e., via the carrier SDK and applications store client on the device) for requesting information related to the in-app items and associated price ranges. As described above, the in-app items with one or more price ranges were previously registered by the application developer with the carrier applications store for the particular e-store application during the initial application submission process. The information requested from the carrier applications store server may include, for example and without limitation, one or more unique item identifiers, which are assigned to the e-store application by the carrier applications store (e.g., upon submission of the application to the developer submission portal). For example, the unique identifier(s) may be stored at the carrier applications store and carrier billing system in association with the registered price range(s) corresponding to the available in-app items for the e-store application. Further, multiple identifiers may be stored for the e-store application, where each identifier corresponds to a different pricing model (e.g., one-time use, use for a limited period of time, etc., as previously described), as designated by the application developer or content provider.","The e-store application matches the confirmed user purchase with the list of available in-app items and price ranges that are returned for the application from the carrier applications store server. Once the in-app item purchase as confirmed by the user has been successfully matched with the registered information returned from the carrier applications store server, the e-store application in conjunction with the carrier SDK generates a purchase request based on a price range returned from the carrier's server (i.e., one set of price ranges if multiple sets of price ranges are returned). The generated purchase request may include, for example and without limitation, the name of the item being purchases, the exact price of the item, and any additional item-specific inventory information, such as a stock-keeping unit (SKU) number. For example, the SKU number may be used to uniquely identify the item in the e-store catalog for the application. In an example, the carrier SDK builds the name of purchased item dynamically when the purchase request is generated so that the details of the purchased items will appear on the carrier bill that will be sent to the user for requesting payment.","As shown in , the carrier applications store client submits the purchase request from the e-store application and carrier SDK to the carrier applications store server. Once the carrier store server has confirmed the purchase request, it returns a new license including details for the purchased items to the e-store application (i.e., via the carrier applications store client). Examples of the details for the purchased items in the new license may include, but are not limited to, purchaser identification, purchased price, name of the purchasing application, the purchase type (e.g., corresponding to a pricing mode, as previously described) and a purchase expiration date, if applicable.","Once the new license has been acquired, the e-store application can communicate with the e-store server of the application provider or content provider to download the purchased content onto the user device. The e-store server then delivers the content to the device and marks the license as having been consumed or used for its intended purpose. Further, the carrier (e.g., via the carrier billing system) bills the mobile device user\/subscriber and settles the account revenue with application developer\/content provider of the e-store based on, for example, a contract associated with sale of the in-app items purchased by the user\/subscriber via the developer's e-store application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","110","100","600"],"i":"a "},"As illustrated in the example of , mobile device  includes a microphone , a speaker  and a voice encoder (\u201cvocoder\u201d) , for audio input and output functions, much like in the earlier example. The mobile device  also includes at least one digital transceiver (XCVR)  for digital wireless communications, although device  may include an additional digital or analog transceiver. The concepts discussed here encompass embodiments of the mobile device  utilizing any digital transceivers that conform to current or future developed digital wireless communication standards.","The transceiver  provides two-way wireless communication of information, such as encoded speech samples and\/or digital information, in accordance with the technology of a particular mobile communication network (e.g., network  of system , as shown in  and described above). The transceiver  also sends and receives a variety of signaling messages in support of the various voice and data services provided via the mobile device  and the communication network. Although not shown, transceiver  may connect to one or more RF amplifiers for sending and receiving communication signals via antenna . Transceiver  may also support various types of mobile messaging services including, but not limited to, short message service (SMS), enhanced messaging service (EMS) and\/or multimedia messaging service (MMS).","In an example, mobile device  also includes a global positioning system (GPS) receiver  for receiving GPS signals so as to provide a user of the mobile device  with a global navigation and positioning tool. A GPS enabled mobile device (e.g., a mobile device including the GPS component  and its associated application software) informs the user of exact positioning information of the mobile device and may support various location-based services. Examples of such location-based services include, but are not limited to, location-based notifications and maps with driving directions.","As shown in , mobile device  further includes a microprocessor , which serves as a programmable controller for the device. For example, microprocessor  may be used to control all operations of mobile device  in accordance with programmed instructions that it executes. Such operations may include operations for general device functions, and operations for enabling in-app item purchases with carrier billing for an e-store application (and carrier SDK and carrier applications store client), as described above with respect to . For example, the instructions executed by microprocessor  may include functions corresponding to the steps in process  of  that are performed at the user device, as described above.","Also, as shown in the example of , the mobile device  includes flash type program memory , for storage of various program routines and mobile configuration settings. In an example, programming stored in the flash memory  configures processor  such that the mobile device  is capable of performing various functions as desired. For purposes of this discussion, the programming in memory  includes carrier applications client  (e.g., carrier applications store client  of ) and e-store application with carrier SDK  (e.g., e-store application  and carrier SDK  of ) to implement the functions involved in the techniques for providing the functionality for in-app item purchasing with carrier billing, as described above. The stored e-store application  may further include the associated license files, as described above. In this example, the mobile device  also includes a non-volatile random access memory (RAM)  for a working data processing memory. Of course, other storage devices or configurations may be added to or substituted for those in the example.","In the example of , the user interface elements of mobile device  include a display  and a keypad . For example, keypad  may include a limited number of hardware keys, and many of the user interface functions may be provided through a touch-screen interface of display . At a high level, a touch-screen of display  is configured to display information to a user and to detect the occurrence and screen position associated with user input (i.e., the user's finger touching an area on the display). Such user input may be an actual touch of the display device with a finger, stylus or other object. Further, display  may include a touch-screen that can also sense when the object is in close proximity to the screen. Use of a touch-screen display as part of the user interface enables a user to interact directly with the information presented on the display.","Based on the foregoing, the exemplary mobile device  uses display  to present visible outputs to the device user. Although not shown in , mobile device  may also include a touch\/position sensor and\/or sense circuit for detecting signals related to the occurrence and position of each user input (e.g., touch) via display . For example, such a sensor or sense circuit provides touch position information to the microprocessor , which can correlate that information to the information currently displayed via the display , so as to determine the nature of user input via the screen.","The display , including any touch sensors, and possibly one or more hardware keys or buttons, are the physical elements providing the textual and graphical user interface for mobile device . In addition, a microphone  and speaker  may be used as additional user interface elements, for audio input and output, including with respect to any e-store application related functions.","The structure and operation of the mobile device , as outlined above, were described to by way of example, only. In an example, e-store application, including carrier SDK,  and carrier applications client  operate as client applications in a client-server network environment. Accordingly, mobile device  operates as a client terminal and a remote computer as a server in the client-server network environment. For example, in-app purchasing functions provided by e-store application (and carrier SDK)  along with carrier applications client  can be implemented through communication with an associated application on a remote computer (or server) operated by a carrier (e.g., carrier applications store server  of system , shown in ) in a mobile communication network (e.g., network  of system ). In an example, mobile device  sends information relating to a particular in-app item, selected by a user via an interface of in e-store application and carrier SDK , to the carrier's remote server. In this example, e-store application  uses carrier SDK to send a request including the information over the mobile communication network to the carrier's remote server via carrier applications client , as described above. The carrier's remote server processes the information and returns to e-store application , for example, in-app item identification and pricing information associated with the purchased in-app item to mobile device , via carrier applications client , over the network.","As shown by the above discussion, server-side functions relating to in-app purchases with carrier billing for an e-store application, via a graphical user interface of a mobile station may be implemented on computers connected for data communication via the components of a packet data network. Although special purpose devices may be used, such devices also may be implemented using one or more hardware platforms intended to represent a general class of data processing device commonly used to run \u201cserver\u201d programming so as to implement the in-app purchase functionality for e-stores as described above (e.g., with an appropriate network connection for data communication).","As known in the data processing and communications arts, a general-purpose computer typically comprises a central processor or other processing device, an internal communication bus, various types of memory or storage media (RAM, ROM, EEPROM, cache memory, disk drives etc.) for code and data storage, and one or more network interface cards or ports for communication purposes. The software functionalities involve programming including executable code as well as associated stored data, e.g., files used for the e-store application, application licenses, carrier SDK, and carrier applications store client. The software code is executable by the general-purpose computer that functions as the e-store application server, the carrier applications store server and\/or that functions as an e-store application or carrier applications store client on a mobile device. In operation, the code is stored within the general-purpose computer platform. At other times, however, the software may be stored at other locations and\/or transported for loading into the appropriate general-purpose computer system. Execution of such code by a processor of the computer platform enables the platform to implement the methodology for in-app purchases with carrier billing for e-store applications in essentially the manner performed in the implementations discussed and illustrated herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","100"],"i":"b "},"Aspects of the in-app purchasing functions of the e-store application and carrier applications store client, as described above, may be embodied in programming. Program aspects of the technology may be thought of as \u201cproducts\u201d or \u201carticles of manufacture\u201d typically in the form of executable code and\/or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. Storage type media include any or all of the tangible memory of the mobile device, processors or the like, or associated modules thereof, such as various semiconductor memories, tape drives, disk drives and the like, which may provide non-transitory storage at any time for the software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be communicated through the Internet or various other networks. Such communications, for example, may enable loading of the software from one computer or processor into another, for example, from a remote server computer of a network into a mobile device or the like as illustrated herein. Thus, another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical, electrical and electromagnetic waves, such as used across physical interfaces between local devices, through wired and optical landline networks and over various air-links. The physical elements that carry such waves, such as wired or wireless links, optical links or the like, also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein, unless restricted to non-transitory, tangible media, terms such as computer or machine \u201creadable medium\u201d refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution.","Hence, a machine readable medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, a tangible storage medium, a carrier wave medium or physical transmission medium. Non-volatile storage media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as any of the storage devices in any computer(s) or the like, such as may be used to implement the in-app purchasing with carrier billing functionality, as shown in the drawings and described above. Volatile storage media include dynamic memory, such as main memory of such a computer platform. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise a bus within a computer system. Carrier-wave transmission media can take the form of electric or electromagnetic signals, or acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media therefore include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD or DVD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical storage medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave transporting data or instructions, cables or links transporting such a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read programming code and\/or data. Many of these forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a processor for execution.","While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and\/or other examples, it is understood that various modifications may be made therein and that the subject matter disclosed herein may be implemented in various forms and examples, and that the teachings may be applied in numerous applications, only some of which have been described herein.
