title: Client-managed group communication sessions within a wireless communications system
abstract: In an embodiment, a user equipment (UE) participating in a server-mediated communication session maintains an identifier of the session and a list of UEs that are currently participating in the session. The UE determines to suppress its participation level in the session, and configures a member update message to include the identifier and to indicate the suppressed participation level of the UE. The UE transmits the configured member update message to each other UE currently participating in the session. In another embodiment, the UE receives a request to modify one or more of a given set of control parameters associated with the session. The UE determines whether the UE belongs to a subset of UEs that are currently participating in the session and to which permission to modify the given set of parameters is restricted. The UE selectively grants the received request based on the determination.

Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the invention relate to client-managed group communication sessions within a wireless communications system.","2. Relevant Background","Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations, including a first-generation analog wireless phone service (1G), a second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks) and a third-generation (3G) high speed data\/Internet-capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.","The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association\/Electronic Industries Association in TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-A entitled \u201cMobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d referred to herein as IS-95. Combined AMPS & CDMA systems are described in TIA\/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT-2000\/UM, or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000\/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), CDMA2000 (such as CDMA2000 1xEV-DO standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA.","In W-CDMA wireless communication systems, user equipments (UEs) receive signals from fixed position Node Bs (also referred to as cell sites or cells) that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Node Bs provide entry points to an access network (AN)\/radio access network (RAN), which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Therefore, the Node Bs generally interacts with UEs through an over the air interface and with the RAN through Internet Protocol (IP) network data packets.","In an embodiment, a user equipment (UE) participating in a server-mediated communication session maintains an identifier of the session and a list of UEs that are currently participating in the session. The UE determines to suppress its participation level in the session, and configures a member update message to include the identifier and to indicate the suppressed participation level of the UE. The UE transmits the configured member update message to each other UE currently participating in the session. In another embodiment, the UE receives a request to modify one or more of a given set of control parameters associated with the session. The UE determines whether the UE belongs to a subset of UEs that are currently participating in the session and to which permission to modify the given set of parameters is restricted. The UE selectively grants the received request based on the determination.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as user equipment (UE), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more access points (APs), which may be referred to as Node Bs. A UE transmits and receives data packets through one or more of the Node Bs to a Radio Network Controller (RNC). The Node Bs and RNC are parts of a network called a radio access network (RAN). A radio access network can transport voice and data packets between multiple UEs.","The radio access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio access network, such core network including specific carrier related servers and devices and connectivity to other networks such as a corporate intranet, the Internet, public switched telephone network (PSTN), a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN), a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), and may transport voice and data packets between each UE and such networks. A UE that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more Node Bs may be referred to as an active UE, and can be referred to as being in a traffic state. A UE that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel (TCH) connection with one or more Node Bs can be referred to as being in a connection setup state. A UE may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel. A UE may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash device, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the UE sends signals to the Node B(s) is called an uplink channel (e.g., a reverse traffic channel, a control channel, an access channel, etc.). The communication link through which Node B(s) send signals to a UE is called a downlink channel (e.g., a paging channel, a control channel, a broadcast channel, a forward traffic channel, etc.). As used herein the term traffic channel (TCH) can refer to either an uplink\/reverse or downlink\/forward traffic channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","120","102","126","102","108","110","112","102","108","110","112"]},"Referring back to , the components of the wireless communications system  and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System  is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote UEs, such as wireless client computing devices , , ,  to communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components connected via the air interface  and RAN , including, without limitation, core network , the Internet, PSTN, SGSN, GGSN and\/or other remote servers.","The RAN  controls messages (typically sent as data packets) sent to a RNC . The RNC  is responsible for signaling, establishing, and tearing down bearer channels (i.e., data channels) between a Serving General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN) and the UEs \/\/\/. If link layer encryption is enabled, the RNC  also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the RNC  is well-known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The core network  may communicate with the RNC  by a network, the Internet and\/or a public switched telephone network (PSTN). Alternatively, the RNC  may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically, the network or Internet connection between the core network  and the RNC  transfers data, and the PSTN transfers voice information. The RNC  can be connected to multiple Node Bs . In a similar manner to the core network , the RNC  is typically connected to the Node Bs  by a network, the Internet and\/or PSTN for data transfer and\/or voice information. The Node Bs  can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the UEs, such as cellular telephone . The Node Bs , RNC  and other components may form the RAN , as is known in the art. However, alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example, in another embodiment the functionality of the RNC  and one or more of the Node Bs  may be collapsed into a single \u201chybrid\u201d module having the functionality of both the RNC  and the Node B(s) .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["126","126","160","165","175","175"]},"Generally, GPRS is a protocol used by Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) phones for transmitting Internet Protocol (IP) packets. The GPRS Core Network (e.g., the GGSN  and one or more SGSNs ) is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W-CDMA based 3G networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network, provides mobility management, session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W-CDMA networks.","The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users (e.g., access terminals) of a GSM or W-CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the internet as if from one location at the GGSN . This is achieved transferring the subscriber's data from the subscriber's current SGSN  to the GGSN , which is handling the subscriber's session.","Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network; namely, (i) GTP-U, (ii) GTP-C and (iii) GTP\u2032 (GTP Prime). GTP-U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol (PDP) context. GTP-C is used for control signaling (e.g., setup and deletion of PDP contexts, verification of GSN reach-ability, updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another, etc.). GTP\u2032 is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.","Referring to , the GGSN  acts as an interface between the GPRS backbone network (not shown) and the external packet data network . The GGSN  extracts the packet data with associated packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or PPP) from the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN , and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN  to the SGSN  which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer (RAB) of the destination UE served by the RAN . Thereby, the GGSN  stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and his\/her profile in its location register (e.g., within a PDP context). The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected UE. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.","The SGSN  is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network , in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN  includes packet routing and transfer, mobility management (e.g., attach\/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, PDP address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN , for example, within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus, SGSNs are responsible for (i) de-tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN , (ii) uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN , (iii) carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and (iv) billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, aside from (i)-(iv), SGSNs configured for GSM\/EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W-CDMA networks.","The RAN  (e.g., or UTRAN, in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) system architecture) communicates with the SGSN  via a Iu interface, with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN  communicates with the GGSN  via a Gn interface, which is an IP-based interface between SGSN  and other SGSNs (not shown) and internal GGSNs, and uses the GTP protocol defined above (e.g., GTP-U, GTP-C, GTP\u2032, etc.). While not shown in , the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System (DNS). The GGSN  is connected to a Public Data Network (PDN) (not shown), and in turn to the Internet , via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway.","The PDP context is a data structure present on both the SGSN  and the GGSN  which contains a particular UE's communication session information when the UE has an active GPRS session. When a UE wishes to initiate a GPRS communication session, the UE must first attach to the SGSN  and then activate a PDP context with the GGSN . This allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN  that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN  serving the UE's access point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2B"],"b":["100","1","120","1","3","120","162","162","188","175","182","184","186","170","2","5","120","164","162","164","188","175","182","184","186","170","4","175","175"]},"Referring to , UEs ,  and  . . . N are illustrated as wireless cell-phones, UE  is illustrated as a wireless tablet-PC and UE  is illustrated as a wired desktop station. However, in other embodiments, it will be appreciated that the wireless communication system  can connect to any type of UE, and the examples illustrated in  are not intended to limit the types of UEs that may be implemented within the system. Also, while the AAA , the provisioning server , the archive database  and the application server  are each illustrated as structurally separate servers, one or more of these servers may be consolidated in at least one embodiment of the invention.","Further, referring to , the application server  is illustrated as including a plurality of media control complexes (MCCs)  . . . N B, and a plurality of regional dispatchers  . . . N A. Collectively, the regional dispatchers A and MCCs B are included within the application server , which in at least one embodiment can correspond to a distributed network of servers that collectively functions to arbitrate communication sessions (e.g., half-duplex group communication sessions via IP unicasting and\/or IP multicasting protocols) within the wireless communication system . For example, because the communication sessions arbitrated by the application server  can theoretically take place between UEs located anywhere within the system , multiple regional dispatchers A and MCCs are distributed to reduce latency for the arbitrated communication sessions (e.g., so that a MCC in North America is not relaying media back-and-forth between session participants located in China). Thus, when reference is made to the application server , it will be appreciated that the associated functionality can be enforced by one or more of the regional dispatchers A and\/or one or more of the MCCs B. The regional dispatchers A are generally responsible for any functionality related to establishing a communication session (e.g., handling signaling messages between the UEs, scheduling and\/or sending announce messages, etc.), whereas the MCCs B are responsible for hosting the communication session for the duration of the call instance, including conducting an in-call signaling and an actual exchange of media during an arbitrated communication session.","Referring to , a UE , (here a wireless device), such as a cellular telephone, has a platform  that can receive and execute software applications, data and\/or commands transmitted from the RAN  that may ultimately come from the core network , the Internet and\/or other remote servers and networks. The platform  can include a transceiver  operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) , or other processor, microprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC  or other processor executes the application programming interface (API)  layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory  of the wireless device. The memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform  also can include a local database  that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically a flash memory cell, but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EEPROM, optical media, tape, soft or hard disk, or the like. The internal platform  components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna , display , push-to-talk button  and keypad  among other components, as is known in the art.","Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention can include a UE including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements, software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example, ASIC , memory , API  and local database  may all be used cooperatively to load, store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively, the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore, the features of the UE  in  are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.","The wireless communication between the UE  or  and the RAN  can be based on different technologies, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), W-CDMA, time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. For example, in W-CDMA, the data communication is typically between the client device , Node B(s) , and the RNC . The RNC  can be connected to multiple data networks such as the core network , PSTN, the Internet, a virtual private network, a SGSN, a GGSN and the like, thus allowing the UE  or  access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art, voice transmission and\/or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly, the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.","Below, embodiments of the invention are generally described in accordance with W-CDMA protocols and associated terminology (e.g., such as UE instead of mobile station (MS), mobile unit (MU), access terminal (AT), etc., RNC, contrasted with BSC in EV-DO, or Node B, contrasted with BS or MPT\/BS in EV-DO, etc.). However, it will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art how the embodiments of the invention can be applied in conjunction with wireless communication protocols other than W-CDMA.","Conventionally, when a given user equipment (UE) determines to initiate a communication session with two or more other UEs, the given UE (or session originator) requests initiation of the communication session with a network-side application server, such as the application server  shown in , which is responsible for arbitrating the group communication session as well as implementing control functions for the session. For example, the logic associated with creating the group communication session (e.g., figuring out which UEs belong to the group, etc.) resides on the application server , and in-call management functions (e.g., figuring out which UEs are actively participating in the session, etc.) also reside on the application server . Thus, in conventional group communication sessions, new clients or UEs that join the group communication session register with the application server , after which the application server  notifies the participating UEs of the new member. Likewise, in conventional group communication sessions, clients or UEs that leave the group communication session notify the application server  of their departure, after which the application server  notifies the participating UEs of the exiting member. As new UEs join and\/or leave the group communication session, the application server  is responsible for maintaining \u2018group state\u2019 information, which means that the application server  maintains an awareness of which UEs are actively participating in the group communication session, as shown below with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["1","2","4","170","400","400","1","1","400","1","120","170"]},"The application server  receives the group session initiation request and then loads group information associated with the group identified by the predetermined group ID contained therein, . For example, the application server  can maintain a table that maps group IDs to corresponding group information such as a current list of group-members that belong to the group, the permissions and\/or priorities of the various group members, and so on. After identifying and locating the group-members associated with the predetermined group ID, the application server  sends an announce message to each of the target UEs belonging to the group, . In , assume that UEs  . . .  receive the announce message and respond to the announce message with a positive acknowledgment (ACK) indicating a desire to join the group communication session,  and . Further assume that UE  receives the announce message and becomes aware of the group communication session, but does not join the group communication session. At this point, the application server  determines that the group communication session can begin, and instantiates a group state that contains information associated with the active group communication session, such as which UEs or group-members are actively participating in the group communication session, . For example, the group state at  of  includes information indicating that UEs ,  and  are actively participating in the group communication session, which UE originated the session, the respective priorities and\/or permissions of the UEs, and so on. Thereafter, based on the group state, the application server  will know where to route information to be sent to the group.","The application server  sends a status message to UE  (i.e., the session originator) in  indicating that UE  can begin speaking (or transmitting other media) to the group (along with an indication that UEs  and  have joined the session). UE  then begins transmitting media to the application server , . The application server  receives the media from UE  to be sent to the group in association with the predetermined group ID, and the application server  identifies UEs  and  as target UEs for UE 's media based on the current group state and then forwards UE 's media to UEs  and , .","At some later point in time, UE  transmits a request to join the group communication session to the application server , . The application server  updates the group state to reflect that UEs  . . .  are currently participating in the group communication session, , and the application server  notifies UEs ,  and  that UE  has joined the group communication session, . UE  continues to transmit media to the application server , , and the application server  identifies UEs  . . .  as target UEs for UE 's media based on the current group state and then forwards UE 's media to UEs  . . . , .","At some later point in time, UE  sends a request to the application server  that indicates UE  is exiting or dropping out of the group communication session, . The application server  updates the group state to reflect that UE  is no longer participating in the group communication session, , and the application server  notifies UEs ,  and  that UE  has left the group communication session, . UE  continues to transmit media to the application server , , and the application server  identifies UEs  and  as target UEs for UE 's media based on the current group state and then forwards UE 's media to UEs  and , .","As will be appreciated from a review of , as groups scale in size and\/or a frequency at which UEs join and\/or leave the group communication session increases, the burden of the application server  maintaining the group state can likewise increase. Also, the total number of group sessions in the system is proportional to the total number of users in the system. Therefore, in order to increase the capacity of the system, it becomes necessary to add not only support for a higher number of users on the application server , but also to add support for a higher number of group communication sessions on the server.","Embodiments of the invention are thereby directed to offloading management functions associated with the group communication session from the application server  to one or more of the UEs participating in the group communication session. In particular, the role of the application server  is reduced and the participating UEs are configured to provide the application server  with more explicit instructions with regard to how group session data is to be forwarded. The application server  is not responsible for maintaining the group state, for instance. Rather, the group state is maintained independently by the UEs participating in the group communication session.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["1","2","500","1","170","508","170","2","512","1","2"]},"Referring to , at some later point in time, UE  determines to add or join UE  to the communication session, thereby transitioning the one-to-one communication between UEs  and  into a true \u2018group\u2019 communication session, . Instead of loading a pre-provisioned or predetermined group identifier (ID) associated with a communication group that includes UEs  . . . , UE  generates a unique group session ID (\u201csession ID\u201d) associated with the group communication session being set-up by UE , . For example, the session ID can be generated in  by combining or hashing a UE-specific identifier associated with UE  and\/or a user-specific identifier with a timestamp (e.g., for example, a timestamp of when UE  determined to add UE  in ). Thereafter, the session ID generated in  is included or tagged to any messages (e.g., group management messages and\/or media messages) exchanged between group-members during the group communication session.","UE  initiates the group communication session with UEs  and  by configuring and transmitting a \u2018create group\u2019 (or an initial member update message) to the application server , .

The member update message can also include \u2018metadata\u2019 associated with the group communication session, such as usernames (or nicknames) associated with the group-members, user \u2018avatars\u2019 or images to be associated with one or more of the group-members, and so on. In an example, each message exchanged in association with the group communication session, such as the member update message of , includes the session ID generated in .","In , after transmitting the member update message in , UE  generates a group state associated with the group communication session.

In at least one embodiment, the group state and its associated metadata can be stored in a persistent storage on UE . For example, the group state can be stored within a contact entry in a client address book of UE , along with any associated metadata. In this case, if a multimedia client on UE  stops running (e.g., due to a \u2018crashing\u2019 of UE  or if UE  is rebooted), the group state and its associated metadata can be restored or reloaded from the persistent storage the next time the multimedia client is re-started on UE . The group state can also include session-control or session-restriction information, which will be discussed in more detail below with respect to .","In the embodiment of , upon receiving the member update message for initiating the group communication session, the application server  is not required to look-up group membership information based on the session ID as in  of  and\/or update a group state associated with the communication session as in  of .

As an example, the target UEs of any member update message correspond to the complete list of group-members contained in the member update message minus the UE that provided the member update message.
