Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a signal transmission apparatus and a signal transmission method both for transmitting encoded audio information. More specifically, the present invention relates to a signal transmission apparatus and a signal transmission method both for transmitting a plurality of pieces of encoded audio information having a plurality of sampling frequencies of F or 1\/N\u00d7F, which are encoded by the same encoding method, via a digital interface to a signal reception apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","Encoded audio information is transmitted from a signal transmission apparatus via a digital interface to a signal reception apparatus.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","701","704","703","704","702","704","701","703","703","704"]},"ISO\/IEC61937 is a known standard for transmission and reception of encoded audio information conducted using the digital interface . In this standard, the signal transmission apparatus  transmits the transmission signal  including encoded audio information obtained by encoding a PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) signal having M samples per frame, in the form of a 16-bit-and-M-sample stereo signal. In this case, when the size of burst information including management information and encoded audio information is less than a block size of 16\u00d7M\u00d72 bits, the signal transmission apparatus  writes stuffing information in the unused portion of the block (stuffing process), and specifically sets the entire unused portion to zero, thereby generating the complete block.","Typically, in the transmission signal  transmitted from signal transmission apparatus , synchronization word information appears in each block. The time between the start of a block indicated by certain synchronization word information and the start of another block indicated by the immediately following synchronization word information is herein referred to as a \u201crepetition time\u201d.","In the ISO\/IEC61397 standard, it is assumed that a stream of MPEG2 audio having a low sampling frequency (LSF) [24 kHz, 22.05 kHz, or 16 kHz] is transmitted. In this case, the repetition time is twice as long as a repetition time when a stream of MPEG audio having a sampling frequency of 48 kHz, 44.1 kHz, or 32 kHz is transmitted.","A transmission clock of the digital interface  which is of a typical type as described in the ISO\/IEC61397 standard is set, assuming that the sampling frequency of encoded audio information to be transmitted is 48 kHz, 44.1 kHz, or 32 kHz.","When different encoding methods are used to encode audio information as described above, the signal reception apparatus  needs to receive information about an encoding method in order for the signal reception apparatus  to correctly receive the transmission signal . In this standard, a value indicating that encoded audio information has been encoded by a different encoding method it defined in a bit field for data type information of the transmission signal  so as to notify the signal reception apparatus  that a different encoding method has been used.","In this case, as encoding methods for encoding audio information are changed, the repetition times of the transmission signal  are also changed. Therefore, if an encoding method which has been used to obtain encoded audio information is defined in data type information, the signal reception apparatus  can synchronize the transmission signal . Therefore, the signal reception apparatus  can appropriately process the transmission signal .","Now, it is assumed that encoded audio information, which has been obtained by the same encoding method but using a different sampling frequency, is transmitted via the digital interface  to the signal reception apparatus . The transmission clock of the digital interface  and the reception clock of the signal reception apparatus  are both constant. The digital interface  and the signal reception apparatus  are presumed to receive encoded audio information having a sampling frequency of 48 kHz.","Typically, the transmission clock of the digital interface  is equal to the reception clock of the signal reception apparatus . Therefore, in the following description, it is assumed that the transmission clock of the digital interface  is equal to the reception clock of the signal reception apparatus .","In the conventional art, the signal reception apparatus  cannot correctly receive encoded audio information having a sampling frequency other than an presumed sampling frequency unless the signal reception apparatus  is notified of a change in the repetition time of a transmission signal.","For example, when encoded audio information having a certain sampling frequency is transmitted and thereafter encoded audio information having a different sampling frequency is transmitted, the signal reception apparatus  cannot correctly receive the transmission signal  unless the signal reception apparatus  is notified of the change in the repetition time of the transmission signal .","Hereinafter, the conventional example will be described in more detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["704","704","701"]},"FIG. () is a diagram showing a structure of a transmission frame  including encoded audio information . The encoded audio information  is one-frame data obtained by dividing encoded audio information having a sampling frequency of 48 kHz into frames. FIG. () is a diagram showing a structure of a transmission frame  including encoded audio information . The encoded audio information  is one-frame data obtained by dividing encoded audio information having a sampling frequency of 24 kHz into frames. In this case, an encoding method for encoded audio information having a sampling frequency of 48 kHz is the same as an encoding method for encoded audio information having a sampling frequency of 24 kHz, that is, an encoding method for the encoded audio information  is the same as an encoding method for the encoded audio information .","As shown in FIG. (), the transmission frame  consists of one block. The transmission frame  includes a header portion  and a body portion . The header portion  stores management information . The body portion  stores data information . The management information  includes synchronization word information  and side information . The data information  includes encoded audio information . The data information  may include non \u201cencoded audio information\u201d .","The signal transmission apparatus  of  generates the transmission frame  from a signal input to the signal transmission apparatus , and outputs the transmission signal  including a series of transmission frames  to the digital interface .","The management information  is information for managing data stored in the body portion . As the data, the encoded audio information  and the non \u201cencoded audio information\u201d  are stored in the body portion . The management information  includes information indicating whether the data stored in the body portion  is valid. The synchronization word information  indicates the start of the block of the transmission frame . The synchronization word information  is used to obtain the repetition time between each transmission frame  sequentially transmitted. The side information  indicates whether the encoded audio information  is stored in the body portion . The non \u201cencoded audio information\u201d  indicates the absence of encoded audio information. The non \u201cencoded audio information\u201d  is used to make the size of the data information  constant.","As shown in FIG. (), the transmission frame  consists of one block. The transmission frame  includes a header portion  and a body portion . The header portion  stores management information . The body portion  stores the data information . The management information  includes synchronization word information  and aide information . The data information  includes encoded audio information . The data information  may include non \u201cencoded audio information\u201d .","The signal transmission apparatus  of  generates the transmission frame  from a signal input to the transmission apparatus , and outputs the transmission signal  including a series of transmission frames  to the digital interface .","The management information  is information for managing data stored in the body portion . As the date, the encoded audio information  and the non \u201cencoded audio information\u201d  are stored in the body portion . The management information  includes information indicating whether the data stored in the body portion  is valid. The synchronization word information  indicates the start of the block of the transmission frame . The synchronization word information  is used to obtain a repetition time between each transmission frame  sequentially transmitted. The side information  indicates whether the encoded audio information  is stored in the body portion . The non \u201cencoded audio information\u201d  indicates the absence of encoded audio information. The non \u201cencoded audio information\u201d  is used to make the size of the data information  constant. The size of the body portion  is twice as large as the size of the body portion  of the transmission frame .","As described above, the encoded audio information  and the encoded audio information  are both one-frame data (i.e., data having the same number of samples) which are encoded by the same encoding method. However, since the sampling frequency of the encoded audio information  is different from the sampling frequency of the encoded audio information , a reproduction time of the encoded audio information  is different from that of the encoded audio information . Further, a time required for the transmission frame  including the encoded audio information  to be received by the signal reception apparatus  is different from a time required for the transmission frame  including the encoded audio information  to be received by the signal reception apparatus .","In the above-described case, the time required for the reception of the transmission frame  is twice as long as the time required for the reception of the transmission frame . The time required for the reproduction of the encoded audio information  is twice as long as the time required for the reproduction of the encoded audio information . Further, the repetition time of a transmission signal including the transmission frame  is twice as long as the repetition time of a transmission signal including the transmission frame .","As described above with reference to , when the sampling frequency of one type of encoded audio information is \u00bd of the sampling frequency of the other type of encoded audio information, the repetition time of a transmission signal carrying the one type of encoded audio information is twice as long as the repetition time of the other type of encoded audio information. Similarly, when the sampling frequency of one type of encoded audio information is 1\/N of the sampling frequency of the other type of encoded audio information, the repetition time of a transmission signal carrying the one type of encoded audio information is N times as long as the repetition time of the other type of encoded audio information, where N is a natural number more than or equal to 2. When the sampling frequency of encoded audio information is decreased by a factor of 1\/N, the size of a body portion received by the signal reception apparatus  is increased by a factor of N. As a result, the repetition time is also increased by a factor of N.","As described above, although the same encoding method is used, a repetition time varies depending on the sampling frequency of encoded audio information. If the transmission signal  is transmitted without notifying the signal reception apparatus  that a different repetition time is used, the signal reception apparatus  cannot be correctly synchronized with the transmission signal . Therefore, the signal reception apparatus  needs to be at least notified that a repetition time has been changed in order to correctly receive the transmission signal .","Alternatively, certain information relating to the sampling frequency of encoded audio information is defined in the management information in order to intermittently notify the signal reception apparatus  of the repetition time of the transmission signal . Conventionally, in the ISO\/IEC61397 standard, when the same encoding method is used but a different repetition time is used, a different value is defined in data type information. The data type information relating to data information is included in the management information. However, when different data type information is defined for each sampling frequency, the number of data types to be written in data type information is increased. As a result, the bit field of the data type information cannot be effectively used, so that the bit field of the data type information becomes insufficient.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a signal transmission apparatus is provided for transmitting a plurality of pieces of encoded audio information encoded by the same encoding method via a digital interface to a signal reception apparatus, in which each of the plurality of pieces of encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of F or \u00bd\u00d7F.

Each of the at least one block includes a body portion, and a header portion storing management information for managing data stored in the body portion. The management information includes synchronization word information indicating a start of the block, and information indicating whether data stored in the body portion is valid. When the encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of F, the data generating section generates one block for one-frame data of the encoded audio information, stores one-frame data of the encoded audio information in the body portion of the generated block, and stores in the header portion of the generated block the management information including information indicating that data stored in the body portion of the generated block is valid. When the encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of \u00bd\u00d7F, the data generating section generates a pair of blocks including a previous block and a subsequent block for one-frame data of the encoded audio information, stores one-frame data of the encoded audio information in the body portion of the generated previous block, stores in the header portion of the generated previous block the management information including information indicating that data stored in the body portion of the generated previous block is valid, and stores in the header portion of the generated subsequent block the management information including information indicating that data stored in the body portion of the generated subsequent block is invalid. The sizes of the previous block and the subsequent block generated by the data generating section when the encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of \u00bd\u00d7F are each equal to the size of the one block generated by the data generating section when the encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of F.","In one embodiment of this invention, the information indicating whether data stored in the body portion is valid is side information indicating whether the encoded audio information is stored in the body portion, and when the side information indicates that the encoded audio information is not stored in the body portion, the side information indicates that the data stored in the body portion is invalid.","In one embodiment of this invention, the data generating section stores stuffing information in the body portion in the subsequent block.","In one embodiment of this invention, the management information further includes data type information indicating an encoding method for data stored in the body portion. The data type information of the previous block is the same as the data type information of the block generated when the encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of F. The data type information of the subsequent block indicates an encoding method for data stored in the body portion of the previous block irrespective of an encoding method for data stored in the body portion of the subsequent block.","According to another aspect of the present invention a signal transmission apparatus is provided for transmitting a plurality of pieces of encoded audio information encoded by the same encoding method via a digital interface to a signal reception apparatus, in which each of the plurality of pieces of encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of F or 1\/N\u00d7F, where N is a natural number greater than or equal to 2.

The sizes of the N blocks generated by the data generating section when the encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of 1\/N\u00d7F are each equal to the size of the one block generated by the data generating section when the encoded audio information has a sampling, frequency of F.","According to another aspect of the present invention, a signal transmission method is provided for transmitting a plurality of pieces of encoded audio information encoded by the same encoding method via a digital interface to a signal reception apparatus, in which each of the plurality of pieces of encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of F or \u00bd\u00d7F.

The sizes of the N blocks generated by the data generating step when the encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of 1\/N\u00d7F are each equal to the size of the one block generated by the data generating section when the encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of F.","As described above, in the present inventions even when encoded audio information has different sampling frequencies, a transmission signal can be transmitted without changing a repetition time by sequentially transmitting a plurality of blocks having the same size.","Specifically, when the sampling frequency of one type of encoded audio information is \u00bd of the sampling frequency of the other type of encoded audio information, two blocks having the same size as the size of a block which is used when one-frame data of the other type of encoded audio information is transmitted are generated based on one-frame data of the one of encoded audio information and the two blocks are sequentially transmitted. Each of the two transmitted blocks stores synchronization word information indicating the start of the block, so that the repetition time of the transmission signal is constant irrespective of the sampling frequencies of encoded audio information. Therefore, the signal reception apparatus does not need to be notified of the repetition time. As a result, the data type information of a transmission signal for transmitting encoded audio information having different sampling frequencies can be defined to be the same.","Further, according to the present invention, management information stored in the header portion of a block generated by the data generating section includes information indicating whether data stored in the body portion of the block is valid. Therefore, a signal reception apparatus receiving the block can retrieve information indicating whether data stored in the body portion of a block in a header portion is valid so as to judge whether the data stored in the body portion of the block is valid.","Still further, according to the present invention, when encoded audio information has a sampling frequency of \u00bd\u00d7F, the body portion of a previous block stores one-frame data of the encoded audio information while the header portion of the previous block stores information that data stored in the body portion of the previous block is valid and the header portion of a subsequent block stores information indicating that data stored in the body portion of the subsequent block is invalid. Therefore, a signal reception apparatus can extract encoded audio information by extracting only the body portion of the previous block. In such a case, the latency of a signal reception apparatus can be set to a constant time.","The header portion of the subsequent block stores information indicating that encoded audio information is not stored in the body portion of the subsequent block. Therefore, the signal reception apparatus does not need to extract data stored in the body portion of the subsequent block. In such a case, the body portion of the subsequent block may store stuffing information.","When payload length information stored in the header portion of the subsequent block indicates that the payload length of the body portion of the subsequent block is less than a minimum value (e.g., zero), the signal reception apparatus does not need to extract the body portion of the subsequent block. The signal reception apparatus can receive the entirety of the one-frame data of encoded audio information only by extracting only the body portion of the previous block including encoded audio information.","In the above description, although the sampling frequency of one type of encoded audio information is \u00bd of the sampling frequency of the other type of encoded audio information, the present invention is not limited to this.","When the sampling frequency of one type of encoded audio information is 1\/N of the sampling frequency of the other type of encoded audio information, N blocks having the same size as the size of a block of when one-frame data of the other type of encoded audio information is transmitted may be generated based on one-frame data of the one type of encoded audio information and the N generated blocks may be sequentially transmitted. In this case, N is a natural number greater than or equal to 2.","These and other advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed description with reference to the accompanying figures.","Hereinafter, the present invention will be described by way of illustrative examples with reference to the accompanying drawings.","One-frame data of encoded audio information is herein a minimum unit which can be singly decoded or reproduced.","The term \u201cframe\u201d as used herein refers to a predetermined interval including a predetermined number of data (samples) in a data stream.
