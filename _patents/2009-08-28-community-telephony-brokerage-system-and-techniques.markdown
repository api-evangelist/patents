title: Community telephony brokerage system and techniques
abstract: A community telephony brokerage system (“CTBS”) and techniques for facilitating telephony communications (including but not limited to text messages, audible messages, multimedia messages, commands, and voice communications) between members of a virtual or real-life community are described. The CTBS operates in conjunction with any known or later developed communication application or service, such as an email application, a social networking application, a gaming application, a discussion forum application, a blogging application, or a subscription/publication application, to provide intra-community telephonic communications via community members' own electronic devices, in a manner that keeps community members' unique telephone numbers secret from other members, and preserves other desired levels of privacy and/or security established by the community and/or communication application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Members of real-life or virtual communities often communicate via server- or service-based communication applications, including but not limited to email applications, social networking applications, gaming applications, discussion forum applications, blogging applications, subscription\/publication applications, and the like. To bring desired levels of anonymity and\/or security to their communications, community members may identify themselves using representations (such as avatars and\/or user names) or other items of information.","Members of a community may also wish to engage in telephonic communications with other community members. Typical server- or service-based communication applications, however, are not configured\u2014from either business or technical perspectives\u2014to support telephonic communications in a failsafe and cost-effective manner. Although community members can exchange their own unique telephone numbers (generally issued by operators of telephony networks including but not limited to wireless networks, public switched telephony networks, or voice-over-IP networks), use and sharing of unique telephone numbers between community members may not preserve the desired levels of privacy or security afforded by communication applications.","A community telephony brokerage system (\u201cCTBS\u201d) and techniques for facilitating telephony communications (including but not limited to text messages, multimedia messages, audible messages, commands, and voice communications) between members of a virtual or real-life community are discussed herein. The CTBS operates in conjunction with any known or later developed communication application or service, such as an email application, a social networking application, a gaming application, a discussion forum application, a blogging application, or a subscription\/publication application, to provide intra-community telephonic communications via community members' own electronic devices, in a manner that keeps community members' unique telephone numbers secret from other members, and preserves other desired levels of privacy and\/or security established by the community and\/or communication application.","In an exemplary implementation, the CTBS includes: one or more telephony interfaces responsive to receive and transmit telephonic communications from\/to one or more known or later developed telephony networks, such as wireless networks, public switched telephony networks, or voice-over-IP networks; one or more application programming interfaces responsive to communicate programmatically with one or more communication applications; and a community number allocator, which is responsible for the non-exclusive assignment of community telephone numbers to community members. The assigned community telephone numbers are selected from among a quantity of community telephone numbers designated by one or more telephony networks for use by the CTBS in providing intra-community telephonic communications.","When a particular community member desires to transmit a telephonic communication to another community member, he or she directs (either via a telephony network or via a communication application) transmission of the communication to a community telephone number assigned specifically to him or her for use in contacting the other community member. For discussion purposes, other community members that may be contacted by a particular community member using the system and techniques discussed herein are referred to as \u201ccontacts\u201d of the particular community member. Various examples of possible uses for the CTBS and intra-community telephonic communications, in the context of different types of communities\/communication applications, are discussed herein.","Using the CTBS and the techniques discussed herein, the same community telephone numbers may be assigned to the contacts of different community members\u2014each different community telephone number is able to represent a single contact for each community member\u2014and the number of community members is unlimited by the quantity of community telephone numbers. In this manner, there is no need to allocate impractically large quantities of telephone numbers on a per-connection basis. Community members are able to communicate telephonically, with levels of privacy and\/or security established by the community being preserved. Communities, communication applications, CTBS providers, and\/or telephony network operators may generate new business models and\/or revenue.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form. The concepts are further described in the Detailed Description section. Elements or steps other than those described in this Summary are possible, and no element or step is necessarily required. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended for use as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this document.","The community telephony brokerage system (\u201cCTBS\u201d) and techniques described herein operate in conjunction with any known or later developed network-based communication applications to provide private, anonymous telephonic communications (including but not limited to text messages, multimedia messages, audible messages, commands, and voice calls) between members of a virtual or real-life community. Exemplary operation of the CTBS is described with reference to online dating and gaming communities\/applications, although it will be appreciated that there are virtually unlimited combinations of communities and communication applications with which the system and techniques described herein may be implemented or used.","Turning now to the drawings, where like numerals designate like components,  is a simplified functional block diagram illustrating an exemplary communication architecture  within which aspects of CTBS  are implemented or used. CTBS  facilitates telephonic communications , including but not limited to text messages, multimedia messages, audible messages, voice calls, and commands, between community members (two community members, community member  and community member N , of members  through N, are shown) of a virtual or real-life community . A virtual or real-life community is any group of people or entities having any pre-established affiliation or logical relationship, who interact via a particular communication application  (discussed further below) for any legal purpose. For example; some purposes include but are not limited to business purposes, social purposes, educational purposes, professional purposes, and entertainment purposes. Although one community  is shown, it will be appreciated that any number of communities, having any number of members, are possible, and that community members may be individual people or entities\/groups of people, such as organizations, businesses, families, and the like.","Community members  and  are authorized to operate electronic devices configured to send or receive telephonic communications on behalf of the members via unique telephone numbers\u2014as shown, community member   is authorized to operate electronic device  configured for telephonic communication via unique telephone number , and community member N  is authorized to operate electronic device  configured for telephonic communication via unique telephone number . Electronic devices may be any known or later developed electronic devices, including but not limited to mobile phones, landline phones, gaming devices, voice-over-IP phones, personal computers, personal digital assistants, media players, facsimile machines, and the like.","Unique telephone numbers are any telephone numbers, in any format, issued by any telephony network (telephony networks  are discussed further below) that uniquely identify communications from or to a particular community member within the issuing telephony network. Generally, but not necessarily, unique telephone numbers are designated for use in connection with particular electronic devices.","Contacts  and telephony\/communication interfaces  are associated with electronic devices  and . For a particular member of a particular community, contacts  represent other community members that may be contacted by the particular community member via CTBS  and\/or the techniques discussed herein. An avatar, a user name, and\/or other items of information (including but not limited to an electronic business card, an address book entry, or assigned community telephone number (discussed further below)) may be used to represent a particular contacts. Telephony\/communication interfaces  represent physical or logical elements (for example, user interfaces) that enable an electronic device to receive information from, or transmit information to, telephony network(s)  and communication application(s) .","Telephony network(s)  represent any existing or future, public or private, wired or wireless, wide-area or local-area, packet-switched or circuit-switched telecommunication infrastructures or technologies. Exemplary telephony networks include: cellular networks, satellite networks, hybrid networks, copper wire networks, voice-over-IP networks, and public switched telephone networks.","Communication applications  represent any known or later developed programs or groups of programs that facilitate electronic communications between members of a particular community  in accordance with community rules\/interfaces . As shown, communication applications  are implemented within or as servers\/services , generally in a public or private, packet-switched network-based environment such as the Internet or a private local-area or wide-area managed network (not shown). Examples of communication applications  include but are not limited to email applications, social networking applications, gaming applications, discussion forum applications, blogging applications, subscription\/publication applications, and the like. Communication applications  further include CTBS interfaces , used for communications with CTBS  (discussed further below), and community rules\/interfaces .","Community rules\/interfaces  are established to govern the identification and interactions of community members via communication applications . For example, network- or client-side user interfaces may be used for obtaining information from, and providing information to, community members via communication applications . Levels of anonymity and security may be established through community rules or user preferences\u2014for example, users may identify themselves using representations (such as avatars and\/or user names) or other items of information, may consent (and withdraw consent) for communication with other community members, and may specify how incoming or outgoing communications are to be received or transmitted.","CTBS  includes: telephony interfaces , which are responsive to receive and transmit telephonic communications from\/to telephony network(s) ; application programming interfaces , which communicate programmatically with communication application(s) ; and community number allocator , which is responsible for the non-exclusive assignment of community telephone numbers  to community members, and for keeping records  of such assignments. Community telephone numbers  represent a quantity of telephone numbers designated by one or more telephony networks  for use by the CTBS in providing intra-community telephonic communications. In one possible implementation, assignment records  are lookup tables.","Aspects of CTBS  may be implemented within one or more network-side operating environments, such as within telephony networks  and\/or environments in which servers\/services  operate. In general, design choices and\/or operating environments dictate how and where specific functions of CTBS  are implemented. Such functions may be implemented using hardware, software, firmware, or combinations thereof.","With continuing reference to ,  is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method for using aspects of CTBS  to facilitate intra-community telephonic communications in a manner that preserves levels of privacy and\/or security established by the community, and enables the generation of new business models and\/or revenue for communities, communication applications, CTBS providers, and\/or telephony network operators.","The method illustrated in  may be implemented by computer-executable instructions (such as computer-executable instructions , shown and discussed in connection with ) that are stored in a computer-readable medium (computer-readable media  are also shown and discussed in connection with ) and executed by one or more general, multi-purpose, or single-purpose processors (such as processor , also shown and discussed in connection with ). Unless specifically stated, the methods or steps thereof are not constrained to a particular order or sequence. In addition, some of the methods or steps thereof can occur or be performed concurrently.","The method begins at block , and continues at block , where a community, such as community , is identified. The community has community members, such as community member  and community member N , who communicate via a communication application, such as communication application , and who also operate electronic devices, such as electronic device  and electronic device , which are configured for telephonic communication via unique telephone numbers, such as unique telephone number  and unique telephone number , respectively.","In an exemplary scenario, communication application  provides one or more network- or client-based interfaces , such as user interfaces, which facilitate electronic communication between community members. Communication application  also generally implements community rules, including but not limited to rules relating to privacy and security. Via the interface(s) and\/or rules, a particular community member who wishes to transmit or receive intra-community telephonic communications inputs (or authorizes the input of) a unique telephone number designated for uniquely identifying telephonic communications by or to the particular community member (generally, the unique telephone number has been issued by a telephony network or other communication network for use in connection with a particular electronic device, although it is not necessary for the unique number to be associated with a single electronic device). Communication application  communicates the unique telephone number to CTBS  (for example, via a call to an application programming interface ), which binds or otherwise associates the identity of the particular community member with the unique telephone number.","An exemplary call to an application programming interface  named \u201cBind( ),\u201d which accepts certain parameters and binds or otherwise associates the identity of a particular community member with his or her unique telephone number, is provided below.","\u201cBind (Community, Community Member, Unique Phone Number)\u201d","Referring again to the flowchart of , at block , a number of community telephone numbers designated for non-exclusive use for intra-community communications, such as community telephone numbers , are identified.","Next, at block , one or more desired contacts (up to the quantity of community telephone numbers identified at block ) of a particular community member are identified. In an exemplary scenario, the particular community member notifies communication application  (via user interface(s) , for example) of one or more other community members with whom he or she desires to communicate telephonically (such other community members are referred to for discussion purposes as \u201ccontacts.\u201d) Contacts may be pre-identified, or identified at the time communication is desired. Consent for such telephonic communication may be obtained from the contact(s), or withdrawn by the contact, either before or at the time of the desired communication. Communication application  communicates the desired contact's unique telephone number to CTBS  (for example, via a call to an application programming interface ), which keeps (for example, stores) a record of the contact (in a data structure such as a table, for example).","An exemplary call to an application programming interface  named \u201cAdd_Connection( ),\u201d which accepts certain parameters and records the existence of a particular community member's contact, is provided below.","\u201cAdd_Connection (Community, Community Member, Contact)\u201d","An exemplary call to an application programming interface  named \u201cRemove_Connection( ),\u201d which accepts certain parameters and removes a particular community member's contact, is provided below.","\u201cRemove_Connection (Community, Community Member, Contact)\u201d","As indicated at block , for each desired contact, a different community telephone number is assigned to the particular community member. In an exemplary scenario, CTBS  (via community number allocator , for example) assigns the particular community member a different community telephone number for each contact (up to the designated quantity of community telephone numbers), and stores a record of the assignment(s), as indicated at block . In one possible implementation, the assignments are recorded in a lookup table. One possible way to make the assignment(s) known to the particular community member is by transmitting electronic business cards associated with the contacts to the unique telephone number associated with the particular community member's electronic device. The electronic business cards may be distributed by CTBS , communication application , or a different application or service. Another possible way to make the assignment(s) known to the particular community member is via a proprietary software program installed on the community member's electronic device that can control his contact book (such as a Java application of a SyncML implementation).","An exemplary call to an application programming interface  named \u201cSend_Connection_Vcard( ),\u201d which accepts certain parameters and requests CTBS  to transmit an electronic business card to a particular community member, notifying him or her of an assignment of a community telephone number for a particular contact, is provided below.","\u201cSend_Connection Vcard (Community, Community Member, Contact)\u201d","Next, as indicated at block , when the particular community member transmits a message, such as a telephonic communication, to a particular contact, he or she directs the transmission of the telephonic communication to the assigned community telephone number. It is determined at diamond  whether the transmission was directed using telephony network(s) , or communication application(s) .","The method continues at block  in the case where the particular community member directs the transmission of the telephonic communication via telephony network(s) \u2014for example, the particular community member causes his or her electronic device to dial the assigned community telephone number. Telephony network(s)  route the telephonic communication to one or more telephony interfaces  of CTBS , and CTBS  receives the telephonic communication, as indicated at block . As indicated at block , the unique telephone number associated with the electronic device from which the telephonic communication originated (which was previously input to communication application  and communicated to CTBS  via one or more application programming interfaces ) is known, and thus CTBS  is able to identify the particular community member. At block , CTBS  consults the stored record(s) of the particular community member, and based on the assigned community telephone number that was dialed, the particular contact can be identified from the stored record(s).","It is determined at diamond  how the telephonic communication is to be transmitted to the particular contact. Community rules and\/or the contact's preferences may be consulted to determine the manner in which the telephonic message is delivered to the contact.","If telephonic transmission to an electronic device operated by the particular contact is indicated at diamond , then at block , the previously supplied information regarding the electronic device of the particular contact, including the unique telephone number associated with the electronic device, may be ascertained, and as indicated at block , CTBS  may cause the unique telephone number associated with the electronic device to be dialed to transmit the telephonic communication to the particular contact. It is noted that the telephone number from which the contact's unique telephone is dialed may be a unique telephone number associated with CTBS  and\/or communication application , or alternatively may be a community telephone number (the same or different community telephone number as was dialed by the particular community member) specifically assigned to the contact for use in telephonically communicating with the particular community member. The desire for telephonic transmission may be indicated by a particular community member, and communicated by communication application  to CTBS  via one or more application programming interface(s) . An exemplary call to an application programming interface  named \u201cInitiate_Call( ),\u201d which accepts certain parameters and requests CTBS  to transmit a telephonic communication to a particular community member, is as follows: \u201cInitiate_Call(community, community member, contact).\u201d Exemplary callbacks to communication service , initiated by a member's electronic device, which request telephonic transmission to an electronic device operated by a particular contact, and acknowledge receipt of a telephonic communication by a contact, respectively, are as follows: \u201cCall_Initiate_Request(community, particular community member, contact)\u201d; and \u201cMessage_Received (community, particular community member, contact, telephonic communication)\u201d.","If telephonic transmission to an electronic device operated by the particular contact is not indicated at diamond  (here it is noted that in practice, both telephonic and non-telephonic transmission may be indicated), then the method proceeds to block . If the community rules and\/or the contact's preferences indicate that the telephonic communication is to be delivered via the communication application, CTBS  may cause communication application  (via a callback from one or more application programming interfaces , for example) to deliver the telephonic communication to the particular contact. For example, a user interface may be used to transmit the telephonic communication to the contact.","In the case where, at diamond , the particular community member directs the transmission of the telephonic communication via communication application , the method continues at block , where the particular community member inputs information (such as the assigned community telephone number for the particular contact, or the particular contact's avatar, user name, or other identifying information) via interface(s)  that causes communication application  to call application programming interface(s) , requesting that the telephonic communication be transmitted to the particular contact. An exemplary call to an application programming interface  named \u201cSend_Message ( ),\u201d which accepts certain parameters and requests CTBS  to transmit a telephonic communication to a particular community member, is as follows: \u201cSend_Message(community, community member, contact, telephonic communication).\u201d","As indicated at blocks  and , CTBS  consults the stored record(s) of the particular community member. Based on the identity of the particular community member and the identity of the particular contact and\/or community telephone number, the unique telephone number associated with an electronic device operated by the contact can be identified, and CTBS  causes the unique telephone number to be dialed, via telephony interface(s) , to transmit the telephonic communication to the particular contact. It is noted that the telephone number from which the contact's unique telephone is dialed may be a unique telephone number associated with the CTBS and\/or the communication application, or alternatively may be a community telephone number assigned to the contact for use in telephonically communicating with the particular community member.","If the community rules and\/or the contact's preferences indicate that the telephonic communication is (alternatively or in addition) to be delivered via the communication application, CTBS  may cause the communication application (via a callback from one or more application programming interfaces, for example) to deliver the telephonic communication to the particular contact. For example, a user interface may be used to transmit the telephonic communication to the particular contact.","In this manner, the same community telephone numbers may be assigned to the contacts of different community members\u2014each different community telephone number is able to represent a single contact for each community member\u2014yet the number of community members is unlimited by the quantity of community telephone numbers. Using an assignment record such as a lookup table, there is no need to allocate impractically large quantities of telephone numbers on a per-connection basis. Community members are able to communicate telephonically, with levels of privacy and\/or security established by the community being preserved. Communities, communication applications, CTBS providers, and\/or telephony network operators may generate new business models and\/or revenue.","CTBS  and the methods illustrated in  may be used to facilitate intra-community telephonic communication for different types of communities\/communication applications. Two examples are described below\u2014online dating and gaming communities\/applications\u2014although it will be appreciated that there are virtually unlimited combinations of communities and communication applications with which the system and techniques described herein may be implemented or used.","Dating Community Example","In an online dating community, community members access an online dating service via a web browser interface, and provide a unique phone number associated with an electronic device (referred to as a cellular phone for discussion purposes) configured for telephonic communication. In one scenario, member A accesses the online dating service, and requests to contact member B telephonically. If member B consents, the dating service requests CTBS  to assign a particular community telephone number to member A for use in contacting member B, and to assign a particular (the same or different) community telephone number to member B for use in contacting member A. CTBS  keeps records of the assignments.","When member A posts to the online dating service a communication to be delivered telephonically to member B (assume for discussion purposes the posted communication is a text message), then the online dating service requests (via a call to application programming interface(s) ) CTBS  to transmit the text message to member B's cellular phone. Member B receives the text message on his or her cellular phone, which is indicated as having been sent from the community telephone number assigned to member B for use in contacting member A. Member B can therefore reply to the text message, and (1) the content of the reply may be handed back to the online dating service (which may continue the conversation thread online, and\/or request that CTBS  transmit the reply back to member A's cellular phone), and\/or (2) member B may use his or her cellular phone to transmit the content of the reply to the community telephone number assigned to member B for use in contacting member A via telephony network(s)  (the content of the reply will be received via telephony interfaces  of CTBS , and passed to member A's cellular phone by CTBS ).","If either member A or member B wishes to withdraw from contact with the other, they may do so via the online dating service, which requests (via a call to application programming interface(s) ) CTBS  to remove the records of the assignments of the community telephone numbers.","Gaming Community Example","In an online gaming community, which for discussion purposes is referred to as a chess community, players may be defined as community members and be allowed to play chess online and offline. When a community member invites another community member to play chess and the other community member is not online (but is assumed to have access to a cellular phone having a unique telephone number registered with the chess community and CTBS ), the online chess service\/application may request that CTBS  send an invitation to the offline community member in the form of a text message to the offline member's cellular phone. The invitation text message may be sent from a community telephone number that is not assigned to any particular community member for use in contacting any other community member, but instead represents the online chess service\/application.","When the offline community member accepts the invitation (for example, replaying to the text message with another text message), the chess board may be sent to the offline member\u2014from a community telephone number assigned to the offline member for contacting the online member\u2014in the form of a multimedia message at every step of the game. The online chess service\/application may show the chess board to the online member on his or her computer. It is possible for the offline member to play multiple online opponents concurrently, identified by the different community telephone numbers assigned to the offline member for contacting different online opponents.","With continuing reference to ,  is a simplified functional block diagram of an exemplary operating environment , with which aspects of CTBS  may be implemented or used. Operating environment  is indicative of a wide variety of general-purpose, special-purpose, client- or server-based, stand-alone or networked computing environments. Operating environment  may be, for example, a type of computer, such as a personal computer, a workstation, a server, a consumer electronic device, or any other type of stand-alone or networked computing device or component thereof now known or later developed. Operating environment  may also be a distributed computing network or Internet-based service, for example.","One or more components shown in  may be packaged together or separately to implement functions of operating environment  (in whole or in part) in a variety of ways. As shown, bus(es)  carries data, addresses, control signals and other information within, to, or from computing environment  or components thereof.","Communication interface(s)  are one or more physical or logical elements that enhance the ability of operating environment  to receive information from, or transmit information to, another operating environment (not shown) via a communication medium. Examples of communication media include but are not limited to: wireless or wired signals; computer-readable storage media; computer-executable instructions; communication hardware or firmware; and communication protocols or techniques.","Specialized hardware\/firmware  represents any hardware or firmware that implements functions of operating environment . Examples of specialized hardware\/firmware  include encoder\/decoders (\u201cCODECs\u201d), decrypters, application-specific integrated circuits, secure clocks, and the like.","A processor , which may be one or more real or virtual processors, controls functions of operating environment  by executing computer-executable instructions  (discussed further below).","Computer-readable media  represent any number and combination of local or remote components, in any form, now known or later developed, capable of recording, storing, or transmitting computer-readable data, such as instructions  (discussed further below) executable by processor . In particular, computer-readable media  may be, or may include persistent memory or main memory, and may be in the form of: a semiconductor memory (such as a read only memory (\u201cROM\u201d), any type of programmable ROM (\u201cPROM\u201d), a random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d), or a flash memory, for example); a magnetic storage device (such as a floppy disk drive, a hard disk drive, a magnetic drum, a magnetic tape, or a magneto-optical disk); an optical storage device (such as any type of compact disk or digital versatile disk); a bubble memory; a cache memory; a core memory; a holographic memory; a memory stick; or any combination thereof. Computer-readable media  may also include transmission media and data associated therewith. Examples of transmission media\/data include, but are not limited to, data embodied in any form of wireline or wireless transmission, such as packetized or non-packetized data carried by a modulated carrier signal.","Computer-executable instructions  represent any signal processing methods or stored instructions that electronically control predetermined operations on data. In general, computer-executable instructions  are implemented as software programs according to well-known practices for component-based software development, and encoded in computer-readable media (such as one or more types of computer-readable storage media ). Software programs may be combined or distributed in various ways.","User interface(s)  represent a combination of presentation tools and controls that define the way a user, such as a community member, interacts with operating environment . One type of user interface  is a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d), although any known or later developed type of user interface is possible. Presentation tools are used to receive input from, or provide output to, a user. An example of a physical presentation tool is a display such as a monitor device. An example of a logical presentation tool is a data organization technique (for example, a window, a menu, or a layout thereof). Controls facilitate the receipt of input from a user. An example of a physical control is an input device such as a remote control, a display, a mouse, a pen, a stylus, a trackball, a keyboard, a microphone, or a scanning device. An example of a logical control is a data organization technique (for example, a window, a menu, or a layout thereof) via which a user may issue commands. It will be appreciated that the same physical device or logical construct may function as an interface for both inputs to, and outputs from, a user.","Various aspects of an operating environment and an architecture\/techniques that are used to implement aspects of CTBS  have been described. It will be understood, however, that all of the described elements need not be used, nor must the elements, when used, be present concurrently. Elements described as being computer programs are not limited to implementation by any specific embodiments of computer programs, and rather are processes that convey or transform data, and may generally be implemented by, or executed in, hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof.","Although the subject matter herein has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is also to be understood that the subject matter defined in the claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
