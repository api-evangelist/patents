{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional application of U.S. Non-Provisional application Ser. No. 13\/287,417, filed Nov. 2, 2011, which is a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 12\/389,145, filed on Feb. 19, 2009, which issued on Feb. 5, 2013 as U.S. Pat. No. 8,367,760, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/029,777, filed on Feb. 19, 2008, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","One or more embodiments of the present invention relate generally to non-black rubber sheeting materials. Certain embodiments relate to silica-filled olefinic rubber membranes, including EPDM membranes, for use in roofing applications.","Ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) is extensively used in a variety of applications. For example, it is particularly useful as a polymeric sheeting material, which, because of its excellent physical properties, flexibility, weathering resistance, low temperature properties and heat aging resistance, has gained acceptance as a roofing membrane for covering industrial and commercial roofs. These roofing membranes are typically applied to the roof surface in a vulcanized or cured state and serve as an effective barrier to prevent the penetration of moisture to the covered roof.","Traditional EPDM roofing membranes are generally black or very dark in color, and are typically prepared by compounding the base polymer of EPDM with one or more carbon black fillers, processing oil, and other desired ingredients such as plasticizers, antidegradants, adhesive-enhancing promoters, etc., in a suitable mixer, and calendering the resulting compound into the desired thickness. The roofing membrane may also be cured by vulcanizing the resultant sheet in the presence of one or more vulcanizing agents and\/or compatible vulcanizing accelerators. Vulcanizing agents such as sulfur or sulfur-donating compounds such as mercaptans are typically used, although vulcanization and curing may be done using other agents or in the presence of other compounds.","While black or dark-colored EPDM membranes have been used for decades as commercial single-ply roofing membranes, such membranes are known to absorb sunlight and become hot. This has lead to various environmental and energy concerns. In recent years, great efforts have been made toward producing white and\/or other non-black EPDM membranes that are more environmentally friendly and more energy efficient. Various mineral fillers such as clay, talc, silicas, mica, calcium carbonate, and the like, in various combinations, have been added to various roofing membrane formulations to improve energy absorption characteristics.","One particular type of non-black mineral filler that has been used in combination with various clay fillers in non-black EPDM membranes includes silicas. It is known that silica, when used in combination with various clay mineral fillers as an EPDM membrane, can improve certain physical properties such as abrasion resistance and tear resistance. However, silicas, by themselves, do not provide effective reinforcement of the rubber membranes such as carbon black does in black EPDM membranes. Thus, there remains a need for a silica-filled olefinic membrane with improved performance and processing properties beyond those already known.","One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a roofing membrane comprising an olefinic rubber and from about 20 to about 250 parts by weight of a silica filler per 100 parts by weight rubber, wherein the silica filler is chemically coupled to the olefinic rubber and wherein the roofing membrane is non-black.","One or more embodiments of the present invention further provide a method for improving the reinforcement properties of a non-black silica-filled olefinic roofing membrane comprising providing a mixture of an olefinic rubber and from about 20 to about 250 parts by weight of a silica filler per 100 parts by weight rubber, adding a silane coupling agent compatible with the olefinic rubber and the silica filler such that the olefinic rubber is chemically linked to the silica filler.","One or more embodiments of the present invention further provide a vulcanizable composition suitable for use in the production of a roofing membrane, the composition comprising the reaction product of an olefinic rubber from about 20 to about 250 parts by weight of a silica filler per 100 parts by weight rubber; and from about 0.1 to about 5 parts by weight of a silane coupling agent per 100 parts by weight rubber, wherein the silane coupling agent is compatible with both the olefinic rubber and the silica filler, such that the olefinic rubber is chemically coupled to the silica filler.","One or more embodiments of the present invention further provide a method for the production of a roofing membrane comprising mixing a olefinic rubber, a silica filler, and a silane coupling agent in a masterbatch, wherein the silica filler reacts with the silane coupling agent to form an uncured compound, calendering the uncured compound into one or more layers to form a sheet, and curing the calendered uncured compound such that the olefinic rubber is chemically coupled to the silica filler.","One or more embodiments of the present invention still further provide a laminate membrane comprising a first layer including a cured elastomeric olefinic copolymer and silica, where at least a portion of the silica is coupled to the elastomeric olefinic copolymer a second layer including cured elastomeric olefinic copolymer and carbon black, and optionally a scrim fabric.","One or more embodiments of the present invention are directed toward non-black roofing membranes that include cured rubber (e.g. EPDM) and non-black reinforcing filler (e.g. silica), wherein at least a portion of the rubber has been chemically coupled to at least a portion of the non-black reinforcing filler. In one or more embodiments, a silane coupling agent is employed to effect the coupling between the non-black reinforcing filler and the rubber. Thus, certain embodiments include a vulcanizable composition including not only a vulcanizable polymer and a non-black reinforcing filler, but also a coupling agent. An uncured sheet can be formed from this composition and cured such that, upon curing, the rubber is chemically coupled to the filler. In one or more embodiments, a silane coupling agent acts to link the rubber and a silica filler together in such a way as to produce cured composition characterized by advantageous physical properties. Also, in one or more embodiments, the introduction of a silane coupling agent provides technological advantage during processing of the vulcanizable composition employed in making the membranes.","In one or more embodiments, the membranes of the present invention are monolithic membranes. These membranes include those where the composition of the membrane (excluding any optional scrim) is homogeneous throughout the thickness of the membrane. In one or more embodiments, these monolithic membranes derive from a single calendered sheet. In one or more embodiments, these monolithic membranes may optionally include a scrim such as a reinforcing scrim. Membranes including a scrim fabric may be referred to as composite membranes.","In other embodiments, the membranes of the present invention are laminate membranes including at least non-black layer prepared from a non-black rubber formulation as described herein. In one or more embodiments, these laminate membranes include at least one layer including carbon black as a filler. In certain embodiments, these bilaminate membranes may be composites and include scrim.","In either event, the membranes of the present invention include at least one non-black polymeric layer that derives from the non-black vulcanizable compositions described herein.","The membranes of the present invention (or at least one non-black layer of the membranes of the present invention) are prepared from non-black vulcanizable compositions of matter that include a rubber, a non-black reinforcing filler, a curative, and a coupling agent. They may be simply referred to as vulcanizable compositions. Optional ingredients may also be added.","In one or more embodiments, useful rubber includes elastomeric olefinic copolymer rubber, which may simply be referred to as olefinic rubber, olefinic copolymer, or simply rubber. In one or more embodiments, useful olefinic rubber includes that rubber that is capable of being cured or crosslinked with sulfur or sulfur-based cure systems.","In one or more embodiments, the olefinic copolymer is a terpolyer that includes mer units that derive from ethylene, \u03b1-olefin, and optionally diene monomer.

Olefinic terpolymers and methods for their manufacture are known as disclosed at U.S. Pat. No. 3,280,082, which is incorporated herein by reference. For purposes of this specification, elastomeric olefinic copolymers may be referred to as elastomeric olefinic terpolymers, terpolymers, or simply EPDM.","In one or more embodiments, the terpolymer may include at least 55 weight percent, in other embodiments at least 60 weight percent, in other embodiments at least 62 weight percent, and in other embodiments at least 64 weight percent mer units deriving from ethylene; in these or other embodiments, the elastomeric terpolymer may include less than about 73 weight percent, in other embodiments less than about 70 weight percent, and in other embodiments less than about 69 weight percent, mer units deriving from ethylene.","In one or more embodiments, the elastomeric terpolymer may include at least 1 percent by weight, in other embodiments at least 1.5 percent by weight, in other embodiments at least 2 weight percent, in other embodiments at least 2.4 weight percent, mer units deriving from diene monomer; in these or other embodiments, the elastomeric terpolymer may include less than about 4 weight percent, and in other embodiments less than about 3.2 weight percent, mer units deriving from diene monomer. In one or more embodiments, the balance of the mer units derive from propylene or other \u03b1-olefins. In particular embodiments of the present invention, the use of a silane coupling agent may advantageously provide for the use of terpolymer rubber having relatively low amounts of diene; for example, terpolymer rubber including from about 1 to about 2 percent, or in other embodiments from about 1.3 to about 1.7 percent, mer units deriving from diene monomer may be used.","In one or more embodiments, the useful elastomeric olefinic terpolymer (EPDM) may be characterized by a Mooney Viscosity (ML@125\u00b0 C.) of about 35 to about 70, and in other embodiments from about 50 to about 70.","Useful EPDM varieties are commercially available.

Other example EPDMs suitable for the present invention include, but are not limited to, Royalene\u00ae 512 and Royalene\u00ae 502.","In one or more embodiments, the EPDM membrane is cured or crosslinked. In one or more embodiments, the EPDM membrane is cured at a temperature of about 160\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, the EPDM membrane may be cured in an autoclave in the presence of steam and pressure.","EPDM can be cured by using numerous techniques such as those that employ sulfur cure systems, peroxide cure systems, and quinone-type cure systems.

In one or more embodiments, the coupling agents include a silane group or moiety that is believed to react with a hydroxyl group on the non-black reinforcing filler and chemically bond thereto. Inasmuch as silica includes hydroxyl groups that will react with silane groups on the coupling agent, the coupling agents may be referred to as silica coupling. In other embodiments, the coupling agents may be referred to as silane coupling agents. Useful silica coupling agents are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,842,111, 3,873,489, 3,978,103, 3,997,581, 4,002,594, 5,580,919, 5,583,245, 5,663,396, 5,674,932, 5,684,171, 5,684,172, 5,696,197, 6,608,145, and 6,667,362, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","In one or more embodiments, the silane coupling agent may be an organosilane. In one or more embodiments, the silane coupling agent may be a hindered silane. In yet one or more other embodiments, the silane coupling agent may be a mercapto silane.

In still one or more other embodiments, the silane coupling agents may include an alkoxysilyl or silyl halide functional group.","In one or more embodiments, the use of hindered silane coupling agents provides for several advantages. For example, the processing properties and the physical properties of the resultant compound have, in certain embodiments, proven to be advantageous. For example, silica-filled EPDM membranes have been shown to have increased physical properties, such as higher modulus, higher tensile strength and improved tear resistance, as compared to silica-filled EPDM membranes prepared without a silane coupling agent. Furthermore, processing properties, such as increased scorch safety and decreased compound viscosity (i.e., softer compounds requiring less energy to break down stocks before processing or calendering) have been found. Also, the reduction in viscosity of the membrane due to the use of the silane coupling agent allows for higher loading of fillers and for higher molecular weight polymers to be used without sacrificing compound processing properties. Finally, it has been found that membranes having employed the silane coupling agent in the production of the mineral (silica)-filled EPDM compounds require less time to cure to have equal or better physical properties.","Examples of silane coupling agents include bis(trialkoxysilylorgano)polysulfides, mercaptosilanes, and blocked mercaptosilanes.

In one or more embodiments, these blocked compounds can be used in conjunction with a deblocking agent. Advantageously, blocked mercaptosilanes do not provide an unpleasant odor, unlike the mercaptosilanes above.

Mixing techniques depend on a variety of factors such as the specific types of polymers used, and the fillers, processing oils, waxes and other ingredients used. In one or more embodiments, the ingredients can be added together in a single shot. In other embodiments, some of the ingredients such as fillers, oils, etc. can first be loaded followed by the polymer. In other embodiments, a more conventional manner can be employed where the polymer is added first followed by the other ingredients.","Mixing times generally range from about 2 to 6 minutes. In certain embodiments an incremental procedure can be used whereby the base polymer and part of the fillers are added first with little or no process oil, the remaining fillers and process oil are added in additional increments. In other embodiments, part of the EPDM can be added on top of the fillers, plasticizers, etc. This procedure can be further modified by withholding part of the process oil, and then adding it later. In one or more embodiments, two-stage mixing can be employed.","The sulfur cure package (sulfur\/accelerator) can be added near the end of the mixing cycle and at lower temperatures to prevent premature crosslinking of the EPDM polymer chains. When utilizing a type B Banbury internal mixer, the dry or powdery materials such as non-black mineral fillers (i.e., untreated clay, treated clays, talc, mica, and the like) can be added first, followed by the liquid process oil and finally the polymer (this type of mixing can be referred to as an upside-down mixing technique).","The silica coupling agent can be added with the fillers near the beginning of the mixing cycle. In one or more embodiments, the silane coupling agent is included before the sulfur cure package is added.","Once mixed, the rubber composition can then be formed into a sheet via calendering. The compositions of the invention can also be formed into various types of articles using other techniques such as extrusion.","The resultant rubbery compositions may be prepared in sheet form in any known manner such as by calendering or extrusion. The cured sheets may also be cut to the desired dimensions. In one or more embodiments, the resulting admixture can be sheeted to thicknesses ranging from 5 to 200 mils, in other embodiments from 35 to 90 mils, by using conventional sheeting methods, for example, milling, calendering or extrusion. In one or more embodiments, the non-black admixture is sheeted to the desired thickness and then bonded to a black sheeting material having essentially the same characteristics as the non-black sheeting material of the present invention using conventional processing techniques. Typically, the plies are calendered separately and then laminated together in an uncured state, to be dusted and cured in an autoclave or by other means. The sheeting can be visually inspected and cut to the desired length and width dimensions after curing.","The calendered sheeting itself should show good, uniform release from the upper and lower calender rolls and have a smooth surface appearance (substantially free of bubbles, voids, fish eyes, tear drops, etc.). It should also have uniform release from the suction (vacuum) cups at the splicing table and uniform surface dusting at the dust box.","As is known in the art, the uncured polymeric sheets (which may also be referred to as uncured sheets) can be subjected to heat in order to effect vulcanization of the rubber. It is believed that this step of heating promotes the formation of chemical crosslinks between the EPDM polymer and the silica filler. As is known in the art, the dusted sheets are wound onto a metal curing mandrel and placed into an autoclave for curing.","In one or more embodiments, the rubber formulations disclosed herein for fabricating membranes are employed in the manufacture of bilaminate membranes wherein the non-black rubber formulations are employed to produce at least one layer of the laminate membranes. In particular embodiments, the non-black formulations disclosed herein are employed to prepare a first layer, and the second layer can derive from a distinct rubber formulation. In one or more embodiments, the distinct rubber formulation (i.e. the rubber formulation employed to prepare the second layer) includes carbon black. Rubber formulations that include elastomeric copolymer and carbon black are generally known in the art as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,632,509, 6,615,892, 5,700,538, 5,703,154, 5,804,661, 5,854,327, 5,093,206, and 5,468,550 which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, these black formulations may include elastomeric olefinic copolymer (i.e. rubber), from about 30 to about 160 parts by weight carbon black per 100 parts by weight rubber, 40 to 100 parts by weight oil per 100 parts by weight rubber, and other ingredients such as a cure package, antioxidants, cure activators, and the like. As is known in the art, the carbon black can be replaced or supplemented with other non-black fillers such as clay and talc.","In one or more embodiments, the laminate membranes of the present invention are bilaminates wherein each layer of the membrane accounts for about 50% of the total thickness of the membrane. For example, a 60 mil membrane may include a 30 mil first non-black layer and a 30 mil second carbon black-filled layer. In other embodiments, the thickness of the layers can be different. In fact, it may be advantageous to construct a membrane with a non-black layer that is thinner than the carbon black-filled layer. In one or more embodiments, the thickness of the non-black layer to the carbon black-filled layer may be about 1:3 to about 1:1, in other embodiments from about 1:2.5 to about 1:1.5, or in other embodiments from about 1:2 to about 1:1.8.","The membranes of the present invention can be optionally reinforced with a scrim fabric. In other embodiments, the membranes are devoid of scrim fabric.","The roof sheeting membranes can be evaluated for physical properties using test methods developed for mechanical rubber goods. Typical properties include, among others, tensile strength, modulus, ultimate elongation, tear resistance, ozone resistance, water absorption, dimensional stability, burn resistivity, and cured compound hardness.","The membranes of this invention can be used as follows. The non-black layer can face upward so as to reflect sunlight, and the black layer should face downward toward the building. As the sheet is unrolled over the roof substructure in a conventional fashion, field seams are prepared by overlapping the edges of a rubber sheet with the edges of an adjacent rubber sheet. The width of the seam can vary depending on the requirements specified by the architect, building contractor, or roofing contractor and thus, do not constitute a limitation of the present invention. Seams can be joined with conventional adhesives such as, for instance, a butyl-based lap splice adhesive, which is commercially available from Firestone Building Products Company as SA-1065. Application can be facilitated by spray, brush, swab or other means known in the art.","Also, field seams can be formed by using a seam tape and a companion primer such as QuickSeam\u2122 tape and Quick Prime Plus\u2122 primer, both of which are commercially available from Firestone Building Products Company of Indianapolis, Ind.","Thus it should be evident that the sheeting material and method of the present invention are highly effective in covering the roof of a building. The invention is particularly suited for use on roofs of buildings, but is not necessarily limited thereto. The sheeting material of the present invention can be used separately with other equipment, methods and the like, such as, for example, for linings for fish ponds, decorative and aquatic gardens, ponds on golf courses, and the like.","In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested. The examples should not, however, be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention.
