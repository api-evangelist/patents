All of the foregoing applications are fully incorporated by reference herein.","The disclosed technology pertains to using information cards, and more particularly to the use of an information card overlay system such as the application of one or more overlay cards to a base card.","When a user interacts with certain sites on the Internet such as service providers, which are also referred to as relying parties, the service provider often expects to know something about the user that is requesting the services of the provider. The typical approach for a service provider is to require the user to log into or authenticate to the service provider's computer system. But this approach, while satisfactory for the service provider, is less than ideal for the user.","For example, the user must remember a username and password for each service provider that expects such information. Given that different computer systems impose different requirements, along with the possibility that another user might have already chosen the same username, the user might not be able to use the same username\/password combination for each such computer system. There is also the related problem that, if the user uses the same username\/password combination on multiple computer systems, someone who hacks one such computer system would likely be able to access other such computer systems.","It is estimated that an average user has over 100 accounts on the Internet. For users, this is becoming an increasingly frustrating problem to deal with. Passwords and account names are too hard to remember. Second, the user typically has no control over how the service provider uses the information it stores. If the service provider uses the stored information in a way the user does not want, for example, the user has relatively little ability to prevent such abuse\u2014and essentially no recourse after the fact.","In the past few years, the networking industry has developed the concept of information cards to tackle these problems. Information cards are a very familiar metaphor for users and the idea is gaining rapid momentum. Information cards allow users to manage their identity information and control how it is released. This gives users greater convenience in organizing their multiple personae, their preferences, and their relationships with vendors and identity providers. Interactions with on-line vendors are greatly simplified.","A typical information card contains claims (e.g., certain pieces of information pertaining to the user's identity). Claims usually include, but are not limited to, the user's first name, last name, street address, city, state, zip code, email address, home phone number, office phone number, and mobile number.","There are currently two kinds of information cards: personal cards (or self-issued cards) and managed cards (or cards that are issued by an identity provider (IdP) or security token service (STS)). A personal card contains self-asserted identity information. In other words, the person issues the card and is the authority for the identity information it contains. In contrast, the managed card is issued by an identity provider, which provides the identity information and asserts its validity.","When a relying party requests identity information from the user, a tool known as an identity selector or card selector can assist the user in selecting an appropriate information card. For example, the card selector can present to the user one or more information cards that satisfy a given security policy and claim requirements of the relying party. When a managed card is selected, the card selector can communicate with the identity provider to obtain a security token that contains the needed information.","While information card technologies are becoming more widespread in applications, there remain certain problems for which no adequate solutions currently exist. For example, while certain information card claims are static (such as last name, for example), it is not uncommon for a user to have multiple email addresses. Current implementations of card selectors require users to maintain multiple information cards, one for each minor customization of the claim values.","Because the user must maintain multiple instances of the same static data across multiple information cards, a simple change of address or phone number, for example, requires the user to update multiple information cards. This can be a very cumbersome, time-consuming, ineffiecient process. The user also assumes a risk of using outdated information if he or she neglects to make the pertinent change(s) in a particular information card before using it.","Thus, there remains a need for a way to address these and other problems associated with the prior art.","Implementations of the disclosed technology can advantageously allow a user to select a base card (e.g., a primary information card) and apply one or more minor claim customizations, for example, via a card overlay mechanism (e.g., an ability to overlay the base card with certain modifications using one or more overlay cards). For example, a card selector can allow the user to create a card overlay (e.g., by selecting an overlay card) that provides additional or replacement data values that override corresponding values stored in the base card.","Usage of the overlay data can be advantageously recorded so that, during future interactions between the user and a specific relying party, the card selector can present the same card overlay (e.g., base card and overlay data applied to it) that was used during previous interactions with the relying party. The user can decide to either accept the presented card overlay, revert to just the base card, or pursue a new base overlay, for example.","Embodiments of the disclosed technology can advantageously reduce the number of personal cards a user needs to manage. For example, consider a situation in which the user moves. While the move would necessitate changes in the information card claims (e.g., address and phone number), only the claim values in the base card would need to be changed as virtually all of the user's overlay card could benefit from the single change. Thus, whenever a basic piece of the user's information changes, he or she would only need to update a single information card (i.e., the base card) instead of each of the virtually limitless number of information cards he or she may maintain.","The foregoing and other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Before describing various embodiments of the disclosed technology, it is important to understand the context of the disclosed technology.  shows an example of a sequence of communications between a client, a relying party, and an identity provider. For simplicity, each of the parties (i.e., the client, the relying party, and the identity provider) may be referred to by their respective machines. Actions attributed to each party are taken by that particular party's machine, except where the context indicates that the actions are taken by the actual party itself.","In , a computer system  (i.e., the client) is shown as including a computer , a monitor , a keyboard , and a mouse . One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various other components can be included with the computer system , such as other input\/output devices (e.g., a printer), for example. In addition,  does not show some of the conventional internal components of the computer system , such as a central processing unit, memory, storage, etc. Although  shows the computer system  as a conventional desktop computer, one having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the computer system  can be any type of machine or computing device capable of providing the services attributed herein to the computer system , including, but not limited to, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or a cellular telephone, for example.","One having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the computer system  can interact with other computer systems, such as a relying party  and an identity provider , either directly or over a network of virtually any type.","The relying party  is typically a machine managed by a party that relies in some way on the identity of the user of the computer system . The operator of the relying party  can generally be any type of relying party. For example, the operator of the relying party  can be a merchant running a business on a website. Alternatively, the operator of the relying party  can be an entity that offers assistance on some matter to registered parties. The relying party  is so named because it relies on establishing some identifying information about the user. For purposes of the present application, the relying party  can refer to an application residing on and\/or running on the computer system  itself.","The identity provider  is typically managed by a party that is responsible for providing identity information (or other such information) about the user for consumption by the relying party . Depending on the type of information that the identity provider  stores for a user, a single user might store identifying information with any number of different identity providers , any of which might be able to satisfy the request of the relying party . For example, the identity provider  might be a governmental agency responsible for storing information generated by the government, such as a driver's license number or a social security number. Alternatively, the identity provider  might be a third party that is in the business of managing identity information on behalf of a wide variety of users.","Conventional methodology of releasing identity information can be found in a number of sources, such as a document published by Microsoft entitled \u201cIntroducing Windows CardSpace,\u201d which can be found on the World Wide Web at http:\/\/msdn2.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/aa480189.aspx and is hereby incorporated by reference. To summarize the operation of Windows CardSpace, when a user wants to access some data from the relying party , the computer system  requests the security policy of the relying party , as shown in a communication , which is returned in a communication  as a security policy . The security policy  is typically a summary of the information the relying party  needs, how the information should be formatted, and so on.","Once the computer system  has the security policy , the computer system  can identify which information cards will satisfy the security policy . Different security policies might result in different information cards being usable. For example, if the relying party  simply needs a username and password combination, the information cards that will satisfy this security policy will typically be different from the information cards that satisfy a security policy requesting the user's full name, mailing address, and social security number. The user can then select an information card that satisfies the security policy .","A card selector on the computer system  can be used by the user to select the appropriate information card. The card selector may present the user with a list or graphical display of all available information cards. Information cards that satisfy the security policy may be highlighted in some way to distinguish them from the remaining cards. Alternatively, the card selector may display only the information cards that will satisfy the security policy. The card selector may provide a means for the user to select the desired information card by, for instance, a mouse click or a touch on a touch screen.","Once the user has selected an acceptable information card, the computer system  can use the selected information card to transmit a request for a security token from the identity provider , as shown in a communication . This request can identify the data to be included in the security token, the credential that identifies the user, and other data the identity provider needs to generate the security token. The identity provider  can return a security token , as shown in a communication .","The security token  can include a number of claims (e.g., pieces of information) that typically include data that the user wants to release to the relying party. The security token  is usually encrypted in some manner, and perhaps signed and\/or time-stamped by the identity provider  so that the relying party  can be certain that the security token originated with the identity provider , as opposed to being spoofed by someone intent on defrauding the relying party . The computer system  can then forward the security token  to the relying party , as shown in a communication .","In addition, the selected information card can be a self-issued information card (also called a personal card). A self-issued information card typically refers to an information card that is issued not by an identity provider but by the computer system  itself. In that case, the identity provider  effectively becomes part of the computer system .","In this model, a person skilled in the art will recognize that because all information flows through the computer system , the user has a measure of control over the release of the user's identity information. The relying party  only receives the information the user wants the relying party  to have, and generally does not store that information on behalf of the user.","Exemplary Computer System for Implementations of the Disclosed Technology",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["105","105","205","210","215","220","205","105","210","105","205","210","105","130","135"]},"The card selector  is typically responsible for enabling a user to select an information card that satisfies a particular security policy. The card selector can present the user with a single information card to select or virtually any number of information cards (such as information cards -, for example) from which the user can select a particular one. The card selector  is also typically responsible for enabling a user to obtain managed cards from identity providers and to install the managed cards on the computer system . Certain implementations of the disclosed technology can include a mapping functionality between the card selector and the identity provider (e.g., to provide support for a base card and\/or one or more overlay cards)","The browser  can allow the user to interact with web pages on a network, such as web pages created by the identity provider . The user may use the browser  to obtain a managed card by, for example, visiting a web page created by the identity provider  and filling out a web-based form.","The computer system  also includes a local policy store , which can store local security policies such as local security policy . In the example, the local security policy  is a local security policy defining how certain information cards (e.g., virtual overlay cards) can be defined and used.","In the example, the card overlay system implemented within the computer system  includes the use of a base card (e.g., the first information card ) and at least one overlay card (e.g., the second and third information cards  and , respectively). The base card can contain the user's \u201cmain\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d information (e.g., home phone number) and each overlay card can contain different information for the same items (e.g., mobile or cell phone number instead of home phone number). Thus, the card overlay system can advantageously allow for the selection of a base card to provide all of the pertinent \u201cdefault\u201d information and at least one overlay card to add, remove, or replace certain information supplied by the base card. In certain embodiments, such actions can be policy-driven.","Exemplary Base and Overlay Cards",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["235","235","235","235"]},"The base card , which can also be referred to as the user's primary card, can be a self-issued card (e.g., stored in a local store of the card selector ) or a managed card. In certain embodiments where the base card  is a managed card, any corresponding overlay cards would typically need to be issued by the same identity provider that issued the base card .","The base card  can contain some or all of the user's data that is relatively static (e.g., name and address). The base card  can contain several different claims, which can each consist of two fields: claim type and claim value. In the example, the base card contains four claims of the following four claim types: name, address, phone number, and email address. Because a base card typically contains the user's \u201cmain\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d information, the claim values for phone number and email address in the base card  are the user's home phone number and primary email address, respectively. In certain embodiments, the base card  can also contain information identifying one or more overlay cards that can be applied to the base card .","Because virtually any information card can be used as a base card in a particular situation, a user may have multiple base cards. In such cases, a user may designate (or have designated for him or her) a \u201cmaster\u201d base card. Because such a \u201cmaster\u201d base card can be used with multiple identity providers, it might not exist as an actual information card for any of the identity provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["236","236","236","236"]},"In the example, the first overlay card  contains the same four claim types that are contained within the base card (i.e., name, address, phone number, and email address) with one notable exception: whereas the base card  has a claim value corresponding to the user's home phone number for the phone number claim, the claim value for the phone number claim in the first overlay card  is an alternate phone number (e.g., the user's mobile number). Thus, in situations where the first overlay card  is applied to the base card , the user's home phone number will be replaced with his or her alternate phone number as the claim value for the phone number claim.","In addition, the first overlay card  of  contains an extra item not found within the base card : a base card identifier. In certain embodiments, the base card identifier can indicate which, if any, of the user's information cards can be used as base cards (e.g., to which the first overlay card  can be applied). The first overlay card  can also contain one or more deltas corresponding to each base card. As used herein, a delta generally refers to a particular piece of information pertaining to which claims have claim values that are different between the first overlay card  and the base card , as well as to which claims are found in the first overlay card  but not in the base card .","The first overlay card  can also contain information pertaining to one or more identity providers (e.g., name and address of each identity provider). Such information can be used, for example, to override the name and address of an identity provider in the base card  with a different identity provider that the user (or card selector) desires to contact (e.g., to request a token based on the set of claims resulting from application of the overlay card  to the base card ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["237","237","237","237"]},"In the example, the second overlay card  contains the same four claim types that are contained within the base card (i.e., name, address, phone number, and email address) with one notable exception: whereas the base card  has a claim value corresponding to the user's primary email address for the email address claim, the claim value for the email address claim in the second overlay card  is an alternate email address.

In certain embodiments, the overlay card may specify certain claims to be removed from the base card, regardless of whether the overlay card contains any claim values for those claims.","The final card can be a modified version of the base card or a newly-created card, for example. If multiple overlay cards were selected, each selected overlay card is applied to the base card. For example, the first overlay card selected can be applied to the base card before the second overlay card selected is applied. The card selector itself can perform the application of the overlay card(s) to the base card (e.g., via an overlay module such as the overlay module  of ). Alternatively, the overlay mechanism can be external to the card selector but work in connection with the card selector.","At , the final card is used. For example, the final card can be used for the same purpose for which the original base card was selected (e.g., for authentication purposes).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"At , a security policy is received from a relying party. A typical security policy is a summary of what information the relying party needs and how the information should be formatted, for example.","At , a base card is identified on the client (e.g., the computer system  of ). The base card can be selected automatically (e.g., by a card selector) or selected by a user (e.g., using a card selector) as described above.","At , a determination is made as to whether an overlay card should be applied to the base card. For example, a card selector can determine whether there are any information cards that can be applied to the base card (e.g., information cards having a base card identifier that identifies the base card). If the card selector determines that one or more overlay cards are available, the card selector can present the overlay cards to the user. Alternatively, the card selector can automatically select one or more overlay cards (e.g., based on actions such as previous overlay card selections by the user). If there are no overlay cards available, processing can proceed directly to .","In certain embodiments, the card selector can provide information regarding potential overlay cards in response to a user action. Upon presentation of the base card, for example, the user can move the pointer over a certain field (e.g., phone number) and, if there are any associated overlay cards containing different values for the field, the card selector can present the options to the user. For example, the card selector can either present the overlay card(s) available or present only the different value(s) for the field contained within the overlay card(s).","Alternatively, the user can right-click on a base card and, if there are any associated overlay cards, the card selector can present the overlay card(s) to the user. The card selector can also present a tree view showing a hierarchy of the overlay cards associated with the user's base card (e.g., where the base card is the top-most or bottom-most card, depending upon the hierarchical structure used).","At , a security token can be generated based on the final card. Here, the final card is the base card itself since no overlay cards were applied to the base card. The generated security token can then by transmitted to the relying party, as shown at .","At , the overlay card(s) can be applied to the base card, resulting in a final card. In certain embodiments, the final card represents a modified version of the base card. For example, if the overlay card specifies the user's mobile number as his or her phone number but the base card specifies the user's home phone number instead, the home phone number can be replaced with the mobile number.","Alternatively, the final card can be a new information card created for the particular situation at hand (e.g., during interactions with a particular relying party) and stored, as shown at . In certain embodiments, the final card itself is stored. Alternatively, a record of the combination used (e.g., identifiers for the base card and overlay card(s)) can be stored rather than the final card itself.","At , a security token can be generated based on the final card (e.g., a modified version of the base card or a new card resulting from application of the overlay card(s) to the base card). The generated security token can then by transmitted to the relying party, as shown at .","General Description of a Suitable Machine in Which Embodiments of the Disclosed Technology Can be Implemented","The following discussion is intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable machine in which embodiments of the disclosed technology can be implemented.
