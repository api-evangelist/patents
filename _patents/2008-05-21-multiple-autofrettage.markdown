The following non-patent literature is referred to in the specification and is expressly incorporated by reference herein:\n\n","Prior to normal use, many engineering components and structures are subjected to overloads in excess of their design operating level. Examples of such overloads are \u201cshakedown\u201d of a bridge structure; hydraulic or swage autofrettage of a pressure vessel (including gun barrels); and mandrel enlargement of rivet holes (including aircraft structures).","In general, the purpose of such overloads is to cause the stresses within the material(s) to behave in an inelastic fashion at design-critical locations and thereby, on removal of initial overload, to induce advantageous residual stresses at or near the critical locations. These residual stresses subsequently serve to mitigate the stresses due to normal operation and thereby improve fatigue lifetime and\/or improve fracture resistance and\/or inhibit re-yielding. For example, in the case of a typical pressure vessel, the use of autofrettage can increase the fatigue lifetime of a tube with pre-existing crack-like defects by approximately one order of magnitude.","Many materials exhibit the Bauschinger effect [1], [2]. The Bauschinger effect serves to reduce the yield strength in compression as a result of prior tensile plastic overload (or vice-versa, when compression precedes tension). It is often assumed that the Bauschinger effect is associated with the pile-up of microscopic dislocations at grain boundaries and the associated creation of microscopic zones of residual stress [3]. The reduction of yield strength after load reversal is of importance because, on removal of the overload, critical regions experience high values of reversed stress. This may approach the magnitude of the yield strength if the unloading is totally elastic. If, because of the Bauschinger effect, the combination of stresses exceeds some yield criterion, the component or structure will re-yield, thus losing much of the potential benefit of overloading.","The loss of residual compressive hoop stress has been quantified for the case of hydraulically autofrettaged open-end tubes [4]. Such tubes are overloaded during an autofrettage process involving extremely high bore pressures applied to the length of the tube; this is usually termed \u201chydraulic autofrettage\u201d. The ratio of the wall thickness which behaves plastically during autofrettage to the total wall thickness is termed the \u201coverstrain\u201d. As a rule of thumb, for typical diameter ratios and overstrain levels, \u201cideal\u201d residual compressive hoop stress at the bore is reduced by 30% by Bauschinger effect and associated effects. As a result, the fatigue lifetime of a typical tubular steel pressure vessel subjected to 80% overstrain which does not exhibit Bauschinger effect may be more than one order of magnitude greater than the same pressure vessel which does exhibit Bauschinger effect. Hence, if it were possible to eliminate the deleterious impact of the Bauschinger effect, the lifetime of the component would be very significantly increased.","It is an object of the invention to provide a method for enhancing the residual stresses in a structure.","It is another object of the invention to provide a method of improving one or more of the fatigue lifetime, fracture resistance, and re-yield resistance of a structure.","One aspect of the invention is a method comprising a first step of performing swage autofrettage on an object; a second step of heat soaking the object; and a third step of performing hydraulic autofrettage on the object. The method may further comprise repeating the second and third steps. The method may additionally comprise a fourth step of heat soaking the object.","In one embodiment, the method may comprise adding material to the object and\/or removing material from the object after the first, third or fourth step. In some embodiments, the heat soaking step or steps may be restricted to a critical area of the object.","The invention will be better understood, and further objects, features, and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","An alternative to hydraulic autofrettage is \u201cswage autofrettage\u201d in which a relatively short mandrel is forced along the inside of the tube. This produces localized yielding near the mandrel. A residual stress solution for the case of swage autofrettage assuming ideal elastic-perfectly plastic behavior without Bauschinger effect, is reported by O'Hara [5]. The results presented in [5] were later adjusted to incorporate Bauschinger effect [6]. Subsequently, work by Underwood et al [7] quantified experimentally some residual stress fields due to swage autofrettage.","In some overload procedures, such as autofrettage, it has been common practice, following overload, to \u201cheat soak\u201d all or part of the structure by way of a slowly applied heating and cooling process in order to stabilize the material. It is often assumed that heat soak produces a \u201chealing\u201d effect at the microscopic level such that dislocation pile-ups caused by the overload are very significantly dissipated or removed.","There has been examination of a \u201cdouble overload\u201d procedure wherein the structure is overloaded once and then, without any intervening process, is subjected to a second similar overload. Apart from a modest contribution due to further strain hardening and\/or \u201cratcheting\u201d of the material, such a process produces little or no benefit [8].","A procedure proposed in [9] involves the following sequence:","1. Initial hydraulic autofrettage;","2. One or more (heat soak+hydraulic autofrettage) sequences;","3. An optional final heat soak.","The heat soak causes microscopic dislocations to be reduced or eliminated while retaining macroscopic residual stresses due to the previous overload. Hence the material responds effectively as virgin material containing a pre-existing residual stress field when the next overload is applied. Plastic strains, and hence Bauschinger effect, during subsequent re-overloads are thereby dramatically reduced. This behavior is analogous to autofrettage of pre-shrunk tubes wherein there has been no prior plastic deformation [10]. Residual stresses created by such a sequence are illustrated in , taken from [9].",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"The present invention includes the following sequence:","1. Initial swage autofrettage;","2. One or more (heat soak+hydraulic autofrettage) sequences; and","3. An optional final heat soak.","The above procedure is distinctly different from hydraulic autofrettage followed by heat soak and further hydraulic re-autofrettage.","A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of an example with reference to the accompanying  and Table 1.

Initial re-yielding begins at the original elastic-plastic interface at 689.5 MPa but does not occur at bore until 716.7 MPa. Thereafter the yielded \u2018zones\u2019 merge at 761.5 MPa.","2. Over the range 690-750 MPa, RYP equals the re-autofrettage pressure. This is because, on subsequent depressurization, there is no reversed yielding. Hence, on further pressurization, the tube behaves elastically up to its earlier re-autofrettage pressure.","3. Over the range 690-750 MPa, the re-yield pressure is equal to the re-autofrettage pressure. This is a feature not previously achieved, either as a result of single autofrettage, whether hydraulic or swage, or as a result of hydraulic re-autofrettage of a tube that was initially subjected to hydraulic autofrettage.","4. Over the range 690-710 MPa, there is a slight reduction in compressive bore hoop stress (Note: this slight reduction should not be confused with the near-bore upturn in ).","5. When the re-yielding commences at the bore at 716 MPa, additional compression is available to counter the above effect. There is then a significant increase in compressive bore hoop stress thru to 750 MPa, which then reduces and reverses at 760 MPa as the two re-yield zones merge.","6. The downturn in both compressive bore hoop stress and RYP above 750 MPa is largely due to the final loss of any benefit associated with the original swage autofrettage. At this point, the tube is behaving as if it had only ever experienced hydraulic autofrettage.","7. The behaviour of bore hoop stress and RYP over the range 690-750 MPa appears significant. 750 MPa is an optimum re-autofrettage pressure at which both bore hoop stress and RYP are maximized.","8. SMP rises monotonically as re-autofrettage pressure is increased. For the current tube, SMP approaches re-autofrettage pressure at 792 MPa. Conversely, the optimum re-autofrettage pressure for maximum RYP is 750 MPa, with no benefit above this level."]}}}},"Calculations based on Paris' fatigue crack growth law [11] using data from Table 1 show that the fatigue lifetime of such a tube, cycled with fixed internal pressure, would be increased as a result of such a procedure. The proportionate increase in fatigue lifetime for a range of re-autofrettage pressures is shown in . The plot shows life improvement ratio (i.e. lifetime after re-autofrettage and associated heat soaks divided by lifetime after single swage autofrettage). Thus, for example, when the operating cyclic pressure is 550 MPa, prior hydraulic re-autofrettage to 750 MPa increases life by a factor of 1.55.","Experimental Validation of Re-Autofrettage Procedure","There are two sets of experimental data that may be compared with the numerical model employed herein. The first is an extensive set of tests conducted by Audino et al [12] that relate to SMP testing of tubes following initial autofrettage. In this set, three separate swage-autofrettaged A723 steel gun tubes were tested. The three tubes had the dimensions analyzed herein and yield strengths of 1022, 1105 and 1177 MPa, respectively. Strain gauges were attached to the OD of each tube and zeroed. The tube was then pressurized and completely depressurized, after which permanent OD strain was noted. The procedure was repeated with increasing maximum pressure until a permanent OD strain of 0.1% was attained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"The second set of tests is due to Troiano et al. [13] and relates to SMP testing of tubes following initial swage autofrettage and subsequent low-temperature heat treatment and hydraulic re-autofrettage. Two A723 tubes were tested. The first tube, with yield strength 1055 MPa, was hydraulically re-autofrettaged to a pressure of 710 MPa. The second tube, with yield strength 1130 MPa, was hydraulically re-autofrettaged to a pressure of 731 MPa. Each tube was then subjected to an SMP-type test, as described above, until permanent OD strain reached approximately 0.025%.  shows the experimental results denoted by the two right-hand sets of cross-like symbols.","The pressures achieved during SMP testing of the re-autofrettaged tubes (i.e. the cross-like symbols) actually exceed those predicted via a numerical analysis that assumes little or no retained strain hardening. The explanation of these significantly higher experimental pressures is likely associated with the retention, and increase, of strain hardening throughout the various processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["10","10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["12","14","14","12"]},"While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
