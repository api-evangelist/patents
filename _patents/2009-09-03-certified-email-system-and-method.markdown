{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This Non-Provisional Application is a continuation of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/486,721 filed on Jun. 17, 2009, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a certified email system capable of receiving email messages (with any attachments) from any sender computing device; requesting and receiving a trusted third-party time stamp; generating time-stamp notifications; verifying a time stamp of a file or email (with any attachments); parametric searching of archived and time-stamped emails and files; and creating detailed pass-through client\/project billing.","2. Description of the Prior Art","The most important business communication system in the world is email. Email has increasingly taken the place of paper-based mail in everyday communication among individuals and between clients, customers, suppliers, business partners and associates. However, paper mail is still used for official correspondence or when a document is delivered to meet a deadline, because paper mail has provided certain advantages that email has heretofore been unable to satisfactorily replicate. Certified paper mail provides an official record through the United States Postal Service that a document was sent, but email systems which seek to provide a verification of sending are cumbersome, typically requiring email to be sent through a web interface or requiring the installation of specialized software or hardware, and wholly dependent upon the reliability of the system provider. Furthermore, many email verification systems have additionally required the cooperation of the email recipient, whether by logging in to a web interface or installing specialized software. This is a significant drawback for any system which does not enjoy near universal usage, and it is a prohibitive obstacle when sending email to recipients who may not want to receive the email, such as would be the case with an emailed eviction notice or the like.","This challenge has been of particular impact to business and other sectors, such as the legal profession, where a significant proportion of correspondence needs proof of service or receipt to meet legal codes and deadlines.","Separately, many businesses charge their clients for expenses incurred while performing work for them, so the fees for certified mail are passed on to these clients. Past email and document certification systems have failed to provide any integrated project or client tracking. Their use would therefore require either a time-consuming manual effort to determine which email might be charged to which client after they are sent, or a tedious process in which a notation of the related client or project would have to be made before each email sent.","Additionally, projects are often assigned to teams having a need for a centralized location to access and to collaborate on a variety of files, documents, and\/or emails. Or, in the context of the legal profession, opposing counsel may find benefit in a mutually accessible multi-party digital file depository. Although various archiving and content management systems are available, they do not provide convenient time-stamping of important documents and emails, so do not provide confirmation of data integrity or authentication.","Further, time-stamp verification methods are currently cumbersome. For example, an end user may be presented with an email and a time stamp, with the assertion made that the time stamp verifies the content and date-and-time of sending. Yet to determine if the assertion is true, the end user has to research how to verify the email with the time stamp and then has to perform the steps discovered. This is neither simple nor straightforward. Thus, an easy-to-use verifying tool could be advantageously used with time-stamped emails.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,162,635 issued to Bisbee proposes a system for registering a document in order to provide proof of existence and possession at a particular time. Bisbee's method utilizes a key proprietary to the document's possessor to cryptographically sign a document, and a trusted third party to verify and time-stamp the cryptographically signed document, as well as to cryptographically re-sign it. The Bisbee system provides only proof of existence and possession, and does not provide any means to determine the delivery of the document to any party or to determine the opportunity of any party to have knowledge of the contents of the document.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,327,656 issued to Zabetian provides for a verification system for confirming the delivery of an email. Zabetian's method relies on a trusted third party extracting a digital signature, or unique HASH, from an original document; the HASH is then stored. At some later point in time, the original document can be authenticated by extracting a HASH and by comparing the newly extracted HASH to the first HASH. Zabetian further provides a system for utilizing the verification method to certify emails. This method involves sending an email to a certification server at a trusted third party, such email containing information indicating the intended ultimate recipient of the email and a document to be certified. The certification provider then extracts a digital signature from the document to be certified, records the signature and time, constructs a new email which contains the certified document, and sends the constructed email to the ultimate recipient.","Zabetian's method presents several drawbacks. Since only the unique HASH is stored, this method provides no way for a document to be later retrieved or recreated from the trusted third party should the original copy be lost. Furthermore, this method at no point utilizes cryptographic signing to verify the original possessor or sender of the document. Additionally, the certification provider is the only provider of a time stamp, and is thus required to be fully trusted. There is no provision for obtaining a certification from another provider to obviate complete reliance on the certification provider. Proof of receiving, time, date, and contents of all rely on the integrity of the certification provider for their accuracy.","Finally, the intermediary step in the email delivery process of generating a new email at the trusted third party's certification server causes the sender of the email received by the ultimate recipient to be other than the original sender. This introduces a level of uncertainty as to the authenticity of the email, as well as significantly increasing the chance that the email will be filtered as spam, as the sending email address will not be on any white list utilized by the ultimate recipient, thus leading to a substantially increased likelihood of the email not being seen by the intended recipient.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,240,199 issued to Tomkow again provides for a system which can be utilized for confirming the delivery of an email. Like the Zabetian system, Tomkow's system relies on a system in which the original sender sends an email to a certification server at a trusted third party. In the Tomkow system, the certification server creates a unique HASH of the email and each of its attachments. The certification server then creates and sends new emails for each intended ultimate recipient, with each email from a unique address (based on the time the email was sent and other factors). Tomkow also provides for the possibility of archiving the contents of the email to the certification server, as well providing for obtaining information regarding the success or failure of the delivery to the various addressees.","The system disclosed by Tomkow faces many of the same drawbacks as that of Zabetian. Although the contents of the original sender's email to the certification server may be retained, there is no provision for retaining the email that was actually sent to the ultimate recipients. Since the actual contents of the emails sent to the ultimate recipients are dependent on the processing of the certification server, there is no guarantee of what was actually sent to each ultimate recipient. Likewise, Tomkow provides no facility for cryptographic signing, and requires that the certification provider be the provider of the time stamp. Tomkow has even more severe drawbacks than Zabetian in relation to obfuscating the original sender of the email, with each email to an ultimate recipient coming from a unique email address, so the ultimate user may not be able to set up any white list more stringent than one which allows any email purporting to be from the domain of the certification server. This opens any users of the system to easy exploitation by spam email vendors who may utilize these permissive filters to expose the users to a profusion of nuisance emails.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,051,370 issued to Wakino discloses a similar system in which an original sender sends an email containing original sender information, ultimate recipient information, billing information, and email content to a content verification server, the content verification server sends a request to bill the sender based on the billing information in the email, transmits the email content to the ultimate recipient, and transmits a receipt to the original sender. This system has essentially the same drawback as the Tomkow system and the Zabetian system, in that the email to the ultimate recipient is not from the original sender, but is from the content verification server, and that the time stamp information is obtained from and maintained by the content verification server with no facility to obtain a time stamp from a more trusted source.","U.S. Pub No. 2004\/0255120 filed by Botti et al. provides a system for automatically submitting digital files for verification without the need for user intervention (upon occurrence of an event on a computer system, such as saving a document or a specified time of day) in which a file is sent to a remote server, the remote server extracts a unique HASH from the file, and the remote server applies a cryptographic signature to the file and a time stamp acquired from a secure clock. This system has similar drawbacks to the Wakino, Tomkow, and Zabetian systems in that the time stamp is acquired from a clock maintained by the remote server with no provision for integrating a more trusted entity. The Botti system further provides no system to verify the delivery of emails. While the Botti system does provide a system to verify whether a digital copy of a document is the same as an original time-stamped document by regenerating a HASH to compare to the digital signature of the originally submitted document, no provision is made for partial matches, such as email content-only matches.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,290,143 issued to Renier et al. provides a system that is superficially similar to the main function of the Zabetian, Tomkow, and Wakino systems, with some modifications; however, the main point of differentiation is that in the Renier system, the certification and other processing occurs on the telecommunication network having the mailbox associated with the addressee. This restricts the system to sending certified or time-stamped emails to recipients who are running a server implementing the Renier system, making the use of the system at the option of the recipient rather than the sender. This essentially precludes general use for sending certified emails to general users, who cannot be compelled to use mailboxes associated with a server capable of providing certification. Also, service costs cannot be associated with a client of the system user.","The time-stamping systems disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,393,126 issued to van der Kaay et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,209,090 issued to Aisenberg et al., U.S. Pub. No. 2004\/0049521 filed by Borrowman, and U.S. Pub. No. 2005\/0160272 filed by Teppler provide for time-stamping documents by relying on the replacement of a computer's internal clock with an assumedly more accurate or secure internal clock. The secure internal clock provides a time with which the local computer can time-stamp a document. All these systems rely on a local clock, which though more secure than a standard clock is still believed to be less secure than a clock maintained by a trusted third party, and the replacement of the local clock with a nonstandard-clock is both troublesome and likely to be error prone and is difficult to integrate with a standard business IT environment. Furthermore, none of the systems provide for any way to verify the delivery of emails or to verify received time stamps.","The system of U.S. Pat. No. 5,509,071 issued to Petrie, Jr. et al. provides a system which is intended primarily for secure purchase transactions, and therefore relies on extensive cooperation from the ultimate recipient. It is therefore not useful for the desired purpose of verification of delivery to a potentially uncooperative recipient, besides the drawback of requiring significant effort for even a cooperative recipient.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,237,114 issued to Rosenberg discloses a system for maintaining a secure cache of individuals' private keys or portions of individuals' private keys to ensure the secure maintenance of the private keys, and a system by which the keys can be temporarily reconstructed or used in a secure environment. The system therefore does not provide for time-stamping documents or verification of delivery of emails.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,872,849 issued to Sudia provides a system for splitting private keys, and though it utilizes public and private keys, it provides no application to certifying, signing or time-stamping documents.","U.S. Pub. No. 2007\/0118732 filed by Whitmore discloses a system in which a user sends a file to a remote server, user inputs a username and password or otherwise has their credentials verified, and the remote server signs the document. This system does not provide any system for time-stamping the document, nor a way to verify the delivery of email.","U.S. Pub. No. 2007\/0106912 filed by Tanaka provides a system for updating a time stamp over time to ensure that the certification is kept current, and as such is not concerned with the method by which the original time stamp is obtained.","Accordingly, there is an established need for an efficient certified email system and method that provides an end user with a simple interface, that is accessible from any type of email client or service on any sender computing device without requiring software installation, that allows for integrated pass-through client\/project billing, that can be integrated with a convenient multi-party archiving and content management system, that provides effective searches of certified email, that provides convenient web-based automated verification services, and that provides digital evidence in the form of a verifiable time stamp of the time and date of sending of the email, of the contents of the email (and any attachments), and of the sender and recipient electronic-delivery addresses.","The present invention is directed to a certified email system and method that is capable of providing a time stamp, such as an electronic postmark, to an end user via a simple-to-use interface by utilizing a demanding party for receiving and preparing the email and a web services time-stamp conduit (WSTC) configured to serve as a convenient conduit to one or more Time Stamp Authorities for the one or more demanding parties. Thus, both the demanding party interface provided to the end user and the WSTC interface provided to the demanding party are configured for ease of use and access. Throughout this disclosure, unless otherwise indicated by context, the term \u201ctime stamp\u201d (and grammatical equivalents) refers to the digital signature that results when a file signature HASH is combined with the time and then digitally signed by a trusted entity.","The demanding party captures the complete email including email-transmission data, parses the coded demanding-party electronic-delivery address (referred to herein as the Trusted Carbon Copy Address [TCC: Address]), prepares the file for time-stamping by generating meta data which include signing of the file's digital HASH value, and passes the prepared conduit-input data with a time-stamp call request to the WSTC. The WSTC then receives, verifies and formats the information, and obtains a time stamp from a Time Stamp Authority (TSA), such as the United States Postal Service Electronic Postmark or EPM\u00ae (a postmark receipt containing a unique Identifier, the file signature, the secure time stamp, and a digital certificate). The time stamp is received by the WSTC, verified and preferably archived. Then a receipt-notification email is sent out to the sending and, optionally, to the receiving party (or parties), as desired by the user of the invention.","Provision is further made for convenient web-based automated verification services, such as a Content-Proof Verifying Tool (to conveniently verify the content of a file or email with any attachments after it was sent) and a Verify HASH Tool (to conveniently verify whether a time-stamp receipt is valid for a given file or email with any attachments).","Another aspect of the invention provides a convenient multi-party content management system integrated with the time-stamping function of the certified email system, which provides archiving, collaborating and searching of time stamps and time-stamp-related data.","The time-stamping function of the certified email system is initiated upon receipt of an email message by the demanding party, thus negating the requirement to log into a website or to install software on the sender or recipient computing devices. The email message is addressed to (and transmitted in the normal way to) both the recipient(s) (using the \u201cTO: Address\u201d field) and to the demanding party TCC: Address (generally using the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d field\u2014but optionally using the \u201cTO: Address\u201d field or \u201cCC: Address\u201d field), and, optionally, to any carbon copy recipient(s) (using the \u201cCC: Address\u201d field or the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d field). The coded TCC: Address preferably contains one or more IDENTIFIERS.","An integrated client billing system is based on the one or more address IDENTIFIERS coded into the local part of the TCC: Address (or, at times, optionally or additionally, based on email-transmission data or manual cataloging). The IDENTIFIERS can be parsed to derive detailed billing parameters (such as corporate, user, client, and\/or project billing-associated details), allowing pass-through billing for clients and projects. Billing-associable details may also be derived from the email header, transmission data, addresses of the sender or recipients, and\/or manual cataloging.","An object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method that provide irrefutable evidence of an email's contents, time of sending, and recipient electronic-delivery addresses.","An additional object of the present invention is to provide a web services time-stamp conduit that is usable by one or more demanding parties to conveniently request and receive a time stamp.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method that are adapted for use with any email service or client (e.g., Outlook\u00ae, Lotus\u00ae, Gmail\u00ae, Microsoft Exchange\u00ae, etc.) on any computing device capable of sending email (e.g., Windows\u00ae computer, Apple\u00ae computer, iPhone\u00ae, BlackBerry\u00ae, etc.).","Another object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method that require no plug-in, client download, or software installation on the sender or recipient computing devices.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method that do not require configuration changes on the MUA (Mail User Agent).","Another object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method that do not require any installation or configuration for the MTA (Mail Transfer Agent).","An additional object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method that, in one aspect, provide detailed billing.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method that do not require the end user to login to a website to use the system.","A further object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method that do not require a cooperative recipient.","Another object of the present invention is, in one aspect, to provide a certified email system and method that automate the process of verifying whether a time-stamp receipt is valid for a given file.","An additional object of the present invention is to provide a certified email system and method providing users with a multi-party archiving and content management system incorporating convenient time-stamping of documents and emails.","These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the attached drawings and from the detailed description of the preferred embodiments, which follow.","Like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views of the drawings.","Shown throughout the figures, the present invention is directed toward an efficient, user-friendly certified email system and method that provide a time stamp or electronic postmark for presented files from any file presenter. Particularly, the presented file may be an email from a sender presented via a simple-to-use interface. Optionally and additionally, the presented file may be presented by a user of the integrated user\/participant console. The certified email system receives the presented file, prepares the presented file for time-stamping, obtains the time stamp, archives the time stamp and a variety of optional time-stamp-related data, and provides convenient access, control, searching, and reporting to both administrators and users of the system.","Preferably, the certified email system comprises a demanding party and a web services time-stamp conduit (WSTC), but other architectures are within the scope of the invention. Preferably, the demanding party receives the email and prepares the email for transmission to the WSTC. The WSTC is configured to serve the demanding party (or multiple demanding parties) as a convenient conduit to one or more providing parties, such as one or more Time Stamp Authorities and\/or third-party archiving services. Thus, both the demanding party interface provided to the user and the WSTC interface provided to the demanding parties are configured for ease of use and access.","While the certified email system and method of the present invention may be profitably used by an individual, the present invention is generally discussed herein as applied to a company, an organization, firm, or other business entity, which may have multiple users and may allow multiple participants to collaborate with the company users through use of a provided content management system. This is done to illustrate the system in its fullest functionality; however, other users may use only a portion of the services and functions available, which is also within the scope of the invention. Therefore, for example, though charges for time stamps or other providing party services are generally herein discussed as charged to a \u201ccorporate account\u201d and the administrative console is referred to as a \u201ccorporate administrative console,\u201d an individual or home business owner may equally well use the corporate account for billing and the corporate administration console to manage provided services.","Also, while the certified email system and method of the present invention is frequently described herein with reference to a law or accounting firm, this is not intended to limit the invention to a particular vertical market or even to anything that could be called a \u201cmarket.\u201d Rather, the present invention is intended to serve the purposes of any user of email, individually or as part of an organization.","The certified email system and method works with any email client or service (running on any computing device)\u2014without requiring the sender or recipient to login to a website to use the system, without requiring the sender or recipient to install software or an email client plug-in, and without requiring a cooperative recipient. Further, no changes are required to the corporate mail server or the client mail server.","The certified email system and method provide convenient web-based administration for users to manage various aspects of the time-stamping functions; provide a multi-party archiving and content management system incorporating convenient time-stamping of documents and emails (allowing complete transparency in negotiations, mediations, consultations, discussions, etc.); allow for integrated detailed billing, including pass-through client\/project billing for the convenience of the company, which can conveniently bill a client for time stamps used and\/or services rendered; provide effective searches of data registries that include archived certified email and other project-correlated data; and provide convenient web-based automated verification services. The certified email system and method provide a guarantee of data integrity (confirmation that the data have not been tampered with), non-repudiation (confirmation that the email transmission took place), and a secure verifiable time stamp (a guarantee that the email transmission took place at a specific time).","While the certified email system allows documents of any type to be time-stamped, it is particularly focused on email processing. However, as the email is presented in a digital file format, much of the functionality is equally applicable to files of other digital file format types (for example, WMV, JPEG, WAV, MP3, PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, etc.). Also, while the certified email system is particularly directed to using a coded email address within a user's regular email client or service, much of the certified email system functionality is applicable to time-stamping requests made at a web console, such as may be desired when using the provided multi-party archiving and content management system integrated into the system.","Referring to , an overview of the time stamp function of the certified email system is presented. The certified email system utilizes a demanding party (DP) , and a web services time-stamp conduit (WSTC) ; as illustrated, optionally more than one demanding party (, , etc.) may run on a single WSTC .","The demanding party  is designed for general use to provide time-stamping, registry, database, archiving, customer account administration, and firm\/corporate administration functionality. The demanding party  can comprise multiple adaptations, interfaces, servers, and front ends for different vertical markets, customized to the requirements of the demanding party operator. The architecture within the demanding party  can also vary, with an exemplary architecture described below in .","The WSTC  is designed to receive requests for services  (with associated prepared conduit-input data , ) from the demanding party, and to process them on its own or with one or more third-party providing parties (particularly Time Stamp Authorities [TSA-, TSA-] , but, optionally, other providing parties [PP-, PP-] , ). The WSTC  prepares and executes requests as per the required methods of the providing third party. In this way, with the WSTC  serving as the manager and translator of service requests, this functionality is offloaded from the web-based application(s) of the demanding party . Thus, the WSTC  provides a robust conduit that the demanding parties  can use to access the providing parties , , . This modular architecture is scalable and flexible.","Therefore, setting up a demanding party  is simplified to merely writing an interface to the WSTC without the need to create custom interfaces to the one or more providing parties , ,  offered by the WSTC. Thus, the creation of the different adaptations and front ends for different vertical markets is facilitated, with the ability to easily incorporate reliable trusted time-stamping (and, optionally, archiving and other services) provided by the WSTC. In addition, the WSTC preferably consolidates the transactions of many demanding parties  and, therefore, benefits from economies of scale, including lower per transaction costs, lowering costs to users and to their clients.","The time stamp function of the certified email system is generally initiated by an email message  from a sender computing device . The receipt by the demanding party  of the email  addressed to the demanding-party electronic-delivery address (referred to herein as the TCC: Address) serves to solicit the obtaining of a time stamp and the charging of the cost of the time stamp to the user's account. The demanding party  is coupled via a wide area network (typically the Internet) to a plurality of sender computing devices  and receiver computing devices . The email message  is addressed to at least one recipient electronic-delivery address (generally using the \u201cTO: Address\u201d field ) and is transmitted to the recipient computing device(s) ; the email message  is also addressed to the TCC: Address (generally using the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d field ) and transmitted to the demanding party ; and the email message  may be further addressed to, and further transmitted directly to, any optional carbon copy recipient computing device(s) (using the \u201cCC: Address\u201d field  or \u201cBCC Address\u201d field [not shown]). Thus the email  is transmitted directly to the recipient computing device(s)  without passing through servers of the demanding party , with the copy of email  (addressed to the demanding-party electronic-delivery address) received by the demanding party  serving as a solicitation to obtain a time stamp for the email . The coded demanding-party electronic-delivery address may contain one or more IDENTIFIERS (such as name value pairs) associable with billing information and usable for reporting categories of usage (such as project, client, company, etc.).","The demanding party  is configured to receive the email message  and to use the email message  to prepare the file for passing  to the WSTC as conduit-input data  () with a time-stamp request call . As shown in , the demanding party  is further configured to transmit a notification , ,  to the sender computing device  and (optionally) to transmit a notification (or ) to the recipient computing device  to alert the recipient  of the certification of the email.","The WSTC  is configured to accept from a demanding party  one time-stamp request call  for a presented file or redundant time-stamp request calls  for a presented file; configured to act upon the time-stamp request call(s); configured to output  the time stamp(s) to the demanding party ; configured to receive and act upon other service calls (), and, optionally, configured to provide other value-added services (either locally by the WSTC or by a third party , ), such as archiving services.","Not only does a single web services time-stamp conduit (WSTC)  provide a convenient, efficient conduit to one or more third-party Time Stamp Authorities , it may also, itself, serve as a Time Stamp Authority. Consequently, acting upon the time-stamp request call(s) may comprise transmitting  a time-stamp request to a TSA  and receiving  the time-stamp back from the TSA  and\/or may comprise time-stamping the file within the WSTC . Thus, redundant time-stamp calls may or may not include the WSTC  itself as a TSA.","The Time Stamp Authority (TSA)  provides trusted proof of content integrity as of a specific point in time, so it can be used to verify the authenticity of the file. Particularly, the certified email system is designed to efficiently utilize the legally enforceable time-stamping and digital signature verification solution from the United States Postal Service (USPS) to establish evidence of digital files, but will also integrate with UPU (Universal Postal Union) compliant post mark services of many Post Offices, or other time-stamp providers. The USPS offers an electronic postmark (EPM\u00ae), which is an auditable time-and-date stamp service.","The sender computing device  and the recipient computing device  may be any desired computing device capable of sending and receiving email, such as, for example, a BlackBerry , an iPhone, a desktop , a laptop , etc. using any operating system (such as, for example, Windows\u00ae, Mac OS\u00ae, Linux\u00ae, etc.). The sender computing device  and the recipient computing device  may send or receive email through any desired email service or client (such as, for example, Microsoft Outlook\u00ae, Yahoo\u00ae, Gmail\u00ae, Lotus\u00ae, Microsoft Exchange\u00ae, or other Mail User Agents [MUA]). As is conventional, mail sent via a MUA of the sender computing device  is generally transmitted through multiple Mail Transfer Agents (MTA) before receipt by the MUA of the recipient computing device .","As illustrated, a single computing device , can function in one email message transmission as a sender computing device (sending email to recipients and ) and in another email message transmission as a recipient computing device (receiving email from sender ), using the same demanding party (not shown) or different demanding parties , , as illustrated. Particularly if the sender computing device and the sender\/recipient computing device , are participants in a project as described below, numerous time-stamped emails may be transmitted between them, all being passed to a single demanding party for time-stamping (not shown).","A variety of customizations, options, reports, settings, and management tools\u2014as well as searching utilities and the multi-party archiving and content management system\u2014are accessible via the corporate administrative console (). End user and participant tools and settings are available via the user\/participant console (). Other administrative tools also presented include the demanding party administrative dashboard  () and the WSTC administrative dashboard  ().","Referring to the more detailed view of  and , to send a certified email (generally after an account has been created and a method of payment chosen), the sender  composes the email message  (and attaches any desired attachments) using any desired email client or service. The sender  addresses the email  to the recipient(s)  and to the demanding party  and to any carbon copy recipient(s) . The coded demanding-party electronic-delivery address (TCC: Address), usually in the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d line , may read, for example, \u201c[Identifier]@tccmail.com\u201d where the local part of the email address, \u201c[Identifier],\u201d is billing-associable identifying information (associable with the sender  seeking certification or associable with the recipient(s) ), and where the domain-part of the email address, \u201ctccmail.com,\u201d directs the BCC: copy of the transmission to the demanding party . (While the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d field  is typically used to send the email  to the demanding party , and will be referred to herein, using the \u201cTO: Address\u201d field  or the \u201cCC: Address\u201d field  to send the email  to the demanding party  is within the scope of the invention.) The complete email  (including any attachments) is then sent as usual, with the email message  delivered to the recipient computing device  (or to multiple recipient computing devices), delivered to the demanding party  (using the TCC: Address, generally via the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d field ), delivered to any other BCC: recipients (not shown), and delivered to any CC: recipient computing device(s) (using the \u201cCC: Address\u201d field ).","After the demanding party  receives the incoming email message  (including email body, email addresses, and any attachments, and transmission data [added by MTA or MUA]) from sender computing device , it parses  the TCC: Address ([Identifier]@tccmail.com) and email-transmission data (for example, the address fields of the sent email [\u201cTO: Address\u201d  [recipient address], the \u201cFROM: Address\u201d], the header, the IP address of the sender, etc.). The data derived from the TCC: Address and the email-transmission data (and, at times, manual cataloging association) comprise billing-associable details, which are associable with, and usable for, billing, reporting, cataloging, and\/or archiving purposes. Addressing schemes and derivation of associations are discussed in more detail later (in ). The parsed billing-associable details may be archived  in database . The complete unparsed email may also be archived.","Based on parsing  of the TCC: Address or the email-transmission data, the demanding party  identifies the user. When using some addressing schemes, the username, firm, client, and\/or project are identified  directly  from the parsing of the TCC: Address. Using other addressing schemes, the username, firm, client, and\/or project are identified indirectly  by consulting the database . If the username, firm, client, and\/or project are not  fully identifiable from the parsing  and are not fully identifiable by consulting the database , manual categorization or cataloging  can be performed by accessing the administration console (). Once sufficient billing-associable details have been determined for identification, the appropriate corporate billing account is billed  () with the billing cost preferably associated and catalogued to the company's client and\/or project. If a client and\/or project are identified by the TCC: Address, but are not already pre-defined as associated with the user, they may be created in the database .","The demanding party  prepares  the email  for transmission  to the web services time-stamp conduit (WSTC) as conduit-input data  (). If needed and desired, the demanding party  can convert files to a standard format. Preferably, the demanding party  uses a hash algorithm  to obtain a HASH value derived from the email or file, encodes the HASH with a conventional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) signing algorithm  using its private key , and archives  the digitally signed email or file.","The demanding party  may further archive any or all of a variety of data, such as, for example, filing  the time-stamp request to the WSTC, filing  the obtained time stamp, filing  parsed billing-associable details, filing the HASH value, archiving the original received email (including the email body, any attachments, recipient and sender electronic-delivery addresses, and\/or email-transmission data) and\/or archiving  the digitally signed email or file. Additionally, the demanding party  preferably provides a web presentation interface to users.","After preparing the conduit-input data  the demanding party  makes a time-stamp request call  to the WSTC  and transmits  the conduit-input data  (preferably the original email  and the digitally signed HASH and, optionally, a copy of the public key).","Referring now to , the WSTC  is illustrated. In overview, the WSTC preferably verifies  the conduit-input data , requests  and receives  a time stamp from one or more Time Stamp Authorities , may optionally archive  data, and outputs  the obtained time stamp  to the requesting demanding party . Both transmission  to the WSTC and transmission  back from the WSTC to the demanding party are preferably, but optionally, performed using secure web services .","The WSTC performs cross-checks of the conduit-input data , when possible. Although preferably the digital file and the signed HASH are provided  to the WSTC as conduit-input data  from the demanding party  (to allow cross-checking), other file-type combinations (e.g., signed HASH , HASH and signed HASH , file and HASH , file , HASH ) can be accepted. Thus, the WSTC provides a versatile, flexible interface for various demanding parties  with various requirements or limitations. As illustrated in , the processes performed by the WSTC are dependent upon the file types to that are passed to the WSTC. For example, if an unsigned file (, , ) is passed to the WSTC, the WSTC signs (, , ) the file; or if an unhashed file () is presented, the WSTC hashes  the file and then signs it ","Most preferably, the file and the signed HASH are passed via the WSTC secure web service's application programming interface (API) , the signed HASH and file are verified , and they are transmitted  to the time stamp authority . (Optionally, the WSTC  may itself serve as a time stamp authority.) The WSTC then receives  the postmark receipt from the time stamp authority . For example, if the time stamp authority used is the USPS, the EPM\u00ae receipt contains the following: (1) a unique time-stamp identifier; (2) the file signature HASH; (3) the obtained secure time stamp; (4) a digital certificate; and (5) a copy of the file signature received by the TSA from the WSTC.","If the time-stamp service is not available at the time of the transaction, the WSTC places the transaction in a batch to be processed on a first-in, first-out basis when the service becomes available again; in this case a temporary informational receipt (provided by the WSTC) is provided to the demanding party  (and possibly passed on to its customer, user\/sender ) along with status updates until a follow-up notification may be received confirming the successful completion of the postmark and triggering an update of the registry logs  ().","The WSTC then preferably verifies the received postmark receipt (e.g., EPM\u00ae) from the time stamp authority. The WSTC may perform other services, such as archiving  the received conduit-input data  and postmark  data in database  and\/or a third-party data storage facility . Optionally, the WSTC may archive particular sets or subsets of the data  and postmark  data in database  or third-party data storage facility . Thus, redundant archiving is optionally provided, within the system itself and\/or by utilizing a third-party storage facility , for example, redundancy may be by means of mirrored discs, database writes streamed to a remote system, regular backups, or utilizing both archiving in database  of the demanding party and archiving in database  of the WSTC or third-party data storage facility . The extent and degree of redundancy is customizable by the operators of the WSTC and of the demanding party and, to a lesser extent, by the firm or corporate administrator.","The WSTC then transmits  the received postmark  (including the secure time stamp and any other associated data, such as, for example, a unique time-stamp identifier; the file signature; the file signature HASH; and a digital certificate) back to the demanding party  ().","The demanding party  then optionally notifies , () the email recipient(s) , of the obtained time stamp; and additionally notifies C or  sender . As illustrated in , the notification email , in addition to containing the postmark , may optionally include other components, such as, for instance, informational, branding, or advertising components. For example, the notification email  may include a link to verify the time stamp , one or more logos  (such as the demanding party logo or branded front end logo and the USPS logo), a demanding party signature , marketing directed toward the encouragement of the viral spread of the service , the original email as an attachment or as a link , original attachment(s) as an attachment or as a link , and\/or information on time-stamping . The components of the notification email  may be configured  by changing configuration settings available in the corporate administrative console  ().","In one aspect of the invention, the demanding party  may directly notify  the email sender of the receipt of the time stamp, without notification to the recipient  or the CC: recipient ","In another aspect of the invention, the demanding party  may attempt to verify receipt of the notification email  (either the notification email to the recipient  or the notification email to the CC: recipient ) by delivery-apprising methods. For example, one or more of the following delivery-apprising methods may be used: establishing communication with the mail server associated with the recipient computing device  so as to attempt to use Delivery Status Notification (DSN) functionality; tracking the notification email  to determine a final delivery status by reviewing the exchange between MTAs; requesting a Mail User Agent (email client) \u201creading\u201d notification; or if the receiving party's MTA supports the functionality, recognizing the MTA's delivery confirmation receipt. These delivery-apprising methods may be used in a complementary fashion.","Another means to verify the receipt of an email includes embedding a tracking graphic (such as a transparent gif or logo image) that is called when an email is opened while the reader is connected to the Internet. When the sent email is opened by the recipient connected to the Internet, the tracking graphic is downloaded and parameters such as an \u201cemail ID code\u201d are sent to the server of the demanding party  thereby providing proof that the email was indeed opened in an MUA. It should be noted that even if the graphic has not been downloaded, it does not prove that the email has not been opened; this is because the user may not have been connected (or was having trouble) with the Internet at the time the email was opened, or the user's MUA may be configured not to download graphics by default.","Also, optionally, receipt of the notification email  may be verified by explicitly asking the recipient to follow a confirmation click-through link that the demanding party  includes in the notification email . The recipient can review the actual email by following the click-through link. The act of accessing the email would be proof of receipt and opening. The recipient can then choose to have the email sent to his regular email inbox. A further option is to send the originally sent email in the notification email , but to additionally provide a click-through link for confirmation. In either instance, the recipient could be encouraged to follow the click-through link through separate verbal or email messages from the sender, for instance saying, \u201cI will continue to work with you only after you have confirmed receipt of the notification email  by following the click-through link provided.\u201d","Additionally and optionally, receipt of an email (or document) can be verified by the downloading of a file (time-stamped email or document) from the user\/participant registry. When a participant downloads a file from the registry, the downloading is recorded, preferably in the registry itself. Thus, a participant can be sent an email (generally by the demanding party) with instructions on retrieving the file from the registry; whereupon, by logging into the registry, the participant retrieves the file, with positive confirmation of receipt. This functionality would preferably be enabled by the administrator via the administrative control panel.","If the notification email , is not deliverable , , that may indicate that the original email  may, also, not have been deliverable\u2014for example, the allotted storage for email may have been reached or the email address is invalid, resulting in the original email and the email notification being undeliverable, or \u201cbouncing.\u201d Thus, the demanding party  preferably positively informs  the sender  of the receipt of the notification email  or negatively informs  the sender of the non-receipt , of the notification email . Optionally, the positive receipt emails  and\/or negative receipt emails  may be grouped and sent as a collection at the end of a time period, for example, at the end of a week; the advantage of the collection is a reduction in the number of emails received by the sender . As an additional option, the positive receipt emails  and\/or negative receipt emails  may be addressed to the sender's delegated assistant or may be redundantly addressed to the sender and to the delegated assistant, as desired. These options could be set within the tools of the corporate administrative console  ().","A variety of other types of other calls () and other conduit time-stamp input data can also be transmitted to the WSTC.","TCC: Addressing Schemes","Referring now to , various exemplary addressing schemes are presented to be used with the email parsing  function of the certified email system and method of the present invention. The addressing schemes allow determination of billing-associable details (for use with billing, cataloging, and content management) based on one or more of the following: (1) one or multiple IDENTIFIERS (IDENTIFIERS@TCCmail.com) coded in the local part (before the @ sign) of the demanding-party electronic-delivery address (TCC: Address); (2) email-transmission data derived from the \u201cTO: Address,\u201d the \u201cFROM: Address,\u201d the \u201cCC: Address,\u201d the email header, sender's IP address, and\/or transmission data; and\/or (3) manual cataloging. Choosing the particular addressing scheme for use can be based on the level of security, the desire for automated billing and filing versus manual cataloging, learning curve considerations, and convenience of use.","The IDENTIFIERS may be derived from username and TCC: Address password authentication (to avoid spoofing) and\/or codes for individual projects, clients, company name, and employee ID's or usernames, as required to obtain the billing-associable details for the particular desired detailed billing. In one aspect, simple and easy-to-use pass-through billing is enabled, such as is required by end users in certain types of businesses where the cost for services is billed to the user's client for a particular project, such as law or accounting firms.","After the user has established an account (or has had an account established for him) with the operator of the demanding server, the user is issued (or chooses) a username and account password. Preferably, for convenience of administration, the username is unique within the demanding server . For this reason, account username is typically the user's email address; a different username can be selected for identification in the TCC: Address, if necessary.","The billing-associable details may be determined by using one of the multiple presented email addressing schemes to determine the specific address to be used for the TCC: Address. Five exemplary addressing schemes are presented in , specified by way of example, and not by way of limitation. Significantly, the verbiage or codes used in the email prefix may be determined by the user in accordance with the user's own identification and cataloguing purposes. Thus, some users may not need or want to specify projects, clients or employees, some users may want to add a TCC: Address password, or users may choose to use numeric or alphanumeric IDENTIFIERS or purely alphabetic IDENTIFIERS, etc.","Significantly, also, the use of the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d field  for email  directed to the demanding server  is not mandatory, but may be employed to prevent identifying information from being conveyed to email recipients (such as client names, project names, and TCC: Address password). Where this is not a concern, another address field may be employed. Where it is a concern, the novel email certification system may, as an option, filter out the particular user's TCC: Address in the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d field  before time-stamping it to protect the confidential information contained in the TCC: Address. Optionally, if the end user desires an extra measure of security, with any of the addressing schemes not already including an address password, a TCC: Address password may be included in the TCC: Address. This TCC: Address password allows the demanding server  to verify the end user's identity, before the solicitation to obtain a time stamp by receipt of the email (addressed to the TCC: Address) and before authorizing the demanding server to charge the time stamp to the end user's account is carried out. Optionally, if a TCC: Address password is inadvertently typed into the \u201cCC: Address\u201d and so becomes known, the demanding server  can send an email to notify the sender , who may choose to change his address password by logging into his web-based account with his account user name and account password.","Further, in some situations it may be desirable to include the TCC: Address in the \u201cCC: Address\u201d field or \u201cTO: Address\u201d field, even though billing is based on the TCC: Address (which is usually entered into the \u201cBCC: Address\u201d field). For example, this might be desirable in the situation in which the sender  wants the recipient(s)  to include the sender's TCC: Address in correspondence, such as by using \u201cReply to All,\u201d so that the full email exchange is certified by the email certification system of the present invention.","To facilitate this certification of a full email exchange, optional subsidized certified reply functionality can be provided. The subsidized certified reply enables the sender  to allow the recipient  to send a certified response that is billed to the sender ; thus the email sender incurs the charge for the response-email time stamp obtained for the email reply of the recipient(s). An offer allowing the recipient(s)  (and, optionally, CC: recipient(s) ) to reply using this subsidized certified reply option can be extended  () in the certified email notification . This is allowable even if the recipient  is not a registered user of the certified email system, or if the recipient  is registered with a different demanding server  than the sender , or even if the recipient  is registered with the same demanding server . This subsidized certified reply option would preferably not be a default option, but would be configurable via the configuration settings in the corporate administrative console  () as one of the user and participant privileges and\/or parameters .","A simplified way to subsidize response-email time stamps is to create a TCC: Address prefix that is only good for a few response-email time stamps and insert this address on the CC:Address line of the email. By asking the recipient to \u201creply to all,\u201d a new user would in essence be time-stamping his or her response and utilizing one of the limited-quantity response-email time stamps associated with the temporary TCC: Address prefix.","Referring to , the first example of an email addressing scheme is the name value pair addressing scheme. In this example, the full TCC: Address is exemplified by Proj158.Clnt103.PW001.Emp001.Firm123@TCCmail.com (). The first entity is \u201cFirm123,\u201d in which the firm name is associated with the value of 123 to identify the firm. Similarly, the employee (or Username) is identified as employee , the TCC: Address password is identified as , the client is identified as client , and the project is identified as project . The particular example shown is only one option. For example, P158.C103.W001.E001.F123@TCCmail.com is associable to identical values. Note that codes do not have to be numeric and field names do not have to be as presented; conformity standard will be dictated by the market, language, personal preferences, etc.","The advantage to coding the email address with name value pairs such as these is that a user can easily become familiar with the mechanism and thereby immediately recognize if a TCC: Address email address is correct and be able to generate such codes himself. An additional advantage is that provision is made to specify a wide range of billing-associable details for the particular detailed billing desired, so maximum flexibility is achieved. Although the delimiter is presented herein as \u201c.\u201d, other delimiters are usable and are within the scope of the invention. Further and optionally, if the width of the entities is set, no delimiter would be required.","However, in order to ensure correct parsing of fields irrespective of their order, the name value pair scheme presented results in a long address, which may not be desirable to all users, such as users of popular mobile computing devices with small keyboards or users with difficulty typing. Fixing the order would only allow for a slightly shorter prefix. Most email clients provide some form of \u201cauto-discovery\u201d of recently used email addresses, therefore once a TCC: Address prefix has been used even once, there is good chance it will be auto-discovered and auto-completed when the user starts to type it.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":"310"},"If usernames can be uniquely distributed across the demanding server , then Firm  can be removed as a parameter. Then, Username  (employee name) can be removed if the \u201cTO: Address\u201d or the \u201cFROM: Address\u201d can be accepted as, or associated with, the Username. If reasonable security is acceptable, TCC: Address password  can be removed as a parameter if the IP(s) in the user's identity profile is consistent with the IP(s) of his mail server(s) and\/or the IP(s) of his device . (Optionally, the TCC: Address password can be appended to the end of Proj158, as in Project158.PW313@TCCmail.com; thus shortening and simplifying the TCC: Address, yet providing an extra measure of security.) Optionally, Client  can be removed if Project  is unique to the Firm and if manual association or registration is set up using the administration tools accessed by the firm or corporate administrative console .","Using the derived addressing scheme of addressing, by default, the certification of the received email  would not be initiated unless the firm, username (employee), TCC: Address password, and client could be derived or removed as a required parameter. If an email  is received in which the parameters cannot be derived or removed, a return email to the sender expressing the problem can be sent. Alternatively, if so configured for the user, the TCC: Address prefix can be used to dynamically create a new client (folder) and\/or project if they do not already exist. New client folders and\/or projects can be in a pending state awaiting acceptance (which would be desirable in case the user made an error entering the TCC: Address prefix); emails in a pending project may be moved to another project.","If the sender  desires to allow a subsidized certified reply offer to be extended, this can be enabled  () in the corporate administrative console , as preferably the default is to not allow subsidized recipient certified replies. Preferably at least one of the addresses in the \u201cTO: Address\u201d field or the \u201cCC: Address\u201d field would be registered to allow association of the subsidized certified reply with the user's account. Otherwise, the subsidized certified reply would not be processed unless the recipient  was also registered to use the certified email system.

Without limitations on users, the code needs to be longer (e.g., 29fds2swdf@TCCmail.com) to be able to distinguish it across the demanding party  (and their firms or companies) and to avoid accidental or fraudulent access attempts. When the demanding party  receives an email to this address, it uses the pseudo-random IDENTIFIER prefix as a key to look up the required fields. The code is preferably generated such that it never includes vowels, ensuring no derogatory terms are spelled in the pseudo random code and no confusion occurs between letters I,O and the numbers 1,0. Optionally, the company administrator can have the pseudo-random IDENTIFIER code sent to an end user via email using the tools of the corporate administrative console  or the end user can access the code via the code generation tool  of the user\/participant console .

Unlike the ad-hoc solution discussed above, the TCC: Address does not change to identify different projects or clients. On the other hand, like the ad-hoc solution, this would require manual cataloging  (, ) using the corporate administrative console  tools to identify the project or client using the addresses and content of the email. In addition to placing the email  in the right project registry, identifying and cataloguing using the administration tool provides a means to allocate billing charges to the right client project (if necessary). Optionally, a TCC: Address password can be included in the simple corporate addressing scheme TCC: Address.","Content Management","In another aspect of the current invention, a convenient, user-friendly, multi-party archiving and content management system is integrated with signing and time-stamping functions to provide confirmation of data integrity.

These two verification utilities  are in addition to, and complementary to, the time stamp verification provided in the user\/participant console  () and in the corporate administrative console  (). These two web-based automated verification utilities  provide functionality to compare and to attempt to verify a challenge file  (which may be a file or an email with any attachments that is believed to be previously time stamped) with a time stamp, whether or not the challenge file originated from interaction with the demanding party . The two easy-to-use verification utilities comprise a Content-Proof Verifying Tool and a Verify HASH Tool. Although the verification utilities  can independently verify challenge files, some verification methods rely on information in one or more archives , such as the database(s)  of the demanding party  or database(s)  of the WSTC  or other postmarking or time-stamping archives.","The Content-Proof Verifying Tool conveniently verifies particular email elements (such as the content or the attachments) of the challenge file. The Verify HASH Tool conveniently verifies whether a time-stamp receipt is valid for a given challenge file. Optionally, the verification tool  can additionally be configured to do digital signing, digital signing verification, encryption, decryption and hashing.","The registry entry for a time stamp ,  () can be expanded to view details such as postmark receipt data including the File Signature HASH  () of the email (or file), the File HASH ( () or  []) of the email (or file), the postmark date, and the time stamp authority tracking number. Also accessible via links are the file signature and TSA signed time stamp contained in the postmark  (). This same information may be sent in the notification receipt  () to the email recipient and\/or sent in the informing email announcement  (or ) to the sender  (informing him of the completion of the time stamp and possibly the receipt of the notification email ) and\/or uploaded to the registry  () and viewable in the registry log  display of the User Console  ().","The postmark  receipt data from the TSA is sufficient to confirm the time stamp's validity without further third-party involvement; a detailed description of this process is preferably available upon request and may be included on the demanding party's FAQ. Unfortunately, the process is not easy for the average user to execute.","In addition, when using email files, the process may not work. The original email cannot be used for direct HASH comparison, although the end user may not appreciate this fact. The sender  may have an email he created as a text document , such as in Microsoft Word\u00ae, then sent with his computing device's email client or service  and now is found in the \u201csent folder\u201d of his email client . But if a hashing  algorithm is used to produce a regenerated HASH value  (either from the email client  \u201csent folder\u201d or from the original content ) this regenerated HASH value  will not match the File Hash that was signed by the demanding party  (using its hashing and signing engine , ) and used by the TSA  to generate the File Signature HASH  of the email  (although the textual content is identical), due to the changes to the email header information during transport; therefore, the regenerated HASH value  of the email in the \u201csent folder\u201d of the email client  will not match the File HASH (the HASH produced by, and preferably signed by, the demanding party  and then sent to the WSTC  and on to the TSA ) of the email received by the demanding party  or the File HASH (using the same algorithm ) of the email received by the recipient . As such, the File Signature HASH  generated by the TSA  will not correspond  to either regenerated HASH , ","The Content-Proof Verifying Utility will provide users with the ability to verify the content  of a file or email with its attachments after it was sent. (This functionality is separate from, and in addition to, the verification described above in block  of , which provides verification of the end user's time stamp with the file that is stored on the demanding party server.)","A user presents a challenge file  to the Content-Proof Verifying Utility. The Content-Proof Verifying Utility will allow a user to drag and drop a sent email (purportedly a previously-time-stamped email) from his \u201csent items\u201d directory of email client  or document content  accessible to the user's computing device into an indicated area in an operable drag-and-drop utility (a \u201cbucket\u201d) on the Content-Proof Verifying Utility. Alternatively, the user can browse for a file and upload said file via an upload utility, or, optionally, an end user may even paste the file contents into a prompt. In yet a further alternative, a user may forward a verification-request email requesting verification to the trusted carbon copy provider, e.g., verify@tccmail.com established for the purpose of providing this utility, with the result being emailed to the requester's \u201creply\u201d email address.","In an effort to make the verification very simple, the Content-Proof Verifying Utility will provide a feature that will compare files and provide a positive content verification (\u201cContent Verification Passed\u201d) or negative content verification (\u201cContent Verification Failed\u201d) response to the user. Substantially, the Content-Proof Verifying Utility will compare the file provided with a copy of the file that is stored in archive , such as on the demanding party servers. The inconsistencies that may exist between a file stored on a user computing device and the time-stamped copy on the demanding party servers will, if from the same source, consist of email header information; thus the Content-Proof Verifying Utility will not decline a positive verification if the content alone is identical.","To demonstrate that the File Signature HASH  of the email file received by the demanding party  corresponds to the regenerated HASH value  (of the \u201csent items\u201d email file  of the sender, of the regenerated HASH value  of the \u201cinbox\u201d email file of the recipient, or of the content  of the sent email stored elsewhere on the user's computer) the Content-Proof Verifying Utility proves the content of the document, file, \u201csent items\u201d email, or \u201cinbox\u201d email is contained in the time-stamped email and that no additional content exists therein and that content is not missing (thus meaning that the content has not been changed). Submitting the challenge file (document, content, \u201csent items\u201d email, or \u201cinbox\u201d email) to the Content-Proof Verifying Utility results in the files being compared  and the exact differences between the time-stamped file and the challenge file delineated. The content-verification result is preferably one of the following forms: \u201ccomplete match,\u201d \u201cbody and attachments match,\u201d \u201cbody only match,\u201d \u201cattachment only match,\u201d or \u201cno match.\u201d Details may be presented if the user selects \u201cdetails.\u201d In the case of the body and header, the details will present the specific content that has been added to or is missing from the submitted challenge file. To ensure credibility, the time stamp of the original file is verified.","An additional option to assist end users in verification is to provide a copy of the actual file that was time-stamped which, by definition, would have a matching HASH. This could be provided, preferably through a link or as an email attachment, in the notification email  to the recipient and\/or the informing email announcement ,  to the sender . Also, the registry provides access to a copy of the email file (block , ) that was time-stamped and by definition could be hashed to produce the matching HASH. This HASH would correspond with (but not match) the File Signature HASH .","The Verify HASH Tool is a potentially independent service option that automates the verification process whereby anybody can verify whether a time-stamp receipt is valid for a given file or email and its attachments.","In one application, a user would have the ability to verify if the regenerated HASH value  of a file matches the one contained in the file signature corresponding to a valid time-stamped receipt, the stored File HASH generated using the hashing algorithm  (, ), that may potentially be stored on the demanding party server archives . This need might arise if the File HASH of a file has been lost or disassociated from the file. The user can login to his account on the demanding party  and drag and drop a file into the Verify HASH Tool \u201cbucket\u201d or browse for the file. The resulting regenerated HASH value  can be presented, and the demanding party's database archives  can be searched for any matches among stored File HASH Values. (For privacy reasons this search may be limited to the customer's time stamps). Alternatively, the File HASH may be provided directly; the File HASH can come from any source including earlier storage and publicly available tools applied to a file. If a match is found, the corresponding stored time-stamp receipt is validated. This is an absolute verification of the digital signature and time-stamp information; thus, the \u201cContent Verification Passed\u201d return would only be provided if the file comparison is 100% identical. If a matching stored File HASH belonging to the user is not found on the demanding party's servers, then the user can (if the service is enabled) optionally submit a time-stamp receipt obtained through any means to test against. The Verify HASH Tool can be configured to accept time-stamp receipts of other providers. As the Verify HASH Tool can perform hashes of any file, optionally, a single file or multiple files can be submitted and their HASHs compared.","Therefore, the present invention provides web-based straightforward verification utilities  that automate the verification process. With these verification tools , end users can easily verify whether a time-stamp receipt is valid for a given file (if the time stamp was originally received from the demanding party  or even if the time stamp was received from a third-party provider). A single destination for independent Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) verification is highly advantageous to the average end user.","Simple Search Capability","The Simple Search Capability will provide users with the ability to do simple keyword searches inside of the user\/participant console  () registry. The Simple Search Capability will at least provide users with a list of all entries that include the keyword that has been searched. Other enhanced search engine capabilities can optionally be provided, such as filters and a variety of styles of search query syntax and ranking results from Probabilistic, Boolean or other search logic.","From within the registry, users may wish to search as they do from within an application such as Microsoft Outlook\u00ae. They can search the current open project, the current open folder, the current open folder and subfolders, all folders, and\/or a selection of folders. The results of a project search would be preferably presented by highlighting (or filtering to) compliant entries in the registry. Matching text itself is preferably further highlighted.","The folder tree address, along with a section of the line of text that contains the searched-for text, is preferably provided as a search result. Clicking on the folder tree address opens that project and presents the result as if the project was searched for the text. Preferably forward and backward navigation is provided.","Further advanced search options, allowing for expansion or restriction of search criteria, are optionally provided. For example, the Simple Search Capability of the present invention can be configured to search based on any or all of the following: include (attachment or uploaded) file types whose content may searched; limit the date range; exclude registry notes; restrict registry entries to selected types; search only folder names; restrict registry entries to specific participant(s) or system; display first found, only most recent or oldest entry; included in email body content; included in specific email field (\u201cTO: Address,\u201d \u201cFROM: Address,\u201d subject field, etc.).","With more elaborate search capabilities, a more sophisticated search engine, indexing, ranking and storage solution are provided.","Further, all the reporting tools support advanced search such that all fields may be filtered using wildcard notation or ranges (as is appropriate with dates for example). A search result may be refined to narrow a result set further, may be sorted by any field (ascending or descending), and may be exported to a CSV file.","Firm or Corporate Purchase Methods","Referring now to , from within the corporate administrative console  () the corporate administrator may select from available payment schemes or methods  () that are offered by the demanding party . A first exemplary purchase method is the credit block purchase method  and a second exemplary purchase method is the pay-as-you-go purchase method . Each method has advantages.","When using either method a firm or company will decide whether it will purchase credits on behalf of its employee accounts or if employees will be responsible for purchasing credits for themselves.","In the credit block purchase method , a quantity of credits (generally having an expiration date) are purchased  () in a block, with the associated price per credit based on the quantity purchased; a larger purchase can result in a lower price per credit (either credits for time stamps or for other providing party services).","The pay-as-you-go purchase method  comprises three types of purchase plans: an individual ongoing purchase plan , a prepaid declining balance purchase plan , and a threshold  purchase plan. In the pay-as-you-go purchase method , preferably a credit card is kept on file. Optionally, but less preferably, the company or customer using the pay-as-you-go payment method could be invoiced.","In the individual ongoing purchase plan , each credit is potentially charged as the time stamp is used. The individual ongoing  charging system would generate numerous small charges, which might not be desirable for some companies or customers.","A pay-as-you-go threshold  purchase option allows for charging when a threshold of credits is reached (in the special ongoing  case the threshold of credits is 1). Thus, the numerous small charges associated with the individual ongoing purchase plan  are effectively consolidated and charged when the threshold is reached. If the threshold is not met in a certain amount of time (for example, monthly), the account is then automatically charged the current balance. The down-side for the demanding party is that it will have to predict credit usage (it may have to advance purchase from TSAs  and PPs ) and will have to advance credits to the company using the service (e.g., give financial credit to the companies).","A prepaid, declining balance system  could be used, wherein the company pays an initial prepayment and the balance declines until a threshold is reached, at which point the company's credit card is automatically charged another prepayment. The prepaid, declining balance system has an advantage to the demanding party in that no advance of credits to the company using the service is required (e.g., no financial credit to the company is required).","The pay-as-you-go purchase method  provides convenience, negating the need for credit distribution and greatly reducing the credit management overhead, yet potentially results in higher costs, plus the demanding party must manage expiring or rejected credit cards.","The credit block purchase method  provides the company or customer the possible option of a lower cost per time-stamp credit, with the risk of credit expiration and wastage and potentially with a management overhead to distribute the credits.","The credit block purchase method  is presented in two alternatives, the ad-hoc credit block purchase method  and the automatic credit block purchase method . In both, the firm's administrator preferably has the option to distribute  () credits to his end users or to allow them to draw from a company pool. The pool provides ease of management, but reduced control. Preferably there is a \u201cdistribute all\u201d button that may intelligently allocate the administrator's balance to users based on recent usage patterns and individual balances. Optionally the \u201cdistribute all\u201d button may allocate credits equally or following an administrator-designated scheme.","While generally the credits are used on a soonest-to-expire basis, preferably there is a customizable prioritization of credit usage, most preferably allowing the end user to choose between using only credits in a corporate pool, using only credits self-purchased, preferentially using credits in the corporate pool before self-purchase, preferentially using self-purchased credits before corporate pool credits, and preferentially using first-to-expire. This may be set on a project-by-project basis.","The ad-hoc credit block purchase method  is a standard process in which, when logged into the corporate administrative console  (), the administrator selects a quantity of credits to purchase (with an associated price per credit displayed in the discount schedule); then he proceeds with an e-commerce checkout  (). Payment is typically by credit card; however, for large volume where a credit arrangement has been made, the corporation may request to be invoiced.","In the automatic credit block purchase method  () the administrator will establish the guidelines for automatic purchasing of credits when inventory becomes low and for the number of credits for which the automated purchase is to be made.","With both the ad-hoc credit block purchase method  and the automatic credit block purchase method , notification alerts (with different levels of criticality) can be set for a balance threshold, for unusually high activity, for credit card denial, for credit card receipts, etc. Yet it remains the responsibility of the administrator to manually monitor the credit balance for his firm.","Preferably, using the firm or company purchase history, usage patterns, current status, and interrelationships between various products, an algorithm similar to EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) algorithms can be used to recommend credit volumes to purchase and to potentially make the purchase automatically.","Billing reports, a consolidated report of credits and their cost used by project for the period indicated, can be generated, irrespective of payment method.","WSTC Application Programming Interface","The demanding party sends authenticated calls of various types to the WSTC Application Programming Interface (API) with a number of parameters specifying the details of the request. As illustrated in , the primary call types are the following: credit call , service call , verification call , cancellation call , and retrieval call . Default parameters are preferably initially set so that calls received in standard format do not need to specify all parameters (e.g., providing party to be used, archiving of data) before accessing the WSTC API.","The credit call deals with the demanding party's time-stamp credits with the WSTC. In a similar manner as the time-stamp credit purchase methods described above and shown in , the demanding party may purchase time stamps in credit blocks , either through automatic  or ad-hoc purchases . A single pricing schedule may be set in a single currency for all demanding parties or special pricing may be established for each demanding party.","The credit call functionality includes the following: credit balance reports, credit usage reports, credit purchase requests (for a specific providing party , ,  or for general usage), and credit automation (a number of parameters including threshold at which a specified number of credits are purchased automatically for a specific providing party , ,  or for general usage).","The service call functionality that can be requested by the demanding party  includes the following services: hash, encrypt, decrypt, sign, archive, providing party request, time-stamping , renewal of time stamps, reports of historic time-stamp receipts and transactions.","The verification call can be used to verify a time stamp, either independently or through the TSA from which it was provided. The WSTC can verify the time stamp, upon submission of the original file and the time-stamp receipt; the WSTC can perform verification with less information, but the submission of the original file and the time-stamp receipt allows for an independent check that does not rely on the content of the WSTC database. (This varies from verification , done routinely as a cross-check when generating a time stamp for a demanding party , in that verification  includes confirming that the HASH of the file signature is correct.) In certain situations, however, it may be desirable to perform the verification with the TSA issuer of the time stamp. The verification call returns the date-time stamp of the time stamp, if it is valid, or an error message, if it is not.","Another verification call requests the WSTC to attempt to verify if, and when, an original file has been time-stamped. For example, given only the original file, the WSTC can perform a hash and then search for the regenerated HASH in its database  of historic time stamps and related data. If the file HASH is found, the time-stamp receipt can be accessed to complete an independent verification. Similarly, the demanding party  can instead provide only the file HASH, only the tracking number, only the file signature HASH, or only the file signature; to find the time-stamp receipt, the database can be searched for the provided data or a key derived from the provided data. The demanding party  provides the available information and verification method it wishes to use; the WSTC bases the cost on the method chosen.","A further use of the verification call is employed in situations where a third party was not able to complete a time-stamp request and the demanding party  has been advised that the transaction is pending. A verification call from the demanding party  can be periodically used to poll the WSTC  for an update. Preferably, if the transaction is not complete, the WSTC  will recommend a wait time before another verification call to prevent excess traffic. If supported by the demanding party , another method is for the WSTC  to make a call to the demanding party to advise it when the transaction is no longer pending.","The cancellation call is used by the demanding party  to attempt to cancel a time-stamp service call to the WSTC that has not been processed yet. If the transaction has already been processed at the time of the cancellation call, an error message is returned indicating such.","The retrieval call from the demanding party  requests retrieval of archived data from the WSTC , upon transmission to the WSTC  of sufficient information to uniquely identify a time stamp or desired information or files. The information transmitted could include some or all of the following data: the tracking number, the original file, the HASH of the original file, the signed HASH, the time-stamp receipt, the date and time of the time stamp, the TSA(s) used, the archive facilities  used, and\/or other providing party  related information. If more than one transaction performed for the demanding party  corresponds to the data submitted, a list of potential time stamps and information or files can be made available to the demanding party ; subsequent retrieval calls can use the keys provided to make specific requests.","Appropriate authentication is performed before calls are processed. It is preferred that all calls from a specific demanding party  come from a fixed IP space.","Demanding Party Administrative Console","Referring now to , the web-based demanding party administrative dashboard or console  is accessible to an administrator from the demanding party.","The demanding party administrative dashboard  may include the following tools: Payment Processor's Administration Tool , Customer Management , Authentication Management , Digital Signature Management , Reporting Tool , Pending Transaction List , Alert and Notification Tool , Expiring Inventory Notification , Inventory\/Purchase Management , and Pending Transaction List . The tools are operable to perform the functions named.","The Customer Management Tool  preferably allows the administrator to quickly track, manage, and view historical data via the following sub-tools: Search , Experience Emulation or Ghosting , Account Creation Log , Login Log , Upload Log , Purchase Log , Error Log , Reporting , Account Creation , Credit Allocation , and Pending Transaction List . The sub-tools are operable to perform the functions named.","The Pending Transaction List  reports situations where a third party is not able to complete a time-stamp or service request, so the transaction is pending. Temporary receipt reference ID's associated with the pending transactions are listed, as well as any status updates available.","The Notification Tool  allows configuration of a variety of alerts and alarms, such as, for example, notifications of expiring time-stamp credits, errors, pending transactions, threshold levels reached, etc.","The Reporting Tool  allows the administrator to view a number of reports demonstrating past performance and usage that, in addition to general usage, may be used to help ensure sufficient time-stamp inventory levels are available to meet future needs (when using the credit block purchasing method  of ).","Through use of the demanding party administrative dashboard  the administrator can also manage credit blocks  (purchase, view expiration, view history), configure defaults (such as the default TSA or time-stamp notification components), verify a time stamp, search the WSTC database  (of its own transactions), and retrieve archived information.","All administrative actions are preferably logged.","WSTC Administrative Dashboard","Referring now to , although most functionality is preferably provided using the WSTC API, the majority of these functions can also be performed through a WSTC administrative web interface or dashboard . The web-based WSTC administrative dashboard  is preferably accessible to an administrator from the WSTC. All administrative actions are preferably logged.","The WSTC administrative dashboard  will give access to the Payment Processor's Administrative Tool , Demanding Party Management Tool , Authentication Management , Digital Signature Management , Expiring Inventory Notification Tool , Pending Transaction List , Inventory Purchase\/Management , Provider Management Tool , and Reporting Tool . Each of these WSTC administrative dashboard  tools may be expanded to access various functions and to drill down to access more detailed data. A variety of alerts and alarms can be customized to alert the WSTC administrator of the reaching of threshold levels, expiration of inventory, error messages, and the like.","Through use of the WSTC administrative dashboard  the WSTC administrator can add and remove demanding party administrators, view reports, manage demanding party credits (sell, issue, returns), manage providing party , ,  credits (buy, return), search the database , retrieve archived information, manage product bundle creations, and manage price and terms.","The Inventory Purchase\/Management Tool  allows the administrator to perform any of the following actions: manage blocks of time stamps; purchase and return time stamps; check on the status of time stamps purchased from one or more providing parties , including viewing expiration times and usage; and set threshold and expiration alerts.","The Inventory Purchase\/Management Tool  also allows the administrator to perform any of the following actions: manage blocks of providing party product credits; purchase and return providing party product credits; check on the status of providing party product credits purchased from one or more providing parties , including viewing expiration times and usage; and set threshold and expiration alerts.","The Provider Management Tool  allows the administrator to add, manage, and change the providing parties , , . When adding a new providing party , , , various issues are considered by the administrator, such as advance or minimum purchase requirements, lead time to adding inventory, pricing and discounts available, relationships between providing parties , , , and expiration of inventory. This information is in turn used in Inventory Purchase and\/or Management .","The Demanding Party Management Tool  allows addition and removal of demanding party administrators; also, the Demanding Party Management Tool  allows the WSTC administrator to search and display demanding party administrators and their permissions. For example, a dynamic search tool will allow the WSTC administrator to do a parametric search (by date range, user ID, user name, role, demanding party , etc.) that will result in a list of users and a high-level profile. Drilling down will reveal a full profile and the action history, which may be filtered for only specific action types.","The Reporting Tool  allows the administrator to generate a number of useful reports (either for an individual demanding party  or combining all (or some) demanding parties ) for management and tracking of financial and service objectives, e.g., inventory purchases (by demanding party , by product, by period); revenues (by demanding party , by product, by period); and transactions (by demanding party , by product, by period).","Security and Hardware","The WSTC  and demanding party (or parties)  are operable to perform all the functions and services as described herein; some functions and services have been described only in outline form as they can be implemented using standard computing service and software design.","The novel certified email system may run on one or more servers (e.g., web servers configured to receive HTTP requests and to deliver web pages and other files via the HTTP protocol, application servers, database servers, etc.) with Internet feed, firewall, switch, load balancer, and mass storage array that may or may not be shared with other functions. The novel certified email system employs a mail server (e.g., an open source mail server such as Sendmail or Exim) to receive authentication requests by email and to send out receipt notifications. Some of the functionality is preferably duplicated for redundancy. The system may also run in cloud computing virtual environments such as Amazon's EC3.","The modular architecture, allowing maximum flexibility and future expandability, also allows the demanding party (or parties) and the WSTC to be physically located in close proximity, such as in the same rack mount, or to be widely dispersed, such as in different countries. Provision is made for multi-lingual presentations. Security mechanisms are provided, such as, for example, encryption for stored information, a firewall to protect the data files, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for passing credit card numbers (and other information requiring secure handling, optionally including customer files), a remote mirror site (for disaster recovery includes real-time streaming), other remote (non-mirroring) backup mechanisms, local mirroring, and local non-mirroring backup, and login authentication using email addresses and passwords or strong authentication including biometrics and\/or token devices.","While the certified email system and method of the present invention has been described as applied to a firm, company, or organization in order to describe its complete functionality and applications, any individual can take advantage of most of the functionality herein presented. Hence, the use of the certified email system and method by an individual user is within the scope of the invention.","Since many modifications, variations, and changes in detail can be made to the described preferred embodiments of the invention, it is intended that all matters in the foregoing description and shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
