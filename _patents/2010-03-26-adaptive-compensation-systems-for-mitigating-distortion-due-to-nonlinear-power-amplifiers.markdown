{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8802-09-C-0001 awarded by the Department of the Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The power amplifier is one of the most important subsystems of modern communication systems. In the case of satellite downlinks, the power efficiency of high-power amplifiers (HPAs) is important because power requirements directly impact size, weight, and cost of the satellite payload. Because the power efficiency is relatively high when the amplifier is operated near the saturation region, as may be the case for satellite links, the HPA frequently must be operated in such a region. However, the nonlinearity of the amplifier in the near saturation region may introduce considerable distortion in the signal to be amplified. As the output power back off is reduced, the signal to distortion power ratio at the amplifier output is correspondingly reduced. This may place a significant restriction on the amount of back off that needs to be introduced, resulting in a loss of the available output power and, equally important, a reduced power conversion efficiency. This results in an increased demand on D.C. power which, in cases where power is supplied by solar panels, may negatively impact the size, weight, and cost of the satellite payload. Schemes by which the amplifier output back off may be minimized while at the same time mitigating the distortion effects of the amplifier may therefore be desirable. Such mitigation becomes even more important when the amplifier input is comprised of relatively high power signals along with relatively low power signals, as in this case distortion due to the strong signals may result in a very poor signal to distortion power ratio for the weak signals.","Previous techniques to mitigate the amplifier distortion effects generally fall into two categories. In the first category may be techniques that attempt to cancel the nonlinear term arising due to the power amplifier in a feedforward or feedback mode with the compensation operation at radio frequency (RF). The feedforward linearizer consists of two loops. The first loop subtracts samples of the input signal from samples of the amplifier output signal to produce samples of the main amplifier's distortion. The second loop subtracts the amplified sampled distortion from the delayed version of the main amplifier output to obtain the final linearized output. This arrangement is complex to implement, requires a second amplifier that needs to be linear to avoid generating its own distortion terms, and results in power loss due to signal combining at the amplifier output. In the feedback linearizer, the amplifier's input and output are detected and low pass filtered and the resulting baseband signals are compared. The error signal is used to control the gain of the amplifier so as to minimize the distortion. This technique suffers from the bandwidth limitation on the amplifier input signal, as the feedback system may respond to frequencies that are much smaller than the inverse of the delay introduced by the amplifier and associated feedback circuitry; thus, the technique is limited to relatively narrowband signals.","In the predistortion linearization technique, the amplifier input is predistorted such that the overall distortion due to the linearizer and amplifier is minimized. The linearizer gain and phase is obtained iteratively for different input power levels. A digital signal processor (DSP) version of the Cartesian predistortion scheme has been proposed wherein a look up table storing inphase and quadrature components of the linearizer as a function of the input signal envelope is used for predistortion for a set of input signal envelope values. The signal to be amplified is digitized and sampled values of the signal are modified by interpolated value of the stored inphase and quadrature components of the linearizer. The correction is limited by interpolation errors. In a proposed adaptive version of the DSP Cartesian predistortion scheme, the stored values are updated according to the amplifier output signal, which is also limited due to the interpolation errors. Based on the feedback architecture of this scheme, a power amplifier linearizer for a time division duplex system has been proposed wherein a receiving subsystem is shared between the receiver and the power amplifier feedback subsystem, resulting in some reduction of complexity for the time division duplex system.","Methods for pre-processing a signal prior to receipt of the signal by a non-linear device (NLD) to compensate for AM-AM distortion and AM-PM distortion of the signal by the NLD are disclosed. In one embodiment, the method includes: generating a modified amplitude rbased on an amplitude xderived from a digitized envelope Rof the signal; generating a scale factor cbased on the modified amplitude rand the amplitude x; generating an AM-AM compensated signal based on the scale factor c; generating a first AM-PM phase compensation value based on the modified amplitude r; and generating an AM-AM and AM-PM compensated signal by modifying a phase of the AM-AM compensated signal based on the first AM-PM phase compensation value. In another embodiment, the method includes: compensating, by at least one processor, an AM-AM distortion of the signal based on a scale factor",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["r","k"]},{"mi":["x","k"]}]},"mo":"."}}},"br":{},"sub":["k ","i,k ","k ","k","a ","k","p ","0,n ","k"]},"Also disclosed is a system that, in one embodiment, includes a non-linear electronic signal processing device for processing an input signal, and a pre-processor in communication with the non-linear electronic signal processing device. The non-linear electronic signal processing device has a non-linear transfer function. The pre-processor receives a signal, processes the received signal, and outputs the processed signal to an input of the non-linear electronic signal processing device. The pre-processor includes at least one processor programmed to: generate a modified amplitude rbased on an amplitude xderived from a digitized envelope Rof the signal; generate a scale factor cbased on the modified amplitude rand the amplitude x; generate an AM-AM compensated signal based on the scale factor c, to generate a first AM-PM phase compensation value based on the modified amplitude r; and generate an AM-AM and AM-PM compensated signal by modifying a phase of the AM-AM compensated signal based on the first AM-PM phase compensation value.","Embodiments of the present application are directed to a number of polar predistortion-based linearization architectures wherein the gain and phase may be individually compensated. In many cases, phase distortion is more important than gain distortion and may be substantially or completely eliminated by architectures presented herein. In certain architectures presented herein, the linearizer gain function may be represented by a polynomial of odd degree having coefficients obtained by an explicit minimization of the mean squared error between the actual amplifier output gain response and the ideal response, which may be selected to be linear. The method may also be applied to other selected responses. The minimization may be performed using a gradient algorithm with a power 4 optimization index. Such an approach provides very good response up to the input signal amplitude where the amplifier output is saturated. However, beyond this value of the saturation input, the polynomial-based linearizer may result in an oscillatory response at the amplifier output. To avoid this problem, a modified linearizer may be used wherein the output of the linearizer is clipped to a value equal to the saturation input for any value exceeding the saturation input. This may result in ideal-limiter characteristics for the linearized amplifier. Simulation examples show that a 7or 9degree polynomial provides excellent linearization results. Because the amplifier gain response is selected to be an odd function, only the odd degree terms of the linearizer are non zero. Thus, only 4 or 5 coefficients may need to be stored for the linearization compared to a large array of gain values as suggested by previous methods.","According to various embodiments, the amplitude to phase transfer characteristic of the amplifier may be modeled by a polynomial of the input signal envelope. Typically, a 9or lower degree polynomial may be needed to precisely model the characteristics over the entire range of the input signal envelope. Because the range of input signal may be limited for any given power level, the approximation may be performed by a 2or 3degree polynomial about a nominal operating point, resulting in a significant computational advantage which may be important in applications involving very wide band signals which may need to be sampled at relatively high rates. The coefficients of the relatively low degree polynomial may be updated at time intervals over which the nominal input power level of the amplifier is expected to change significantly due to various factors such as channel variations. The architecture may include a method to evaluate and update the nominal power level as well. At every sample time, the expected phase distortion due to the amplifier may be evaluated using a 2or 3degree polynomial and pre-compensated for in the AM-PM compensator. Architectures that operate at RF and baseband are presented. Open loop adaptive architectures may adapt with respect to the nominal input power level changes.","In addition, close loop architectures are presented that may also adapt to the (relatively slow) changes in the amplifier characteristics as well. In these architectures, the error signal between the output of the amplifier with the open loop compensation and the ideal response may be modeled by a parametric model such as a polynomial having coefficients adapted to the variations that may occur in the amplifier characteristics and any other component variations. Because these variations may occur over a much larger time scale compared to the time scale of the signal variations, the error model parameters may remain essentially constant. Therefore, generation of the adaptive close loop compensation signal to offset the variations in the characteristics of the amplifier and any other components need not depend upon the instantaneous phase or amplitude error. The adaptive close loop compensation signal may instead be derived from the amplifier input signal amplitude and phase without using instantaneous feedback from the amplifier. Accordingly, the close loop adaptive architecture of the present application does not have a bandwidth limitation that arises in other feedback architectures of the prior art that require instantaneous output feedback.","Also, in contrast to the Cartesian predistortion architecture of the prior art, in the close loop architecture of the present application there may be two distinct compensation signals based on the known amplifier characteristics and the variations in the latter, respectively. Because the second component of the compensation is relatively insignificant compared to the first, the architecture disclosed in the present application may be relatively more robust in terms of stability compared to architectures having a single compensation signal.","Simulations have shown that embodiments of the adaptive compensation system of the present application provide significant performance improvement, even when applied to the AM-AM and AM-PM characteristics of an otherwise state of the art linearized amplifier. It is believed that these embodiments provide a distortion mitigation of a much higher level than is currently available.","In one general aspect, embodiments of the present application are directed to devices and methods for pre-processing a signal prior to receipt of the signal by a non-linear device (NLD) to compensate for AM-AM distortion and AM-PM distortion of the signal by the NLD. AM-AM distortion is caused by a change in a gain of the NLD arising from a change in an input power level of the NLD. AM-PM distortion is caused by a phase shift introduced by the NLD arising from a change in an input power level of the NLD. An NLD that receives an input bandpass signal may comprise only the power amplifier or multiple linear or nonlinear devices such as converters, amplifiers, etc. in a cascaded arrangement. The input bandpass signal may be, for example, a single digitally modulated signal such as an offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) signal or the sum of a number of digitally modulated signals. In either case, the combined signal at the input of the NLD may be represented in the following equivalent forms:\n\nThe AM-PM form: ()=()cos(2())\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nThe inphase and quadrature form: ()=()cos(2)\u2212() sin(2)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere R(t) and \u03b8(t) are respectively the real envelope and the phase of the bandpass signal s(t), and u(t) and v(t) respectively denote the real inphase and quadrature baseband signals. The frequency fmay be the RF frequency fwhen the nonlinear device is just the power amplifier or it may be equal to the intermediate frequency (IF) frequency fwhen the NLD is comprised of both the up converter and RF power amplifier. The signal s(t) may be available at the complex baseband and is equal to (u(t)+j v(t)) with j\u2261\u221a{square root over (\u22121)}, in which case the real base band signals u(t) and v(t) are available directly as the real and imaginary components of s(t). As will be appreciated from the discussion that follows, embodiments of the present application may be implemented differently depending on, for example, whether the signal s(t) is at the RF\/IF frequency or at the complex baseband. The output of the NLD, the last stage of which may be the RF power amplifier, may be represented by:\n\n()=()cos(2()+\u03c6())\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhere the output real envelope R(t) and the phase \u03c6(t) may be obtained in terms of the amplitude transfer characteristics function h( ) and the amplitude to phase transfer characteristics function \u03c6( ). These two functions are directly related to the AM-AM and AM-PM characteristics of the device, which are specified in terms of power levels of the sine wave signal used in the measurements of these characteristics. In terms of the amplitude transfer characteristics function h( ) and the amplitude to phase transfer characteristics function \u03c6( ), the output real envelope R(t) and the phase \u03c6(t) may be represented by:\n\n()=(());\u2003\u2003(4a)\n\n\u03c6()=\u03c6(()); ()=()\/\u2003\u2003(4b)\n\nIn equations (4a) and (4b) Aand Amay be appropriate input and output normalization amplitudes. For example, Aand Amay be selected such that A=\u221a{square root over (2P)}; A=\u221a{square root over (2P)} where Pdenotes the output power at saturation with the sine wave input signal and Pdenotes the corresponding input power level in watts. However, it will be appreciated that any other convenient normalization may also be used with the corresponding modification in the function h( ) and \u03c6( ). If there are linear devices in the cascade operating at relatively low signal power levels (e.g., bandpass filters), such devices may introduce an amount of frequency dependent phase in the signal which will be added to the phase \u03c6(t) in equation (3). The effect of such devices on the AM-AM and AM-PM model of the composite device is otherwise assumed to be insignificant.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 26","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","2600","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","114"],"sub":["i","i","i","i","i,k ","i,k ","i,k ","i,k ","i,k ","i,k","i,k","i,k","i,k ","iN ","k","k","i,k","iN","k ","k ","m","k","m","k","k","m","k ","k","k ","k","m"],"br":[{},{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["R","u","+v","x","=R","\/A","; k="],"sup":["2","2"]},"The scale factor cmay be input to the AM-AM compensator  where it multiplies the inphase and quadrature baseband signals uand vto generate the AM-AM compensated signals uand v, respectively, at the AM-AM compensator  output.

In the simulation example, both the signals are filtered by square-root raised cosine filters. The WB signal has a rate R=100 Msps with the square-root raised cosine filter roll-off factor \u03b1equal to 0.3. The narrowband (NB) signal with rate R=4.44 Msps has the filter roll-off factor \u03b1=0.21. The separation between the center frequencies of the two signals \u0394fis equal to 68.12 MHz, thus avoiding any overlap among their spectrums. Both the signals have the same peak power spectral densities. The ratio of the power levels of the two signals is 22.5 or 13.52 dB.
