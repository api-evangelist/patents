{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to alert systems and, more particularly, to a system and method for secure transmission of alert messages using standard communication protocols.","On many production programs, the ability to resolve production issues or address manufacturing events in a timely manner is necessary for meeting production schedules. The ability to rapidly resolve a production issue may be dependent on the ability to quickly notify the appropriate personnel of the production issue. For a production program where manufacturing and support operations are located within a single facility, the amount of time required to alert the appropriate personnel may be relatively short. However, many manufacturers of large programs are outsourcing an increasing amount of manufacturing and production work to a variety of different facilities at numerous locations including overseas locations. The increase in outsourcing may result in an increase in the amount of time required to notify appropriate personnel of the occurrence of a manufacturing event so that the event may be addressed and resolved.","Adding to the time required to resolve a production issue is the wide variety of communication systems that may exist at the different facilities. For example, each facility may have their own unique communication system with unique communication protocols and unique security requirements. Furthermore, each facility may have one or more internet security firewalls that block the receipt of messages from outside sources. The different communication protocols and security requirements may not be compatible with the protocols and security requirements of other facilities with the result that an alert that is sent from one facility may not be received by an intended recipient in another facility in a timely manner.","A further drawback associated with conventional communication systems is that a first facility working on a production program may not inform other facilities of changes that may have been implemented in the communication system at the first facility. For example, one facility may expand, upgrade, or alter their communication system without providing notice to other facilities of the changes to the communication system. As a result, personnel at one facility may not receive timely notice of a manufacturing event that may have occurred at another facility. The net result may be an increase in the amount of time required to address and resolve a manufacturing event.","As can be seen, there exists a need in the art for a system and method for sending an alert regarding an event to appropriate personnel and wherein the system may be operated without regard to security requirements such as firewalls that may be installed at different facilities. Furthermore, there exists a need in the art for a system and method for sending an alert which accommodates changes to the communication systems at each facility.","The above-noted needs associated with communication of manufacturing events are specifically addressed and alleviated by the present disclosure which, in an embodiment, provides an alert system that may include an alert sender module, an alert routing module, an alert controller module, and an alert mechanism. The alert sender module may be configured to send an encrypted alert independent of an internet security firewall. The alert routing module may have a registry and may be configured to receive the encrypted alert and process the encrypted alert according to a security mechanism associated with the registry. The alert controller module may be configured to accept the encrypted alert from the alert routing module according to the security mechanism. The alert mechanism may be configured to be activated by the alert controller module.","In a further embodiment, disclosed is an alert system which may include an alert sender module, an alert routing module, an alert controller module, and an alert mechanism. The alert sender module may be configured to send an encrypted alert independent of an internet security firewall. The alert routing module may have a registry. The alert controller module may be communicatively coupled to the alert routing module. The alert mechanism may be communicatively coupled to the alert controller module. The registry may be configured to issue an encryption key to the alert controller module upon registration thereof with the registry. The alert controller module may be configured to accept the encrypted alert if the encrypted alert is capable of being decrypted using the encryption key. The alert mechanism may be configured to be activated by the alert controller module upon decryption of the encrypted alert.","Also disclosed is a method of sending an alert which may include sending an encrypted alert independent of a presence of an internet security firewall. The method may also include processing the encrypted alert according to a security mechanism associated with a registry. In addition, the method may include accepting the encrypted alert from the alert routing module according to the security mechanism. The method may also include the step of activating an alert mechanism in response to accepting the encrypted alert from the alert routing module.","The features, functions and advantages that have been discussed can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments, further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings below.","Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating various embodiments of the disclosure, shown in  is a schematic diagram of an alert system  for sending an alert  or message from a sender  to a recipient  to alert the recipient  of an event  ().

For example, the sender device  may be associated with a machine or process in a facility such as a manufacturing facility.","For example, in a non-limiting illustration of the functionality of the sender module  (), the sender device  () may be coupled to a numerical control (NC) machine (not shown) configured to perform machining operations on a component (not shown) within a manufacturing facility (not shown). Upon the occurrence of a manufacturing event associated with the machining of the component such as a non-conformance (not shown) in the component geometry, the alert sender module  may be configured to generate an alert  () representative of the non-conformance.

In this regard, the acceptance of the encrypted alert  may include accepting, by the alert controller module  (), the encrypted alert  if the encrypted alert  is capable of being decrypted using the encryption key  () issued by the alert routing module  during registration of the alert controller module .","Step  of the method  of  may comprise limiting acceptance of the encrypted alert  () to a communication protocol  () that is not subject to restriction by an internet security firewall  () or otherwise prevented from passing through the internet security firewall . In this regard, acceptance of the encrypted alert  may be limited to emails  (), text messages  (), and web service  () communications.","Step  of the method  of  may comprise activating an alert mechanism  () in response to accepting the encrypted alert  () from the alert routing module  (). The activation of an alert mechanism  may include activating and\/or controlling one or more alert devices  () that may be supported by the alert routing module . Activation and\/or control of the alert devices  may be performed by an alert mechanism interface  () of the alert controller module . In this regard, the alert mechanism interface  may receive an alert  from the alert mechanism agent  (). The alert mechanism interface  may directly control one or more alert devices  () regardless of the type or configuration  () of each alert device . For example, the alert mechanism interface  may directly control the alert devices  regardless of whether the alert devices  are configured as an alert display device  configured to display text (), illuminate a visual signal device  (), activate an audible signal device  () to cause the emission of an audible signal (e.g., via a loudspeaker\u2014not shown), or activate any one of a variety of other alert device  configurations , without limitation.","Step  of the method  of  may comprise collecting historical data  () regarding a plurality of the encrypted alerts  (). The historical data  may be collected in the alert routing module  by the information logger  (). As mentioned above, the information logger  may store content  () of the plurality of encrypted alerts  which may include data (e.g., time, date, and nature of event) associated with the encrypted alerts . Advantageously, metrics  () may be generated from the historical data  collected by the information logger . Such metrics  may be analyzed for detecting trends or anomalies and to resolve issues such as manufacturing non-conformances.","Advantageously, the system  () as disclosed herein provides a means for sending an alert  () to appropriate personnel (e.g., recipients \u2014) regarding the occurrence of an event  () such as a manufacturing event or a production issue. Due to the registration process wherein the location  () of alert devices  () is updated when the alert controller module  () is rebooted or at predetermined time intervals, the system  may be re-configured or expanded while maintaining communications between the alert controller module  and alert devices  regardless of whether the alert controller module  or alert devices  are added, deleted, or moved to different locations. Advantageously, flexibility is provided by the system  due to the capability of transmitting alerts  () to one or more alert devices  without pre-knowledge by the sender  () of the specific configuration or specific physical hardware of the alert device .","The system  () may be implemented in a supply chain system (not shown) for providing parts (not shown) from a vendor (not shown) to one or more production or manufacturing facilities (not shown). The system  may also be implemented as a means to notify appropriate personnel (not shown) upon the occurrence of a manufacturing event (not shown) such that production support, engineering, inspection, quality control, and any one of a variety of other personnel may be alerted and informed of the nature and location of the event . In this regard, the system  may be implemented in a factory environment and\/or between companies located anywhere in the world.","Referring to , embodiments of the disclosure may be described in the context of an aircraft manufacturing and service method  as shown in  and an aircraft  as shown in .
