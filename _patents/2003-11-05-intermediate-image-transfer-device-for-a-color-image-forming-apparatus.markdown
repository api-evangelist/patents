Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a copier, facsimile apparatus, printer or similar image forming apparatus and more particularly to an intermediate image transfer type of color image forming apparatus.","2. Description of the Background Art","Generally, an intermediate image transfer type of image forming apparatus includes an image carrier, an intermediate image transfer body, primary image transferring means for transferring a toner image from the image carrier to the intermediate image transfer body, and secondary image transferring means for transferring the toner image from the intermediate image transfer body to a sheet or similar recording medium. This type of image forming apparatus is disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2002-214932. The image carrier, configured to carry a toner image corresponding to image data, is implemented as a photoconductive drum by way of example. For the intermediate image transfer body, use is often made of an endless, intermediate image transfer belt passed over a plurality of rollers. To effect primary image transfer, an electric field is formed between the drum and the belt. For secondary image transfer, an electric field and\/or pressure is applied between the belt and a sheet.","Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2000-010415, for example, teaches an intermediate image transfer type of color copier, color laser beam printer or similar color image forming apparatus. The apparatus taught in this document sequentially transfers toner images of different colors to an intermediate image transfer belt one above the other and then transfers the resulting composite color image to a sheet.","A problem with the intermediate image transfer type of image forming apparatus is that when image formation is repeated, image transferability is lowered or image transfer becomes irregular due to aging, as determined by experiments. One cause of the above problem is that resistivity on the surface of the belt to which a bias is applied varies due to repeated image formation. A change in the surface resistivity of the belt directly translates into a change in adequate bias and other image transfer conditions, lowering transferability or, when they locally vary, rendering image transfer irregular. More specifically, when the surface resistivity of the belt decreases due to aging, a current easily flows on the surface of the belt to which the bias is applied. If the amount of current is large, then a current expected to contribute to image transfer decreases with the result that transferability is lowered or toner scattering occurs due to an increase in electric field in a non-image transfer region.","In a tandem image forming apparatus including a plurality of image carriers, the distance between nearby primary image transferring means is small. Consequently, if the surface resistivity of the surface applied with the bias is low, then a current easily flows on the surface of the belt and causes, if large in amount, nearby primary image transferring means to interfere with each other.","In an image forming apparatus configured to apply a secondary image transfer bias to the inner or reverse surface of the belt, a current is apt to flow along the inner surface of the belt. This also causes the problems discussed above to arise.","Another cause of low transferability and irregular image transfer ascribable to aging is that the volume resistivity of the belt decreases as image formation is repeated. This also causes the image transfer conditions to vary as when the surface resistivity of the belt varies, bringing about the problems stated above.","It is known that the variation of resistance stated above occurs because the belt is subject to electric adverse influence, i.e., so-called hazard ascribable to, e.g., repeated bias application. To protect the belt from such deterioration ascribable to aging, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 08-054789 and 09-281814, for example, propose to detect information dependent on the resistance of the belt and control a bias for image transferring means by taking account of the information detected.","The bias control scheme, however, cannot obviate irregular image transfer because the resistance of the belt does not uniformly vary due to the influence of toner and sheet. Further, a current flows along the surface of the belt due to the fall of resistance, so that interference between nearby image transferring means cannot be obviated. Moreover, in the case where a voltage used for primary image transfer is susceptible to the area of a toner image or the thickness of a toner layer, transferability varies between a single-color image and a composite color image with the result that image transfer is apt to become short or excessive.","In the intermediate image transfer type of image forming apparatus, irregular image transfer sometimes occurs on the surface of the belt in the event of primary and secondary image transfer, as also determined by experiments. One cause of this irregularity is that an irregular potential distribution, which is the replica of the potential of a latent image formed on the drum, sometimes appears on the belt at the time of primary image transfer. If the belt with such an irregular potential distribution enters a primary image transfer nip, then irregular image transfer occurs in accordance with the above irregular potential distribution.","More specifically, when a latent image is formed on the drum, a surface potential difference occurs between the image portion and the non-image portion or background of the drum. The surface potential difference remains on the drum even when the latent image is developed. When the drum faces a primary image transfer roller or similar primary image transferring means via the belt at the primary image transfer nip, a potential difference occurs between the image portion and the non-image portion relative to the roller. An electric field for primary image transfer is strong in the portion where the potential difference is great or weak in the other portion where it is small. A great amount of current flows in the portion where the electric field is strong, so that the surface potential of the belt becomes higher in the above portion than in the portion where the electric field is weak. If such an irregular potential distribution remains up to the next primary image transfer nip, then primary image transfer efficiency varies and brings about irregular image transfer.","Another cause of irregular image transfer is that the potential of the belt becomes irregular due to charge deposited on the belt in the event of secondary image transfer. Such irregularity is ascribable to the fact that the surface potential of the belt, remaining after the belt has moved away from the secondary image transfer nip, is different from the portion of the belt facing a sheet to the portion not facing it.","Why the potential difference occurs on the surface of the belt moved away from the secondary image transfer position will be described hereinafter. A current flows more easily in the non-facing region of the belt not facing a sheet than in the facing region of the same facing the sheet. As a result, when the secondary image transfer bias is applied from a secondary image transfer roller or similar secondary image transfer member, more current flows in the non-facing region than in the facing region. Consequently, more charge is fed to the non-facing region than to the facing region raising the surface potential of the non-facing region. It follows that the surface potential of the belt moved away from the secondary image transfer position is higher in the non-facing region than in the facing region. If such an irregular potential distribution remains on the belt up to the primary image transfer position following the secondary image transfer position, then a difference in primary image transfer efficiency occurs in accordance with the potential difference of the belt, resulting in irregular image transfer corresponding to the irregular potential distribution. Therefore, if the next toner image is transferred to the belt over the portions different in potential from each other, density becomes irregular accordingly.","Laid-Open Publication No. 2002-214932 mentioned earlier proposes to obviate irregular density ascribable to the potential contrast of the belt by reducing the contrast when the facing region and non-facing region of the belt pass the secondary image transfer nip. More specifically, for such a purpose, the above document switches the current value of the secondary image transfer bias between the time when the belt faces a sheet and the time when it does not face the sheet. Although this scheme can switch secondary bias control between the facing region and non-facing region of the belt, it cannot do so when the facing region and non-facing region exist together in the widthwise direction of the belt. It follows that irregular image transfer cannot be obviated when, e.g., a sheet of size A is passed in a landscape or a profile position or when a sheet of size B or similar relatively small size is passed.","It is a first object of the present invention to provide an image forming apparatus capable of obviating defective image transfer ascribable to the variation of the surface or the volumetric resistivity of an intermediate image transfer belt ascribable to aging.","It is a second object of the present invention to provide an image forming apparatus capable of obviating irregular image transfer apt to occur at the time of primary image transfer, which follows previous primary image transfer, due to the potential irregularity of the surface of an intermediate image transfer body, which is brought about by the previous primary image transfer due to the influence of the potential of a latent image.","It is a third object of the present invention to provide an image forming apparatus capable of more positively obviating irregular image transfer at the time of primary image transfer, which follows secondary image transfer, due to the potential irregularity of an intermediate image transfer belt ascribable to the secondary image transfer.","An intermediate image transfer type of image forming apparatus of the present invention includes an image carrier, an intermediate image transfer body, primary image transferring means for transferring a toner image from the image carrier to the intermediate image transfer body with a primary image transfer bias, and secondary image transferring means for transferring the toner image from the intermediate image transfer body to a sheet. When the surface resistivity of the intermediate image transfer body is measured by a method that repeatedly applies a voltage of 200 V for 60 seconds to the intermediate image transfer body and grounds the intermediate image transfer body for 10 seconds 1,000 consecutive times, a difference in absolute value between the logarithm of the first time of measurement and that of the thousandth time of measurement is 0.5 log \u03a9\/\u25a1 or below.","Referring to  of the drawings, a color image forming apparatus embodying the present invention and directed mainly toward the first object stated earlier is shown. As shown, the color image forming apparatus is generally made up of an electrophotographic color copier body , a sheet feed table  on which the copier body  is mounted, and an ADF (Automatic Document Feeder)  mounted on the copier body . In , suffixes Y, M, C and K stand for yellow, cyan, magenta and black, respectively.","The copier body  includes an endless, intermediate image transfer belt (simply belt hereinafter)  passed over a plurality of rollers, e.g., three rollers ,  and  and movable clockwise as viewed in . A belt cleaner  is positioned at the left-hand side of the roller or second roller , as viewed in , and removes residual toner left on the belt  after image transfer.","Four image forming means Y, M, C and K are arranged side by side above the upper run of the belt  between the roller or first roller  and the second roller , constituting a tandem image forming section . An exposing unit  is positioned above the tandem image forming section .","The image forming means  respectively include photoconductive drums or image carriers Y, M, C and K for carrying a yellow, a cyan, a magenta and a black toner image thereon. Primary image transfer rollers or primary image transferring means Y, M, C and K are located at primary image transfer positions where they respectively face the drums Y, M, C and K with the intermediary of the belt .","The roller  is implemented as a drive roller for causing the belt  to turn. In a monochrome or black mode, the rollers  and  other than the drive roller  are moved to release the drums Y, M and C from the belt .","As for an image forming apparatus of the type including only one photoconductive drum, it is a common practice to form a black image first in order to increase first-copy speed. In this case, only when a document is a color document, color images are formed after a black image.","A secondary image transferring device  is positioned at the opposite side to the image forming section  with respect to the belt . In the illustrative embodiment, the secondary image transferring device  comprises an endless, secondary image transfer belt (simply belt hereinafter)  passed over two rollers . The secondary image transferring device  is pressed against the roller or third roller  via the belt  at the time when an image is to be transferred from the belt  to a sheet or recording medium.","A fixing unit  is positioned beside the secondary image transferring device  for fixing the image transferred to the sheet. The fixing unit  includes a press roller  pressed against an endless fixing belt .","The secondary image transferring device  additionally serves to convey the sheet carrying the image thereto to the fixing unit . While the secondary image transferring device  may, of course, be implemented by an image transfer roller or a non-contact charger, some device is necessary for providing such a substitute with a sheet conveying function.","In the illustrative embodiment, a sheet turning device  is arranged below the secondary image transferring device  and fixing unit  in parallel to the image forming section . In a duplex copy mode for forming images on both sides of a sheet, the sheet turning device  is operated to turn the sheet.","The operation of the illustrative embodiment will be described hereinafter. The operator of the copier stacks desired documents on a document tray  included in the ADF  or opens the ADF  away from the copier body , lays a desired document on a glass platen  included in a scanner , and again closes the ADF . Subsequently, when the operator presses a start switch not shown, the scanner  is driven, when documents are stacked on the ADF , after one document has been conveyed to the glass platen  or immediately driven when a document is set on the glass platen , causing a first and a second carriage  and  to start running. A light source mounted on the first carriage  illuminates the document while the resulting imagewise reflection is incident to a mirror mounted on the second carriage . The light incident to the mirror is reflected toward an image sensor  via a lens .","When the start switch is pressed, a drive motor, not shown, causes the drive roller  to rotate and turn the belt . At the same time, the image forming means  respectively form a yellow, a cyan, a magenta and a black toner image on the drums , which are in rotation. The toner images of different colors are sequentially transferred from the drums  to the belt  one above the other by the primary image transfer rollers Y through K, completing a composite color image on the belt .","Further, when the start switch is pressed, one of pickup rollers  disposed in the sheet feed table  is rotated to pay out a sheet from associated one of sheet cassettes , which are positioned one above the other in a paper bank . At this instant, a reverse roller  associated with the pickup roller  separates the above sheet from the other sheets underlying it. The sheet thus paid out is conveyed by roller pairs  via a sheet path  and then introduced into a sheet path  arranged in the copier body . The sheet is then stopped by the nip of a registration roller pair .","On the other hand, when the operator stacks special sheets on a manual feed tray , a pickup roller  is rotated to pay out the sheets one by one while a reverse roller  separates the sheet being paid out from underlying sheets. This sheet is conveyed via a sheet path  until it has been stopped by the nip of the registration roller pair .","Subsequently, the registration roller pair  is rotated to start conveying the sheet to a position between the belt  and the secondary image transferring device  such that the leading edge of the sheet meets the leading edge of the composite color image present on the belt . The secondary image transferring device  transfers the composite color image from the belt  to the sheet.","The sheet, conveyed to the fixing unit  by the secondary image transferring device , has the color image fixed thereon by heat and pressure. A path selector  steers the sheet coming out of the fixing unit  toward either one of an outlet roller pair  or the sheet turning device . The outlet roller pair  drives the sheet out of the copier body  and stacks it on a copy tray . The sheet turning device  turns the sheet and again conveys it toward the secondary image transfer position; the sheet, carrying composite color images on both surfaces, is driven out to the copy tray  by the outlet roller pair .","After the image transfer, the belt cleaner  removes toner left on the belt  to thereby prepare it for the next image formation.","While the registration roller pair  is, in many cases, grounded, a bias may be applied to the registration roller pair  in order to remove paper dust, in which case the registration roller pair  will be formed of conductive rubber. Each rubber roller is provided with a diameter of 18 mm and formed with a 1 mm thick, conductive NBR (nitril rubber) rubber layer on the surface thereof. Electric resistance is selected to be about 10\u03a9\u00b7cm in terms of the volumetric resistivity of rubber. A voltage of about \u2212800 V is applied to one surface of a sheet to which toner is to be transferred, i.e., a front surface while a voltage of about +200 V is applied to the other surface or reverse surface of the sheet. The registration roller pair  may, of course, be grounded because the intermediate image transfer system causes a minimum of paper dust to reach the drums . The above DC bias may be replaced with an AC bias including a DC offset component.","The front surface of the sheet moved away from the registration roller pair , which is biased as stated above, has been slightly charged to the negative side. Therefore, in the event of image transfer from the belt  to the sheet, image transfer conditions different from those to be selected when a bias is not applied to the registration roller pair  may sometimes be required.","Now, it is likely with the intermediate image transfer type of copier described above that transferability is lowered or irregular image transfer occurs due to repeated image formation, as stated earlier. This is ascribable to the fact that the resistivity of the surface of the belt  to which a bias is applied varies due to aging and the fact that the volumetric resistivity of the belt  varies due to aging. The illustrative embodiment is capable of obviating defective image transfer ascribable to the above causes. Specific examples of the illustrative embodiment will be described hereinafter.","Ten different kinds of belts  were prepared. To measure the variation of each belt ascribable to aging, the surface resistivity of the belt is measured by repeating the application of a voltage and grounding 1,000 times under preselected conditions. A value produced by subtracting the logarithm of the result of the first measurement from the logarithm of the result of the thousandth measurement (log \u03a9\/\u25a1) will be referred to as a variation of resistance hereinafter. In this case, a logarithm is a common logarithm.","The variation of resistance increased in five belts in the range of 0.01 log \u03a9\/\u25a1 to 0.55 log \u03a9\/\u25a1; such five belts were labeled Nos.  through  in the incrementing order of absolute value. Likewise, the variation of resistance decreased in the other five belts in the range of 0.1 \u03a9\/\u25a1 to 0.56 \u03a9\/\u25a1; such five belts were labeled Nos.  through  in incrementing order of absolute value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1","1","2"]},"With the resistivity meter mentioned above, it is possible to freely set a voltage application time t (sec) and to apply a voltage and then ground the electrode  for thereby discharging the belt. Further, it is possible to automatically apply the voltage on the elapse of a discharge time t (sec), which is also freely selectable. In addition, the voltage can be repeatedly applied any desired number of times N. The voltage is repeatedly applied on the assumption of electric hazard particular to the belt  in the actual electrophotographic apparatus. Assume that the voltage is continuously applied and that the belt  has a laminate structure. Then, charge accumulates at the interface between nearby layers and obstructs the flow of a current as the time elapses. Therefore, continuously applying the voltage is not efficient in view of the above objective.","There were also used a high-tension power supply COR-A-TROL (610C) (trade name) available from Trec and an ammeter Digital Electrometer TR8652 available from Advantest.","Experimental results representative of a relation between the variation of surface resistivity and transferability will be described hereinafter.  shows transferability ranks in numerical values determined with the electrophotographic apparatus shown in .

It will therefore be seen that with the belt whose variation of resistance is 0.5 log \u25a1\/\u03a9 or below, it is possible to confine transferability and image density in an allowable range.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["6","10"]},"As  indicates, the belts Nos.  through  with the variations of resistance up to 0.49 were above the lower limit, but the belt No.  with the variation of 0.56 brought about irregular image transfer and lowered image density to an unacceptable degree.

In this condition, if the surface resistivity of the inner surface of the belt  is low, then a current is apt to flow on the surface of the belt . If the amount of such a current is large, then interference is likely to occur between nearby primary image transfer positions and cause the bias for image transfer to fluctuate, resulting in irregular image transfer and other defects. Example 1 described above is therefore advantageous when applied to this type of copier.","Example 2 to be described hereinafter is identical with Example 1 as to the configuration of the electrophotographic copier, so that the following description will concentrate on a difference between Examples 1 and 2. In Example 2, a bias opposite in polarity to toner was applied to the roller , so that toner is transferred from the belt  to a sheet by electrostatic repulsion. When a bias is so applied to the inner or reverse surface of the belt  and if the surface resistivity of the inner surface is low, then a current easily flows along the inner surface. If the amount of such a current is large, then a current to contribute to image transfer decreases with the result that transferability is lowered or an electric field in a non-transfer region is intensified to bring about toner scattering.","Example 2 is therefore advantageous when applied to the electrophotographic copier in which various problems arise when surface resistivity varies on the inner surface of the belt . Further, because Example 2 does not apply a bias for secondary image transfer to the belt  via a sheet, there can be reduced the influence of resistance of a sheet on transferability.","Ten different kinds of belts  were prepared. To measure the variation of each belt ascribable to aging, the volumetric resistivity of the belt is measured by repeating the application of a voltage and grounding a thousand times under preselected conditions. A value produced by subtracting the logarithm of the result of the first measurement from the logarithm of the result of the thousandth measurement (log (\u03a9\/\u25a1) will be referred to as a variation of volumetric resistivity hereinafter.

By contrast, in Example 3, an acceptable image was attained when the belt  had a variation of volumetric resistivity of 2.1 log \u03a9.cm or below. This difference indicates that volumetric resistance contributes to transferability less than surface resistivity. Therefore, to implement high transferability, the variation of volumetric resistance should only be 2.1 log \u03a9.cm or below in terms of a difference in logarithm; further reducing the variation would simply increase cost.","Example 4 used voltage control means for constant-voltage controlling primary bias applying means to thereby apply a constant voltage to each primary image transfer roller. In the case where a voltage for primary image transfer is susceptible to the area of a toner image or the thickness of a toner layer, transferability differs from a large image area to a small image area or from a monochromatic image to a composite color image, sometimes rendering image transfer short or excessive. Besides, even when the resistance of the belt  varies due to aging, if the bias for image transfer is subject to constant-current control, the image transfer voltage is apt to be short when resistance is high or excessive when it is low, causing transferability to vary or making image transfer irregular.","Example 4 is therefore advantageous when applied to the electrophotographic apparatus in which transferability is apt to vary due to the variation of the surface resistivity or the volumetric resistivity of the belt . Further, constant-voltage control unique to Example 4 prevents transferability from varying in accordance with the area of a toner image or the thickness of a toner layer and therefore obviates short or excessive image transfer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 8"],"b":["20","1","1","2","2","3","4","2"]},"As  indicates, constant-current control for the primary image transfer bias failed to implement acceptable image density when the image area ratio was 5%.

Carbon black was dispersed I a polyamic acid solution. The resulting dispersion was caused to flow on a metal drum, dried, peeled off in the form of a film, and then extended at high temperature to form a polyimide film. The polyimide film was cut in a suitable size to thereby produce a seamless belt formed of polyimide resin. Generally, to form a film, after a polymer solution with carbon black dispersed therein has been introduced into a hollow cylindrical mold, the mold is rotated while being heated at 100\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C. to thereby form a film by centrifugal molding. The film thus formed is removed form the mold in a half-set condition, put on an iron core, and then subject to polymide reaction at 300\u00b0 C. to 450\u00b0 C. and fully set thereby.","The belt produced by the above procedure had surface resistivity of 8.9\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 and volumetric resistivity of 1.5\u00d710\u03a9.cm. The volumetric resistivity of the belt varied by 1.18, as measured in the manner described previously.","While the illustrative embodiment is implemented as an indirect image transfer type of image forming apparatus shown in , it is similarly applicable to a direct mage transfer type of image forming apparatus.  shows a specific configuration of the direct image transfer type of image forming apparatus. As shown, a sheet S is conveyed by a registration roller pair  in synchronism with image formation effected with drums . While a belt conveyor \u2032 is conveying the sheet S, toner images of different colors are sequentially transferred from the drums  to the sheet S one above the other at consecutive image transfer stations . As for the rest of the configuration and operation, the image forming apparatus of this type is similar to the indirect image transfer type of image forming apparatus.","In , image transfer to the sheet S is effected in substantially same conditions as the secondary image transfer of the indirect image transfer type of image forming apparatus. Therefore, by applying the illustrative embodiment to the apparatus of , it is also possible to achieve the various advantages described above.","As stated above, the illustrative embodiment obviates defective images by using an intermediate image transfer body whose surface resistivity on the inner surface varies little, and obviates defective images ascribable to aging by using an intermediate image transfer body whose volume resistivity varies little.","An alternative embodiment of the present invention, which is directed mainly toward the second and third objects stated earlier, will be described hereinafter. The alternative embodiment to be described is also practicable with the electrophotographic color copier shown in . The following description will therefore concentrate on configurations unique to the alternative embodiment.","The problem with the intermediate image transfer type of electrophotographic copier is that irregular image transfer sometimes occurs on the belt  at the time of primary and secondary image transfer, as stated previously. More specifically, irregular image transfer occurs due to an irregular potential distribution, which is a replica of the potential distribution of a latent image on the drum  and appears on the belt  at the time of primary image transfer. Further, the above irregular potential distribution on the belt  remains thereon until the belt  again reaches the primary image transfer position after moving via the primary image transfer nip of the last color and secondary image transfer nip. The irregular potential distribution on the belt , which has moved away from the primary image transfer nip of the last color, sometimes accumulates at two or more of the consecutive primary image transfer positions. The illustrative embodiment is capable of obviating irregular image transfer ascribable to the above causes. Specific examples of the illustrative embodiment will be described hereinafter.","The belt  was implemented as a belt whose surface potential, as measured at a position to which a primary image transfer bias Vwas applied, decreased to V\/2 or below in 5 seconds since the application of the bias. More specifically, a surface potential attenuation ratio, i.e., the ratio of charge remaining on the belt  in 5 seconds to the original charge was \u00bd or less. Let such residual charge left on the belt  in 5 seconds be referred to as a 5-second potential hereinafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":["10","10"]},"Experimental results indicative of a relation between the surface potential attenuation ratio of the belt  and irregular image transfer will be described hereinafter.  lists irregular image transfer ranks determined with six belts Nos.  through  each having a particular surface potential attenuation ratio by use of the copier of . Irregularity of image transfer was estimated on images. For estimation, the belt was provided with a circumferential length of 1,178 mm and moved at a linear velocity of 282 mm\/sec.  shows curves each showing a potential left on particular one of the belts Nos.  through  after the application of 500 V.","The distance between nearby drums , i.e., nearby nips formed by nearby drums  and the belt  was selected to be 150 mm and was the same throughout the consecutive nips. In , a circle, a triangle and a cross respectively indicate \u201cgood\u201d, \u201callowable lower limit\u201d and \u201cno good\u201d.","As  indicates, when use was made of the belt No.  whose 5-second potential value was 207 V, the result of estimation was the lower limit. The belts Nos.  through  with 5-second potential values smaller than 207 V all were fully acceptable. On the other hand, the belts Nos.  and  with 5-second potential values of 436 V and 481 V, respectively, were not acceptable at all. This proves that the belt, having the surface potential attenuation ratio that decreases to \u00bd or below in 5 seconds, is successful to confine irregular image transfer in an allowable range.","As stated above, if the belt  has a 5-second potential value decreasing to \u00bd in 5 seconds after the application of the primary image transfer bias V, then the charge deposited on the belt  at the time of primary or secondary image transfer attenuates to a degree not effecting the next primary image transfer. More specifically, even if an irregular charge distribution, which is the replica of the potential distribution of the drum , appears on the belt , it does not remain in a critical amount at the time of the next primary image transfer. Moreover, even if charge of the same polarity as toner is deposited on the belt  at the secondary image transfer position, the potential does not remain in a critical amount at the time of the next primary image transfer.","In the tandem, intermediate image transfer type of apparatus configured to transfer a plurality of toner images to the belt  during one turn of the belt , the distance between nearby primary image transfer nips and the distance between the primary image transfer nip and the secondary image transfer nip tend to decrease. Therefore, a sufficient period of time is not available for the charge deposited on the belt  by, e.g., the voltage applied to the belt  to attenuate before the belt  again advances to the primary image transfer nip. Consequently, irregular image transfer occurs more than in an apparatus including a single photoconductive drum.","In the tandem apparatus, the bias for primary image transfer may be sequentially increased stepwise at the consecutive primary image transfer stations, so that transferability can be insured despite an increase in the surface potential of the belt . However, if the above bias is excessively high, then discharge occurs at the portions of the belt  where the surface potential is low, preventing the current from being used for primary image transfer and therefore lowering image transfer efficiency. Further, to increase the bias, a power supply with great capacity is necessary, resulting in an increase in cost.","It follows that the illustrative embodiment, capable of obviating irregular image transfer, is advantageous when applied to the tandem apparatus.","Example 2 is practicable with the same copier configuration as Example 1. This is also true with the other examples to follow. The following description will therefore concentrate on configurations unique to Example 2.","In Example 2, a period of time in which the surface potential of the portion of the belt  applied with a primary image transfer bias Vdrops to V\/2 is determined to be T seconds, which is the interval between the preceding and following primary image transfer. More specifically, T seconds is the interval between the time when a black toner image, which is the last one of four toner images constituting a composite color image, is transferred to the belt  and the time when a yellow toner image, which is the first one of four toner images, is transferred to the belt  after the secondary transfer of the above composite toner image to a sheet. Let the potential remaining on the belt  in T seconds be referred to as T-second potential.","Experimental results, indicating a relation between the surface potential attenuation ratio of the belt  in T seconds and irregular image transfer, will be described hereinafter.  additionally shows a relation between the surface potential attenuation ratio in T seconds and irregular image transfer determined with the belts Nos.  through  each having a particular surface potential attenuation ratio. T seconds can be produced by dividing the distance over which the belt  moves clockwise from Bk, , to Y, , via the rollers ,  and  by the linear velocity:\n\n={1178\u2212(150\u00d73)}\/282\u22482.6 (sec)\n","T seconds was therefore selected to be 2.6 seconds in Example 2.","As  indicates, the surface potential of the belt No.  dropped to 268 V in T (2.6) seconds since the application of the voltage of 500 V. Image transfer effected with the belt No.  was estimated to be \u201c\u0394\u201d, i.e., the allowable limit. The belts Nos.  through  whose surface potentials dropped more than the surface potential of the belt No.  all were estimated to be \u201c\u2218\u201d, i.e., acceptable. On the other hand, when the belts Nos.  and  whose surface potentials dropped only to 467 V and 489 V, respectively, were used, irregularity was estimated to be \u201cx\u201d, i.e., not acceptable at all. It will therefore be seen that the belts Nos.  through  whose surface potentials drop to \u00bd or below in T seconds are successful to obviate irregular image transfer.","As stated above, if the surface potential of the belt  drops to \u00bd or below after the application of the primary image transfer bias V, but before the next primary image transfer, then the charge deposited on the belt  by the preceding primary image transfer can attenuate to such a degree that it does not effect the following primary image transfer. Therefore, even if an irregular potential distribution, which is the replica of the potential distribution on the drum , appears on the belt , the potential attenuates, before the above irregular potential distribution reaches the next primary image transfer nip, to such a degree that it obviates irregular image transfer. In addition, the potential on the belt  attenuates to such a degree that irregular image transfer ascribable to other factors is obviated.","In Example 3, the belt  is provided with surface resistivity of 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or above, but 10\u03a9\/\u25a1 or below, on the inner surface thereof to which the primary image transfer bias Vo is applied. Hereinafter will be described experimental results indicating a relation between the surface resistivity of the inner surface of the belt  and image quality.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0131"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 1"],"b":["7","15"]},"As  indicates, when the belt No.  with the surface resistivity of less than 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 on the inner surface was used, the image transfer ratio was lowered to an unacceptable degree \u201cx\u201d. On the other hand, when the belt No.  with the surface resistivity of higher than 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 on the inner surface was used, discharge marks were found in the resulting image, so that the result of estimation was not acceptable as indicated by \u201cx\u201d. It will therefore be seen that by confining the surface resistivity of the rear surface of the belt  in the range of from 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 to 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1, it is possible to produce a desirable image whose image transfer ratio and discharge marks both lie in the acceptable range.","It will also be seen from  that the surface resistivity of the inner surface of the belt  and the 5-second potential or the T-second potential are not correlated to each other. Stated another way, the surface potential attenuation ratio of the belt  is not determined only by the surface potential of the inner surface of the belt .","The results of estimation shown in  may be accounted for by the following. If the surface resistivity of the inner surface of the belt  is lower than 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1, then the current derived from the primary image transfer voltage Vo applied to the primary image transfer roller  flows along the inner surface of the belt . As a result, the current flows not only to the expected drum  but also to another drum  adjoining it and is likely to disturb image transfer at the another drum . On the other hand, if the surface resistivity of the inner surface of the belt  is higher than 10\u03a9\/\u25a1, then the potential on the inner surface and the surface on the outer surface are unbalanced with the result that discharge is apt to occur between the belt  and a grounding member adjoining it. Such discharge causes a discharge mark to appear in the resulting toner image.","Considering the experimental results stated above, Example 3 uses, among the belts Nos.  through  with rear-surface resistivities lying in the above range, the belt No. , , ,  or  whose 5-second potential and T-second potential both are \u00bd or less.","Generally, when toner images of different colors are sequentially stacked to form a full-color image, toner rises to substantial height and is likely to be scattered around. This kind of toner scattering (referred to as stack scattering hereinafter) is particularly conspicuous on characters and other line images. In light of this, in Example 4, the maximum amount of toner to deposit on a line portion included in a single-color toner image, which is to be transferred to the belt , is limited to 0.7 mg\/cm. This will be described more specifically with reference to  showing experimental results.  lists the properties of belts Nos.  through  used for the experiment. The estimation of stack scattering shown in  was conducted with a modified machine of Imagio Color 5100 (trade name) available from RICOH CO., LTD. For estimation, the amount of toner to deposit on a two-color line image was varied so as to determine stack scattering ranks in numerical values.","Stack scattering is influenced by the amount of toner deposited on an image, as known in the art, and particularly critical on lines. In light of this, how the amount of toner deposited on a line portion is measured will be described first.  shows a device for measuring the amount of toner deposited while  each show a particular image sample to be measured.","To measure the amount of toner with the device of , a nozzle, fluidly communicated to a suction pump and provided with a filter, sucks toner and stores it therein and is then removed from the pump. The weight of toner deposited is determined by subtracting the weight of the nozzle before suction from the weight of the same after suction.","The image samples shown in  are a line image and a solid image, respectively, both of which have a total area of 3 cm. The amount of toner deposited on the line image or the solid image for a unit area can therefore be determined. More specifically, the image sample of  consists of five groups of ten lines each being 0.35 mm wide and 17.0 mm high while the image sample of  consists of a single solid image that is 30.0 mm wide and 10.9 mm high.","The device shown in  is operated to suck toner deposited on each of the above line image and solid image, and then the amount of toner deposited is determined in terms of weight. For the experiment, use is made of black toner. As for the solid image, the amount of toner is determined in terms of density by a spectral densitometer X-Rite 938 (trade name) after secondary image transfer, but before fixation.","A relation between the amount of toner deposited and stack scattering rank was determined with each of the belts Nos.  through , , with respect to a two-color line image.  lists the relation thus determined.  is a graph derived from the data shown in ; the ordinate and abscissa indicate stack scattering ranks  through  and the amounts of toner, respectively. The higher the rank, the smaller the amount of stack scattering. Ranks  and  are satisfactory as to image quality.","As  indicates, when the belts Nos.  through  whose 5-second and T-second potentials both were \u00bd or below were used, the resulting relations between the amount of toner and stack scattering did not noticeably differ from each other, but showed similar tendency. This indicates that if the amount of toner deposited on a two-color line image is 1.4 mg or less, i.e., 0.7 mg or less for a single color, then the stack scattering rank 4 or above is achievable. This is why Example 4 limits the maximum amount of toner to deposit on the line portion of a single-color toner image, which is to be transferred to the belt , to 0.7 mg\/cm.","Assume that the maximum amount of toner to deposit on the line portion of a single-color toner image, which is to be transferred to the belt  is a mg\/cm, and that the maximum amount of toner to deposit on the solid portion of a single-color toner image is b mg\/cm. Then, in Example 5, the ratio of the amount a to the amount b (referred to as a line\/solid ratio a\/b hereinafter) is confined in the range of:\n\n1.0\u22661.4\n","More specifically,  is a graph showing the amount of toner deposited on and the density of a solid portion, and the relation between the amount of toner deposited on the solid portion (solid amount hereinafter) and the amount of toner deposited on a line portion (line amount hereinafter) with respect to various ratios a\/b. The amount of toner deposited was measured in the same manner as in Example 4.","Generally, the target density of a solid image is 1.3 or above. As  indicates, to implement such image density, the solid amount must be 0.5 mg\/cmor above when use is made of pulverized toner. To implement the solid amount of 0.5 mg\/cmor above and to obviate stack scattering stated in relation to Example 4, the line amount must be 0.7 mg\/cmor below. This condition can be satisfied if the line\/solid amount ratio is 1.4 or below. Further, the ratio a\/b is generally not less than 1.0 because toner deposits on a line portion more than on a solid portion for a unit area because of, e.g., the edge effect known in the art.","For the reasons stated above, the above conditions can be satisfied at the same time if the ratio a\/b lies in the range of 1.0\u2266a\/b\u22661.4. If this condition is satisfied, then it is possible to obviate stack scattering while insuring solid image density of 1.3 or above.","In a zone X indicated by hatching in , there are satisfied all of the conditions that the solid amount be 0.5 mg\/cmor above, that the line amount be 0.7 mg\/cmor below, and that the ratio a\/b be 1 or above. In , lines with numerical values of 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 indicate line\/solid ratios a\/b; the longer the part of the line lying in the zone X, the greater the margin as to the above three conditions required. It will therefore be seen that as the ratio a\/b approaches 1.0, there can be obviated stack scattering more positively while insuring the solid image density of 1.3 or above.","A method of satisfying the range of the ration a\/b stated above will be described hereinafter.  is a graph showing a relation between a gap Gp for development and the ratio a\/b. The gap Gp refers to a distance between the sleeve for depositing toner on the drum  and the drum . As shown, the gap Gp and ratio a\/b have a positive correlation; the ratio a\/b increases with an increase in gap Gp. It is therefore possible to confine the ratio a\/b in the range of from 1.0 to 1.4 by adjusting the gap Gp. In the illustrative embodiment, if the gap Gp is between 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm. then the ratio a\/b can be confined in the range of from 1.0 to 1.4. This, however, depends on the linear velocity ratio of the sleeve to the drum and other conditions for the developing device as well as on the carrier resistance of a developer. In the illustrative embodiment, the above linear velocity ratio is selected to be 2.0 while use is made of a developer whose carrier resistance is 1\u00d710\u03a9 lying in the usual range of from 1\u00d710\u03a9 to 1\u00d710\u03a9.","Another method of confining the ratio a\/b in the particular range stated above is to adjust the resistance of carrier grains that convey toner grains electrostatically deposited thereon to the drum . For example, by lowering the resistance of the carrier grains, it is possible to reduce the strength of an electric field at the contour of an image between the sleeve and the drum  and therefore to prevent toner grains form depositing more on the contour than on the other portion of the image. This reduces to a certain degree an occurrence that the line amount becomes larger than the solid amount, thereby limiting the ratio a\/b to 1.4 or below.","Example 5 will be described in relation to Comparative Example 5 hereinafter. Pulverized toner with circularity of 0.91 was used. The belt  had surface resistivity of 1.13\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 on the inner surface, a 5-second potential of 11 V, a T-second potential of 16 V, and thickness of 85 m. The belt  was implemented as a single-layer seamless belt formed of polyimide with carbon black dispersed therein. The gap Gp for development was 0.3 mm in Example 5 or 0.5 mm in comparative Example 5.  shows the results of experiments conducted with Example 5 and comparative Example 5","As  indicates, when the gap Gp is 0.3 mm as in Example 5, the line amount decreases for given solid density, compared to the gap of 0.5 selected in Comparative Example 5. It is therefore possible to limit the ratio a\/b to 1.4 or below for thereby reducing stack scattering.","Use was made of toner having mean circularity of 0.95 or above. The belt  had the same configuration as in Example 5. Although the spherical toner was polymerized toner formed of modified polyester, the material and production method are open to choice.","The mean circularity of toner is measured by a flow type, grain image analyzer FPIA-2100 available from SYSMEX. More specifically, a 1% NaCl aqueous solution is prepared by use of primary sodium chloride and then passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. After 0.1 ml to 5 ml of surfactant, preferably alkylbenzene sulfonate, has been added as a dispersant to 50 ml to 100 ml of the resulting solution, 1 mg to 10 mg of sample was added. The resulting mixture is dispersed for 1 minute by an ultrasonic dispersing device to thereby prepare a dispersion whose grain density is between 1,000\/\u03bcl to 15,000\/\u03bcl. Assuming that the diameter of a circle having the same area as a bidimensional image picked up by a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) camera is a diameter corresponding to a circle, diameters of 0.6 m and above are determined to be valid on the basis of the accuracy of the CCD camera and used to calculate mean circularity. Mean circularity can be determined by adding the circularity of such grains and then dividing the sum by the number of grains. Further, the mean circularity of the individual grain can be calculated by dividing the circumferential length of a circle identical in projection area as the grain image by the circumferential length of the projected image of the grain.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0154"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 29"],"sup":["2 ","2 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0155"},"figref":"FIG. 30","sup":["2 ","2 "]},"Thus, the solid amount of 0.4 mg\/cmor above, line amount of 0.7 mg\/cmor below and ratio a\/b of 1 or above all are achievable with spherical toner in a zone Y indicated by hatching in . The zone Y is larger in area than the zone X shown in  and derived from pulverized toner. It will therefore be seen that a broader a\/b range and therefore a greater margin is achievable with spherical toner than with pulverized toner. Spherical toner therefore increases a margin as to the amount of deposition.","Toner with circularity of 0.93 or below cannot form a layer having a uniform thickness and a uniform surface, so that the chance that the toner contacts a sheet or the belt  decreases. This lowers image transfer efficiency and therefore makes it necessary to increase the image transfer current to thereby aggravate discharge in the event of separation. By contrast, spherical toner with high mean circularity makes the short image density discussed above difficult to occur even when a relatively low amount of toner deposition is selected, increasing the margin as to the ratio a\/b.","The shape of toner is represented by shape indices SF-1 and SF-2. SF-1 and SF-2 are defined by randomly sampling the images of a hundred toner grains having grain sizes of 2 \u03bcm and above and enlarged by, e.g., FE-SEM (S-800) (trade name) available from HITACHI by 1,000. More specifically, the image information of 100 toner grains randomly sampled are input to, e.g., an image analyzer Luzex III available from NICORE via an interface and then analyzed.","The shape indices SF-1 and SF-2 respective indicate the degree of circularity and the degree of irregularity of the individual toner grain. When SF-1 is smaller than 135, the shape of toner approaches amorphousness away from circularity and cannot form a layer having a uniform thickness and a uniform surface, resulting in the problem stated above.","Example 6, successfully reducing stack scattering with the particular gap and spherical toner, will be described in relation to Comparative Example 6 using pulverized toner hereinafter. Circular toner and pulverized toner had circularities of 0.91 and 0.98, respectively. The belt  was implemented by a seamless single-layer belt formed of polyimide with carbon black dispersed therein. The belt  had a 5-second potential of 11 V and a T-second potential of 16 V, as measured by the device of , and thickness of 85 \u03bcm. The gap for development was 0.4 mm in both of Example 6 and Comparative Example 6.  compares Example 6 and Comparative Example 6 by using experimental results.","As  indicates, Example 6, using spherical toner, reduces the line amount to 0.58 mg\/cmsmaller than that attainable with Comparative Example 6, which uses pulverized toner, for substantially the same solid image density, realizing stack scattering rank 5. Also, as for the omission of the inside of an image ascribable to image transfer pressure, Example 6 is superior to Comparative Example 6 because spherical toner is packed more densely than pulverized toner and therefore lower in the height of a toner image than pulverized toner, so that the stress concentration of a toner image at the image transfer position is reduced.","In Example 6, in the zone Y shown in , the solid amount is 0.5 mg\/cmor above while the line amount is 0.7 mg\/cmor below for obviating stack scattering. A ratio a\/b of about 1.6 or below suffices to satisfy the above conditions. Further, because the ratio a\/b is generally not less than 1.0, the ratio should only lie in the range of 1.0\u2266a\/b\u22661.6. This means that the a\/b range is broader than in Example 5 using pulverized toner.","As shown in , the belt  used in Example 7 is made up of a base layer and a surface layer . In Example 7, the surface layer was formed of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), which is fluorine-based resin. While fluorine-based resin may be any one of TFE (tetrafluoroethylene), FET (tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluloroethylene copolymer) and so forth, such a material is only illustrative. PTFE was coated on the base layer to thickness of 5 \u03bcm. A belt No.  having the same base layer as the above belt , but lacking the surface layer , was prepared.  compares the belt No.  and the belt, designated by No. , having both of the base layer and surface layer as to image quality.","As  indicates, the belt No.  with the surface layer reduced irregular image transfer more positively than the belt No. . Further, the belt  allowed toner left thereon after secondary image transfer to be removed more desirably than the belt . More specifically, when portions where toner strongly adheres to the belt, e.g., where many colors are stacked exist, the toner is apt to remain on the belt and bring about irregular image transfer. Example 7, promoting the separation of toner from the belt , desirably obviates even this kind of irregular image transfer. In addition, toner can be easily peeled off from the belt , so that efficient cleaning is achievable.","As stated above, in the illustrative embodiment, assuming that the weight-mean grain size and number-mean grain size of toner are Xw and Xn, respectively, then a ratio Xw\/Xn should preferably be 1.35 or below. If the ratio Xw\/Xn is greater than 1.35, then the thickness and surface of a toner layer are not uniform in the same manner as described in relation to the shape index SF-1, lowering image transfer efficiency. As a result, it is likely that the image transfer current increases and aggravates discharge at the time of separation.","In the illustrative embodiment, the cohesion of toner should preferably be small, so that the thickness of a toner layer between the belt  and a sheet be uniformed. Further, the uniform surface of a toner layer allows an even electric field to act on the individual toner grains for thereby enhancing efficient image transfer. Moreover, there can be reduced the amount of charge to deposit on a sheet and therefore toner scattering ascribable to discharge at the time of separation. The cohesion of toner may be represented by a degree of cohesion (%); the higher the degree of cohesion, the stronger the cohesion or toner.","To measure the degree of cohesion, use was made of POWDER TESTER TYPE PT-N available from HOSOKAWA MICRONS. POWDER TESTER was operated in accordance with its operation manual except that 75 \u03bcm, 45 \u03bcm and 22 \u03bcm sieves were used and that vibration time was 30 seconds. The degree of cohesion of toner should be between 5% and 20%, preferably between 5% and 15%. A degree of cohesion below 5% would make the fluidity of toner excessively high and cause toner to be easily scattered at the time of image transfer. A degree of cohesion above 20% would obstruct the transfer of toner.","When the secondary image transfer bias Vis applied to the belt  at the secondary image transfer position as in the illustrative embodiment, irregularity occurs in a toner image transferred to the belt  by primary image transfer, as determined by experiments. More specifically, the surface potential of the belt  moved away from the secondary image transfer nip N differs from the portion of the belt  facing a sheet to the other portion not facing it, resulting in a potential contrast. This potential contrast sometimes remains on the belt  up to the primary image transfer nip following the secondary image transfer nip N. If the next toner image is transferred to the belt  by primary image transfer over the portions of the belt  where the potential contrast exists, stripe-like density irregularity occurs in accordance with the potential contrast.","Example 8 is capable of obviating irregular image transfer ascribable to the potential contrast stated above. In Example 8, a belt whose surface potential decreased to V\/2 or below in 5 seconds after the application of the secondary image transfer bias Vwas used as the belt . Again, the device shown in  was used to measure the surface potential attenuation ratio of the belt .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0171","num":"0170"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","1","6"]},"As  indicates, when use was made of the belt No.  whose 5-second potential after the application of 500 V was 207 V, irregularity was estimated to be the allowable limit, \u201c\u0394\u201d. The belts Nos.  through  whose 5-second potentials were even lower than 207 V all were acceptable, \u201c\u2218\u201d. On the other hand, the belts Nos.  and  whose 5-second potentials were only 436 V and 481 V, respectively, were not allowable at all, \u201cx\u201d. It will therefore be seen that if the 5-second potential of the belt  decreases to V\/2 or below after the application of the secondary image transfer bias V, then the charge of the belt  deposited by secondary image transfer successfully attenuates to a degree not disturbing the next primary image transfer.","Thus, even when an irregular potential distribution, which is the replica of the potential distribution of a latent image formed on the drum , appears on the belt , it does not remain to a critical degree when the belt  arrives at the next primary image transfer nip.","Example 9 is identical with Example 8 as to the configuration of the copier except for the following. In Example 9, a period of time in which the surface potential of the belt  attenuates to V\/2 after the application of the secondary image transfer bias Vwas selected to be U seconds, which was the interval between secondary image transfer and the primary image transfer following it. Let the potential remaining on the belt  in U seconds be referred to as a U-second potential hereinafter.","Experimental results representative of a relation between the U-second potential and irregular image transfer will be described hereinafter. U seconds can be calculated by dividing a distance between the secondary image transfer nip N, , and the primary transfer nip N assigned to the first color in the direction of movement of the belt  by the linear velocity of the belt :\n\n410\/282\u22481.45 seconds\n","As  indicates, when the belt No.  whose U-second (1.45 seconds) was 311 V was used, irregularity was estimated to be the allowable limit, \u201c\u0394\u201d The belts Nos.  through  whose U-second potentials were even lower than 207 V all were acceptable, \u201c\u2218\u201d. On the other hand, the belts Nos.  and  whose U-second potentials were only 80 V and 485 V, respectively, were not allowable at all, \u201cx\u201d. It will therefore be seen that if the U-second potential of the belt  decreases to \u00bd or below after the application of the secondary image transfer bias V, then the charge of the belt  deposited by secondary image transfer successfully attenuates to a degree not disturbing the next primary image transfer.","Thus, even when an irregular potential distribution, which is the replica of the potential distribution of a latent image formed on the drum , appears on the belt , it does not remain to a critical degree when the belt  arrives at the next primary image transfer nip. Also, the potential on the belt  attenuates to a degree that obviates irregularity ascribable to other factors.","Reference will be made to  for describing another alternative embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the drum or image carrier is movable in a direction indicated by an arrow. Conventional negative-to-positive image forming means forms a toner image of preselected polarity on the drum . The toner image forming means includes a charger for uniformly charging the surface of the drum  to negative polarity, the exposing device  for exposing the charged surface of the drum  imagewise, and the developing device  for developing the resulting toner image with toner to thereby produce a corresponding toner image.","In the case of a full-color image forming apparatus, four developing devices are arranged around the drum  and respectively assigned to, e.g., yellow, magenta, cyan and black, although not shown specifically.

A power supply  applies a bias opposite in polarity to the polarity of toner, i.e., a positive bias in the illustrative embodiment to the conductive brush . An electric field formed between the belt  and the drum  by the brush  transfers the toner image of negative polarity from the drum  to the belt .","The brush  may, of course be replaced with a roller formed of conductive rubber or a blade formed of a conductive material or even with a corona charger, if desired.","The toner image transferred to the belt  is transferred to a sheet S by a secondary image transfer roller or secondary image transferring means . Subsequently, the toner image on the sheet is fixed by the fixing unit .","As stated above, the second and third embodiments described above, implemented as an intermediate image transfer type of image forming apparatus each, obviate irregular image transfer otherwise occurring at the time of primary image transfer N due to an irregular potential distribution deposited on the intermediate image transfer body at the time of primary image transfer N preceding the above image transfer.","Further, there can be obviated irregular image transfer otherwise occurring at the time of primary image transfer N, which follows secondary image transfer N, due to the potential contrast of the intermediate image transfer body occurred at the time of secondary image transfer N.","Various modifications will become possible for those skilled in the art after receiving the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the scope thereof."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken with the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 3 and 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIGS. 9 and 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 32"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 17"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 35"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
