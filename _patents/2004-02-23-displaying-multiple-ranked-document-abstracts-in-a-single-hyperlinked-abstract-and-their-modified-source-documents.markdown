{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/016,488, filed Jan. 30, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,742,163 B1, which claims priority from Application No. 9-019393, filed Jan. 31, 1997 in Japan, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a computerized document processing system for abstracting a computerized document obtained by sending a keyword or the like via a network.","2. Description of Related Art","With the spread of Internet, users are now allowed to readily access information on Internet by using WWW. Then, many individuals and corporations have come to publicly disclose a hyper-text file called a Web page.","However, it has become difficult for each individual user to know where a Web page required by the user is located and to know what should be specified as an URL address to obtain the required Web page.","Then, a system for retrieving accessible Web pages per their contents has been developed for that end and its service has come to be given. That is, such Web retrieve server has allowed a Web page containing a keyword to be retrieved by specifying the keyword. Users have used to retrieve necessary Web pages by using such Web retrieve server.","Hitherto, it has general practice to list a certain amount of document titles, headers or keywords of documents and pages on the upper rank in a retrieve result. Some retrieve server has also registered manually prepared outlines or introductions of pages to present as a retrieved result. Looking at the result, the user has used to determine whether or not to directly make reference to the retrieved page.","Hereinafter, one represented about each document when the retrieved result is thus presented will be referred to as an \u201cabstract\u201d of the document and a page in which \u201cabstracts\u201d of each document are collected will be referred to as an abstract page or an abstract document.","Then, as a method for presenting the retrieved result, it is conceivable to represent a portion where a retrieve word occurs within a retrieved document by KWIC (Key Word In Context). The KWIC representation is a suitable representation method in discriminating a retrieved page in general. However, the KWIC representation is not actually realized for an abstract of a retrieved result of the retrieve server. The reason thereof will be described below.","The presentation of the above-mentioned retrieved result is carried out by one retrieve server. The retrieve server cannot spend much processing time for presenting the retrieved result because it has to respond to retrieve requests of many and unspecified users. Accordingly, the retrieve server presents one which can be generated by a very simple process as the retrieved result. Or, the retrieve server normally uses a method of creating a text to be presented as a retrieved result in advance about one document and of presenting it when the document is retrieved.","Because the KWIC representation is a process requiring more processing amount and because retrieval character strings differ every time when a retrieval is made, it cannot be created in advance. Accordingly, it has not been realized so much.","It is also conceivable to stretch a link from a portion where the KWIC representation is made so that the appropriate portion of the original page may be directly referred in representing by KWIC. However, the original page must be modified in order to stretch the link. It is then conceivable to deal with that by modifying a copy of the document in representing by KWIC while holding the document to be retrieved on a local disk of the retrieve server as it is. However, it is difficult to hold all the Internet documents to be retrieved in terms of capacity. It is also difficult in terms of copy right to modify the copy.","It is also conceivable to obtain a document in the high order of the retrieved result from the site where the document exists and to modify the document to utilize for the KWIC representation. However, because it takes several minutes or more, it cannot be realized for the retrieve server responding to retrieve requests of many users.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a computerized document processing system which allows processes in creating an abstract to be distributed and an original document to be readily modified to relate the abstract with the original document (e.g. link, highlighting of extracted character string and the like) not by generating the abstract document, i.e. the retrieved result, in the retrieve server but by incorporating a module for presenting the retrieved result on the client side or by holding copies of all Web pages in the retrieve server within a local net called Intranet in which there is no problem in terms of copy right and by realizing the KWIC representation by modifying it appropriately.","According to the present invention, there is provided a computerized document processing system which allows processes in creating an abstract to be distributed and an original document to be readily modified to relate the abstract with the original document.","The computerized document processing system comprises a keyword holding section for holding keywords, document storage section for holding a computerized document transferred via a network, abstract creating section for creating an abstract by extracting at least a character string containing a keyword held in the keyword holding section from the computerized document held in the document storage section, document modifying section for modifying the computerized document such that it can be represented by relating with the abstract created by the abstract creating section, and modified document storage section for storing the computerized document modified by the document modifying section. The computerized document processing system presents the abstract created by the abstract creating section and presents the modified computerized document linked to a predetermined portion of the presented abstract by reading it from the modified document storage section in correspondence to a specification made by a user.","The specific nature of the invention, as well as other objects, uses and advantages thereof, will clearly appear from the following description and from the accompanying drawings.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained below with reference to the drawings.","At first, terms used in the following description of the invention will be explained.","\u2018Internet\u2019 is a world-wide electronic information communication network which is now spreading.","\u2018HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)\u2019 is an artificial language which prescribes computerized documents or a representation format of computerized documents in particular and which allows a represented document or its location to be quickly changed. A computerized document containing the HTML description is called a HTML document. Each individual HTML description within the HTML document is called a tag in general. The HTML document is also called a Web page or simply as a page occasionally.","The HTML tag is described as a character string put between symbols \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d. The HTML document is a text file. It is noted that the part put between \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d will be called an inside of the tag hereinafter. One tag is also represented as \u201c< . . . >\u201d. Here, while \u201c . . . \u201d is an arbitrary character string, it shall be a character string containing no symbol \u201c>\u201d.","\u2018Internet document\u2019 is a computerized document which can be accessed, i.e. can be referred or updated, which can be received, i.e. can be obtained, and which can be transmitted, i.e. can be registered via Internet. \u2018WEB document\u2019 and \u2018WWW document\u2019 also have the same meaning. \u2018WWW document\u2019 means specifically a computerized document described by HTML.","\u2018URL (Universal Resource Location)\u2019 is a format for describing a location on a network where an Internet document is located and its document name and is document information described by that.","While \u2018browser\u2019 means a system or a software for representing a computerized document, it specifically means a system or a software for representing a HTML document. Normally, the browser is provided with means for obtaining a document described by URL via Internet. The browser analyzes the HTML tag described in each portion in the HTML document and presents each portion by a representation mode specified by the tag.","\u2018KWIC (Key Word In Context)\u2019 is one of methods for presenting a retrieved result of a full text retrieved to the computerized document. It is a representation format which represents a retrieve keyword together with character strings before and after that when the retrieve keyword occurs. It brings about an effect that it allows to know by a certain degree that the keyword is used in what kind of context.","\u2018FTP (File Translation Protocol)\u2019 is a protocol spread to transmit\/receive computerized documents, computerized data and programs via Internet.","\u2018Site\u2019 is a location which is one unit in a computer network in terms of a logical structure. Normally, each corporation, academy and public organization composes one site, respectively. Each site has address information assigned per site for communication. The above-mentioned FTP and URL are arranged so as to describe the address information therein.","\u2018Down-load\u2019 is an operation for receiving and obtaining a file from a certain site. \u2018Up-load\u2019 is an operation for transmitting and registering a file to a certain site.","\u2018Link\u2019 means tagging for quickly changing a represented document or a represented location specifically in the HTML document. \u201cStretch a link\u201d or \u201cEmbed a link\u201d mean to dispose means for quickly changing a presentation to a certain location of a document B in a certain location where a document A is represented. It is realized by inserting a specific tag to the appropriate location of the documents A and B.","Because the portion to which the link is stretched is specially represented by changing a color of characters or by drawing an underline in representing that portion in the document A, the user can understand that there exists the link. Further, because a shape of a mouse cursor changes when a pointing device on the screen called a mouse is placed on an appropriate portion, the user can also understand that there exists the link. Then, when the mouse cursor is placed on the appropriate portion and then the mouse button is clicked, the display is changed to the document B or to a portion linked within the document B.","It is also possible to link to a button or a pattern called an icon within the document A. Stretching the link to a certain character string or a pattern within the document A is called as rendering that portion clickable. Such portion is also said to be clickable.","\u2018Server client system\u2019 is a process lately developed on computer networks such as LAN and Internet and is a system for distributing the whole processes by harmoniously advancing the process while communicating between a small number of fast and large capacity computers called a server and having a hardware and software structure per each content of service and a large number of computers called a client responsible for a user interface function of various services in general. A retrieve server described later is a server provided to give a document retrieving service on Internet.","\u2018Home page\u2019 means a WWW document prepared per each site. There is a case when each individual prepares a home page.","In general, a home page is a public entry point of a corporation or a group and is a page to which a user who accesses to its site by some intent visits at first. Normally, a link is stretched from the home page to a plurality of pages prepared per low order organization or subject. In such a case, the former page to which the user visits at first is called a top page and the latter low order page is called a sub-page. Normally, the sub-page has a link further to a lower order sub-page and is constructed hierarchically.","\u2018Intranet\u2019 is a LAN laid normally per corporation, group and its sub-organization. Security and traffic control are attained in unit of that organization.","\u2018HTTP server\u2019 is a computer server on a LAN processing HTTP message communication. The HTTP server receives a HTTP message from a client and transmits\/receives a file to\/from an external computer based on a inter-computer communication protocol called TCP\/IP. The file sent from the external computer is sent to the HTTP client who has requested the file and in the same time, is stored temporarily in a memory area of the HTTP server called a cache. Then, when there is a request to the same file from the same client or from the other client, the file existing in the cache is taken out and is sent to the client unless no specific setting is made. Thus, the file stored once in the cache of the HTTP server is not communicated again between the computer in which the file has originally existed, thus distributing the load of the processing. Further, a time for obtaining the file is shortened by storing it in the cache.","When there exist many client machines within a LAN, the LAN is divided and hierarchized and a server called a PROXY server is provided per each LAN. It is then arranged such that the clients within the LAN transmit\/receive a HTTP message to\/from each PROXY server, not the HTTP server, and such that only each PROXY server exchanges the HTTP message directly with the HTTP server. Thereby, the load of the HTTP server can be distributed.","It is noted that the following description will be made by exemplifying a case when a computerized document to be retrieved and to be abstracted is a HTML document and a keyword within the abstract created from the computerized document is represented by KWIC.","Further, the abstract created in the following description is a computerized document obtained by shortening the computerized document in order to grasp an outline of the acquired computerized document and comprises a title of the document, a line including a clue phrase, a header line and a KWIC line including a keyword extracted from the retrieved computerized document.","There is a case when the original computerized document modified so as to be linked with the abstract is called a KWIC document.","[First Embodiment]",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"In , the abstract creating system  comprises a keyword holding section , an abstract processing section  and a document storage section .","The keyword holding section  holds keywords used by the abstract processing section  in creating an abstract document represented by KWIC.","The document storage section  holds a computerized document to be retrieved and to be abstracted, an abstract document created from the computerized document and a document modified to represent by KWIC.","It is noted that the document modified to represent by KWIC will be referred to as a KWIC document hereinafter.","The abstract processing section  analyzes a computerized document, e.g. a HTML document; stored in the document storage section  to extract character strings before and after a keyword to create an abstract document represented by KWIC and copies and modifies the original computerized document to embed a HTML tag at a location where the keyword occurs within the text so that the keyword part within the document can be perceived. Further, it stretches a link by embedding a specific tag corresponding to the both documents of the abstract document and the KWIC document so that an appropriate location within the original document can be quickly referred from each KWIC representation in the abstract document.","The operation of the abstract processing section  of the abstract creating system  shown in  will be explained below with reference to a flow chart shown in .","At first, the abstract processing section  reads a document to be abstracted as a pre-processing to unify character codes or to divide an extremely long line in Step S.","While there exist JIS code, SJIS code and EUC code as Kanji codes used in Japanese computerized texts, they are translated appropriately to unify into any one of them. It is also arranged such that no HTML tag is divided, i.e. it is not line-fed between the symbols \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d, in dividing a line and such that no two byte character code is divided.","An algorithm for dividing a line is implemented as follows.","At first, a maximum length N of one line is set in advance. Next, when length of a certain line is N or more, it is determined whether or not the N-th character from the head of the line is an inside of some tag. It is implemented concretely as follows.","Symbols \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d whose location of occurrence are closest to N are selected among those occurring at the portion less than N letters from the head of the line and their values are set as a and b, respectively. When they do not exist, the value is set as zero.","When a is greater than b, it can be seen that the N-th letter from the head of the line is a location where the symbol \u201c<\u201d has occurred before that and where the symbol \u201c>\u201d does not occur after that occurrence, i.e. that it is the inside of some tag.","When it is determined to be the inside of some tag, the line is divided before the symbol \u201c<\u201d at the location closest to N, i.e. at the point of letter a\u22121 from the head of the line.","When a=1, i.e. when there exists \u201c<\u201d at the head of the line and the tag exceeds N letters, the line is fed behind the location of \u201c<\u201d which occurs at first counting from the head of the line. In this case, the length of one line exceeds N. The line is fed at the N-th letter from the head of the line when a tag removing system and a tag scope discriminating process which appear in the process thereafter complement to a case in which a line-feed is inserted in the middle of a tag. In this case, the line is fed within the tag.","When a line is divided and length of a character string behind the point where the line-feed has been implemented is more than N, the above-mentioned process is repeated on that. Thereby, the same process is repeated until when a character string after line-feed becomes less than N.","The following processes are repeated on each line after the pre-processing (Steps S through S).","At first, when a line contains tags <TITLE> . . . <\/TITLE>, a character string between those two tags is extracted as a title and is registered in a title register in Steps S and S. As for the title line, no extraction of KWIC line, clue phrase line, header line and head line is implemented.","There is a case when the tag <TITLE> and the tag <\/TITLE> do not exist in the same line and several lines exist therebetween. In such a case, a character string within a scope of the tag <TITLE> must be determined and extracted precisely speaking. This process will be described later.","When a keyword held in the keyword holding section  is contained in part of the line other than the HTML tag part, a KWIC line counter is incremented to remove the tags contained in the line to extract as a KWIC line and to register in the KWIC line register. Then, tags keyed by a KWIC computerized document name and a KWIC line number registered in the KWIC line counter and a tag specifying highlighting are inserted before and after the keyword part within the KWIC line in Steps S and S.","There is a case when a keyword exists while straddling lines. Then, in order to prevent its extraction from being omitted, such keyword is detected from a line in which a previous line temporarily held is connected with a current line. When a plurality of keywords are contained, the same process is implemented on each keyword.","Next, when a clue phrase is contained in part of the line other than the HTML tag part, a clue phrase line counter is incremented to remove the tag contained in the line to extract as a clue phrase line and to register in the clue phrase line register in Steps S and S.","A clue phrase is a word, an idiom or a phrase in general which occurs before or after an important part of a document and which is often contained in a text showing an outline of the page. They include, for example:","\u201cWelcome to\u201d","\u201cIn this home page\u201d","\u201cIn our company\u201d, and the like.","It is helpful to extract a sentence containing a word or a representation like the clue phrase and to present it within the abstract document to understand the outline of the document.","Next, a tag contained in the line or a tag in which the line is in the scope thereof is checked. When the tag is a header, a header line counter is incremented to remove the tag contained in the line to extract as a header line and to register in the header line register in Steps S and S.","HTML showing that one is a header line include, for example:\n\n","It is noted that the scope of tag will be described later.","Removing the tags means to delete a portion interposed between the symbols \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d within a character string of a line, together with those symbols.","The following exceptional process is executed in removing the tags.","Although a long line is divided in the pre-processing so that the line is not divided in the middle of a tag, i.e. so that the line is not divided in the middle of the portion interposed between \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d, there is a case when a line is divided within a tag when the tag is extremely long. In this case, the line is divided into two lines of \u201c . . . < . . . $\u201d and \u201c^ . . . > . . . \u201d. Here, \u201c . . . \u201d is an arbitrary character string containing no symbols \u201c<\u201d and \u201c>\u201d and the symbols \u201c$\u201d and \u201c^\u201d are expedient symbols for showing the last of the line and the head of the line, respectively. In such a case, the character string \u201c< . . . $\u201d of the line \u201c . . . < . . . $\u201d is removed and the character string \u201c ^ . . . >\u201d of the line \u201c^. . . \u201d is deleted in removing the tags.","Next, a head line counter is incremented unconditionally until reaching a predetermined fixed letter amount (threshold value) from the head of the document to remove the tags from the line, to extract as a head line and to register in a head line register in Steps S and S. At this time, it is not extracted when no letter remains when the tags are removed. The title line is not also extracted.","The fixed letter amount is N\u00d7M, wherein M is a number of letters of one line which can be represented in representing by standard fonts of a standard browser for example and N is a number of lines presented as an abstract of one document.","When there is no restriction on a storage device such as a memory, the character string from which the tags have been removed are registered in the head line register for all the read lines. This case will be explained in the following description.","Next, the read lines are output as a KWIC computerized document in Steps S through S. While this KWIC computerized document is almost the same with the original computerized document, the HTML tags are embedded before and after the keyword to specify to represent the keyword by bold or large fonts, by reversed white letters, by italic or by adding an underline so that the keyword portion within the document is highlighted when it is represented. The HTML tag which indicates a destination of link from the abstract document is also embedded. What is presented when the user reads the abstract document and refers to the original page via the link embedded within the abstract document is the KWIC document.","As for a line containing a keyword, it is output by inserting tags keyed by the KWIC line number registered in the KWIC line counter and tags specifying highlighting before and after the keyword in the line. As for a line containing no keyword, the line is output as it is after the end of the pre-processing.","After reading all the lines of the document and extracting the header line, the clue phrase line and the KWIC line as described above, a certain number of lines are selected from the extracted lines under the criterion described below to output as an abstract of the document in Steps S and S. The process for selecting lines to represent as the abstract is an output adjusting process.","The output adjusting process will be explained below. It is noted that in the following explanation, a number of letters of one line which can be represented by the standard fonts of the standard browser shall be denoted by M and a number of lines presented as an abstract of one document shall be denoted by N.","When the total of number of letters, except of tags, of the lines extracted as KWIC is M\u00d7N or more, the KWIC lines are selected from the head of the KWIC line register, i.e. from ones whose original line number is small, so that the total number of letters settles within M\u00d7N. When the total number of letters of the lines extracted as the KWIC lines is less than M\u00d7N, all the extracted KWIC lines are selected.","When there is a remainder beside a value obtained by dividing the total number of letters of the line thus selected by M, a value added by \u201c1\u201d, i.e. a number of lines on the display when those lines are combined to display as one line, is set as K.","When K is less than N, the selection is made from the header line.","The selection is made from the head of the header line register, i.e. from those whose original line number is smaller, so that the total number of letters of the part except of the tags settles within M\u00d7(N\u2212K). When the total number of letters is less than M\u00d7(N\u2212K), all the extracted header lines are selected.","When there is a remainder beside a value obtained by dividing the total number of letters of the line thus selected by M, a value added by \u201c1\u201d, i.e. a number of lines on the display when those lines are combined to display as one line, is set as L.","It is noted that lines which have been already selected from the KWIC line register are not selected in selecting from the header lines to avoid the same portion from being represented by a plurality of times as an abstract of the document and to display different portions as much as possible because an amount of lines which can be represented as the abstract of one document is limited.","When K\u2212L<N, the selection is made from the head line. The selection is made from the head of the head line, i.e. from those whose original line number is smaller, so that the total number of letters settles within M\u00d7(N\u2212K\u2212L). In selecting from the head line, the lines which have been already selected from the KWIC line or the header line are not selected.","The selection of a clue phrase line is made as follows.","Because a clue phrase line often implies an outline of the whole document, it is preferable to display it after a display of document title of each document within the abstract document. Normally, a link to the original document is embedded here so as to jump to the original document when this portion is clicked. The extracted clue phrase line is selected from the head, i.e. from those whose clue phrase line number is smaller, so that the number of letters settles within about M\u00d7L, where L is a number of letters of the document title.","Tags for adjusting the representation format are added to the KWIC line, the header line, the clue phrase line and the title line thus selected to output to the abstract document.","A process of the above-mentioned abstract processing section  will be explained below based on an example of an abstract of a document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0127"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},"Assume that two words of \u201cInternet\u201d and \u201cIntranet\u201d for example are registered in the keyword holding section  as keywords.","Because no tag indicating an equivalence of header nor clue phrase and keyword exists in the first line, it is not extracted as a header line, a clue phrase line or a KWIC line. Because no letter is left when the tag is removed, it is not extracted also as a head. The first line is output to the KWIC document as it is.","The second line is a tag showing an equivalence of a header. Because there exists a tag \u201c<TITLE>\u201d, it is registered in the title line register by removing the tag. Because the second line is a title line, extraction of KWIC line, clue phrase line, header line and head line is not implemented. The second line is output to the KWIC computerized document as it is.","Because the lines from the third line through the 19-th line are part composed of only tags, they are not extracted as a header line, clue phrase line or KWIC line. Each line is output to the KWIC computerized document as it is.","Because the 20-th line contains the keyword \u201cInternet\u201d, link tags keyed by a KWIC document name and a KWIC counter value are inserted before and after the character string \u201cInternet\u201d after removing the tag by incrementing the KWIC line counter to register in the KWIC register.","In concrete, assuming the document name of the KWIC document as \u201cmod.html\u201d for example, it is registered in the KWIC line register by inserting a tag \u201c<AHREF=\u201cmod.html#KWIC1><B>\u201d and a tag \u201c<\/B><\/A>\u201d before and after the character string \u201cInternet\u201d. Here, \u201c1\u201d in \u201cKWIC1\u201d is a value of the KWIC counter.","Because the 20-th line is a scope of tag <H> of the previous line, it is registered in the header line after removing the tag part by incrementing the header line counter.","Here, the scope of the tag is a character string part within the document, other than the HTML description part, in which a specification such as a representation format specified by the tag is applied. Among HTML tags, there are two kinds of tags having no scope and having a scope. For instance, \u201c<BR>\u201d is a tag having no scope and has an effect of urging line-feed at the location thereof when it is displayed when its document is displayed. For instance, \u201c<H> . . . <\/H>\u201d is a tag having a scope and specifies to display the character string between them by the usable largest fonts. The latter tag having the scope is more general in HTML and is normally designated by two corresponding tags of \u201c<AAA> . . . <\/AAA>\u201d (AAA is a character string). Generally, the former tag <AAA> is called a begin tag and the latter tag <\/AAA> is called an end tag.","Thus, there is a case when a line sequentially read is a scope of the HTML begin tag contained in the line previously read. Accordingly, it is necessary to memorize that the current line is a scope of which HTML tag contained in a previously read line and to adequately process it.","Further, when there is the begin tag or the end tag in the middle of a read line, a character string before the begin tag or after the end tag is not a scope of those tags.

Thereby, a more accurate article ranking may be obtained.","The processes thereafter are the same with those described before.","It is noted that although the processes of the abstract processing section  have been explained such that the abstracts of all the documents are created in accordance to the merged ranking, some retrieve server sends each retrieved document as a retrieved result by appending an abstract manually created. When the document contained in the retrieved result from this server is contained in the ranking after the merge, it is conceivable to have a system of displaying the transmitted abstract as it is as an abstract, without creating a new abstract for that document, and of creating an abstract only for a document not contained in the ranking after the merge.","Further, the following method is conceivable as another variation.","When a retrieved page is a sub-page, titles and headers of chapters and sections of the intermediate pages from the top page to that page are represented hierarchically. In this case, the intermediate pages from the retrieved page to the top page are obtained at first as follows.","When there exists a link \u201creturn to\u201d in the middle (or the end in particular) of the retrieved page, it implies a higher order page or the top page.

Normally, URL of the top page assumes a shape of \u201chttp:\/\/aa.bbb\u201d or \u201chttp:\/\/aaa.bbb\/index.html\u201d. Here, \u201cbbb\u201d is what is used in Japan and is prescribed as \u201cco.jp\u201d for companies, as \u201cac.jp\u201d for academies and as \u201cor.jp\u201d for public organizations for example.","A sub-page has a form of \u201chttp:\/\/aaa.bbb\/ccc\/ddd\/eee.html\u201d.
