title: Robot-enabled case picking
abstract: A robot-enabled method of picking cases in a warehouse is provided. A robotic vehicle includes a processor configured to access a memory, a user input device, an output device, and a load platform, and has access to an electronically stored representation of a warehouse. The representation includes a map that defines aisles for storing items arranged as pick faces within the warehouse. A pick list is generated from an order; the pick list provides identifications of items to be picked to fulfill the order. Determined from the pick list is a plurality of stops at pick faces associated with the items. A route within the map is generated that includes the plurality of stops. The robotic vehicle iteratively guides itself along the route and automatically stops at each of the plurality of stops to enable loading of the items from the pick list onto the load platform.

No. 61\/501,026, entitled Robot-Enabled Case Picking, filed on Jun. 24, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present inventive concepts relate to the field of systems and methods in the field of storage facility management, and more particularly to systems and methods involved in case picking or selection.","A storage facility is a facility primarily used for storage of goods for commercial purposes, such as a warehouse. The storage is generally intended to be temporary, as such goods ultimately may be intended for a retailer, consumer or customer, distributor, transporter or other subsequent receiver. A warehouse can be a standalone facility, or can be part of a multi-use facility. Thousands of types of items can be stored in a typical warehouse. The items can be small or large, individual or bulk. It is common to load items on a pallet for transportation, and the warehouse may use pallets as a manner of internally transporting and storing items.","A well-run warehouse is well-organized and maintains an accurate inventory of goods. Goods can come and go frequently, throughout the day, in a warehouse. In fact, some large and very busy warehouses work three shifts, continually moving goods throughout the warehouse as they are received or needed to fulfill orders. Shipping and receiving areas, which may be the same area, are the location(s) in the warehouse where large trucks pick-up and drop-off goods. The warehouse can also include a staging area\u2014as an intermediate area between shipping and receiving and storage aisles within the warehouse where the goods are stored. The staging area, for example, can be used for confirming that all items on the shipping manifest were received in acceptable condition. The staging area can also be used to build orders and pallets to fulfill orders that are to be shipped.","Goods in a warehouse tend to be moved in one of two ways, either by pallet or by cart (or trailer). A pallet requires a pallet transport for movement, such as a pallet jack, pallet truck, forklift, or stacker. A stacker is a piece of equipment that is similar to a fork lift, but can raise the pallet to significantly greater heights, e.g., for loading a pallet on a warehouse shelf. A cart requires a tugger (or \u201ctow tractor\u201d), which enables a user to pull the cart from place to place.","A pallet transport can be manual or motorized. A traditional pallet jack is a manually operated piece of equipment, as is a traditional stacker. When a pallet transport is motorized, it can take the form of a powered pallet jack, pallet truck, or forklift (or lift truck). A motorized stacker is referred to as a power stacker. A motorized pallet jack is referred to as a powered pallet jack, which an operator cannot ride, but walks beside. A pallet truck is similar to a powered pallet jack, but includes a place for an operator to stand.","As with motorized pallet transports, a tugger can be in the form of a drivable vehicle or in the form of a powered vehicle along the side of which the operator walks. In either form, a tugger includes a hitch that engages with a companion part on the cart, such as a sturdy and rigid ring or loop.","Automatic guided vehicle (AGV) forms of pallet trucks and powered tuggers exist. An AGV is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision or lasers to make its way without direct or remote control by an operator. They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or a warehouse, such as in the case of AGV forklifts and AGV tuggers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","112","116","114","114","112","116","114","110","116"]},"Warehouse  includes a plurality of aisles and storage spaces (collectively aisles ) where the goods are intended to be stored in an orderly manner. Additionally, zones can be defined in a warehouse\u2014as a means for categorizing areas within a warehouse. A zone can be defined for an aisle, group of aisles, portion of an aisle, or various combinations thereof. In , several zones are defined, including zones A-E.","When one or more orders is to be filled, a \u201cpick list\u201d is generated, which tells an order selector (or picker) which aisles to go to and which goods to pick. Pallet transports or tuggers and carts (collectively pallet transport ) are sent through warehouse  with the order selector to \u201cpick\u201d cases, totes, cartons, or other forms of containers of goods (collectively \u201ccases\u201d herein). A \u201ctote\u201d is a container that is used to fill an order on a piece-by-piece basis, where the pieces are individual goods or groupings of relatively small goods. The goods are arranged in aisles , and the same goods are arranged as a \u201cpick face.\u201d A \u201cpick face\u201d is a location, usually a two-dimensional facing or area, in a warehouse or stock area that is designated for the storage of one or more products and is accessible by an order selector for order filling. The cases are loaded on pallet transport  and brought to either the staging area  or shipping & receiving area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["120","0","1","5","6","0","1","5","6","0","6"]},"There are different approaches to arranging products in a warehouse, which is referred to as \u201cslotting.\u201d Slotting is viewed by many to be the key to the efficiency of the warehouse operation, where the highest possible \u201cpick rates\u201d are desired. Generally speaking, \u201cpick rate\u201d means the number of cases or units picked per unit of time, e.g., cases per hour.","One common approach to slotting products is to use item velocity. Generally, the more popular a product is, the higher its item velocity\u2014the faster or more frequently it moves in and out of the warehouse. When slotting by item velocity, it is typical to keep the products with the highest item velocities in zones closest to the shipping & receiving  area (or staging area ). Meanwhile, items with the lowest item velocities tend to be in zones furthest away. Slotting by item velocity can reduce travel time within a warehouse when filling orders. Reducing travel time is an important factor in increasing pick rates\u2014so it is considered quite advantageous to slot by item velocity.","Another way to slot products in a warehouse is by product categories\u2014grocery stores tend to use this approach. For example, paper products may be a product category. One or more product categories may exist within a zone. To increase efficiency with this type of product slotting, it may be advantageous to pick all products from a category that are needed to fill multiple orders\u2014and then put the orders together in the staging area .","There are many different methods for filling the order. The method chosen will typically depend on the way the products are slotted and whether or not cases are being picked versus individual products, e.g., a case of aspirin versus  bottles of aspirin. Some of the most common order picking methods are:\n\n","The appropriateness of a particular order filling method will also depend on its impact on pick rates. The higher the overall pick rate, the more efficient and cost effective the warehouse.","Referring again to , a warehouse management system, or WMS,  is a key part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of goods within warehouse . The WMS can process transactions associated with the movement of goods into, out of, and within the warehouse, including shipping, receiving, putaway and picking. \u201cPutaway\u201d generally refers to moving goods into the warehouse or storage area at their designated storage locations, e.g., zones and pick faces.","The WMS can provide a set of computerized procedures to handle the tracking and management of goods at a warehouse, model and manage the logical representation of the physical storage facilities (e.g. racking etc.), and enable a seamless link to order processing and logistics management in order to pick, pack and ship product out of the warehouse. Warehouse management systems can be standalone systems, or modules of an enterprise resource management system or supply chain execution suite. Orders can be electronically received by a WMS or manually input. Pick lists can be automatically or manually generated from the order, which can include route optimization performed by the WMS.","When picking cases to fill orders, it is typical to use pallet transports  that are navigated through the warehouse  to pick faces within zones to retrieve the necessary product cases. When doing so, the pallet transport  is navigated under the control of the order selector. That is, the order selector looks at a first\/next item on a pick list, which indicates the aisle, pick face, and (optionally) zone where the corresponding product is located. The order selector drives the pallet transport to the pick face, and loads the appropriate number of cases on the pallet (or cart). This is done for each product on the pick list, until the order selector has worked completely through the pick list.","If the order selector is only picking for a particular zone, he can bring the pallet transport to the next zone and hand it off to the next order selector to continue working down the pick list. If the order selector is picking the complete pick list, then he can drive the pallet transport to the shipping & receiving area  or staging area  when the order is complete.","In accordance with aspects of the present invention, provided is a robot-enabled method of picking cases in a storage facility. The method includes providing a robotic vehicle having a processor configured to access a memory and a load platform. The robotic vehicle has access to an electronically stored representation of the storage facility; the representation includes locations within the storage facility for storing items arranged as pick faces. A pick list is generated from an order, the pick list providing identifications of items to be picked to fulfill the order. From the pick list a plurality of pick faces associated with the items is determined. A route within the map is electronically generated that includes the plurality of pick faces. The robotic vehicle iteratively navigates itself along the route and automatically stops or slows down at each of the plurality of pick faces to enable loading of the items from the pick list onto the load platform.","The representation of the storage facility can be a two-dimensional map.","The method can further include manually entering the order to the robotic vehicle through a user input device.","The method can further include electronically communicating the order to the robotic vehicle. In such a case, the order can be electronically communicated to the robotic vehicle by a storage facility management system.","The method can further include manually entering the pick list to the robotic vehicle through a user input device.","The method can further include electronically communicating the pick list to the robotic vehicle.

In such a case, the route can be electronically communicated to the robotic vehicle by a storage facility management system.","The method can further include automatically generating the route from an electronically stored pick list.","The method can further include tracking the robotic vehicle using a wireless network. In such a case, the wireless network can include wireless access points distributed throughout the storage facility. And the method can further include determining a location of the robotic vehicle from a strength of one or more wireless signals transmitted by the robotic vehicle and received by one or more of the access points.","The method can further include the robotic vehicle initiating travel to a next pick face, of the plurality of pick faces, in response to a user input. In such a case, the user input can be a voice command. In other cases, the user input can be a gesture.","In other cases, the user input can be an actuation of a physical mechanism that provides an electronic signal to the robotic vehicle. The physical mechanism can be one or more of a button, RF gun, or touch screen.","The method can further include providing an output device, and the robot vehicle can communicate with a user via the output device.","The method can further include, at each pick face, the robotic vehicle outputting a message that identifies a set of items to be picked from the pick face to fill the order.","In such a case, the message can further identify a quantity of each item in the set of items to be picked from the pick face to fill the order.","The message can further identify a specific position on the load platform to place a picked item.","The message can include an audio voice message.","The message can include a text output.","Outputting the message can include outputting a pattern of one or more lights or symbols.","The output device can be a wireless Bluetooth device. The wireless Bluetooth device can communicate with a wireless headset or handset.","The output device can include a display.","The output device can include one or more lights.","Pick faces can be associated with predetermined zones, and the route can be determined on a zone-by-zone basis.","The robotic vehicle can be one of a plurality of robotic vehicles, and the method can include electronically optimizing routes of the plurality of vehicles to avoid congestion within the storage facility.","The method can further include electronically optimizing the route of the robotic vehicle to minimize robotic vehicle travel distance within the storage facility.","The method can further include electronically optimizing the route of the robotic vehicle to minimize order distance within the storage facility.","The method can further include electronically optimizing the route of the robotic vehicle to maximize pick rate.","The method can further include the robotic vehicle iteratively navigating itself along the route using an evidence grid populated with data indicating probabilities of locations of objects in the storage facility. The evidence grid can be a three-dimensional (3-D) evidence grid.","The method can further include the robotic vehicle collecting sensor data used to update the evidence grid while the robotic vehicle iteratively navigates itself along the route.","The representation of the storage facility can include a list of route segments.","The robotic vehicle can be a forklift.","The robotic vehicle can be a high lift.","The storage facility can be a warehouse.","The robotic vehicle can be a pallet truck and the load platform can be a pallet.","The robotic vehicle can be a tugger and the load platform can be a cart.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms.

The display can be any wireless type display, e.g., radio frequency (RF) display.","When an order is received, or otherwise electronically stored at the robotic vehicle , a pick list module  can process the order to generate a pick list. A pick list, therefore, is a list of items to be picked in the warehouse to fill at least one order. In addition to the order, the pick list module  can generate the pick list using various types of information, such as product inventory. The pick list could also be generated using information relating to pick zones associated with products, and pick faces within pick zones where the products physically reside. Alternatively, a user may specify a pick list manually, e.g., via an interface on or off the robotic vehicle, such as the user interactive screens shown in . This information can be stored in storage device , or made available from WMS \u2032.","With a pick list generated, a route module  can be used to generate a route through the warehouse to be followed by robotic vehicle , as the robotic vehicle works its way through the warehouse to gather the products. In addition to the pick list, route module  can generate the route using various types of information, such as an electronic map representing the warehouse, including pick zones and pick faces within pick zones. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the route module may include functionality to optimize the route based on minimizing distance traveled, minimizing congestion (in view of routes of other robotic vehicles), minimizing time, and\/or order stacking considerations (e.g., heaviest items on bottom), as examples.

It can receive instructions, and automatically route itself to a destination within a facility, e.g. a warehouse. Robotic vehicles can use electronic maps, markers, vision systems, and so on for guidance. However, typical robotic vehicles have no ability to iterate themselves through an environment (e.g., a facility).","Vehicle control module  communicates with vehicle control system  to achieve an iterative robotic navigation through an environment, in this case warehouse .

But in other embodiments, one or more of the foregoing could be externally stored, e.g., at the WMS, and communicated to the robotic vehicle as needed\u2014perhaps just in time. For example, when an order selector loads product from a pick face and is ready to initiate robot self-navigation to a next location, a voice or other input could cause the robotic vehicle to receive the next pick face location from the WMS or other external system.","In accordance with aspects of the present invention, a variety of case picking solutions are possible by including a robot control system in facility equipment, such as pallet transports, forklift, highlifts, and tuggers, to form a robotic vehicle. The resulting flexibility can be enhanced by interfacing the robotic vehicle with a storage facility management system to maximize the utilization of robotic vehicles to support a combination of factors that are important, in varying degrees, to each customer\/facility. Balancing cases\/hour with the labor costs and orders\/hour may have different implications for efficiency and impact other areas, like put-away and shipping. There is great value in letting each facility balance its own people, processes and robots to achieve its own goals.","At the same time, the robot control system is flexible enough to integrate with other technology in use at the warehouse. The robots take direction from the WMS order, e.g., as orders are printed for the pickers, can follow an optimal path, and can display what to pick for the worker on a screen mounted on the robot. The robots can arrive at a zone and the worker can read the screen for what to pick. Additionally or alternatively, the voice system can tell the worker what to pick.
