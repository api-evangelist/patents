title: Systems and methods for alerting to traffic proximity in the airport environment
abstract: Systems and methods for alerting to traffic proximity in the airport environment. Knowledge of the geographic position, speed, rate of change of speed, heading (or track-angle) and/or altitude of own-aircraft (or vehicle) and another, potentially conflicting aircraft (or vehicle) are used to calculate a predicted distance between the two aircraft (or vehicles) at given point of time in the future. If separation distance is predicted to be less than a predetermined acceptable value, then an alert message (aural, visual or both) is issued to the pilot or operator of the vehicle.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under FAA Agreement #DTFAWA-09-00001. The Government may have rights to portions of this invention.","Several collision accidents have occurred at airports where an aircraft or vehicle has entered a runway environment which is already occupied by another aircraft that is moving at significant speed. Airborne collision protection and mitigation is provided by Traffic Collision and Avoidance System (TCAS), however the algorithms used in TCAS systems are not well suited to the airport surface operations problem; on airports, near runways, aircraft commonly operate at relatively high speeds in close proximity to other aircraft and vehicles. For example, an aircraft waiting to enter a runway is commonly stopped within a distance of the order of 100 feet from a runway that may be occupied by a landing aircraft traveling at speeds greater than 100 knots, thereby confusing TCAS algorithms. Also, on the ground at normal taxi speeds, an airplane can change its direction of travel much more rapidly than can an airborne aircraft.","The present invention uses knowledge of the geographic position, speed, rate of change of speed, heading (or track-angle) and\/or altitude of own-aircraft (or vehicle) and another, potentially conflicting aircraft (or vehicle) to calculate the predicted distance between the two aircraft (or vehicles) at given point of time in the future. If separation distance is predicted to be less than a predetermined acceptable value, then an alert message (aural, visual or both) is issued to the pilot or operator of the vehicle. The required information from the potentially conflicting traffic is obtained over a data communication channel, such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Rebroadcast (ADS-R) or Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TISB) data. The information required from own-aircraft is readily available from on-board systems such as Global Positioning Systems and Air Data Systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","20","24","26","30","32","34"]},"The processor  sends and receives state information over a data channel via the transponder . Using own-vehicle information (from the GPS  and the ADS ) and target vehicle state information (position, velocity, acceleration and track-angle), the processor  calculates predicted range between the two vehicles for a set of future times. If the predicted range is less than a pre-determined \u201callowable miss distance\u201d at a time less than Tw, then a Warning alert is generated and outputted to one of the output device(s) . If the predicted range is less than the \u201callowable miss distance\u201d at a time less than Tc, then a Caution alert is generated and outputted to one of the output device(s) .","The processor  provides predictions for many scenarios\u2014i.e. for converging runway traffic as well as same runway traffic. However, to avoid missed alerts when either own-vehicle or the target vehicle is changing track-angle rapidly\u2014which happens on the ground\u2014the predicted positions are calculated at a set of future times\u2014e.g. every three seconds out to 30 seconds, i.e. 10 calculations. This frequency can vary. Also, the accelerations (rate of change of speed) of own-vehicle and target vehicle are used to provide more accurate predictions. Acceleration of the target vehicle is calculated from reported velocity (or geographic position), and filtered to reduce noise.","In another embodiment, the processor  uses track-angle data from own-vehicle and traffic vehicle to calculate track-angle rate to improve the prediction of position when own-vehicle and\/or target vehicle is turning. Since the relative positions of the own-vehicle and the traffic vehicle are known, the direction from which the target vehicle is converging is also calculated, and the direction can be included in the alert message: e.g. \u201cTraffic left\u201d, or \u201cTraffic 9 o'clock\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["50","20","54","56","58"]},"At a decision block , the processor  determines if one of the determined distances between corresponding times is below a predefined threshold. If one of the determined distances is below the threshold, then at decision block , the processor  determines if the time corresponding to the determined distance is below a first time threshold. If the corresponding time is below the first time threshold, the system  outputs a warning alert, see block . If none of the determined distances are below the predefined threshold, the process  is delayed at block  and returned to block .","If the corresponding time is not below the first time threshold, then at decision block , the processor  determines if the time corresponding to the determined distance is between the first time threshold and a second time threshold. If the corresponding time is not between the first and second time threshold, the process  is delayed at block  then returned to decision block . If the corresponding time is between the first and second time threshold, the system  outputs a caution alert at block .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["80","80","80"],"sub":["A ","A ","A ","A ","A ","A "]},"If Tis not less than or equal to TCaution or the target is not inside the proximity zone, then the process  proceeds to analyze the next target aircraft\/vehicle based on observed ADS-B traffic targets.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A","b":"90","sub":["P ","A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["AvgAccel","K"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"V","mrow":{"mi":["K","i"],"mo":"-"}},{"mi":"V","mrow":{"mi":["k","i"],"mo":["-","-"],"mn":"1"}}],"mo":"-"}},"mo":"\/","mi":"dT"}}}}}},"Where AvgAccelis the average acceleration in the Ktime interval, N is the number of averaging samples, Vis the velocity at the isample before the current time interval, Vis the velocity at the (i-1)sample before the current time interval, and dT is the time step used in the calculations (typically 1 second).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["140","142","140","140","140","142","142","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["150","150","154","154","140","158","154","158","158","154"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6"],"b":["150","154","1","154","1","142","160","154","1","150","150","154","1"]},"While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
