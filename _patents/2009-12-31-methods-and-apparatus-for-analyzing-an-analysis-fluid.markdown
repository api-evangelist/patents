{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of Hans G. Kloepfer et al U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/916,292, which was filed on 11 Aug. 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,695,676, and is fully incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under grant number R44 DK059219 from the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights to this invention.","The present invention relates to methods and devices for testing analysis fluids, and more particularly to a consolidated testing apparatus for use in performing analyses of one or more components of a fluid. Significant contemplated applications of the invention are in the biological sciences, especially diagnostic medicine. In this field, analysis fluids would primarily be bodily fluids, notably whole blood.","Diabetes has been referred to as the \u201cundiagnosed epidemic of the third millennium\u201d. Some experts predict the number of diabetics world-wide to triple over the next 15 years to about 320 million. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is considered the quintessential prerequisite for diabetes management and treatment. As will be explained in more detail, most current SMBG systems, whether designed for patient or professional use, still have significant limitations.","The three major types of diabetes are type 1 (formerly insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM, juvenile-onset), type 2 (formerly non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM, adult-onset), and gestational diabetes. About 130,000 children in the US have type 1 diabetes. Treatment for type 1 consists of insulin injections, diet and exercise.","In type 2 diabetes, treatment may include insulin, but preferably oral glucose lowering agents, diet, weight reduction and exercise. Approximately ninety percent (90%) of diabetics are type 2.","Diabetics are predisposed to heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, retinopathy, kidney disease and neuropathy. The latter is associated with amputations, silent myocardial infarction and sudden death, and it accounts for over 300,000 hospitalizations in the United States each year. Today's total diabetes-related toll to the US economy (direct and indirect costs combined) is estimated to approach $150 billion.","As a true cure for diabetes remains elusive, tight glucose control will continue to be the sine-qua-non of diabetes combat strategies. The benefits of tight glucose control in curbing diabetes-related complications are now authoritatively documented. This evidence also suggests that a large portion of type 2 diabetics may benefit from tight glucose control and insulin. As worldwide knowledge about diabetes will be nurtured by the information age and media-assisted education, masses of undiagnosed diabetics who would benefit from tight glucose control will eventually be brought into the system. Since testing technology will also further mature, these megatrends will co-functionally establish an enormous market for SMBG in the future.","The mainstay of treatment for type 1 and many type 2 diabetics is SMBG in conceit with responding self-administration of insulin to harmonize glucose levels. Current SMBG systems are typically comprised of a test strip-type, dry chemistry device. The test strip is insertable into a hand-held meter that contains a display that gives the user a read-out of results. Alternately, results can be obtained by comparing reaction colors to printed color charts.","From a provider perspective, the main shortfall is that current systems are generally limited to the measurement of glucose. This is in drastic discord with the concept of diabetes as a multi-factorial metabolic syndrome. From a user point of view, there are still limitations in those features that consumers and users believe to be important, such as (1) minimal invasiveness; (2) speed of analysis and (3) ease of performance and minimal complexity (inconvenience) from primary and auxiliary product mixes.","The majority of presently marketed SMBG systems utilize more or less \u2018invasive\u2019 technology (lancing of fingertips) to obtain blood samples in a range between 2 and 30 \u03bcL. Non-invasive and minimally invasive technologies have been under active development for years, but made it to market only on a very limited scale due to technical difficulties.","Invasive Systems. Several dry-chemistry technologies exist for testing of whole blood specimens. In most devices, liquid reagents are applied onto solid support substrates by some impregnation or coating method. After solvent evaporation, the dry and therefore stable reagent is contained within a reactive zone or signal member (test field). As the blood sample makes contact with the reagents, a chemical reaction is initiated between analyte in the blood and the reagents on the test field. In most conventional test strips the analyst provides blood to test fields manually, contacting the strip with a drop or unspecified portion of a drop of blood. This technique has limitations with respect to constancy of volume applied and locations on the test field surface contacted by the drop. Consequences can be under- or over-sampling, or heterogeneous distribution of blood and hence reaction signal.","Both photometric and electro-sensimetric detection principles are in use. The vast majority of systems used to employ reflectance photometry, however, in recent years an increasing trend towards electrochemical detection (\u2018sensors\u2019) has occurred.","In meters that measure reflectance photometry, light of a wavelength absorbed by the colored reaction product is shined onto the surface of the test field and the reflected portion is monitored. In contrast to conventional photometry where absorbance is measured from reduced light transmittance in the direction of the incident beam, reflectance is measured at locations angled away from incident light. As light of varying wavelengths is reflected in different directions, an informed choice must be made as to which incident and reflective angles to select for obtaining a signal that is most sensitively and most specifically related to concentration. Preferably, the photocurrent detector (photodiode) of the metering device is positioned at a location where unspecific scattering is minimal and specific reflectance maximal. However, since the two can usually not be completely spatially separated, pure signals are by definition unobtainable (\u2018needle in a haystack\u2019 phenomenon). This is one reason why it is so difficult to achieve universal standardization of these systems and why the systems differ so much among each other, resulting in widely scattered method means in proficiency testing surveys.","Another limitation resides in the method by which cellular component of blood is separated from plasma. In older products, plasma was separated by soak through methods into coated bibulous materials or reagent films. Cells were then manually removed from the site of blood application by either washing or wiping, potentially giving rise to significant operator-induced errors. Several newer methods permit separation by means other than washing or wiping. The most frequently used are separation by porous glass fiber fleeces or membranes. In these matrices, pore sizes are chosen so that cellular component is held back within the matrix, whereas plasma diffuses through the separating and into the detection layer.","In most colorimetric test strips the separating layer is sandwiched against the detection layer. The reflectance measurement is then made at the side of the test strip opposite to the side of blood application. To keep needed blood volume low, the thickness of the separation layer is kept at a minimum. An adverse consequence is that spatial separation of red cells from the site of measurement is then so small that the thin zone of separation material that is devoid of cells incompletely shields cells. In instrumented measurements this \u2018shining through\u2019 effect of red cells can, as long as the effect is constant, be corrected by calibration or a dual wavelength measurement. However, such corrective methodology makes measurements more complex and less precise.","The shining through effect of red cells is particularly disadvantageous for visual interpretation. It is for this reason that most present-day colorimetric test strips cannot be read visually. Visual interpretation can serve as a confidence check for quantitative results provided by the meter. And in locations where meters are not readily available (rural areas, doctors office, ambulance, third world) concentrations can still be determined semi-quantitatively by visual comparison of reaction colors to standardized color charts. Unfortunately, the feature of visual backup is realized only in a minority of present-day systems.","Non-Invasive (NI) and Semi-Invasive Technology. The goal for the SMBG market, a completely non-invasive glucose monitoring technology, although pursued for over a decade, has so far proven elusive, despite perennial promises from companies in the industry. These failures have led to predictions that completely non-invasive optical technology (infrared or other) may not make it to market in any significant way, for both cost and technical reasons. It is also argued that this lack of success was predictable from early theoretical considerations of signal engineering. These considerations include the numerous and variable challenges of isolating a meaningful signal against a background of overpowering non-specific noise, such as noise from water. An authoritative recent review of NI glucose testing technology concludes that: \u201c . . . none of the NI experiments reviewed provides proof that the signal is related to actual blood glucose concentration. Clark error grid presentation shows performance that is not acceptable for home glucose meters.\u201d","A promising alternative to non-invasive is \u201csemi-invasive\u201d or minimally invasive testing using interstitial fluid (IF). The only product currently marketed that employs this technology is Glucowatch\u2122 from Cygnus, Inc. It uses electrically stimulated (reverse iontophoresis) glucose extraction from IF into a sensor-equipped sample pad. The product was recently approved by the FDA but only for supplementary (trend) testing. Reported problems with IF sampling are variations in skin thickness and permeability, changes in blood\/IF equilibration, sweating, signal instability and skin irritation. Furthermore, the watch must be recalibrated every 12 hours which is done by invasive finger stick measurements.","Several more recent devices employ electrochemical (sensimetric) detection. Good progress in system miniaturization has been achieved with these methods because they can function on whole blood, obviating the need for a plasma-consuming, cell-separating member. In some of these products miniaturization is further aided by provision of capillary sampling techniques. Despite these improvements, a major limitation of sensor methods is that visual backup is completely lost. This places a very heavy burden on the manufacturer as even minor flaws in test strip architecture or signal conductivity could have disastrous consequences. Hematocrit dependence in sensor methods can also be substantial due to \u2018dilution\u2019 of the electrochemical reaction milieu by cellular component. Furthermore, in these devices signal output is, as in the case of reflectance measurement, non-linear with respect to concentration, requiring complex mathematics for calibration. Finally, the technical sophistication and manufacturing complexity of the sensor methods makes it difficult to produce them at low cost.","In the future the SMBG market will increasingly be driven by consumer demand, managed care, and cost pressures from third party reimbursement companies. In this environment a market conversion from established and affordable invasive whole blood technology to unproven and costly non-invasive systems appears unlikely. However, it is expected that the market will migrate to invasive systems which minimize invasiveness and its associated pain. As such, the Applicant's minimally invasive and relatively less painful technology is believed by Applicants to better achieve the goals sought by the industry, and be well placed in the direction in which the market is heading.","The present invention comprises a hand-held meter that works cooperatively with a test wand to process an analysis fluid using the chemistry on test strips contained in the test wand. The capillary flow technology of the present invention enables the removal of obstructions in the analysis fluid that interfere with optical measurement of characteristics of the analysis fluid. Optical measurements include, but are not limited to, transmittance, reflectance, luminescence and fluorescence measurements. In the preferred embodiment, the capillary flow enables transmittance measurement through clear reactive films.","Embodiments of the present invention enable miniaturization of a blood sample volume to less than 300 nanoliters by a thin film, capillary flow micro-fluidic technology. Embodiments of the present invention also enable monitoring of reaction signals by rehydration by blood plasma of transparent polymeric reagent films, using a transmittance-recording, handheld meter. In co-functionality with the meter, the testing consolidation technology can integrate into one single disposable test wand: (1) lancing site preparation, (2) lancing, (3) sampling and dosing, (4) plasma acquisition by rehydrating dry film, (5) cell and excess blood removal exclusively achieved by capillary force, and (6) instrumented and\/or visual signal monitoring.","The embodiments can be operationally rugged and extremely user friendly. Intrinsic qualities of the embodiments can include: (1) quantitative measurement by transmittance photometry with visual backup, (2) incorporation of all testing parts and steps into a single unit, eliminating product clutter and making testing easier, (3) virtually painless testing due to the ultra-miniaturization of lancing procedure and sample size, and the potential for alternate site (non-fingerstick) sampling, and (4) environmentally independent and safe testing and disposal due to lancet, test strip and antiseptic swab enclosure before and after use.","Although the dynamic range of transmittance and reflectance measurement is in theory similar, use of a transmittance system in conjunction with a non-scattering chemistry matrix offers the advantage of increased signal strength and allows use of a smaller chemistry matrix. The increased signal strength and quality provides for reduced energy consumption (longer battery life) and better transient performance of the light source, usually a light emitting diode (LED). The smaller chemistry matrix enables a smaller sample volume, an extremely attractive feature in many point-of-care (POC) applications.","Measuring transmittance through a non-scattering chemistry matrix offers distinct advantages over reflectance or electrochemical measurement. One advantage is that the surface area of the chemistry matrix can be kept minimal. By contrast, in highly scattering media the reflected light is laterally dispersed as quantified by the point spread function which strongly depends upon the scattering characteristics of the chemistry matrix. This \u2018blooming\u2019 effect requires the light source to illuminate an area well inside the boundary of the active chemistry matrix. For example, to account for manufacturing tolerances, a 3 mm diameter light spot would typically require a 6 mm diameter chemistry pad. When measuring transmittance through a non-scattering media, light absorption is locally focused and the chemistry matrix could be as small as 3 mm when using a 2 mm diameter light spot. This reduction from a 6 mm to a 3 mm diameter reduces test field surface and blood volume needed by a factor of four.","A second advantage is that the transmittance measurement is simpler than the reflectance measurement. For a reflectance measurement, the overwhelmingly dominant signal in the detection region is specular reflection from the surface of the analyte pad. This specular reflection is typically devoid of specific analyte-related information, thus greatly enhancing background noise while simultaneously diminishing useful signal information contained in the remaining diffusely scattered component of the reflection. In contrast, because of a much better S\/N ratio, transmittance measurement enables faster signal integration, thus requiring less time for obtaining high precision results.","A third advantage is that transmittance measurement decreases the need for high precision electronics and shielding. High precision electronics and shielding add to the cost of the measurement system as well as the power requirements.","A fourth advantage is that a transmittance meter is easier to calibrate than a reflectance meter because: a) a transmittance measurement has a linear signal-to-mass relationship, and b) it is much more straightforward and easier to implement a matchup of the chosen LED emission range with reactant absorbance maxima. For both transmittance and reflectance, the usual route to instrument accuracy is calibration using a calibration standard measurement made contemporaneously with the analyte measurement in order to scale the source output. For the reflectance measurement, geometry demands that a known, stable calibration target must be presented to the optics for each measurement. This typically requires an onboard calibration target cleverly configured to remain clean while still being easily optically available; or alternatively the undosed teststrip can be presented as a calibration target. For the transmittance measurement the calibration can be performed by a simple measurement with nothing inserted in the optical path. Thus the transmittance measurement does not require a calibration target.","An advantage of a transmittance over an electrochemical sensimetric measurement is that a visual backup optical indicator (color comparison chart) can be provided that allows immediate check of extreme (and possibly aberrant) readings in what could be an emergency situation.","In comparison to the current state-of-the-art, the embodiments of the present invention can include several novel features, including the following: (1) because cells do not adhere to \u2018film\u2019 when blood is pulled through the capillary channel, the need for a discrete plasma separating member (cell filter) can be eliminated; (2) owing to laminar flow of blood over \u2018film\u2019, the need for a blood spreading layer, as required in many other current test strips, can be eliminated (Together, these two features enable ultra-miniaturization, making the method minimally invasive and virtually pain-free.); (3) since cellular component and excess blood is continually removed from \u2018film\u2019, cells are inhibited from clogging or temporarily covering the test field surface (This \u2018mobile sample\u2019 feature renders the device essentially independent from interference by hematocrit.); (4) linear optical signals can be acquired from transmittance measurement; in contrast, all present instrumented colorimetric test strips monitor reflectance, relying on a standard curve that is (a) non-linear at all concentrations, and (b) based on an inverse and complicated (Kubelka-Munk) relationship between concentration and reflectance (The capacity for linear measurement simplifies product development and meter calibration.); (5) visual backup or visual monitoring, which is especially important in environments with limited infrastructure and resources (cost or unavailability of meters, batteries, etc.), but also appreciated by those who prefer visual backup to confirm the test results displayed by an electronic device; and (6) incorporation of all operational elements into a single disposable consolidated test wand (which has never before been accomplished), makes testing extremely easy, fast, and thus highly accessible.","The user visually observes sampling and discontinues it when the transparent reaction capillary window is filled with blood. Inaccurate sampling is a lingering problem with current SMBG products. Over-sampling is particularly hazardous as it can lead to life threatening insulin over-administration in response to an erroneously high glucose reading. In the present invention, over-sampling will not result in an erroneous test result.","The features of the present invention can allow the user a high level of control over the analytical process. Transparence of the test strip cover panel allows visual observation of complete dosing through the circular opening in the front end of the test wand. After testing, complete removal of blood can be ascertained in the same fashion. Reaction signals can also be visually confirmed. (With sensor methods, the user has to completely rely on built-in, \u2018black box\u2019 QC features).","Beyond these features, the intrinsic capacity of the technology to permit separation of nanoliter quantities of blood plasma or other analysis fluids from cellular or other particulate suspensions has universal applicability to the complex analytical systems encountered today in biomedical science.","Another feature of the present invention is the ability to connect test wands to the sides of the meter. This feature enables a user to attach the desired number of test wands necessary for a period of time to the meter, and put the meter with attached test wands in a pocket, purse or other carrier. This eliminates the need for a pouch to hold all of the test utensils. Then as the user uses a test wand, they can dispose of the test wand and not have to carry unneeded components around. A method is disclosed that allows multiple test wands to be attached longitudinally and latitudinally along the sides of the meter.","Another important feature of the present invention is the design of the test wand to easily cooperate with a meter to process an analysis fluid, and the methods for processing an analysis fluid. The test wand includes a test wand holder and a test strip. The test strip contains a reagent and at least one layer that has arms that extend out a slot in the test strip holder. The analysis fluid is placed at the distal end of the test strip. When the test wand is inserted into the test wand opening of a meter, the side wall of the test wand opening engages the arm of the test strip, pulling the test strip in the proximal direction, causing the analysis fluid to flow in the proximal direction to expose a portion of the reagent on the test strip that has reacted with the analysis fluid. The exposed reagent can then be analyzed by the meter. Several methods and associated apparatus are disclosed, including a panel separation method in which the layers of the test strip are separated to cause a capillary force to expose a portion of the reagent; a panel sheer method in which the layers of the test strip are slid relative to one another to cause a capillary force to expose a portion of the reagent; and a wiper method in which a wiper wipes the analysis fluid from a portion of the test strip to expose a portion of the reagent.","These and other features of the present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art in connection with a review of the drawings and detailed description of the invention set forth below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","200","200","10","10","200","200","10","200","10","10","200"]},"The casing of the meter , best shown in  and A-C, includes a case front , a case back , a case top , a case bottom , a right case side member  and a left case side member . The case front  includes a right front lip  that extends along the perimeter of the right side of the case front , and a left front lip  that extends along the perimeter of the left side of the case front . The case back  includes a right rear lip  that extends along the perimeter of the right side of the case back , and a left rear lip  that extends along the perimeter of the left side of the case back .

The left case side member  includes a front channel  sized and shaped to matingly join with the left front lip  of the case front , and a rear channel  sized and shaped to matingly join with the left rear lip  of the case back . In the preferred embodiment, the case front  and the case back  are joined by sliding the front and rear channels ,  of the right case side member  over the right front lip  of the case front  and right rear lip  of the case back , respectively, and by sliding the front and rear channels ,  of the left case side member  over the left front lip  of the case front  and left rear lip  of the case back , respectively.","The meter  also includes a display  for the display of information, and one or more buttons to control the meter  and the display of information on the display .  shows one embodiment of the meter  with two buttons, an upper triangular button  to scroll through information displayed on the display , and a lower square button  to select displayed information for the control of meter functions.  shows a second embodiment of the meter  with an elongated toggle button  to control meter functions. The toggle button  includes an upper portion  and a lower portion  to scroll up or down, respectively, through the information displayed on the display , and a central portion  that can be depressed to select the desired item displayed on the display .","The case back , best shown in , includes a battery cover , a code chip slot , a light pipe opening , a color chart , a visual back-up test wand opening , and rubber feet . The battery cover  is removable to replace the batteries that power the meter . In the embodiment shown, two AAA batteries are used, however, other size batteries could be used depending on the power and size considerations for the meter. The code chip slot  is configured to accept a code chip containing information on the test strips to be used with the meter . The code chip may include information regarding the meter or the test strips; for example the code chip could include lot specific calibration information for the lot of test strips currently being used with the meter. The light pipe opening , the color chart , and the visual back-up test wand opening  are all part of the visual back up feature provided by the meter  which is explained later in this section. The rubber feet  form a platform to help protect the meter  and its various features from damage, and to reduce sliding of the meter  during use.","The case bottom , best shown in , includes an automated consolidated test-wand opening  for automated meter evaluation of a blood sample, and the visual back-up test wand opening . The automated consolidated test-wand opening  includes a first side wall  and a second side wall  that cooperate with the consolidated test wand  for sample analysis, as will be described below. The test wand insertion slots ,  for meter and visual measurement are sized and shaped for insertion of a test strip end  of the consolidated test wand .","The consolidated test wand  includes a body portion , the test strip end  containing a test strip , and a cartridge . The consolidated test wand  is preferably the type described in greater detail in Kloepfer et al., U.S. Patent Publication 2003\/0109777 (\u201cthe '777 Publication\u201d), and the test strip  and the thin film, capillary-augmented sample acquisition process are based on the methods disclosed in Kloepfer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,240 (\u201cthe '240 patent\u201d), which was filed on Oct. 25, 2000 and issued on Feb. 24, 2004, and which has been improved upon by auxiliary mechanical means as disclosed herein. Both the '777 Publication and the '240 patent are incorporated herein by reference.","The right and left side members ,  join the case front  to the case back , and also have mounting ridges  for mounting one or more consolidated test wand cartridges  to the case , each of the cartridges  containing a consolidated test wand .","The consolidated test wand cartridge  includes a generally cylindrically shaped cavity  having a bottom , and a pair of longitudinally extending ridges ,  on the exterior of the cavity . The cavity  of the test wand cartridge  is sized and shaped for receiving the test strip end  of the consolidated test wand . A drying agent can be deposited on the bottom  of the interior of the cavity  to prevent moisture from affecting the test strip  mounted in the consolidated test wand .","A consolidated test wand  comes with the test strip end  sealed in the test wand cartridge  so that the test strip  is protected from the environment until the consolidated test wand  is removed from the test wand cartridge . In contrast to the commonly used method of delivering multiple test strips in a single vial, each test strip  is protected from the effects of the outside environment, such as dirt, dust and moisture, until the test strip  is to be used. For example, in a vial having twenty test strips, every time the vial is opened to retrieve one test strip for testing, all of the test strips are exposed to the environment. As a consequence, by the time the last test strip is being used, it has been exposed to the environment on at least twenty different occasions due to the twenty times the vial was previously opened to retrieve the nineteen previous test strips and the current test strip. In the present invention, since each consolidated test wand  comes sealed in its own test wand cartridge , the test strip  is only exposed to the environment once when it is being used for testing, greatly diminishing the chance of test results being adversely effected by environmental factors.","In the preferred embodiments, the right side member  and the left side member  are identical or mirror images of each other. Thus, the following description is given for the right side member  but applies equally to the left side member . The mounting ridges  on the right side member  include a first longitudinally extending ridge , a second longitudinally extending ridge , a third longitudinally extending ridge  and a fourth longitudinally extending ridge  that are each sized and configured for cooperatively receiving multiple test wand cartridges , each of the test wand cartridges  holding one consolidated test wand . Each test wand cartridge  includes the first longitudinally extending ridge  and the second longitudinally extending ridge . The four side member longitudinally extending ridges , , ,  are equally spaced so the two cartridge ridges ,  can be fit over either the first and second side member ridges , , or alternatively over the second and third side member ridges , , or alternatively over the third and fourth side member ridges , .  shows a test wand cartridge  holding a test wand  attached to the case  with the first longitudinally extending ridge  of the cartridge  attached to the second ridge  of the right side member  and the second longitudinally extending ridge  of the cartridge  attached to the third ridge  of the right side member . Multiple test wands  can be attached longitudinally along each of the right side member  and the left side member . When using the first and second ridges ,  to attach one set of test wand cartridges , and the third and fourth ridges ,  for attaching another set of test wand cartridges , two test wand cartridges  can be attached side-by-side latitudinally on the side member  allowing twice the number of test wand cartridges  to be attached to the case .","The meter  and consolidated test wand  work cooperatively to provide a reading of an analysis fluid, for example, a blood sample obtained by the user.  shows the consolidated test wand  inserted in the automated test wand insertion slot  of the meter . As the meter  receives the test strip end  of the consolidated test wand , the meter  and test wand  cooperatively manipulate the test strip  to perform fluid separation and to facilitate the reading of the reagent on the test strip that has been exposed to the analysis fluid.","The test strip end  of the consolidated test wand  includes four primary components: the test strip , a test strip holder  and a test strip retainer . In the preferred embodiments, the test strip end  also includes a hinge mechanism  for hingedly coupling the test strip holder  and the test strip retainer . The test strip retainer  is movable between an open position (see e.g. ) and a closed position (see e.g. ). When the test strip retainer  is in its closed position, the test strip  is sandwiched between the test strip retainer  and the test strip holder  to maintain the test strip  in the desired position on the consolidated test wand .","The test strip  includes a proximal end  and a generally concave shaped distal end . Generally, blood is placed on the test strip  at the distal end  and through capillary or mechanical forces is caused to flow toward the proximal end . The test strip  is designed to separate the colored (primarily erythrocyte) component of the blood from the clear, primarily plasma components of the blood, to provide a generally clear analyte fluid, that can then be reacted with reagents contained on the test strip  to form a colored reaction product that can then be analyzed either visually, or through the use of the meter .","The embodiments for cooperation between the meter  and the consolidated test wand  for processing a blood sample, described below, each include steps where the reagent in the chemistry of the test strip  is exposed to the sample to react with the analyte of the sample, the exposed reagent is then moved into the optical path of the meter for a reading and\/or the unwanted parts of the sample are cleared from the exposed reagent, enabling an optical measurement by the meter  of the exposed reagent.","The test strip  and the test strip end  of the consolidated test wand  include a collection component that comprises an inlet, a film containing the reagents, and a wicking structure. When a fluid of interest is applied at the inlet, the wicking structure draws the fluid from the inlet and over the film by exerting capillary or mechanical forces upon the fluid. The reagents on the film react with the desired analyte from the fluid as the fluid is drawn over the film. The wicking mechanism can be structured to exert sufficient force on the fluid to effectively sweep the film free of particulate matter (e.g. erythrocytes) of the fluid, thereby clearing the optical path for an optical measurement of the exposed reagent on the film. The test strip end  of the consolidated test wand , the test strip , and the test strip receiving aperture  of the meter  are sized and shaped to cooperatively perform the above described functional steps.","In the case where the fluid of interest is blood, the test strip  is designed to separate the colored (primarily hemoglobin) components of the blood from the clear, primarily plain components of the blood, to provide a generally clear analyte fluid, that can then be reacted with reagents contained on the test strip  to form either a colorimetric or non-colorimetric reaction product that can then be analyzed either visually, or through the use of a meter .","The first embodiment to be described for cooperative processing of a blood sample by the meter  and the consolidated test wand  is the panel separation method shown in  and .","The test strip  used in the panel separation method includes an upper panel ; a lower panel ; a left side spacer  and a right side spacer . The upper and lower panels ,  are hingedly attached at the proximal end  of the test strip  and are preferably made of transparent plastic. The upper and lower panels ,  can be attached by various methods known in the art, including, for example, double stick tape or ultrasonic welding. The left and right side spacers ,  separate the upper and lower panels ,  creating a channel .  shows an exemplary, but out of proportion cross-section of the distal end  of the test strip  showing the channel . The channel  is surrounded on the left and right by the left and right side spacers , , respectively, and surrounded on the top and bottom by the upper and lower panels , , respectively. A reagent  is deposited in the channel . During use, the user introduces an analysis fluid , such as blood, into the channel  which reacts with the reagent .","The test strip holder  includes a generally planar base  having a proximal end , and a generally concave shaped distal end  to facilitate the introduction of blood to the test strip . The base  includes an optical path aperture  through which an optical measurement may be taken by the meter  when the test strip portion  of the consolidated test wand  is fully inserted in the meter . Several different types of optical measurements can be taken, including but not limited to transmittance, reflectance, luminescence or fluorescence measurements.

Reflectance measurements measure the amount of light from a light source that is reflected by or through the exposed reagent  to a light detector. Fluorescence or luminescence measures the amount of radiation produced or emitted from the exposed reagent  to a light detector. In the preferred embodiment, the meter  uses a transmission measurement as shown in the schematic diagram of .","Using an optical measurement and the capillary techniques of the present invention enables fluid analysis with an ultra-miniaturized fluid sample. This can be a very important feature in many applications, such as blood analysis for diabetics, which require frequent fluid samples. Reasons for these benefits include that the capillary techniques confine the fluid sample to a very small space thus requiring less fluid to present an adequate sample, and for the case of transmittance measurements, the blooming problem encountered with reflectance measurements is avoided.","In a transmittance measurement, the analysis fluid  moves over the reagent  in the y-direction, shown by the axes in . A light source  emits a light beam along an optical path  that passes through an illuminated test field  of the reagent film  and strikes a light detector , such as a silicon photodiode. The photocurrent of the light detector  is converted to a proportional voltage, amplified and measured using conventional digitizing techniques in an output circuit . A rapid rate of data sampling (at least 10 measurements\/sec) enables early reaction monitoring and kinetic measurement as required. In the preferred embodiment, the light source  is a narrow band LED driven by a digitally controlled, stable, temperature compensated current driver . The computations for the transmittance measurement are performed by a microprocessor . The microprocessor controls the current driver  and receives the output of the output circuit . The microprocessor  also receives the inputs from the buttons  and controls the output display .","Mass transfer in the z-direction into a reagent film  and measurement can be mathematically defined if the following conditions are met: (1) constant architecture of capillary channel system, (2) reproducible physical dimensions and chemical properties of rehydrated film  (\u2018reagent film\u2019 being a homogeneous water-soluble polymer or rehydrated dispersion), (3) reproducible sample volume, (4) negligible variations in surface tension and viscosity of analysis fluid , e.g. whole blood, and (5) excess of reagent  (enzymes, chromogen) in the film . Under these conditions, a residence time for the analysis fluid  over the test zone  of the film  that is illuminated by the cross section of the photometric light beam  during measurement can be defined.","The designated planar dimensions of the cross section of the light beam  in the test field  are y [mm] in the direction of flow, and x [mm] perpendicular to the direction of flow. The capillary channel segment containing the analysis fluid  above the illuminated portion  of the film  has the dimensions x\u2032 perpendicular to the flow direction and perpendicular to the light path (width), y\u2032 in the flow direction (length), and z\u2032 perpendicular to the flow direction and parallel to the light path (height). Residence time (\u03c4) of the portion of the analytical sample  over the illuminated, measured volume fraction of the film  is Vp\/v, where Vp is sample volume [mm], and v is rate of flow [mm\/sec], which is equal to z\u2032\u00b7x\u2032\u00b7<dy\/dt>, where z\u2032\u00b7x\u2032 is the cross section of the capillary channel segment [mm] containing the analysis fluid  above the measured cross section of the film  (y\u00b7x) [mm], and <dy\/dt> is the average rate of flow [mm\/sec] of analysis fluid  across this channel segment (parabolic velocity profile). During the residence time of analysis fluid  above the test field  of the film , mass transfer into the reagent  in the film  occurs of an analyte component (i). The flux, j, of analyte component i perpendicular to the phase boundary (the surface of the film ) is given by: j=\u03b2\u00b7(c\u2212c), where j=flux [mole\/(sec\u00b7mm)], \u03b2=mass transfer coefficient [mm\/sec], c=concentration of analyte i in the analysis fluid  [mole\/mm], and c=concentration of analyte i at upper boundary of the film  [mole\/mm]. Total amount, a, of analyte i transferred during residence time \u03c4 into the film  over the cross section y\u00b7x [mm] is: a=j\u00b7y\u00b7x\u03c4=\u03b2y\u00b7x\u00b7\u03c4(c\u2212c). If \u03b2, y, x and \u03c4 are kept constant and cis much smaller than c, then the equation simplifies to: a=k\u00b7c, where k is constant (k=\u03b2\u00b7y\u00b7x\u00b7\u03c4). This relationship is valid under above conditions (1) through (5), both in the case of diffusion controlled mass transfer (homogeneous swellable films), as well as in the case of interstitial bulk flow effected by capillary forces, superimposed by diffusion into rehydrating particles (layer of particles formed by drying of a dispersion).","If transferred analyte i (a) reacts quantitatively with the excess reagent  in the film , then absorbance A (measured on transparent films) at wavelengths characteristic for the reaction product of analyte i is linearly related to concentration (Lambert Beer's law): A=ln I\/I=\u03b5\u00b7c\u00b7d=\u03b5\u00b7a\u00b7(x\u00b7y), where I\/I=transmittance, \u03b5=molar extinction coefficient [mm\/mole]. The derivations illustrate that measurements taken in absorbance mode solely depend on the mass of analyte i transferred across area x\u00b7y, and do not depend on distribution of analyte i over thickness dimension (z) of the film due to subsequent diffusion in the z-direction. This is in contrast to diffusion-dependent reflectance measurements taken on reactive surfaces. Thus, independence of signals from analyte and reaction product distribution in the z-direction makes absorbance or transmittance measurement intrinsically more precise than reflectance measurement.","The optics\/electronics interface includes an optics module  that mates directly to a printed circuit board (PCB) , simplifying critical alignment of optics and test wand. The optics module  directs the collated light beam along the optical path  from the light source , through the test pad , to the detector . Tight tolerance molded parts for the interface between the test wand  and meter  will insure precise alignment of test field  and optical path . Complete insertion of the test strip end  of the consolidated test wand  is assured by an end-of-strip recognizing mechanical device, preferably a spring-driven snap-in pin.","A comprehensive serial interface  provides an output that can be connected for data transfer to a computer, allowing results to be sent to the doctor over a modem. This serial interface  also simplifies needed data retrieval during meter development, e.g. acquiring test data for calibration can be completely automated. Additionally the serial interface  can accommodate lot-code carrying media.","The meter  also includes a visual backup system to enable a user to confirm measurement results by the automated system, or to obtain results visually when the automated system is not operational, e.g., due to dead batteries. The visual backup system includes the visual back-up test wand opening , the color chart , the light pipe entrance aperture  on the back  of the meter , a light pipe exit aperture  in the visual back-up test wand opening , an exit aperture lens  and the light pipe  for transmitting light from the light pipe entrance aperture  to the light pipe exit aperture . The color chart  is a generally circular wheel having multiple sectors . Each sector  has a different shade of color such that the color chart  covers the spectrum of colors of the reacted test strips . Each sector  also has an aperture  located near the center of the sector .  shows a color wheel  with five sectors  of approximately seventy-two degrees of arc each. More sectors can be used to provide finer granularity on the visual backup reading, such as, for example, eight sectors that are each have forty-five degrees of arc. Alternatively, the color chart  could have a continuum of colors ranging across the spectrum of expected test results with apertures placed periodically around the continuum.","The following discussion will refer to the test strip  discussed above, however, the back up system works equally well with the test wand  regardless of the method of processing the analysis fluid , e.g., the panel separation method, the panel sheer method, the wiper method etc. The key is that the analysis fluid  has already reacted with the reagent  on the test strip before the test strip is inserted in the visual back-up test wand opening . The test strip end  of the consolidated test wand  and the visual back-up test wand opening  of the meter  are sized and shaped such that when the test strip end  with a reacted test strip  is fully inserted into the visual back-up test wand opening , the reaction area of the test strip  is visible through one of the apertures  in the color chart . Thus, the reacted area of the test strip  is visible through the aperture  and is surrounded by the color shade of the associated sector . To perform a visual backup, the user simply rotates the color chart  until the reacted area of the test strip  shows through the aperture  of the sector  with the color shade most closely matching the color shade of the reacted area of the test strip .","Applicant has investigated several different light path and light source options for illuminating the reacted area of the test strip  when fully inserted in the visual backup test wand opening  of the meter .","A first option is to not include the light pipe  and the light pipe apertures , , and simply to make the visual backup slot  on the rear  of the meter  under the color chart  a reflective white color. With this option, reflected light coming through the aperture  better illuminates the color shade of the reacted area of the test strip . The advantage of this option is that no external light or energy sources are necessary, and there is no opening to allow contaminants into the meter .","A second option is to have the light pipe  and the light pipe apertures ,  without the exit aperture lens . With this option, light coming in through the light pipe opening  is reflected through the light pipe  to shine through the exit aperture , through the reacted area of the test strip , and through an aligned aperture  of the color chart . The advantage of this option is that no external light or energy sources are necessary, and the amount of light illuminating the test strip  is dependent on the size of the light pipe and not on the size of the apertures  of the color chart .","Another option is to have the light pipe  and the light pipe apertures ,  with the exit aperture lens .

The advantage of this option is that it does not require a light pipe and the amount of light is not dependent on the size of the apertures  of the color chart . The disadvantage of this option is that it requires a light source which in turn requires additional energy.","Having described the invention in detail, it will be appreciated that variations and modifications can exist within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST STATEMENT","TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIGS. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIGS. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIGS. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIGS. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIGS. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIGS. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIGS. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIGS. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIGS. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIGS. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIGS. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIGS. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIGS. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIGS. 24","FIGS. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":"156"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
