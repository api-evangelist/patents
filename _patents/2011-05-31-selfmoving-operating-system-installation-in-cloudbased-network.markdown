title: Self-moving operating system installation in cloud-based network
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for a self-moving operating system installation in cloud-based network. A guest operating system can be instantiated in a cloud-based host environment to support a set of virtual machines. The operating system can be configured with resources in the kernel to detect and manage the identity of the cloud in which the operating system is installed, as well as to interrogate potentially new target host clouds to determine the configuration settings required to move or copy the guest operating system to that target. The resulting mobility of the guest operating system affords the ability to be self-moving, and an administrator or other user can simply specify a desired target cloud to host the operating system without a need to manually configure APIs or other resources.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates generally to systems and methods for a self-moving operating system installation in cloud-based network, and more particularly, to platforms and techniques for configuring a cloud-based operating system with cloud awareness and installation capabilities in order to receive an identification of a new host cloud for installation or migration of the operating system itself, extract the necessary configurations or resources for installation in that target, and move a migrated image of that operating system to the target on an automated basis.","The advent of cloud-based computing architectures has opened new possibilities for the rapid and scalable deployment of virtual Web stores, media outlets, social networking sites, and many other on-line sites or services. In general, a cloud-based architecture deploys a set of hosted resources such as processors, operating systems, software and other components that can be combined together to form virtual machines. A user or customer can request the instantiation of a virtual machine or set of machines from those resources from a central server or cloud management system to perform intended tasks, services, or applications. For example, a user may wish to set up and instantiate a virtual server from the cloud to create a storefront to market products or services on a temporary basis, for instance, to sell tickets to or merchandise for an upcoming sports or musical performance. The user can subscribe to the set of resources needed to build and run the set of instantiated virtual machines on a comparatively short-term basis, such as hours or days, for their intended application.","Typically, when a user utilizes a cloud, the user must track the software applications executed in the cloud and\/or processes instantiated in the cloud. For example, the user must track the cloud processes to ensure that the correct cloud processes have been instantiated, that the cloud processes are functioning properly and\/or efficiently, that the cloud is providing sufficient resources to the cloud processes, and so forth. Due in part to the user's requirements and overall usage of the cloud, the user may have many applications and\/or processes instantiated in a cloud at any given instant, and the user's deployment of virtual machines, software, and other resources can change dynamically over time. In cases, the user may also utilize multiple independent host clouds to support the user's cloud deployment. That user may further instantiate and use multiple applications or other software or services inside or across multiple of those cloud boundaries, and those resources may be used or consumed by multiple or differing end-user groups in those different cloud networks.","In terms of the installation of a guest operating system in a host cloud or clouds, based upon which a set of virtual machines can be instantiated or supported, in known cloud management platforms and operating systems, the operating system itself is not configured to detect the configuration requirements of a host cloud in which it is to be installed or migrated. One host cloud may for instance require a certain type or category of file systems, or may require or operate based on a particular set of application programming interfaces (APIs). Due to the lack of operating system self-awareness and auto-installation capability, administrators wishing to configure the operating system for particular cloud resources or conditions, may need to manually specify the APIs and\/or other resources or configuration data necessary to initially install, copy, and\/or move or migrate the operating system in a target host cloud.","It may be desirable to provide systems and methods for a self-moving operating system installation in cloud-based network, in which a guest operating system for a cloud-based implementation can be configured with a kernel that has a native cloud-awareness and installation capability to identify the host cloud in which it is to be installed or operate, and automatically configure the kernel and other resources of the guest operating system to compatibly operate in the intended target cloud or clouds.","Embodiments described herein can be implemented in or supported by a cloud network architecture. As used herein, a \u201ccloud\u201d can comprise a collection of hardware, software, services, and\/or resources that can be invoked to instantiate a virtual machine, process, or other resource for a limited or defined duration. As shown for example in , the collection of resources supporting a cloud  can at a hardware level comprise a set of resource servers  configured to deliver computing components needed to instantiate a virtual machine, process, service, or other resource. For example, one group of resource servers in set of resource servers  can host and serve an operating system, and\/or components, utilities, or interfaces related to that operating system, to deliver to a virtual target, and instantiate that machine with an image of that operating system. Another group of servers in set of resource servers  can accept requests to host computing cycles or processor time, memory allocations, communications ports or links, and\/or other resources to supply a defined level of processing power or throughput for a virtual machine. A further group of resource servers in set of resource servers  can host and serve applications or other software to load on an instantiation of a virtual machine, such as an email client, a browser application, a messaging application, or other applications, software, or services. Other types of resource servers can be used to support one or more clouds .","In embodiments, the entire set of resource servers  and\/or other hardware or software resources used to support one or more clouds , along with the set of instantiated virtual machines, can be managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system  can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and\/or other software, hardware, services, and network tools that communicate via network , such as the Internet or other public or private network, with all servers in set of resource servers  to manage the cloud  and its operation. To instantiate a new or updated set of virtual machines, a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system  for the particular type of virtual machine they wish to invoke for their intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email, messaging or other applications from the cloud . The virtual machines can be instantiated as virtual client machines, virtual appliance machines consisting of special-purpose or dedicated-task machines as understood in the art, and\/or as other virtual machines or entities. The request to invoke and instantiate the desired complement of virtual machines can be received and processed by the cloud management system , which identifies the type of virtual machine, process, or other resource being requested in that platform's associated cloud. The cloud management system  can then identify the collection of hardware, software, service, and\/or other resources necessary to instantiate that complement of virtual machines or other resources. In embodiments, the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can, for example, and as noted, comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts, Web pages, and\/or other transaction sites.","In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request, for example, can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated collection of machines, services, or processes is needed. The period of time can be, for example, an hour, a day, a month, or other interval of time. In embodiments, the user's instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis, rather than for a predetermined amount or interval of time. For instance, a user could request a set of virtual provisioning servers and other resources until a target software update is completed on a population of corporate or other machines. The user's instantiation request can in further regards specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines or other instantiated resources. For example, the request can specify a specific minimum or maximum amount of processing power or input\/output (I\/O) throughput that the user wishes to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resource. In embodiments, the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement (SLA) acceptable for their desired set of applications or services. Other parameters and settings can be used to instantiate and operate a set of virtual machines, software, and other resources in the host clouds. One skilled in the art will realize that the user's request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters, and others. It may be noted that \u201cuser\u201d herein can include a network-level user or subscriber to cloud-based networks, such as a corporation, government entity, educational institution, and\/or other entity, including individual users and groups of users.","When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build those machines or resources have been identified, the cloud management system  can communicate with one or more set of resource servers  to locate resources to supply the required components. Generally, the cloud management system  can select servers from the diverse set of resource servers  to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines, services, or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments, permanent storage, such as optical storage or hard disk arrays, may or may not be included or located within the set of resource servers  available to the cloud management system , since the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments, other hardware, software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in one or more clouds  can be accessed and leveraged as needed. For example, other software or services that are provided outside of one or more clouds  acting as hosts, and are instead hosted by third parties outside the boundaries of those clouds, can be invoked by in-cloud virtual machines or users. For further example, other non-cloud hardware and\/or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the one or more clouds  acting as hosts or native clouds, for instance, on an on-demand, subscribed, or event-triggered basis.","With the resource requirements identified for building a network of virtual machines, the cloud management system  can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic, on-demand basis. For example, one set of resource servers  may respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour or day. A further set of resource servers  can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth, for example on a guaranteed minimum or best-efforts basis, for instance over a defined window of time. In other embodiments, the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis, or at a particular future time. For example, a set of resource servers  may respond to a request for instantiation of virtual machines at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time, such as the next 12 hours.","Other timing and resource configurations are possible.","After interrogating and receiving resource commitments from the set of resource servers , the cloud management system  can select a group of servers in the set of resource servers  that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the user's requested virtual machine, service, or other resource. The cloud management system  for the one or more clouds.  acting as the destination for the virtual machines can then coordinate the integration of the identified group of servers from the set of resource servers , to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system  can track the identified group of servers selected from the set of resource servers , or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined, to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population, services, or other cloud-based resources.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can generate a resource aggregation table or other record that identifies the various selected sets of resource servers in set of resource servers  that will be used to supply the components of the set of instantiated virtual machines, services, or processes. The selected sets of resource servers can be identified by unique identifiers such as, for instance, Internet protocol (IP) addresses or other addresses. In aspects, different sets of servers in set of resource servers  can be selected to deliver different resources to different users and\/or for different applications. The cloud management system  can register the finalized group of servers in the set resource servers  contributing to or otherwise supporting the set of instantiated machines, services, or processes.","The cloud management system  can then set up and launch the initiation process to instantiate the virtual machines, processes, services, and\/or other resources to be hosted and delivered from the one or more clouds . The cloud management system  can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the registered group of servers in the set of resource servers . The cloud management system  can receive a confirmation message back from each registered server in set of resource servers  indicating a status or state regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various registered resource servers may confirm, for example, the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles, amounts of electronic memory, communications bandwidth, services, and\/or applications or other software prepared to be served and delivered.","As shown for example in , after coordination of the sources and configuration of resources including the hardware layer, selected software, and\/or other resources, the cloud management system  can then instantiate a set of virtual machines , and\/or other appliances, services, processes, and\/or entities, based on the resources supplied by servers within set of resource servers  registered to support the one or more clouds  in a multiple-cloud network . According to aspects, cloud management system  can access or interact with a virtualization module, platform, or service to instantiate and operate set of virtual machines , such as the kernel-based virtualization manager (KVM\u2122) available from Red Hat, Inc. of Raleigh, N.C., or others. In embodiments, the cloud management system  can instantiate a given number, for example, 10, 500, 1000, 20,000, or other numbers or instances of virtual machines to populate one or more clouds  and be made available to users of that cloud or clouds. In aspects, users may access the one or more clouds  via the Internet, or other public or private networks. Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table, or other record or image of the instantiated virtual machine population. Additionally, the cloud management system  can store data related to the duration of the existence or operation of each operating virtual machine, as well as the collection of resources utilized by the overall set of instantiated virtual machines .","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can further store, track and manage each user's identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software, hardware, and other resources. Each user that operates a virtual machine or service in the set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them, with associated access rights and security provisions. The cloud management system  can track and configure specific actions that each user can perform, such as the ability to provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources, configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications, submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host, manage other users of the set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources, and\/or other privileges, entitlements, or actions. The cloud management system  associated with the virtual machine(s) of each user can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking, billing, and auditing of the resources and services consumed by the user or set of users. In aspects of the present teachings, the tracking of usage activity for one or more user (including network level user and\/or end-user) can be abstracted from any one cloud to which that user is registered, and made available from an external or independent usage tracking service capable of tracking software and other usage across an arbitrary collection of clouds, as described herein. In embodiments, the cloud management system  of an associated cloud can for example meter the usage and\/or duration of the set of instantiated virtual machines , to generate subscription and\/or billing records for a user that has launched those machines. In aspects, tracking records can in addition or instead be generated by an internal service operating within a given cloud. Other subscription, billing, entitlement and\/or value arrangements are possible.","The cloud management system  can configure each virtual machine in set of instantiated virtual machines  to be made available to users via one or more networks , such as the Internet or other public or private networks. Those users can for instance access set of instantiated virtual machines via a browser interface, via an application server such as a Java\u2122 server, via an application programming interface (API), and\/or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine in set of instantiated virtual machines  can likewise communicate with its associated cloud management system  and the registered servers in set of resource servers  via a standard Web application programming interface (API), or via other calls, protocols, and\/or interfaces. The set of instantiated virtual machines  can likewise communicate with each other, as well as other sites, servers, locations, and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks, whether within a given cloud in one or more clouds , or between those or other clouds.","It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front-end can be used to view and operate the set of instantiated virtual machines  from a client or terminal, the processing, memory, communications, storage, and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the one or more clouds . In embodiments, the set of virtual machines  or other services, machines, or resources may not depend in any degree on or require the user's own on-premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments, a user can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off-premise basis, for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront, messaging site, and\/or any other application. Likewise, one or more clouds  can also be formed in whole or part from resources hosted or maintained by the users of those clouds, themselves.","Because the cloud management system  in one regard specifies, builds, operates and manages the set of instantiated virtual machines  on a logical or virtual level, the user can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real-time or near real-time basis, without a need to specify, install, or configure any particular hardware. The user's set of instantiated virtual machines , processes, services, and\/or other resources can in one regard therefore be scaled up or down immediately or virtually immediately on an on-demand basis, if desired. In embodiments, the set of resource servers  that are accessed by the cloud management system  to support the set of instantiated virtual machines  or processes can change or be substituted, over time. The type and operating characteristics of the set of instantiated virtual machines  can nevertheless remain constant or virtually constant, since instances are assembled from a collection of abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications. . Conversely, the users of the set of instantiated virtual machines  can also change or update the resource or operational specifications of those machines at any time. The cloud management system  and\/or other logic can then adapt the allocated resources for that population of virtual machines or other entities, on a dynamic basis.","In terms of network management of the set of instantiate virtual machines  that have been successfully configured and instantiated, the one or more cloud management systems  associated with those machines can perform various network management tasks including security, maintenance, and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system  of one or more clouds  can, for example, install, initiate, suspend, or terminate instances of applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system  can similarly monitor one or more operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines, and for instance terminate an application identified as infected, or a virtual machine detected to have entered a fault state. The cloud management system  can likewise manage the set of instantiated virtual machines  or other resources on a network-wide or other collective basis, for instance, to push the delivery a software upgrade to all active virtual machines or subsets of machines. Other network management processes can be carried out by cloud management system  and\/or other associated logic.","In embodiments, more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same time, at overlapping times, and\/or at successive times or intervals. The cloud management system  can, in such implementations, build, launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines as part of the set of instantiated virtual machines  based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers , with populations of different virtual machines such as may be requested by the same or different users. The cloud management system  can institute and enforce security protocols in one or more clouds  hosting one or more sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets or subsets of virtual machines in the set of instantiated virtual machines  can be hosted in a respective partition or sub-cloud of the resources of the main cloud . The cloud management system  of one or more clouds  can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub-clouds, or isolate individual workloads\/processes within the cloud to a specific sub-cloud or other sub-domain or partition of the one or more clouds  acting as host. The subdivision of one or more clouds  into distinct transient sub-clouds, sub-components, or other subsets which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi-tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple-user scenario, each of the multiple users can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the same one or more clouds . In further embodiments, sub-clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources, if desired.","In embodiments, and as also shown in , the set of instantiated virtual machines  generated in a first cloud in one or more clouds  can also interact with a set of instantiated virtual machines, services, and\/or processes generated in a second, third or further cloud in one or more clouds , comprising a multiple-cloud network . The cloud management system  of a first cloud of one or more clouds  can interface with the cloud management system  of a second, third, or further cloud of one or more clouds  to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and\/or virtual machines, services, and\/or processes on a combined basis. The cloud management system  of a given cloud on one or more clouds  can in aspects track and manage individual virtual machines or other resources instantiated in that cloud, as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources in other clouds.","In the foregoing and other embodiments, the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud network can be a person, customer, subscriber, administrator, corporation, organization, government, and\/or other entity. In embodiments, the user can be or include another virtual machine, application, service and\/or process. In further embodiments, multiple users or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.","Aspects of the present teachings relate to platforms and techniques in which the kernel of an operating system acting as a host operating system in a cloud-based network can be equipped or configured with a set of cloud-awareness, and\/or auto-installation or auto-migration resources or capabilities. The cloud-aware kernel of the operating system can be configured to contain capabilities and\/or services to be able to detect and identify the identity, type, or other information of the cloud in which the operating system is installed, directly at the kernel level and without a need to invoke third-party applications or services located outside of the kernel. The kernel of the host operating system can likewise be configured to contain installation tools and resources to permit the kernel to receive or access an identification of a target cloud environment to which the operating system is to be installed, copied, and\/or migrated, and automatically discover and install necessary resources to permit the seamless and\/or automatic installation of the operating system to that target cloud or clouds. The host operating system can thereby establish the identity of the cloud in which it is installed and\/or to be installed, and for instance automatically configure or adjust operating parameters, services, application programming interfaces, and\/or other resources to match the cloud host environment in which it finds itself located or to which it is to be moved. Usage history tracking, including duration or instantiation tracking, can be invoked in existing or target cloud hosts.","Consistent with the foregoing, in general,  shows an illustrative network configuration in which systems and methods for tracking cloud installation information using a cloud-aware operating system kernel can be implemented, according to various embodiments. In embodiments as shown, one or more users can operate a set of virtual machines  in a set of host clouds , for instance, by subscribing to resources in the set of host clouds  to support, provide, and\/or execute the set of virtual machines  according to service level agreements (SLAs) and\/or other terms or arrangements. In aspects, each virtual machine in the set of virtual machines  can have a set of applications  installed or instantiated in that machine, such as browsing, messaging, word processing, spreadsheet, and\/or other applications or application types. According to aspects, each virtual machine in the set of virtual machines  can operate using an instance of a guest operating system  assigned to or supporting that machine in the associated cloud-based network in the set of host clouds . Each host cloud in the set of host clouds  can be supported, hosted, and\/or executed in or by a cloud management system  associated with the set of host clouds . In aspects, the guest operating system  instantiated in one or more clouds in the set of host clouds can be or include, for instance, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux\u2122 operating system available from Red Hat, Inc., Raleigh, N.C., or other operating systems or platforms. In aspects, the each instance of the guest operating system  can serve or function to support the operation of an associated virtual machine set of virtual machines  operating in the set of host clouds .","In aspects as shown, the kernel  of the guest operating system  can be configured or equipped with a set of services or resources including a set of kernel services  to support task scheduling, file support, and other operating system services for an associated virtual machine and\/or other entities, as well as a cloud awareness engine  configured to perform discovery and tracking operations in the cloud environment in which the guest operating system  is installed. The cloud awareness engine  and\/or other logic, application, platform, and\/or service can be configured to build, access, update, and\/or maintain a kernel hosting record  to directly capture and store information related to the location, duration, operation, and\/or other details related to the use and activity of guest operating system  in one or more host clouds in the set of host clouds . The kernel hosting record  can be configured to store a set of kernel hosting data , including for instance cloud location information, operating system duration information reflecting the period or length of time over which the guest operating system  and\/or associated virtual machines or applications have been executing and\/or in use, public cloud registration information, private cloud registration information, and\/or other data related to the operation of guest operating system  in the set of host clouds  or otherwise. In aspects as shown, the cloud awareness engine  can be integrated, hosted, and\/or embedded directly in the kernel  of the guest operating system  itself, without a requirement for additional layers of software to perform cloud identification and operating system management tasks.","In terms of identifying the actual cloud or clouds in the set of host clouds  in which the guest operating system  is installed or operates, the cloud awareness engine  and\/or other logic, application, platform, and\/or service can be configured to communicate with one or more clouds in the set of host clouds  to interrogate those clouds for a respective cloud identifier . The cloud identifier  can be an identifier or code stored in or associated with each cloud in the set of host clouds  and\/or other clouds, to identify the vendor, type, software compatibilities, subscription terms, resource capacities, and\/or other data related to the cloud network environment supplied or offered by each cloud. In aspects, the cloud identifier  can represent a unique identifier or code assigned to all public clouds or other types of clouds, for instance, through a public registry maintained by one or more cloud vendors and\/or other organizations. According to aspects, the cloud awareness engine  and\/or other logic, application, platform, and\/or service can request, interrogate, access, and\/or otherwise acquire the cloud identifier  for the cloud in which it is installed, for instance by querying the cloud management system  associated with that cloud, and\/or interrogating other entities, platforms, sources, and\/or services. In implementations, the cloud awareness engine  and\/or other logic, application, platform, and\/or service can communicate with the cloud management system  and\/or other entities via secure channels and\/or private channels, such as encrypted channels or other connections.","In aspects, the cloud awareness engine  and\/or other logic, application, platform, and\/or service can likewise request or acquire other data directly or internally from the host cloud or cloud(s) in which it is installed or operates, including duration information as part of the set of kernel hosting data . The duration information can reflect the length, amount, and\/or period of time over which the guest operating system , set of applications , set of virtual machines , and\/or other operating systems, machines, and\/or other entities have been installed, instantiated, and\/or otherwise operating in the set of host clouds  using the guest operating system . The duration information can be stored by the cloud management system  and\/or other logic or service associated with the host cloud or clouds in the set of host clouds  in which guest operating system  is installed and\/or operates.","In aspects, the duration information can be associated with and\/or used for purposes of metering and billing the end-user of one or more of the set of virtual machines  or other users, based on time of operating system use, resource consumption data, and\/or other variables. In aspects, the cloud awareness engine  and\/or other logic, application, platform, and\/or service can be configured to access the kernel hosting record  and transmit duration information as well as other data in the set of kernel hosting data  to an external, third-party, and\/or other metering system  for receipt and consumption by that system. In aspects, the metering system  can be configured to access subscription information for the subject user via subscription databases or other sources, to generate or process billing records or other subscription events or activities, based on the duration of operation of the guest operating system , set of virtual machines , set of applications , and\/or other uses or factors. In aspects, the cloud awareness engine  and\/or other logic, application, platform, and\/or service can communicate with an entitlement engine  () configured to record and administer subscription information for the set of host clouds, with that engine for instance installed in the cloud management system  and\/or other host or location. The cloud awareness engine  can also be connected to metering system  via a secure channel or connection, if desired. The same or similar duration, subscription, and\/or metering information can also be shared or stored to the cloud management system  of the corresponding host cloud, and\/or to other locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["228","142","142","228","228","240","228","272","142","136","272","228","142"]},"In aspects as shown, the kernel  can be configured or equipped with a set of services or resources including a set of kernel services  to support task scheduling, file support, and other operating system services, as well as an installation tool  to provide control logic for the potential installation, copying, and\/or migration of the guest operating system  on an automated basis. The installation tool  and\/or other logic, application, platform, and\/or service can be configured to perform various discovery and\/or interrogation operations to determine the necessary configuration parameters and\/or other resources necessary to install, move, and\/or copy the guest operating system  to one or more target clouds  and\/or other destinations.","In aspects as shown, the installation tool  can receive an identification of one or more target clouds  to which the guest operating system  is to be installed, moved, and\/or copied, for instance by user selection or input, and\/or via automated services or applications. In aspects, the one or more target clouds  can be or include a new cloud host or hosts to which the guest operating system  and related resources will be installed, and\/or can be or include additional cloud host(s) to which an image of the guest operating system  will be migrated or copied, for instance from an original host cloud in the set of host clouds .","In aspects, for those and other purposes, the installation tool  can be configured to generate, build, and\/or configure a migrated operating system image  for purposes of installing, copying, and\/or migrating the guest operating system  and\/or adaptations thereof to the new or additional cloud host environments. In aspects, upon receiving or accessing an identification of the one or more target clouds  to which the migrated operating system image  will be installed, copied, and\/or imaged, the installation tool  can identify the target cloud or clouds, and transmit a set of installation queries  to the target cloud or clouds.

The set of configuration requirements  can be, include, and\/or specify data such as, for example the application programming interfaces (APIs) used, compatible with, or required by the one or more target clouds , and\/or the file system or directory structures used by, compatible with, or required for storing files or other data in the one or more target clouds . The set of configuration requirements  can likewise be or include data such as a set of drivers used by, compatible with, or required by the one or more target clouds , such as for printing, storage, media sharing, and\/or other services. Other configuration data and\/or parameters can be specified in the set of configuration requirements  supplied by the one or more target clouds  responding to the set of installation queries  and\/or other exchanges with or via the installation tool .","After receiving the set of configuration requirements  from the identified target host cloud or clouds in the set of target clouds , the installation tool  can access a set of installation resources  to build the migrated operating system image  that is compatible with the set of configuration requirements  for the one or more target clouds  to which the migration, installation, or movement of the operating system  is to take place.
