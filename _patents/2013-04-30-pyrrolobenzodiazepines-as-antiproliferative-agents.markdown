The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al., 1994, 433-465 (1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al., 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al., 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al, 35, 972-978 (1982); Langley and Thurston, 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al., 41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al., 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., 25, 437-444 (1972)).

In the B-ring there is either an imine (N\u2550C), a carbinolamine (NH\u2014CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH\u2014CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter, 19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents. The synthesis of the compounds has been reviewed in Thurston, D. E., et al., 1994, 94, 433-465 and Thurston, D. E., et al., 2011, 111, 2815-2864.","A number of conjugates of PBD with pyrroles and imidazoles have been reported, such as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"29.46mm","wi":"102.28mm","file":"US09376440-20160628-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"i":"Journal of Organic Chemistry, "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"29.46mm","wi":"102.28mm","file":"US09376440-20160628-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"31.58mm","wi":"123.78mm","file":"US09376440-20160628-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"where n=1-2 (Kumar, R. and Lown, J.

The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or clinician, although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.","Administration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell(s) being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician, veterinarian, or clinician.","In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to about 25 mg (more typically about 1 \u03bcg to about 10 mg) per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, an amide, a prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 100 mg, 3 times daily.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 150 mg, 2 times daily.","In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 200 mg, 2 times daily.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of the compound of the invention will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 15 mg\/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg\/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of compound to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises a course of administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg\/kg, followed by additional doses every week, two weeks, or three weeks of a compound. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.","Includes Other Forms","Unless otherwise specified, included in the above are the well known ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of these substituents.

The compounds were generally well tolerated without any signs of toxicity. However, a minor weight loss was observed at a dose level of 400 \u03bcg\/Kg\/day dose level for 16e (). Some insignificant weight loss for 16f was also observed at the same dose level. A repeat MTD experiment using only 16f at 350 \u03bcg\/Kg\/day did not show any weight loss or other signs of toxicity (). As 16f provided a marginally better toxicity profile in the MTD study, it was decided to carry out more extensive in vivo tumour xenograft studies on this molecule.","ER-Negative MDA MB 231 Breast Cancer Xenograft Study","In vivo studies of the activity of 16f were carried out in an ER-negative MDA MB 231 breast cancer xenograft in a mouse model. The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (5\u00d710cells) was employed to establish xenografts in the flanks of female MF1 nude mice, 2-3 months old and weighing 20-25 g. Subsequent passaging was by the subcutaneous implantation of small tumour pieces (approx 1 mm) into the flank. When the tumours reached approx. 0.06 cm(three weeks post implantation) they were divided into 3 groups of 4 mice. The drug treated groups were administered with an IV dose (in DMSO) of either 250 \u03bcg\/Kg\/day or 300 \u03bcg\/Kg\/day for 5 consecutive days followed by two drug free days for 3 weeks, followed by 2 consecutive days in week 4 at which point the dosage was stopped. As shown in , 16f produced prominent in vivo antitumour activity compared to control mice (\u25b4) at both 250 \u03bcg\/Kg (\u2666) and 300 \u03bcg\/Kg (\u25aa) dose levels without any signs of toxicity (, where the arrow shows the last injected dose). The tumour did not re-grow up to 3 weeks after administration of the last IV dose in the case of the 300 \u03bcg\/Kg dose level.","Mia Paca 2 Pancreatic Cancer Xenograft in Mouse Model","An in vivo study of 16f was carried out in a pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse model, in a similar manner to the above. The drug (16f) treated group was administered an IV dose of 300 \u03bcg\/Kg\/day for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 drug free days, and the cycle was continued for 3 weeks. 16f produced prominent antitumour activity compared to control mice at the 300 \u03bcg\/Kg dose level without any signs of toxicity (: \u2666300 \u03bcg\/Kg 16f; \u25aa control). The inability of the tumour to grow back immediately after withdrawing drug was notable, and no growth was observed up to 21 days after the last administered dose. Cross-sections from the tumour and control tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical staining, and the findings were consistent with NF\u03baB inhibition in the experimental animals compared to controls.","16f was evaluated in a commercial Transcription Factor Activation Profiling Array Assay\u2122 (Signosis) using the HeLa cell line. In this assay the activities of 48 transcription factors could be monitored simultaneously using a collection of biotin-labeled DNA probes based on the consensus sequences of individual transcription factor DNA-binding sites. The top five transcription factors whose activities were at least 30% down-regulated by 7 h at a concentration of 10 nM for 4 hours were: NFAT, EGR, NF-\u03baB, SMAD and OCT-4. The activity of NF-\u03baB was reduced by almost 50%.","Based on the hypothesis that 16f may down-regulate the expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent genes (e.g., I\u03baB, BCL2, BCLX) by binding to the cognate DNA sequence of NF-\u03baB, thereby blocking interaction of the transcription factor protein and inhibiting transcription of a number of genes, it was decided to explore this possibility in CLL cells in which NF-\u03baB signaling is known to be active and closely correlates with the initiation and progression of malignancy. Using levels of phosphorylated I\u03baB and p65 as surrogates for NF-\u03baB activity in comparison to the Actin protein as a control, Western Blotting indicated that, after 24 hours incubation, 16f caused a significant suppression of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 at concentrations down to 0.1 nM, with only a marginal effect on phosphorylated-p65."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0286","num":"0288"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0287","num":"0289"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0288","num":"0290"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
