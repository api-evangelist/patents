{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to providing product services. More particularly, embodiments of the invention relate to activating services associated with products supported by a service center.","Prior to the advent and prolific use of distributed network environments such as the Internet, customer service sessions typically occurred over a teleconference between a customer service agent or service specialist and a customer. These teleconferences, which incidentally are still very popular today, are initiated by a customer placing a phone call to a customer service agent. The customer service agent's phone receives the call through a public-switched telephone network (PTSN). Many support centers handle a large volume of inquiries, usually by phone, for sales, information, customer support and other services. Typical support centers provide the ability to route multiple incoming, customer-initiated calls to agents which provide sales, information, or support on behalf of an entity interested in establishing or maintaining a relationship with the customer.","Modern support center systems selectively route incoming calls based on a number of factors such as the number called or dialed, the originating number, the queued sequence of the caller, the geographic location of the caller, accumulated caller history, and other relevant criteria. Once the system has evaluated the inbound caller's information, if any, the system searches for an available agent to service the call. Availability of agents may be dependent on any number of factors such as a skill level or a schedule of the agent. The number of agents within the contact center and available to the system may often be limited by the physical space available for the agents to operate. Contact centers have to deal with a limited number of agents to handle a large number of incoming customer calls.","As the Internet is getting more popular, customer service providers now provide for computer-based customer service interaction by way of the World Wide Web. Instead of initiating a customer service session by using the phone, customers may access a website and engage in a web-based customer service session to make inquiries (e.g., technical support) and\/or perform tasks (e.g., paying bills). Web-based customer service sessions offer numerous advantages over teleconference-based sessions. For example, the graphical user interface of web-based customer service applications permit customers to view illustrations or written explanations and thus ameliorate the miscommunications which may arise with oral conversations between a customer service agent and a customer.","Further, web-based customer service sessions enable a customer to directly target his\/her needs on the website and thus reduce the time expended both in navigating through a series of vocal menu choices inapplicable to the consumer's particular needs and in waiting to speak to a service agent. Significantly, web-based customer service sessions are particularly cost-effective for the customer service provider given that fewer agents are required to communicate with customers. Indeed, customers are provided functionality for finding answers to their questions or performing tasks without any help from a live agent. These customer service sessions may be entirely computer-based or, alternatively, involve interaction with a customer service agent.","In some situations, when a consumer purchases a device such as a mobile phone, it requires an activation of a cellular service of a wireless carrier on the device before the device can function properly. Typically, a consumer has to individually contact the wireless carrier and provide all the necessary information (e.g., serial number, international mobile subscriber identity or IMSI) about the device. Often, such information is not readily available to the consumer and such an activation of service becomes tedious to most of the ordinary consumers.","Various embodiments and aspects of the inventions will be described with reference to details discussed below, and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to provide a concise discussion of embodiments of the present inventions.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in conjunction with the embodiment can be included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.","According to some embodiments, a service center (also referred to as a support center) is configured to provide services for activating a service on a product acquired by a user. The service to be activated may be a service subscribed by the user (e.g., a cellular plan) and can be activated on a device purchased by the user (e.g., a cellular phone). In one embodiment, in response to a request for activating a service on a device, the service center is configured to communicate with other entities (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, service providers) to compile all of the necessary information concerning the device (e.g., manufacturer, product model, serial number, IMSI, etc.) and subscription information of the subscribed service. The service center then contacts a service provider of the subscribed service on behalf of the user to activate the subscribed service on the device, without having the user to individually contact the service provider. As a result, the hassle of figuring out the detailed information of the device and activating the service on the device can be greatly reduced.","In one embodiment, the service center is configured to proactively identify a subscribed service that can be activated on a device acquired by the user and to prompt the user for permission to activate the subscribed service on the device. For example, when a user acquires or purchases a device and registers the device with the service center for support purposes, the service center can determine that there is a service subscribed by the user and can be activated on the newly registered device. The service center then notifies the user of the subscribed service asking permission for activating the service on the device. For example, the service center may transmit a notification to a mobile device of the user regarding the subscribed service and asking for permission. In response to a positive response received from the user, the service center is configured to communicate with the proper parties or partners to activate the subscribed service on the device on behalf of the user.","In one embodiment, the registration of the device may be performed by the service center automatically without user invention or knowledge. For example, when a user purchases a device at a retail location, an electronic receipt of the purchase is automatically transmitted from a point of sale (POS) location to the service center, where the electronic receipt may contain certain information of the device such as a serial number, etc. Based on the electronic receipt, the service center is configured to communicate with the associated parties such as retailer's backend systems and\/or manufacturer's backend systems to compile all the necessary information of the device and to register the information in a product asset store associated with the user within or accessible to the service center. Thereafter, the service center determines and notifies the user of the subscribed service asking permission for activating the service on the device. In response to a positive response received from the user, the service center is configured to communicate with proper parties to activate the subscribed service on the device on behalf of the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","101","102","101"]},"Service center  may be implemented in a centralized facility or server. Alternatively, service center  may be implemented in multiple facilities or servers in a distributed manner (e.g., cloud-based service platforms). Service center  provides services to a variety of products or services from a variety of clients or vendors. A client may be a manufacturer, a distributor, a retailer, a service provider or broker, a purchasing facility (e.g., Amazon\u2122, Expedia\u2122, or ISIS\u2122), or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, service center  includes service APIs  to communicate with other systems such as mobile device , client's site , social communities , contact center  including agents or experts , client backend systems , manufacturer backend systems , eCommerce sites  and other auxiliary systems (e.g., billing system). Service center  can handle service requests from customers of multiple clients. For example, a service center may handle customer service requests for a number of retail sales companies, sales calls for catalog sales companies, and patient follow-up contacts for health care providers. In such a structure, the service center may receive service requests directly from the customers or through client support management systems.","In one embodiment, service center  further includes community service system , support services system , post market service system , messaging system , and data warehouse . Support services system  is responsible for handling support services requests from the users, including identifying and registering a product, creating an instance case context, selecting and assigning a customer representative (also referred to herein as an agent, specialist, or expert) to provide support services to the users, and managing work flows, etc. An agent may be selected based on a skill set or expertise of the agent, as well as other factors such as geographic location, of the agent. The term \u201cagent,\u201d \u201cspecialist,\u201d or \u201cexpert\u201d refers to a service center personnel or a computerized application, in some cases, that respond to customer requests. An agent may be locally situated at the service center or remotely situated over a network. Throughout this application, the terms of \u201cagent,\u201d \u201cspecialist,\u201d and \u201cexpert\u201d are interchangeable terms dependent upon the circumstances. In most cases, the term of \u201cagent\u201d collectively refers to a customer representative, a support agent, a support specialist, a support expert, or a combination thereof, which may be a service center personnel and\/or a computerized application. Further detailed information concerning service center  and\/or support service system  can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/085,397, filed Apr. 12, 2011, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In one embodiment, community service system  is responsible for communicating with social communities  via an API, for example, to post a message received from a user and to route the responses received from social communities  back to the user. Post market service system  is responsible for handling post market activities associated with the registered products, including selling a registered product on eCommerce sites  and arranging a disposal facility to dispose or recycle the product, etc.","According to one embodiment, in addition to registering a product with the service center, a user can also register, for example, through the application running within a mobile device, one or more social communities and\/or one or more eCommerce sites by storing the necessary credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) of the servers hosting the social communities and eCommerce sites in a database (e.g., user database) of the service center, where the database is associated with a user the mobile device. Subsequently, the user can transmit a sales request to sell or dispose a registered product by specifying one or more of the eCommerce sites.","In response to the sales request, post market service system  of service center  is configured to retrieve the necessary credentials for the specified one or more eCommerce sites and arrange the specified eCommerce sites for selling the product together with the associated credentials to allow the eCommerce sites to authenticate the user for the purpose of selling the product, such that the user does not have to provide the necessary credentials at the point in time of the sales request and the user does not have to provide detailed information of the product to be posted on the eCommerce sites describing the product to be sold. A single sales request received from the mobile device can specify multiple eCommerce sites. The service center can also arrange a disposal facility to dispose (e.g., recycle) a registered product without having a user to specifically contact the disposal facility.","Similarly, a user can also post a message to one or more of the registered social communities from the application running within the mobile device without having to individually access the social communities. In one embodiment, a user can transmit a request from mobile device  to service center , where the request includes a message to be posted and one or more community identifiers identifying one or more registered social communities. In response, community service system  of service center  is configured to retrieve the associated credentials from the database and to post the message to the specified social communities together with the associated credentials allowing the social communities to authenticate the user, without having to prompt the user for their same credentials each time. Further detailed information concerning community service system  and\/or post market service system  can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/185,213, filed Jul. 18, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","In one embodiment, messaging or advertisement system  is responsible for handling any messages received from a variety of partners or parties, such as client sites , client backend systems , manufacturer backend systems , and eCommerce sites . Messages may be related to the registered products of the user, such as, promotions, rewards, and recall messages. Messages may include advertisements from a variety of advertisement providers.","In one embodiment, a user can configure a set of one or more rules to specify whether certain types of messages or advertisements received from vendors or parties (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, social communities, or other advertisement providers), which may or may not be related to a registered product, should be routed to the user. These rules serve as part of message delivery or filtering rules. The service center engages with the related parties to allow the related parties to get in touch with the user by sending certain messages such as product promotions, rewards, and\/or recalls, etc. to the user. The service center may send a message to a user via one or more communications channels preferred by the user, which may also be configured as a set of rules and stored in a database associated with the user.","According to another embodiment, an advertisement received from a vendor is delivered by the service center to a mobile device of a user based on a set of delivery rules associated with the user. The advertisement is displayed on a display of the mobile device by an application running therein. In addition, the service center and\/or the application are configured to track interactions of the user with respect to the displayed advertisement to determine user behaviors, patterns, or trends in view of the displayed advertisement. An analysis is performed on the user interaction and the result of the analysis may be utilized to configure further advertisement delivery by the service center and\/or the vendors.","According to another embodiment, service center  is configured to identify users that have at least one common product registered with the service center and are also members of a social community. The service center is configured to send a message to those users to invite them to connect (e.g., becoming friends or following a friend) with each other via the social community. The social community is hosted by a third party and communicatively coupled to the service center over a network. The service center may also deliver messages or items posted by one of those users to another one of those users on behalf of the social community, without requiring such users to individually or directly accessing the social community. The service center can also deliver messages or items to a particular user posted by other users of the social community, where the messages or items are related to a registered product of that particular user.","According to a further embodiment, an application running on a mobile device provides a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to allow a user to configure a set of one or more delivery rules concerning whether certain types of messages or advertisements should be received at the mobile device from a service center. The service center is configured to deliver messages or advertisements on behalf of a message or advertisement provider, which can be a client to the service center, a retailer, a manufacturer, a social community, or other content providers. A user can utilize the GUI to configure, for each of the providers, whether a message associated with a particular registered product of the user or all products in general related to the provider should be received by the mobile device. The settings of the delivery rules are then transmitted from the mobile device to the service center to allow the service center to deliver subsequent messages or advertisements on behalf of the message or advertisement providers accordingly. Further detailed information concerning advertisement system  can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/185,309, filed Jul. 18, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","In one embodiment, data warehouse  includes product database , client database , user database , and knowledgebase . Product database  is configured to store any data related to the registered products including user manuals, etc. Client database  is configured to store information related to clients such as client's preferred communications mechanisms. User database  is used to store information related users, such as, for example, registered products associated with a user, communications channel preference of a user, credentials necessary for a user to access other sites, and\/or messaging filtering settings of a user, etc. Knowledgebase  is used to store knowledge collected and compiled over a period of time, which can be used by agents  and\/or users for self-support purposes.","In one embodiment, service center  further includes a multi-channel communication system (not shown) to provide one or more communication channels to any user or client to concurrently access service center . Examples of communication channels include email, chat, texting (e.g., short messaging services or SMS), voice (e.g., automated IVR, real-time, or VoIP), video, Web (e.g., Web conferencing), and\/or online community forum (e.g., Facebook\u2122 or Twitter\u2122), etc. Note that the multi-channel communication system may be fully or partially integrated with service center  or alternatively, it may be maintained or provided by a third party or partner (e.g., communicatively coupled via service API  over a network). Service center  further includes an automatic caller distribution (ACD) system (not shown) to receive, route, and manage voice calls exchanged via the multi-channel communication system.","A customer can obtain support services from service center  via a variety of communication mechanisms. A customer can initiate a support request to contact a live agent such as agents  in a live manner. Alternatively, a customer may browse certain knowledgebase, such as KB  via a Web interface, in an attempt to find a solution to a problem of a product he\/she purchased from a manufacturer via a client of service center .","According to one embodiment, service center  further includes a security system  to authenticate a user of mobile device  in order to allow the user accessing services provided by any of systems -. Security system  is configured to provide multiple login and authentication options to a mobile device to allow a user to select one or more of the options to access service center . The login\/authentication options include, but are not limited to, a traditional username and password login\/authentication option, a voice login\/authentication option, and an image login\/authentication option. These options can be utilized individually or in combination dependent upon a particular user configuration or preference, which may be specified and stored in a user profile maintained by service center , as part of user database . One login\/authentication option can be utilized in addition to another login\/authentication option or alternatively, one login\/authentication option can be utilized as a backup option when another login\/authentication option fails.","In one embodiment, in response to a user selection of a voice login option, security system  causes mobile device  to present predefined one or more phrases and to request the user to speak the presented content to a microphone of the mobile device. A voice recorder of mobile device  is configured to capture a voice stream representing the one or more phrases spoken in real time by the user. Mobile device  then transmits the captured voice stream to service center  over a network. In response, security system  is configured to authenticate the user by matching the received voice stream against another voice stream that has been previously registered and stored in a database associated with the user of the service center.","Similarly, a user can also initiate an image or video login option from its mobile device. According to one embodiment, in response to a user selection of an image login option, mobile device  requests the user to capture one or more images of the user at the point in time using a camera of mobile device . Mobile device  then transmits the captured image(s) to service center  over a network. In response, security system  of service center  is configured to authenticate the user by matching the received image(s) against other image(s) that have been previously registered and stored in a database associated with the user of the service center. The previously recorded voice and\/or image references may be stored, for example, by a registration system (not shown), in a user account as part of user database . Once the service center has successfully authenticated the user, the user can obtain support services or access resources available from the service center as described above regarding one or more products or services that have been registered by the user. Further detailed information concerning security system  can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/213,000, filed Aug. 18, 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","According to one embodiment, support service system  is configured to provide services for activating a service on a product acquired by a user. The service to be activated may be a service subscribed by the user (e.g., a cellular plan) and can be activated on a device acquired or purchased by the user (e.g., a cellular phone). In one embodiment, in response to a request for activating a service on a device, support service system  is configured to communicate with other related entities (e.g., systems -) to compile all of the necessary information concerning the device (e.g., manufacturer, product model, serial number, IMSI, etc.) and subscription information of the subscribed service. Support service system  then contacts a service provider of the subscribed service on behalf of the user to activate the subscribed service on the device, without having the user to individually contact the service provider. As a result, the hassle of figuring out the detailed information of the device and activating the service on the device can be greatly reduced.","According to one embodiment, application  is installed on mobile device  of a customer or user, where application  can serve as a central service point to service center  that provides support services to a variety of products or services provided by a variety of vendors. The vendors can be, for example, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, service brokers, purchasing houses, etc. of the products. Vendors may be the clients of service center  or entities having a business relationship with service center . A user (also referred to herein as a customer) can activate application  from the user's mobile device  to reach agents  the service center  or KB data center  via a variety of communication channels or media, such as, for example, email, chat, voice (including automated interactive voice recognition or IVR, voice over Internet protocol or VoIP), video, Web, and\/or online community-based forum, etc. Application  can be a thin\/thick client application or a Web-based application.","Note that a service center described throughout this application is not limited to a traditional service center or support center, nor is it implemented in a single physical location. A service center described herein represents a collection of service logic or providers communicatively coupled to each other over a network in a distributed or a cloud-based fashion. The term of a service center herein represents any kind of service providers that provide a variety of services to customers or users.

The term of an agent, an expert, or a customer representative can also refer to any processing logic or functional block that is configured or programmed to provide automated services to a customer, for example, via services APIs of the service center, without a need of a real person involved. Such processing logic and\/or functional blocks can be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","100","102","104","102","102","104","102","106","106","210"]},"In one embodiment, support service system  includes a service activation module  configured to activate a service on a device on behalf of a user without requiring the user to directly contact a service provider of the service to be activated. The service to be activated may be a service subscribed by the user (e.g., a cellular plan, a media service subscription) and can be activated on a device purchased by the user (e.g., a cellular phone, a media player). In one embodiment, in response to a request for activating a service on a device, service activation module  is configured to communicate with other entities  (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, service providers) to compile all of the necessary information concerning the device (e.g., manufacturer, product model, serial number, EIN, IMSI, etc.) and subscription information of the subscribed service.","If the device has been previously registered with service center , such information may have already been stored in product asset store  associated with the user. Similarly, if the subscribed service has been previously registered with service center, subscription information (e.g., subscription identifier and the associated credentials) of the service may have been stored as part of service subscription information in service subscription store . User database  may also store other information such as credentials for accessing other partners' sites  and user profile  which may include user preferences, etc. Service activation module  then contacts service provider  of the subscribed service on behalf of the user to activate the subscribed service on the device, for example, by transmitting the compiled information to service provider , without having the user to individually contact the service provider. As a result, the hassle of figuring out the detailed information of the device and activating the service on the device can be greatly reduced.","In one embodiment, service activation module  is configured to proactively identify a subscribed service that can be activated on a device acquired by the user and to notify and prompt the user for permission to activate the subscribed service on the device. For example, when a user acquires or purchases a device and registers the device with the service center for support purposes, service activation module  can determine that there is a service subscribed by the user that can be activated on the newly registered device based on information obtained from product asset store  and service subscription store . Service activation module  then notifies the user of the subscribed service asking permission for activating the service on the device. For example, service activation module  may transmit a notification to mobile device  of the user regarding the subscribed service and asking for permission. In response to a positive response from the user received from application  of mobile device , service activation module  is configured to communicate with subscribed service provider  to activate the subscribed service on the device on behalf of the user.","Typically, a user can register a product or service by specifically providing detailed information of the product or service to be registered. Alternatively, the user can register the product or service simply by scanning using a camera of mobile device  a machine-readable code (e.g., QR code or serial number) of the product or a membership card of the service. Based on machine-readable code, registration system  is configured to communicate with all of the related parties (e.g., systems  and ) to compile all the necessary information of the product or service without having the user to specifically provide the detailed information. Registration system  is then configured to store the compiled information in product asset store  and service subscription store , as described in the above incorporated-by-reference patent applications. Note that the product asset store  and service subscription store  may be implemented as a single store.","In one embodiment, the registration of the device may be performed by registration system  automatically without user invention or knowledge. For example, when a user acquires or purchases a device at a retail location, an electronic receipt of the purchase is automatically transmitted from a point of sale (POS) location to service center , where the electronic receipt may contain certain information of the device such as a serial number, etc. In this example, the retailer associated with the POS location may be a client of service center . Based on the electronic receipt, registration system  is configured to communicate with the associated parties such as retailer's backend systems and\/or manufacturer's backend systems  to compile all the necessary information of the device and to register the information in product asset store  associated with the user within or accessible to service center . Thereafter, service activation module  determines and notifies the user of the subscribed service asking permission for activating the service on the device. In one embodiment, service activation module  may transmit the notification to mobile device  to be displayed by application . In response to a positive response received from mobile device , service activation module  is configured to communicate with proper parties such as service provider  to activate the subscribed service on the device on behalf of the user. A subscribed service can be any kind of services such as cellular calling plans (e.g., AT&T, Verizon), media subscription plans (e.g., Netflix, Pandora), or warranties, etc.","According to some embodiments, a registered user would be allowed to register any number of accounts for subscriptions and services that would be accessed via an electronic device with service center . This registration provides a form of single sign on allowing service center  to make the necessary authenticated and authorized changes without prompting the user to sign in every time. In one embodiment, a user can register a new device on an existing service or deactivate a device from the same service via application , which communicates with service center  over a network. A user can also retrieve a summary of the account or make certain feature changes to a device.","If a user does not have a subscription with one or more of the services available via the device (e.g., Netflix), according to one embodiment, the user may be able to connect, for example, via the service center, to the services registration system of the corresponding service provider (e.g., service provider ) to sign up for subscription of the service. Once the user is signed up and active, the registration system of the service provider can pass to service center  the necessary credentials which will allow the user to make changes, activate features, etc., on that specific service. If a user is already registered with a service (e.g., Block Buster) the user can register their login information directly with service center , which may be stored in service subscription store , to allow the necessary access to the user's account of the service provider when needed. As a result, the user may not be prompted for credentials when changes requested by the user are made.","In some cases specific functionality such as changing a credit card on a service account, etc., would be performed directly with the service provider. A user can at anytime deactivate any number of services on a specific device(s) yet still retain the necessary credentials for such services so that they can reactivate if desired. A user can also elect to terminate a subscribed service (e.g. Pandora) thus removing any or all credential information about the service from service center . In the case that a selected service (e.g. Pandora) is terminated (deleted) from service center , a user will have to reregister the service information with service center  to enable the service on any device.","In some situations, a user may activate a subscribed service on multiple devices registered with service center . When a new device is registered with service center  or a request for activating a particular service on an additional device, according to one embodiment, service activation module  is configured to determine, based on information obtained from product asset store  and service subscription store , whether the number of existing devices that have been activated with that particular subscribed service reaches a predetermined level allowed by the subscription. If so, service activation module  is configured to notify the user and to ask whether the user wishes to deactivate one of the existing devices in order to activate the same service on the new device. In one embodiment, service activation module  is configured to transmit a summary of the existing devices that have been activated with the subscribed service to mobile device  and cause application  to display the summary and to prompt the user selecting one of the existing devices for deactivation. In response to a user selection of one of the existing devices received from mobile device , service activation module  is configured to communicate with service provider  to deactivate the selected existing device and activate the new device.","After the service has been activated on a new device, according to one embodiment, product training module  is configured to offer training on operating the device in view of the subscribed service. In one embodiment, training module  transmits a media stream such as a video or audio stream to mobile device  to be played by a media player of mobile device  illustrating the operation of the new device. The training media stream may be maintained by service center  or alternatively, it may be downloaded from the corresponding product or service provider's site.

A subscribed service could be a movie or music subscription provided by Netflix\u00ae or Pandora\u00ae and a registered product could be a DVD player. For example, for the purpose of illustration, it is assumed that a customer currently has Netflix service; the Netflix credentials are registered with the service center; and the customer has four devices activated on account already while maximum devices allowed is five. The user is in an electronic store and decides to buy a blue-ray DVD player. The user pays for the DVD player and leaves the store. The service center registers device from POS electronic receipt (e.g., via API) and adds to customers asset inventory. The service center sends a notification to the user that a new asset is added and asks to enable services (e.g., Netflix, Block Buster, Vudu, Pandora, etc.). The user acknowledges, for example, via an application running on a mobile device, to activate the DVD player with its Netflix account. The service center uses product information and unique ID (e.g., serial number, MAC address, etc.) to identify the DVD player and uses customer credentials to register the DVD player's unique ID with Netflix. The user gets home and connects player per instructions (power, TV, network, etc.) and runs Netflix application on the DVD player. Netflix sees the user registered player (ID) and allows access and confirms the user account. This way if the user intends to purchase another device the user is aware that one of the currently utilized devices would have to be deactivated.","In another situation, a subscribed service could be a cellular plan provided by a cellular carrier and a registered product could be a cellular phone. For example, for the purpose of illustration, it is assumed that the customer currently has an account with the wireless carrier and the customer has registered a wireless account and a device with the service center. The customer has more than one phone on the current wireless account. The customer enters a retail store (e.g. Best Buy, Sprint Store, etc.) to buy a new phone. The customer selects phone, makes purchase, and leaves the retail store. The service center receives POS electronic receipt (via API) and adds the new phone into customer's asset store, including model, EIN number, serial number, etc. The service center notifies the customer that the new phone has been added to customer's inventory and asks if the customer would like to activate it. The customer acknowledges activation of the phone and adding the phone to the existing plan. The customer is prompted by the service center, for example, via a mobile application running on a mobile device, whether this phone is \u201cnew\u201d and is to be added to user's existing wireless account or a \u201creplace\/upgrade\u201d of an existing phone. If the customer responds that the phone is a new phone, the service center is configured to activate the wireless service on new phone. If the customer selects \u201creplace\/upgrade\u201d, the service center prompts the customer which of the existing phones on the customer account is to be replaced. The customer selects an existing phone to be replaced and the service center collects and submits customer specific information to a wireless carrier. In addition, the service center proceeds with deactivating the selected existing phone, activating the new phone, and updating account information for proper accounting and billing, etc. The wireless carrier activates the phone and notifies the service center of completion. The service center notifies the customer that the new phone is now active and walks the user through testing, software updates and downloading a mobile application, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6H","FIGS. 6A-6H","FIG. 2","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIGS. 6A and 6B"],"b":["103","600","601","605","601","605","601","602","603","604","606","618"]},"In one embodiment, a user can compile a list of items the user wishes to have by activating link . A user can search for an item that is interesting to the user using a search tool from the application. For example, a user can search on the Internet for an item the user wishes for. Alternatively, the user can scan using a scanning tool a barcode or QR code of the wished product. This is useful when a user is shopping in a retail store in that the user can scan the barcode of the product in order to add the product into its wish list. In one embodiment, for each of the items listed in the wish list, the user can review other people's comments about the product via link .
