title: Portable data storage device and method of accessing data thereof
abstract: A portable data storage device includes a control unit coupled via a predetermined interface with a computer having an operating system with user authority limits, and a memory divided into a segment I for storing related applications, a public segment II for temporarily storing instructions and data, and a hidden segment III for saving client data. In a method of accessing data via the portable data storage device, when the computer is to write data into or read data from the segment III, the data to be written or read is first temporarily stored in the segment II, and specific read or write instructions for a read/write level application interface are written into the segment II by the applications in the segment I and executed, so as to complete data exchange and access between the portable data storage device and the computer.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates to a portable data storage device and method of accessing data thereof, and more particularly to a portable data storage device and method of accessing data thereof that allows an operator to log on an operating system with user authority limits using a general user account to access data stored in the portable data storage device.","With the high development of Internet, various kinds of software for browsing information over Internet have been constantly developed and introduced into the market. Among others, Microsoft\u2122 Windows\u2122 System is an operating system best welcome by consumers and having the highest share in the market. However, since it has some backdoor programs not completely removed therefrom, Microsoft\u2122 Windows\u2122 System has become a medium for hackers to invade computer systems. Besides, it also has constantly increased problems with viruses and garbage mails. All these factors have forced information administrators of general companies to spend a lot of time and efforts in computer system management. A feasible and common way to solve the above-mentioned problems is to set limits to the authority of accessing data via user accounts. Currently, Windows\u2122 2000, Windows\u2122 NT, Windows\u2122 XP, and Windows\u2122 2003 are some Microsoft\u2122 operating systems that have user authority limits.","Meanwhile, there are also some new issues arisen with the popularization of portable flash storage devices. For instance, when a user installs a driver of a portable flash storage device in an operating system with user authority limits via a USB interface, the use of the portable flash storage device might require a certain application in an application programming interface (API), which is referred to as \u201capplication programming interface of small computer system interface\u201d (SCSI API) in Microsoft\u2122 Windows\u2122. However, functions provided by the API can be accessed only by an operator who logs on the operating system at the administrator level. Therefore, in the above-described operating environments, an operator logged on the operating system at the general user level is not able to drive the portable flash storage device in a fully normal manner. Moreover, portable flash storage devices corresponding to different Windows\u2122 operating systems do not operate in the same one manner, which also causes inconveniences in using these portable flash storage devices.","It is therefore tried by the inventor to develop a portable data storage device and method of accessing data thereof to overcome problems existed in using conventional portable flash storage devices in operating systems with user authority limits.","A primary object of the present invention is to provide a portable data storage device and method of accessing data thereof that enables data exchange and access between the device and an external computer having an operating system with user authority limits.","To achieve the above and other objects, the portable data storage device of the present invention includes a control unit coupled via a predetermined interface with an external computer having an operating system with user authority limits, and a memory divided into a segment I for storing related applications, a public segment II for temporarily storing instructions and data, and a hidden segment III for saving client data. In the method of accessing data stored in the portable data storage device, data to be written into or client data to be read from the segment III by the external computer is first temporarily stored in the segment II, and specific read or write instructions for an add-on read\/write level application interface in the applications stored in the segment I are written into the segment II and executed, so as to complete data exchange and access between the portable data storage device and the external computer that has an operating system with user authority limits.","Please refer to  that is a block diagram of a portable data storage device according to the present invention. As can be clearly seen from , the portable data storage device, which is generally denoted by reference numeral , mainly includes a control unit , and a memory that is divided into three segments, namely, a segment I , a segment II , and a segment III . The control unit  is adapted to couple with a corresponding processing unit  in an external computer  via a predetermined interface, such as a USB interface, so as to connect the computer  to the portable data storage device  to enable reading and writing of data from and into the portable data storage device . The segment I  is used to store related applications. The segment II  is a public segment used as a register to temporarily store various instruction files and data files. Data can be freely read from or stored in the data files stored in the segment II . The segment III  is a hidden segment used to save client data. Data cannot be freely read from or store in this segment III .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["2","2","31","3","101","22","3","103","3","105","3","2","103","3","107","105","107","109","111","113","22","115","3","23","109","117","119","121","22","3","123","22"]},"With the above-mentioned steps, it is possible for an operator logged on an operating system of a computer with user authority limits using a general \u201cuser\u201d account to effectively execute accessing of data via the portable data storage device of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, wherein",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
