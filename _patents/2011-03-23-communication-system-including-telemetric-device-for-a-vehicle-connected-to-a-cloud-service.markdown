The vehicle to which the telemetric device  is coupled can be, but is not limited to, a car, a truck, a train, a plane, a motorcycle, a bus, a recreational vehicle, a boat, or any other suitable vehicle, for example. The telemetric device  can be included with the vehicle during the manufacturing of the vehicle as original equipment or can be added to the vehicle as an after-market product. The telemetric device  can be attached to the vehicle at any suitable location on the vehicle. For example, as original equipment of the vehicle, the telemetric device  can be an integral portion of the dashboard of the vehicle. Additionally, the telemetric device  can be attached to the vehicle's dashboard, storage compartment, electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU), fuse box, diagnostic gateway, or the vehicle's electrical system, either by wired or wireless connection.","A diagnostic gateway is any interface or interfaces through which diagnostic data can be obtained. For example, a typical diagnostic gateway is a diagnostic port such as a vehicle's on-board diagnostic (OBD) port. OBD ports can either be OBDI, OBD1.5 or OBDII. Other diagnostic gateways are JOBD for vehicles in Japan, EOBD for vehicles in Europe, and controller-are network (CAN). Alternatively, the diagnostic gateway could be directly connected to the ECM or ECU of the vehicle . In addition, the diagnostic gateway could include individual vehicle components or systems. For example, the diagnostic gateway could include the tire pressure sensors. The diagnostic gateway can be wired or wireless. For example, if the diagnostic gateway includes the tire pressure sensors, then the tire pressure sensors can transmit data concerning the pressure in the tires either over a wire or through the air wirelessly. It is also possible that the diagnostic gateway includes multiple interfaces. For example, the diagnostic gateway could include the OBDII port and the tire pressure sensors. The communication between the telemetric device  and the diagnostic gateway can be either wireless or wired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["20","20","24","25","26","24","25","26"]},"Data Aggregator","The data aggregator  includes a wired or wireless bridge\/gateway that exchanges data to and from the vehicle  and\/or the wired devices and objects  and\/or the wireless devices and objects . The term \u201cdevices\u201d includes active devices such as devices that are powered, and the term \u201cobjects\u201d includes passive devices such as smart cards or other devices equipped with RFID but that are not powered. The data aggregator  discovers and interprets modes of communication preferably in real-time. The data aggregator learns or defines the communication mode (e.g. protocols, languages, etc.) between the connected vehicle , the wired devices and objects , and the wireless devices and objects . The data aggregator  communicates data directly to the processor  for further analysis, execution, or communication to\/from (i.e., bidirectional) the cloud services .","The data aggregator  discovers the communication modes preferably in real-time. The data aggregator  can interpret and communicate data from vehicle , the wired devices and objects , the wireless devices and objects . The processor  receives the interpreted data and then processes the interpreted data. For example, the telemetric device  can include a vehicle interfacing chip\/module that interprets the OBDII communication codes received from the OBDII port from a vehicle. The processor  can then further process the interpreted OBDII communication codes.","The data aggregator  can be wired for communication with, for example, the diagnostic gateway, the electrical system, or any other wired juncture. The data aggregator  can wirelessly communicate with, for example, a keyless entry system, and discoverable devices internal or external to the vehicle. Discoverable devices include, but are not limited to phones, laptops, computers, navigation devices, near field communication devices, and any suitable device with a discoverable communication. The data aggregator  can also receive data from the processor  to communicate the data to any device that the data aggregator  is connected with, including, for example, the diagnostic gateway or discoverable device. That is, the data aggregator  can create bidirectional communication between the processor  and any device that the data aggregator  is connected with. The data aggregator  can also collect data from the input\/output (I\/O) devices  included with the telemetric device . Once the data is collected, the data is communicated to the processor  for computing. The discovering process of the data aggregator  is discussed below.","The data aggregator  can include I\/O devices  that can enhance the functionality or remote measuring, reporting, and communication of data. For example, data aggregator  could included a GPS module  that provides location data or a display or LEDs  that indicate that the telemetric device  is \u2018ON\u2019 or is transmitting data. Further, other I\/O devices  could be a joystick or keyboard, radar, or condition sensors such as fuel, tire pressure, motion, weight, temperature sensors and devices that can be a combination thereof, such as an audio\/visual system that can receive input from a user and broadcast outputs (e.g., an infotainment platform with interactive displays and speakers, which can be used for playing movies or music, providing a web-browser, or similar programs and applications).","The data aggregator  also includes a communication interface  that can include a wired module  or wireless module  that enables wired or wireless communication. The communication interface  can perform the physical\/active discovering initiated by the data aggregator  and can simultaneously communicate with any desired device, including, but not limited to, devices, objects, and vehicles. The communication device can use any suitable protocol, including proprietary protocols and open protocols such as the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI).","Discovering Devices for Connection","Vehicle communication protocols can be discovered by detecting the presence of outgoing data packets, including, for example, wireless RF communication in the vehicle. The telemetric device can first detect as soon as it is turned on. It could be the first action that the telemetric device  would take. The telemetric device  will begin detecting for any device within a certain radius around the telemetric device. The telemetric device  can detect using any of its communication protocols. Different communication protocols can have different radiuses in which a device using that communication protocol can be discovered. For example, using the Bluetooth\u00ae protocol, the telemetric device  can discover Bluetooth\u00ae devices within a radius, for example, of about five or ten feet, and using the Wi-Fi protocol, the telemetric device  can discover Wi-Fi devices within a radius, for example, of about 50 or 100 feet. Once the telemetric device  discovers a device, it will attempt to communicate with the device and determine what protocol or language should be used to communicate with the device. If it is successful, then a communication link will be established so that data can be communicated between the cloud services  and the device, which could allow the device to be controlled or interfaced.","For example, the telemetric device  could establish communication with a cell phone, an electronic garage door, a vehicle, a wireless home network, or any suitable device that can be connected through a wired or wireless network. It is also possible that the telemetric device  can communicate with other telemetric devices located in other vehicles. This device-to-device communication can be accomplished either directly between the telemetric devices or through the internet via, for example, a cellular network interface.","After the telemetric device  is on and has established communication with the cloud services  (i.e., in the active mode), the telemetric device  will begin a continuous loop of searching for a device using one of its communication protocols within a pre-determined radius (e.g., five feet, 100 yards, one mile, five miles). The telemetric device  will transmit frequencies including, but not limited to, infra-red (IR), Bluetooth\u00ae, 802.11, motion, sonar, radar, etc. If a device is located within the predetermined radius and is receptive to the communication protocol transmitted by the telemetric device , then telemetric device will pair with the located device.","This process will be specific to the communication protocol being used. For example, if telemetric device  uses the communication protocol 802.11, then the telemetric device  would transmit a wireless signal in search of a wireless network. For example, if the wireless signal is broadcasted and received by a wireless router, then a connection can be established. The wireless router then transmits a signal to the telemetric device  and allows for the pairing with the telemetric device . Thus, bidirectional communication is established between the wireless router and the telemetric device . The process would be similar for any device in or near the vehicle.","A. Wired Telemetric Device Connection","A wired telemetric device  could be connected directly to the vehicle, for example, through the OBDII port, fiber wire, or any other suitable connection method. The telemetric device  would still detect its surroundings, but communication would be much more direct because the device is wired to the telemetric device . The telemetric device  would establish bidirectional communication using the protocol to which it is connected. For example, if the OBDII port is used, then the OBDII protocol is used. Once the bidirectional communication is opened, the telemetric device  can begin communicating directly with whatever device it is wired to. For example, the telemetric device  could detect the presence of the vehicle's radio or navigation\/computer system and establish bidirectional communications directly with vehicle's radio or navigation\/computer system, without the communications going through the ECU or the CAN port.","B. Wireless Telemetric Device Connection","Wireless connection would be similar to the steps discussed above for a wired connection except that there would be no direct connection using wiring. The telemetric device  would detect the presence of any outgoing transmissions from the vehicle or devices in or around the vehicle. The telemetric device could use, for example, a RF transponder for wireless communication. After discovering the device, bidirectional communication can be established between the discovered device and the telemetric device . For example, to control the vehicle's locks, the telemetric device  could discover a signal being transmitted by an RF transponder and replicate the signal, allowing the telemetric device  to lock and unlock the vehicle doors by replicating the transponder communication.","Processor ","The processor  provides most of the functions of the telemetric device . The processor  can have an embedded or a general-purpose architecture, depending on the desired functionality of the telemetric device . The processor  processes the data received from the data aggregator , then passes the processed data to the cloud communication interface , where data is sent to the cloud services . Additionally, the cloud communication interface  provides bidirectional communication between the cloud services  and the telemetric device .","The processor  includes 1) system firmware , which is the operating system software of the telemetric device , 2) main memory  that can include RAM  and ROM  and that can store computer programs that, when executed by the processor , provide the functions of the telemetric device , and 3) storage device  that stores the most data. ROM  preferably stores data\/instructions critical to the functioning of the telemetric device . The storage device  can include, for example, a removable memory device such as a USB thumb drive, MP3 player with internal memory, or other suitable removable memory device or other suitable media devices. The storage device  can include multiple devices. For example, the storage device  can include an internal hard drive and a USB thumb drive.","The processor  can compress\/uncompress, encrypt\/decrypt, and convert\/translate the data. For data being transmitted by the telemetric device , the processor  can perform on the data to be transmitted one or more of compression, encryption, and conversion into binary format. For data being received by the telemetric device , the processor  can perform on the received data one or more of uncompression, decryption, and translation into useful data. Typically, for data that is to be sent, the processor  converts the data into a binary format, compresses the binary data, and then encrypts the compressed data, and for data that is received, the processor  decrypts the data, uncompresses the decrypted data, and translates the uncompressed data into useful data.","A. Compression\/Uncompression","The telemetric device  can transmit and receive either compressed or raw data. The telemetric device  can transmit a portion of the data stream using compression and another portion of the data stream without compressing the data. The telemetric device can uncompress any received data.","B. Encryption\/Decryption","The telemetric device  can transmit and receive either an encrypted or unencrypted stream of data. The telemetric device  preferably uses a cipher or key to encrypt the data that is going to be sent. The telemetric device  can transmit a portion of the data stream using encryption and another portion of the data stream without using encryption. When the received data is encrypted, the telemetric device  can decrypt the data using a standard decryption process. The telemetric device  stores the requisite cipher and key necessary to decrypt the encrypted data. The telemetric device  uses the cipher and key to decrypt the encrypted data so that the decrypted data can be further processed.","C. Conversion to Binary Format\/Translation into Useful Data","The telemetric device  can translate data into binary form to reduce the size of data transmitted from the device to the cloud services  and can convert data in binary form into useful data. The telemetric device  can transmit none, a portion, or all of the data stream in binary form. The telemetric device  can translate data received in binary form into useful data that the telemetric device  understands.","D. Communication Device","The cloud communication interface  in the telemetry device  can include a plurality of communication protocols, such as TCP, UDP, FTP, or a proprietary protocol thereof, over one or more of the following interfaces: GSM, CDMA, GPRS, WAP, and UMTS. The general\/miscellaneous communication interface  within the data aggregator  of the telemetric device  can use any suitable protocol, including Bluetooth\u00ae, Wi-Fi, RF, PAN (Personal Area Network), and\/or Near Field Communications.","F. Power Source","The power source  provides power for the telemetric device . The power source  can be connected to the electrical system of the vehicle, or the power source  can include a power component, such as a battery, that can be charged through the electrical system of the vehicle. Preferably, the telemetric device  is connected to the power source  such that the telemetric device  is always on and transmitting data, even if the vehicle is not on or running. For example, if the telemetric device  is connected to the battery of a vehicle, then the telemetric device  can transmit data even when the vehicle is off. Preferably, the telemetric device  monitors the condition of the vehicle's battery (or other similar power source) so that the telemetric device  stops transmitting to prevent the vehicle's battery from discharging to the point that the battery will not start the vehicle.","Real-Time Data Transfers","The telemetric device  preferably automatically provides real-time or near real-time data of the vehicle to which it is connected. That is, the telemetric device  provides a continuous or nearly continuous data stream without any prompting by a user. The telemetric device  preferably provides the data stream without any input or prompting by a user and is not based on any condition or change in a condition of the vehicle to which it is connected. The telemetric device  will, simultaneously and in real-time, provide a bidirectional communication channel for data to be communicated to and from the vehicle. The telemetric device  preferably has the capability of sending remote signals to the vehicle that can control functions and operations of the vehicle.","Frequency of Data","The telemetric device  can update the data with any frequency. For example, the telemetric device  can have an update frequency of about 10 times a second (real-time) or can have an update frequency of about once every couple of minutes (near real-time), or can have any update frequency between these two end-points. The update frequency can be fixed or can be variable. For example, if the telemetric device  senses that the vehicle has not moved after a fixed period of time, then the telemetric device  can reduce the update frequency, which can reduce power consumption. Also, the update frequency can be changed depending upon which type of network that the telemetric device  is connected to. For example, if the telemetric device  is connected to a network that can handle higher data volume, then the update frequency can be increased. Conversely, if the telemetric device  is connected to a network that can only handle lower data volume, then the update frequency can be decreased. Different data can be updated with different frequencies, including reducing the update frequency to zero, i.e. not updating the data. For example, if the vehicle enters an area with a network with lower data volume, the update frequency of the location data of the vehicle can be maintained, while the update frequency at which the temperature outside the vehicle is updated can be lowered or reduced to zero. It is also possible that different data can be transmitted based on a change of vehicle conditions. For example, if the telemetric device  detects that a window is broken or that there is movement within the vehicle at a time when there should not be movement, then the telemetric device  can transmit data concerning a possible break-in. The telemetric device  can also notify predetermined people that the vehicle in question has been involved in an accident and is inoperable, via the cloud services  or publicly broadcasted to cloud resources .","Transmission of Real-Time Data","The telemetric device  preferably sends real-time or near real-time location data. The location data is typically based on a GPS data provided by a GPS device. However, the location data could be determined from user input data, LAN data, cellular network data, or any data suitable for determining the vehicle's location. The telemetric device  can also transmit data based upon any information received by the data aggregator . For example, the telemetric device  can transmit data concerning the vehicle's condition. For example, if the vehicle is a car and if the telemetric device  is connected to the OBD port of the car, the telemetric device  can transmit data indicating that the car needs an oil change or other service or maintenance needs.","Receiving of Real-Time Data","The telemetric device  can also receive data. For example, the telemetric device  can receive media data such as data for a song. If the telemetric device  is an after-market product and includes an RF interface, then the telemetric device  can play the song using the vehicle's speakers by transmitting the data for the song using an RF protocol to be received by the vehicle's radio. If the telemetric device  is original equipment for the vehicle, then the telemetric device  is typically integrated with the vehicle's radio, which allows the song to play on the vehicle's radio without using the RF protocol.","Push\/Pull of Data","The telemetric device  can download and pull rich content and firmware updates after determining such updates are necessary. Once the telemetric device  is connected to the vehicle, it runs a continuous loop of queries and commands. Preferably, one such query is to ping the vehicles diagnostic gateway (e.g., the vehicle's ECM or ECU) asking if any firmware\/software updates are needed. In addition, the cloud services  will also have the requisite knowledge to determine if any firmware or software updates need to be pushed to the diagnostic gateway. In the event that the telemetric device  and\/or cloud services  determine that a firmware update is necessary, either from update files available on the internet or through communication with the diagnostic gateway, the telemetric device  will begin downloading the firmware data which may be directed towards the vehicle, devices, or sub-components of the vehicle. The downloading is analogous to downloading an email attachment. Cloud services  will send the file to the telemetric device . Upon receipt of the file, the telemetric device  will open the file and begin downloading the file. The data being downloaded will be stored in the storage device  of the telemetric device . Once the downloading is complete, the telemetric device  will run a completion check to determine if download has completed successful. This completion check could be as simple as determining the initial file size and comparing it to the downloaded file size being stored in the storage device  of the telemetric device . Once the completion check is complete, the telemetric device  can upgrade its own firmware or can send through the diagnostic gateway for a new firmware upgrade to be installed for any connected device, for the vehicle, or for any object within the vehicle. For example, a navigation unit can request a large rich content update from the cloud services  after being queried by the telemetric device . The navigation software could be out of date and in need of an update or traffic\/road conditions need to be sent to the navigation device. The telemetric device  would request the download from cloud services . Cloud services  would send the software upgrade to the telemetric device . The telemetric device  would begin downloading the file and saving it to the storage device  of the telemetric device . It is possible that large size file can take substantially longer to download in full, even on a 4G network. Once the download is completed, the telemetric device  would run the completion check on the downloaded file for size and completeness. Once the completion check is completed and successful, the telemetric device  performs a release of the software upgrade to the navigation unit for installation.","Vehicle Controlling Data","The telemetric device  can also receive data that controls the vehicle. For example, the telemetric device  can be connected to the vehicle such that, when the telemetric device  receives a start-up command, the telemetric device  can cause the vehicle to start-up. In a similar fashion, the telemetric device  can be used to lock or unlock the vehicle's doors and can be used to determine the location of the vehicle. The telemetric device  can be used to control auxiliary functions of the vehicle such as opening\/closing of trunk or gas cap or controlling the radio, windows, hood, heated seats, sunroof, etc.","Cloud Communication Interfaces","The telemetric device  preferably also includes a cloud communication interface  that transmits data to\/from the cloud services . The physical communication can take place through a wired module  or preferably, a wireless module , which, for example, can use a wireless network, such as a GSM or CDMA carrier, to communicate data to the cloud services  using one of the preferred protocols of TCP, UDP, FTP, or a proprietary protocol thereof. Similarly, the cloud services  can contain a TCP, UDP, FTP listener, or a proprietary protocol thereof, for listening to data communicated by the telemetric device . The cloud services  preferably have no limit to the number of simultaneous connections it can have.","The telemetric device  including the data aggregator , processor , and cloud communication interface  can be implemented using either hardware or software. The hardware can include known components such hard drives, DVD drives, CD drives, BlueRay drives, RAM, ROM, one or more processors, one or more electronic displays, and any other suitable hardware devices. The software can be stored on any suitable tangible or non-transitory computer-readable medium such that, when run on the hardware, the functions discussed above are performed.","Data is Transmitted from the Telemetric Device  to the Cloud Services ","The cloud services  and the direct clients  are each connected to the internet . Thus, the telemetric device  can transmit and receive data to and from the cloud services  and the direct clients . The direct clients  can provide access to browsers and\/or applications , which are examples of the direct clients. The telemetric device  can also transmit and receive data to and from the cloud services  and the cloud resources . Examples of cloud resources  are content providers, including those that provide media data such as songs and movies, advertisements, social media, etc. The cloud resources  could also be social network providers. The cloud services  can receive the real-time or near real-time data stream from the telemetric device . The cloud services  can also provide data to the telemetric device . The cloud services  can preferably provide data without the need for a call center or prompting by a user. For example, based on the location of vehicle or the location history of the vehicle, the cloud services  can return data concerning nearby stores. If the cloud services  receive data that indicates that the vehicle needs an oil change, then the cloud services  can transmit data indicating the location of a nearby service station where the vehicle's oil can be changed. If the telemetric device  includes an LCD display output device or similar display device, then the cloud services  can transmit the data to the LCD display output device or similar display device. If the telemetric device  does not include an LCD display output device or similar display device, then the cloud services  can transmit the data to the wireless device ,  of the operator of the vehicle. The cloud services  can transmit a coupon or promotional material in addition to or separately from the information concerning nearby stores.","General Description of the Cloud Services ","The cloud services  are the intelligent processing engine behind the telemetric device . The cloud services  receive data from the telemetric device  for processing and storage. The cloud services  are responsible for delivering usable and readable data to the end user for use with the telemetric device . The cloud services may also communicate bidirectional data to the cloud resources .","Components of the Cloud Services ","The cloud services  preferably include two main components: device services  and application services  shown in . The device services  preferably include a device listener , device log , device gateway services , cloud services database , and intelligence engine . The application services  preferably include mobile services , web applications , and notification services , emergency services gateway .","Device Services ","The device services  shown in  include device listener , device log , device gateway services , cloud services database , and intelligence engine . The device services  serves as the intelligent processing unit of the cloud services . The device services  receive data from the telemetric device  via the device listener . The device listener  logs the data in the system device log . The device listener  then transmits the data to the device gateway services  where the data is processed into a useful format. For example, the data from the telemetric device  could be converted into a binary format, compressed, and encrypted. To process the data into a useful format, the data is decrypted, uncompressed, and translated from binary code into a usable data for further processing. Of course, if the data is not encrypted, then the data does not need to be decrypted; if the data is not compressed, then the data does not need to be uncompressed; and if the data is not in a binary format, then the data does not need to translated into usable data. After the data has undergone the necessary processing, if any, the data is stored in a cloud services database  for storage and retrieval by the application services  of the cloud services .","A. Device Listener ","The device listener  is a bridge between the cloud services  and the telemetric device . The device listener  transmits data between the cloud services  and the telemetric device . The device listener  receives and sends the transmitted data to the device log  for logging\/reference purposes by the device gateway services . The device listener  serves primarily as a conduit for data to pass between the telemetric device  and the cloud services .","The device listener  serves as the gatekeeper that prevents unauthorized devices from transmitting or accessing the cloud services . The device listener  ensures that only data using the proper protocols is transmitted and received by the device gateway services . The device listener  verifies that the devices attempting to communicate with the cloud services  are using an identifiable language that the cloud services  can understand. Typically, the data will be transmitted using a proprietary protocol, but it is also possible that the data is transmitted using an open protocol. The proprietary communication is preferably based on and compatible with an open protocol, such as TCP, UDP, or FTP protocols. For example, the data could be transmitted with the proprietary communication based on the TCP protocol.","B. Device Log ","The device log  stores data transmitted between the telemetric device  and the cloud services . The device log  receives the data transmitted from the telemetric device  to the cloud services  via the device listener . The device log  records the data transmission and saves the data. It is possible that the device gateway services  receive the data from the device log  instead of directly from the device listener .","The device log  provides an audit trail that allows data transmissions between the telemetric device  and the cloud services  to be recorded in an unprocessed format (i.e. unmodified data from the telemetric device  that has not been processed) for further, more-in-depth analysis at a later time. The cloud services  can recall the data stored on the device log  and extract for analytical purposes certain data that was not initially extracted. The device log  is a data mine for unprocessed data collected from the data transmissions of the telemetric device . The device log  preferably includes unprocessed data from a multitude of telemetric devices .","C. Device Gateway Services ","After receiving the unprocessed data from the device listener , the device gateway services  determines if the data is compressed, encrypted, or in a binary format. If necessary, the device gateway services  uncompresses, decrypts, and translates the data transmitted from the telemetric device . As explained above, the processor  of the telemetric device  can compress, encrypt, and convert the data before the data is transmitted to the cloud services . When the data is encrypted, the device gateway services  can decrypt the data using a standard decryption process. The device gateway services  can store the requisite cipher or key necessary to decrypt the encrypted data. The device gateway services  uses the cipher to decrypt the encrypted data so that the decrypted data can be further processed.","The telemetric device  can compress the data. The device gateway services  can uncompress any received data that has been compressed by the telemetric device .","The telemetric device  can translate the data into a binary format. This binary data is virtually unusable by a computer processor until translated into useful data. The device gateway services  translate the data transmitted from the telemetric device  into useful data so that the data can be processed by and stored in the cloud services database .","After the data is translated into useful data, the device gateway services  parse the data into individual data pieces that are stored in the cloud services database . The device gateway services  parses the data into individual data pieces that are stored in the appropriate locations or referenced within the data structures (e.g. data tables) of the cloud services database .","Additionally, the device gateway services  preferably place trigger mechanisms for the emergency services gateway  and notification services . The intelligence engine  listens for the trigger mechanisms. When the intelligence engine  receives data with a trigger mechanism, the intelligence engine  transmits the data to the corresponding data for emergency services gateway  and notification services  for providing an alert or notification, which is discussed below.","D. Cloud Services Database ","The cloud services database  receives and stores the data from the device gateway services . The cloud services database  can store the data in various data tables for storing the processed data that can be used by the device gateway services , intelligence engine , and the application services . For example, data tables can include data tables that are particular to location, user info, diagnostics, vehicle data, etc. It is possible to delete unnecessary data tables once the data tables are no longer needed and to add new tables that have a structure and\/or data that is different from existing tables. The deletion and addition of data tables can be performed by a system administrator, for example.","The data stored by the cloud services database  is not limited to the data received from the telemetric device . The cloud services database  also stores information, data, and content from the application services . Within the cloud services database , information is consumer friendly data; data is machine readable content accessed using, for example, an application programming interface (API), which is a particular set of rules and specifications that a software program can follow to access and make use of the services and resources provided by another particular software program that implements that API; and content is music, files, or other data, for example, needed by the application services . Further, if a user or user group is created, for example, from the application services , this data is stored in the cloud service database  for reference by the mobile services  or web application . Additionally, the cloud services database  could also store user preferences, which are not particular to a telemetric device , but are when a mobile application communicates with the application services .","E. Intelligence Engine ","The intelligence engine  is the location-aware analytical engine that powers the cloud services , including both mobile- and web-based applications. Intelligence engine  is preferably the event-based intelligent engine discussed in U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/070,459 concurrently filed herewith and entitled \u201cSystem for Event Based Intelligent Targeting.\u201d Intelligence engine  enhances the delivery of notifications from the telemetric device  to the cloud services  and end user. The notifications can be catered notifications that are only sent to a single user or can be non-unique notices that are sent to a plurality of users. For example, a unique notice could be a coupon to a vehicle operator that needs an oil change that is near a specific repair shop. A non-unique notice could be a coupon for a coffee shop for all vehicle operators within a fixed radius of the coffee shop. The notifications can be sophisticated notifications based on data received from the telemetric device  or other data such as weather or time. That is, sophisticated notifications can be based on one or more of the location of the vehicle, time, user input, etc. For example, with regard to the unique repair shop coupon discussed above, the intelligence engine  can determine based on the time to send the coupon and only if the repair shop is open.","The intelligence engine  performs additional analysis on the data stored in the cloud services database  to provide catered and\/or sophisticated notifications through notification services  of the application services . While the intelligence engine  can use the notification services  of the cloud services  to transmit its analyzed data, it can also have its own notification services. The intelligence engine  processes and analyzes the data transmitted from the device gateway services .","Application Services ","The application services  provide a public interface so that the public can access the information, data, and content stored in the cloud services database . As shown in , the application services  can include, but is not limited to, mobile services , web applications , notification services , and an emergency services gateway .","A. Mobile Services ","The mobile services  within the application services  provide the public interface optimized for mobile content within the cloud services . As shown in , mobile clients  (e.g., cell-phones, PDAs, smart-phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) can communicate with the cloud services  though the mobile services . For example, this allows a mobile client  to communicate with telemetric device , which allows mobile client  to control the functions of the vehicle, including, for example, starting the vehicle.","B. Web Application ","The web application  is a public interface similar to the mobile services  but optimized\/enhanced for a richer experience through a web browser . The web application  is also a popular choice due to the ubiquity of web browsers . For example, an end user can communicate with the telemetric device  through a web browser  to control the functions of the vehicle, including, for example, starting the vehicle.","C. Client ","A client  can include, but is not limited to, cell-phones, PDAs, smart-phones, laptops, smart-devices, etc. A client  can use a browser , an application , or other  to communicate with the application services .","D. Browers, Application, Other","A client  can connect to the application services  through wired or wireless networks. The client  can use a web browser  that is a software application designed for the retrieving, presenting, and traversing of information resources on the internet. The client  can also use an application , which is specifically programmed to perform, manage, or communicate directly with the application services  of the cloud services . Further, if the client  uses an application , then an API is used in communication with the application services . Other  in  references singular protocols, such as, but not limited to, SMS, MMS, POP3, IMAP, or any other proprietary or OSI used to access the application services  within the cloud services .","E. Notification Services+Emergency Items","The notification services  facilitate the timely delivery of alerts and\/or similar content to the mobile services , web application , and emergency services gateway . The cloud services  can also provide alerts if the telemetric device  sends data (time+event) indicating that the vehicle has been in an accident or similar event driven alert requiring notification as determined by the cloud services . These alerts are then sent to the emergency services gateway , where they are then processed and\/or forwarded to emergency services  in , which include municipalities, emergency response teams, E911 services, public dispatch centers, etc. The dispatched emergency services can include an ambulance, firemen, and police and\/or predetermined persons who are not in the vehicle and\/or persons or groups set forth by the cloud services . Together with the cloud services , the emergency services also contain a significant level of intelligence. For example, if the cloud service  has detected a vehicle accident or similar emergency event, then the emergency services gateway  can transmit a message to designated authorities to investigate the event, as well as, transmit message to a first predetermined contact. If the cloud services  detect that the first predetermined contact was not in the vehicle during the emergency event or not available for contact, then it can try a second predetermined contact.","The cloud services  including the device services , intelligence engine , and application services  can be implemented using either hardware or software. The hardware can include known components such hard drives, DVD drives, CD drives, BlueRay drives, RAM, ROM, one or more processors, one or more electronic displays, and any other suitable hardware devices. The software can be stored on any suitable tangible or non-transitory computer-readable medium such that, when run on the hardware, the functions discussed above are performed.","Further, it is also possible for the telemetric device  to communicate with other telemetric devices and wireless\/wired devices in or around the vehicle based upon a predetermined radius from telemetric device. The device-to-device communication can be accomplished either directly or indirectly through the cloud services . For example the cloud services  may utilize the device-to-device communication with telemetric device  to compare accelerometers measuring G-forces in wired\/wireless devices in or around the vehicle during an emergency event.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["140","140","140","149","140","141","142","143","145","150","146","147","148"]},"The OBD2 connector  connects the telemetric device  to the diagnostic system of the vehicle, typically via a wired connection, for example. The power control  provides 5 V and 3.8 V voltages for the other devices of the telemetric device . The power control  could provide voltages other than 5 V and 3.8 V as well. The power control  can also include a charge circuit for charging batteries (not shown). The telemetric device  also includes a processor  and miscellaneous logic .","The remote  communicates with a vehicle remote control unit , typically via a wireless connection. The vehicle remote control unit  is cable of, for example, of starting the vehicle and of locking\/unlocking the vehicle's doors.","The GPS module  includes an antenna , and the GSM\/GPRS modem  includes an antenna and a SIM card . The GPS module  and the GSM\/GPRS modem  shown in  are connected to the main unit . However, it also possible to include the GPS module  and the GSM\/GPRS modem  with the main unit . While the GPS module  and GSM\/GPRS modem are shown in  as a single unit, they can also be separate units.","It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention.
