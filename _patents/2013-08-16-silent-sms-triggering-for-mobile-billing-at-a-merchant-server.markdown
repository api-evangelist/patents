Field of the Invention","This invention relates to a system and method for processing transactions.","2). Discussion of Related Art","Merchant servers often have stores allowing consumers to use browsers within mobile devices to select goods, virtual goods or services from the merchant server and then to make a purchase from the merchant server. The consumer may be asked to select payment options, such as credit card details, payment via an account having a stored value, or have a charge placed on their phone bill. If the consumer selects their phone bill, the merchant server transmits a payment authorization to a billing server. The billing server is aligned with one or more carrier servers and places a charge on a phone bill of the consumer at the carrier server. There are methods that exist in the art for the billing server to determine a phone number and\/or a carrier corresponding to a consumer mobile phone of the consumer.","The carriers in different countries have different requirement with respect to currency and price points that are supported. In addition, a merchant server may have a number of different options available for purchase at different target prices. For example, a merchant may sell 100 points, 200 points or 300 points. The different levels of service sold by the merchant server may not be in exact multiples due to carrier restrictions with respect to price points. Alternatively, a merchant may wish to provide different levels of service at different price points that are optically more favorable (e.g. $1.99, $2.99 and $3.99) or that factor in discounts for larger purchases.","The invention provides a method of processing transaction with at least one merchant computer, including receiving, with the at least one merchant computer, a confirmation of a purchase from a consumer device, triggering, with the at least one merchant computer, in response to the confirmation of the purchase, a silent text message to the consumer device, wherein a purchasing unit on the consumer device responds to the silent text message by sending a text message with a unique transaction ID to a short code of a billing server via a carrier server to the billing server and receiving, with the at least one merchant computer, in response to triggering the silent text message, a callback notification from the billing server with the transaction ID.","The method may further include transmitting, with the at least one merchant computer, in response to receiving the callback notification, a transaction result to the consumer device.","The method may further include configuring, with at least one merchant computer, a pricing matrix of countries and target prices, the pricing matrix having a set of cells, each cell corresponding to an intersection between a respective country and a respective target price, such that each country has a subset of the set of cells, the subset having different price points, storing, with at least one merchant computer, the pricing matrix, receiving, with at least one merchant computer, a transaction request from a consumer device, identifying, with at least one merchant computer, a country of the consumer device based on the transaction request, matching, with at least one merchant computer, the country of the consumer device with a country in the pricing matrix, determining, with at least one merchant computer, at least one price point for the country that has been matched in the pricing matrix and transmitting, with at least one merchant computer, the price point that has been determined to the consumer device, allowing a user of the consumer device to make a purchase.","The method may further include registering, with at least one merchant computer, a publisher portal account at the billing server, creating, with at least one merchant computer, a service in the account and adding, with at least one merchant computer, the countries of the pricing matrix to the service, wherein the pricing matrix is configured by the merchant computer on the billing server and being approved on the billing server.","The method may further include integrating, with at least one merchant computer, a service call into a mobile phone application, setting, with at least one merchant computer, permissions in the service call, directing, with at least one merchant computer, the mobile phone application to retrieve price points from the merchant computer, creating, with at least one merchant computer, a payment request as part of the service call and publishing, with at least one merchant computer, the mobile phone application for download onto the consumer device, the consumer device being a consumer mobile phone.","The method may further include storing a prompting routine on the merchant server to prompt the merchant server to call a billing server service application programmable interface which retrieves price points from the billing server, and retrieving the price points from the billing server.","The method may further include that at least one price point for one of the countries differs from all price points of another country.","The method may further include that the price points for two different countries are in different currencies.","The method may further include that the one target price has a plurality of different price points between countries.","The method may further include that the price points for at least one country is only supported below a predetermined amount.","The method may further include that the price points for one country are only supported for a set of predetermined amounts.","The method may further include receiving, with the at least one merchant computer, a user selection of at least price following the transmission of the price point, transmitting, with the at least one merchant computer, a transaction request API call to the billing server, receiving, with the at least one merchant computer, a transaction request response from the billing server in response to the transmission of the transaction request and transmitting, with the at least one merchant server, a purchase confirmation to the consumer device including data from the transaction request response.","The method may further include that the transaction request API call includes a merchant-id, a service-id, a handset-locale, an mcc (mobile country code) and an mnc (mobile network code).","The method may further include that the transaction request response includes an api-version, a trx-id, a result-code, a result-msg, a price, a product-description, a service-name, a client-message and a client-action.","The invention also provides a non-transitory computer-readable medium having stored thereon a set of instructions wherein, when executed by a processor of a computer performs a method of processing transaction with at least one merchant computer, including receiving, with the at least one merchant computer, a confirmation of a purchase from a consumer device, triggering, with the at least one merchant computer, in response to the confirmation of the purchase, a silent text message to the consumer device, wherein a purchasing unit or the consumer device responds to the silent text message by sending a text message with a unique transaction ID to a short code of a billing server via a carrier server to the billing server and receiving, with the at least one merchant computer, in response to triggering the silent text message, a callback notification from the billing server with the transaction ID.","The invention further provides a merchant computer system including a processor, a computer-readable medium connected to the processor and a set of instructions on the computer-readable medium and executable by the processor. The set of instructions includes at least one module that executes the method of receiving a confirmation of a purchase from a consumer device, triggering in response to the confirmation of the purchase, a silent text message to the consumer device, wherein a purchasing unit or the consumer device responds to the silent text message by sending a text message with a unique transaction ID to a short code of a billing server via a carrier server to the billing server and receiving in response to triggering the silent text message, a callback notification from the billing server with the transaction ID.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["12","14","16","18","20","12","14","14","16","16","18","20","12","16","12"]},"The billing server  includes a transaction application programmable interface (API) management module , a carrier billing module  and a Short Message Service (SMS) messaging module .
