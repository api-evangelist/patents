title: Systems and methods for streamlined interactions with document services from mobile computing applications
abstract: A document-services dialog window, accessible from all applications of a mobile computing device (MID), interacts with other applications on the MID, and with remote document services on a document access server. The applications on the MID are linked to the document access server and to the document references stored in a document reference repository on the MID. The document references can be beamed to another MID. The document services interface is invoked to access a desired document reference and enables a user of a MID to execute actions on a selected document via the selected document reference.

Field of Invention","This invention generally relates to systems and methods for interacting with computer program applications.","2. Description of Related Art","Portable document solutions for Personal Digital Assistant-class (PDA-class) devices from competing vendors rely on remote servers to perform the services. A user interacts with the remote server through a general-purpose browser, which has fill-in fields, action buttons, and so forth. The document creator applications, e-mail software, communication software, and mobile information device-resident browsers installed on many PDA-class devices often come from various suppliers.","A mobile information device (MID) is a handheld device that combines computer applications, telephony and\/or remote networking features. A typical mobile information device can function as a cellular phone and\/or a personal organizer. A mobile information device may be equipped with a hypertext-markup-language (HTML) or wireless access protocol (WAP) browser and\/or e-mail reader.","High value information is frequently inaccessible to users of mobile information devices (MID) because this information is often in a file having a file format that is inaccessible to software installed on the mobile information device or because it is otherwise inaccessible for some other reason. Such files may be in any number of file formats, for example, spreadsheet, word processing, or high-resolution graphical file formats. Software applications, which can interact with the data format of the files to be accessed, are not typically installed on the mobile information device. Therefore, the user of the mobile information device cannot access the information embedded in such files. Instead, these applications may be installed at a remotely-located document access server. A document access server allows a remote user to fax, print, and\/or view information stored on, or otherwise accessible to the document access server. In response to a command issued at the mobile information device, the document access server prepares the attachment for viewing, printing and\/or faxing, and dispatches the prepared document to a target fax machine, printer, or other appropriate device.","This invention provides systems and methods that permit streamlined interactions with document services by linking diverse applications on a mobile computing device, such as a contact list, e-mail applications, and so forth, to a document access server.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that provide a document reference repository.","This invention further provides systems and methods that provide the document reference repository on the mobile information device.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that allow diverse applications on a mobile information device to be linked to a document reference repository.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that provide for sharing document references with other mobile information devices.","This invention separately provides systems and methods that allow diverse applications on a mobile information device to be linked to an application or the like that implements sharing of document references with other mobile information devices.","In various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention, a small pop-up document-services dialog window is accessible from all applications of a mobile computing device by way of a globally-available menu item. The document-services dialog window and zero, one or more auxiliary dialog windows interact with other applications on the mobile information device, and with remote document services.","In various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention, a document services interface is invoked to access a desired document service. The document services interface enables a user of a mobile information device to execute actions on a selected document through, or by using, a document access server. In various exemplary embodiments, the interface is invoked by selecting an icon in a browser window whose contents are generated by a document access server. In various other exemplary embodiments, the interface is invoked by selecting a globally accessible menu item after first selecting a unique identifier within a text display area that is supplied by some other application's interface. In various other exemplary embodiments, the interface can be invoked either by selecting an icon in a browser window whose contents are generated by a document access server and\/or by selecting a globally accessible menu item after first selecting a unique identifier within a text display area that is supplied by some other application's interface.","In various exemplary embodiments, an action to be executed on the document is determined. In various exemplary embodiments, a database of available actions is stored on the mobile information device. In various other exemplary embodiments, available actions are hard-coded into the interface. An action identifier is determined for a selected action. In various exemplary embodiments, the action identifier is a textual identifier similar to the menu selection corresponding to the action. In various other exemplary embodiments, the action identifier is a numeric identifier.","In various exemplary embodiments, one or more optional action options are determined. An action option modifies a selected action. In various exemplary embodiments, the document identifier, action identifier, and one or more optional action option identifiers are transmitted back to the document access server. In response, the document access server performs the selected action on the document identified by the document identifier. Accordingly, it is not necessary for the software required to open or access that document to be installed on the mobile information device. Nor is it necessary, to perform the selected action on the selected document, to download that document from the document access server to the mobile information device, or to re-upload that document back to the document access server from the mobile information device.","These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in or are apparent from the following detailed description of the systems and methods according to this invention.","In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, unique document references or document identifiers are icons appearing in a browser display or window. The browser display or window may present content from the Internet, an intranet, an extranet, or any other known or later-developed distributed network that is accessible from the document access server. In various exemplary embodiments, the unique document references or document identifiers are derived from Internet or intranet uniform resource locators (URLs). The mobile information device typically communicates with the document access server through some wireless or wired networking technology, often over the Internet. The document access server uses similar technology to access documents, associated with a document reference, that may be located elsewhere on the Internet, or on an intranet, an extranet, a local area network, a wide area network, a storage area network, and\/or any other known or later-developed distributed network.","In various exemplary embodiments, the unique document references or document identifiers are displayed in the browser window as selectable text within an application running on the mobile information device, such as, but not limited to, e-mail applications, calendar applications, note-taking applications or any other appropriate known or later-developed application. As discussed below in greater detail, the unique document references or document identifiers can also be stored into a document reference repository and\/or shared between different mobile information devices by various communication means, including, but not limited to, infrared or radio-frequency \u201cbeaming\u201d.","The following detailed discussion is directed to one specific type of application, an e-mail application, with which the browser window and document references or document identifiers are usable. However, it should be appreciated that this is for ease of understanding and familiarity only, and should not be interpreted as limiting the types of applications with which the systems and methods according to this invention are usable.","It should also be appreciated that using the document references or the document access server according to this invention does not require the mobile information device to be continuously connected to a document access server. That is, it is possible to do useful things with a document reference, such as, for example, sharing the document reference with other mobile information devices, or creating a new document reference, without having to be connected to a remotely-located document access server. This is advantageous because a wireless mobile information device may not always be within range of a broadcast tower; because use of the wireless service is often charged per-minute; and because certain actions can be accomplished more quickly when the mobile information device does not have to engage in two-way communication with a document access server.","For example, e-mail readers typically allow a user to download e-mail messages addressed to that user from the remotely-located document access server. The user can then disconnect from the e-mail server and read the downloaded e-mail messages at the user's leisure. In various exemplary embodiments according to this invention, the user can open the downloaded e-mail messages, and save any document references that may appear in the downloaded e-mail messages into the document reference repository. The user can then operate on the saved document references, such as by faxing, printing, beaming and\/or any other desired action, when it is convenient to wirelessly re-connect to the remotely-located document access server, and do all of the desired operations on the saved document references in a single batch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","100","110","112","114","116","120","120","110","121","120","110"]},"In various exemplary embodiments, each of the one or more referenced electronic documents is identified by a unique document identifier or document reference . It should be appreciated that these terms are generally interchangeable. In various exemplary embodiments, each document reference or document identifier  may be one or more of a user-friendly text string, a uniform resource locator (URL), and\/or an iconic representation of the referenced electronic document. In fact, each document identifier may be displayed in any manner by which a user of a mobile information device, on which the graphical user interface or browser display or window  and the e-mail document  are displayed, may receive visual information.","It should be appreciated that, in various exemplary embodiments, the graphical user interface or browser display or window  may also include an attachment field . In various exemplary embodiments, the attachment field  contains one or more document references or document identifiers  that identify corresponding documents that were included as attachments to the e-mail document . In general, such an attachment field will be implemented in a way specific to the particular e-mail application. However, it should be appreciated that any known or later-developed method for implementing the attachment field  can be used.","In various exemplary embodiments, the graphical user interface or browser display or window  displays the e-mail document  inside a window or application area . An informational area  of the window or application area  may display informational items relating to the e-mail document . Thus, application or document information  may be displayed along, for example, the top border of the window or application area . A scroll bar  may be displayed in the graphical user interface or browser display or window . The scroll bar  enables a user of the graphical user interface or browser display or window  to intuitively determine the position of a displayed portion within, and the extent of, the e-mail document  being displayed. In various exemplary embodiments, the scroll bar  may include a portion  displaying this information.","In various exemplary embodiments, the graphical user interface or browser display or window  also may present the user with various options for processing the displayed document, such as the e-mail document , such as a \u201creply\u201d function accessed via a Reply button , a \u201creply all\u201d function accessed via a Reply All button , a \u201cforward message\u201d function accessed via a Forward button  and a \u201cclose message\u201d function accessed via a Done button . In various exemplary embodiments, clicking the Reply button  invokes the reply function, which enables a user of the graphical user interface or browser display or window  to send a reply message back to the sender of the e-mail document .","In various exemplary embodiments, clicking the Reply All button  invokes the reply all function, which enables a user of the graphical user interface or browser display or window  to direct a reply message back to the sender of the e-mail document  and all other addressees of the e-mail document . In various exemplary embodiments, clicking the Forward button  invokes the forward message function, which enables a user of the graphical user interface or browser display or window  to forward the e-mail document  to another recipient. Finally, in various exemplary embodiments, clicking the Done button  invokes the close message function, which enables a user of the graphical user interface or browser display or window  to close the e-mail document , and optionally perform any selected actions on the e-mail document . The Done button may also close the graphical user interface or browser display or window .","As indicated above, documents associated with the e-mail document , which are accessible through the graphical user interface or browser display or window , are represented by unique document references or document identifiers . In particular, these document references or document identifiers  can be understood, parsed or interpreted by the document access server. That is, in various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention, a repository is provided on the mobile information device in which unique identifiers can be stored and\/or managed for later use with the document access server and\/or for sharing with other mobile information devices. Additionally, in various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention, a user is able to directly enter a unique document reference or document identifier  for a document that may not yet exist using any data entry mode that is supported by the mobile information device being used. This allows all unique identifiers accessible to the mobile information devices to be shared with other mobile information devices by various techniques, including, but not limited to, infrared or radio-frequency \u201cbeaming\u201d, as will be discussed below in greater detail.","In various exemplary embodiments, clicking or selecting one of the one or more document references  (or the document references  if the attachment field  is implemented) invokes a document services interface. In various exemplary embodiments, the document services interface may also be invoked by selecting a globally accessible menu item. For example, in various exemplary embodiments, the document services interface may also be invoked by first selecting a document identifier presented in any other application, in addition to or instead of the e-mail application discussed above, that is capable of storing and\/or presenting document identifiers, followed by invocation of a globally accessible menu item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","100","200","110","100","200","260","260","121","260","200"]},"In various exemplary embodiments, the document services interface  enables a user to access a document identifier database, or access a document identifier repository, that is resident on the mobile information device. Thus, clicking the Add To Pocket button  accesses a save function that enables a user to save the currently selected document identifier  to the document identifier database or repository. Moreover, clicking the Open Pocket button  invokes the document identifier database or repository, enabling a user to select a previously-saved document identifier  stored in the document identifier database or repository for further processing.","In various exemplary embodiments, the document services interface  enables the user to select an action to be performed on the document corresponding to the selected document identifier . In various exemplary embodiments, an action may be selected by selecting the Options widget . In various exemplary embodiments, the Options widget  accesses or invokes an options entry interface. The options entry interface presents action selections, for example, via a drop-down list. In various exemplary embodiments, these actions can include faxing, printing and\/or beaming the identified document, as well as any other appropriate known or later-developed action that can be performed against a document identified by a selected document identifier . In various exemplary embodiments, the selected action may be executed by activating the Send button . The send button  invokes a \u201cperform action\u201d function that performs the selected action on the document identified by the selected document identifier . Alternatively, a user may quit the document services interface  without executing the selected actions on that document by clicking the Done button  to close the document services interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","310","300","310","300","320","325","320","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["320","310"]},"For example, as shown in , in various exemplary embodiments, upon selecting a particular contact record, the other relevant information, such as a recipient's name, address, and other identifying information, is transferred from the contact list or address book into a facsimile cover sheet. That is,  shows one exemplary embodiment of a cover sheet interface screen that displays a facsimile cover sheet that has been automatically populated with information from the selected contact record selected using the contacts list or address book lookup interface. Selecting the Details button  accesses a details interface (not shown) that allows the user to specify whether the facsimile cover sheet is to be automatically prepared or not from the information contained in the selected contact record. Additionally, in various exemplary embodiments, when the facsimile cover sheet is selected, the details interface allows the user to easily access the facsimile cover sheet to add a message to the facsimile cover sheet or to alter any of the information that was automatically entered into the facsimile cover sheet.","In various exemplary embodiments, the facsimile options interface  contains an action selection widget .
