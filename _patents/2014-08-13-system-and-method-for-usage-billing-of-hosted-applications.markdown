title: System and method for usage billing of hosted applications
abstract: A system, method, and computer readable medium for usage billing of one or more hosted applications serving one or more clients. The hosted applications are contained within one or more isolated environments or run without isolated environments. The system may include usage billing based on one or more of resources open, amount of data flowing through resources, number of open files, number of transactions, number of concurrent users, number of processes, CPU utilization and memory usage, The system may further include a management interface where administrators may add, remove and configure isolated environments, configure client policies and credentials, and force upgrades. If using isolated environments, the isolated environments may be isolated from other applications and the host operating system on the clients and applications within the isolated environments may run without performing an application-installation on the client.

Field of the Invention","This invention pertains generally to enterprise computer systems, computer networks, embedded computer systems, wireless devices such as cell phones and PDAs, computer systems, and more particularly to methods, systems and procedures (i.e., programming) for providing application isolation for multiple applications running on a host operating system and for providing usage billing for applications running within the isolated environments. The invention further provides application usage billing for applications running within a \u201ccloud computing\u201d or \u201chosted environment\u201d with or without isolated environments.","2. Description of Related Art","In many environments one of the most important features is to ensure that one running application doesn't affect other running applications, and that the crash of one application doesn't compromise other running applications. In many environments applications share system resources, libraries and hardware, which expose subtle interconnects between seemingly unrelated applications.","Several approaches have been developed addressing this fundamental problem. The first level of application isolation is provided by the operating system. Modern operating systems such as Linux, UNIX, Windows2000, NT, XP and Vista provide some level of application isolation through the use of processes, and the underlying hardware memory management unit. The use of processes generally ensure than one running application process cannot address memory owned by other processes. This first level of isolation does not address the use of shared resources, such as files, file systems, shared memory, and libraries, so other approaches have been developed.","The present invention builds on the teachings in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/813,593 wherein Havemose teaches \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR APPLICATION ISOLATION WITH LIVE MIGRATION\u201d, and U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/813,618 wherein Havemose teaches \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR HIERARCHICAL INTERCEPTION WITH ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS\u201d collectively identified as \u201cHavemose\u201d throughout the disclosures. Havemose discloses system and methods for creating and maintaining isolated environments wherein applications can be installed and run without interfering with any other applications on the host system. Havemose further discloses system and methods for creating isolated environments and for the use of pre-created isolated environment as \u201cinstallation-free\u201d images that can run on a client without requiring direct application installation on the client, and systems for hierarchical interception. Havemose teaches an approach that works on commodity operating system using off-the-shelf applications. Havemose was incorporated herein by reference in its entirety above.","In a \u201cCloud computing\u201d environment, where resources and applications are dynamically assigned and accessed remotely a related challenge is one of charging for the use of the application. Historically, applications were purchased by a corporation, installed in the company's datacenter and managed by in-house IT staff. With the shift to cloud computing, the applications are hosted somewhere in the internet \u201ccloud\u201d and accessed remotely. The actual end-user or the end-user's IT group are typically not responsible for installing, hosting, and maintaining the application.","A variety of approaches have been designed to manage billing for application use. Historically software was purchased and paid for once and keep updated using an annual maintenance contract. With the move to hosted applications, the hosting provider needs a flexible way to do \u201cusage billing\u201d where the user pays based on actual use patterns. Existing billing-mechanisms are often either fixed one-time licenses as just described, or require custom applications, custom operating systems, or custom hardware.","In U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,928 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,680 Wiedmer teach \u201cBilling System for Computer Software\u201d and \u201cBilling System for Computing Software\u201d respectively. The teachings rely on a combination of algorithms and custom hardware security and billing modules. The billing modules are replaced periodically and the billing information is read from the billing module. In a typical cloud environment requiring custom hardware and replacement of modules to do billing is impractical and not well suited to hosting in a datacenter. Furthermore the teachings do not address usage billing.","In U.S. Pat. No. 5,235,290 Cauffman et al teach \u201cBilling System with Data Indexing\u201d. The teachings describe a pre-processing mechanism to facilitate display, under the control of a service customer, for services rendered to a customer. The teachings do not disclose steps for collection of usage billing information or the use in a cloud computing environment, only a pre-processing step for displaying the results.","In U.S. Pat. No. 5,386,369 Christiano teach \u201cLicense Metering System for Software Applications\u201d. The teachings rely on a hardware dongle as \u201cmetering device\u201d and disclose various techniques to ensure that the application metering data is accurately stored, and cannot easily be lost due to hardware failures. The teachings do not address the actual metering mechanics, the use within the context of cloud computing or application isolation.","In U.S. Pat. No. 5,708,709 Rose teach \u201cSystem and Method of managing try-and-buy usage of application programs\u201d. The teachings focus on ensuring that a user only can run applications properly licensed using a combination of encryption and verification. The teachings do not address collecting usage billing information or application isolation.","Therefore, in many systems, providing usage billing of hosted applications requires one or more of customized operating systems, customized applications, and proprietary billing infrastructure Furthermore, the above cited references do not include or address application isolation. Hence, there is a need for systems and methods that combine application isolation with usage billing of hosted applications running on commodity operating systems such as Windows and Linux","The present invention provides a system and methods for usage billing of one or more hosted applications. The one or more applications are pre-configured inside one or more isolated environment and the isolated environments are hosted on one or more central servers. The teachings of Havemose work on commodity operating systems, such as Windows and Linux, and work with standard \u201coff the shelf\u201d applications; no customizations of operating system or applications are required, and no virtual machines, virtual file system or any other proprietary protocols are needed. The isolated environments with said one of more applications are accessed remotely or locally and clients can run said one or more applications without ever performing a local installation. Usage billing information is collected for said one or more applications and collected and aggregated for billing purposes. In one embodiment an implementation in the Linux environment is disclosed, in another embodiment an implementation on Windows is disclosed. In yet another embodiment, an implementation of usage billing without isolated environments is disclosed.","Another aspect of the present invention is the fine granularity on which usage billing is provided. Examples include billing based on application time used, application memory used, number of open files, number of transactions, amount of air-time, and a variety of other metrics. Yet another aspect of the present invention is a flexible event driven billing aggregator providing summary billing information for each chosen event type.","Yet other aspects of the present invention are a two-way authentication subsystem and encryption of communication data. The streaming server is authenticated by clients before they accepting any streaming data, and clients likewise are authenticated against pre-defined credentials before the streaming servers delivers any isolated environments or updates.","A user of the client computer can run the application without needing to install or configure the application; the user runs the application as pre-configured and provided on the streaming server. The present teachings require no special virtual file systems, proprietary streaming protocols, or any other proprietary protocols.","The terms \u201cWindows\u201d and \u201cMicrosoft Windows\u201d is utilized herein interchangeably to designate any and all versions of the Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Examples of transport include TCP\/IP, Message Passing Interface (MPI), Myrinet, Fibre Channel, ATM, shared memory, DMA, RDMA, system buses, and custom backplanes. In the following, the term \u201ctransport driver\u201d is utilized to designate the implementation of the transport. By way of example, the transport driver for TCP\/IP would be the local TCP\/IP stack running on the host.","The term \u201cinterception\u201d is used to designate the mechanism by which an application re-directs a system call or library call to a new implementation. On Linux and other UNIX variants interception is generally achieved by a combination of LD_PRELOAD, wrapper functions, identically named functions resolved earlier in the load process, and changes to the kernel sys_call_table. On Windows, interception can be achieved by modifying a process' Import Address Table and creating Trampoline functions, as documented by \u201cDetours: Binary Interception of Win32 Functions\u201d by Galen Hunt and Doug Brubacher, Microsoft Research July 1999\u201d.

The abbreviation IE is used to designate an isolated environment on the diagrams and throughout the text.","The Term \u201cIsolated Environment Infrastructure (IEI)\u201d is used herein to designate the entire isolated environment infrastructure as disclosed in Havemose. It's comprised of shared libraries, a series of interceptors and other configuration information is described in the cited reference. Details of IEI will not be further described herein.","The terms \u201cCloud Computing\u201d, \u201cSoftware as a service (SaaS)\u201d, \u201cUtility Computing\u201d, and \u201cHosted Applications\u201d are used herein interchangeably to designate a deployment model where applications are hosted centrally, often off-site, and accessed remotely. Typically, the applications are hosted and managed by an independent company and the end-user pays to access the software services.","The term \u201cusage billing\u201d is used herein to designate that the user of an applications pays to use the application based on one or more metrics. Possible metrics include, but are not limited to: time used, storage used, number of open files, number of records in a database, and number of times the application has been launched.","Further aspects of the invention will be brought out in the following portions of the specification, wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing preferred embodiments of the invention without placing limitations thereon.","Referring more specifically to the drawings, for illustrative purposes the present invention will be disclosed in relation to  through . It will be appreciated that the system and apparatus of the invention may vary as to configuration and as to details of the constituent components, and that the method may vary as to the specific steps and sequence, without departing from the basic concepts as disclosed herein.","The context in which this invention is disclosed is one or more applications installed inside isolated environments and hosted on an \u201cIsolated Environment Streaming Server (IESS)\u201d with the isolated environments being streamed to one or more clients. The Havemose reference cited above, included in its entirety by reference, teaches the creation and maintenance of the isolated environments. Usage billing information is collected by the Isolated Environment Infrastructure (IEI) present on all clients, and aggregated by a billing manager system. Without affecting the general case of multiple applications, the following scenarios often depict and describe one or two applications as applicable. Multiple applications are handled in a similar manner. Similarly the following scenarios often depict one or two clients; multiple clients are handled in a similar manner. Similarly, the following scenarios often depict one isolated environment per client; multiple isolated environments are handled in a similar manner. Similarly, the following scenarios often depict one IESS; multiple IESSes are handled in a similar manner. The term \u201cclient\u201d is used only to designate that it's the recipient of the isolated environments steamed from the IESS. By way of example, the \u201cclient\u201d may be a desktop workstation, a server in a data center, or a virtual machine hosted on some other server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","10","20","30","40","10","12","13","18","14","16","20","22","23","28","24","26","30","32","33","38","34","36"]},"Each client connects to the IESS  via the Client Policy Manager (CPM) . The CPM validates the credentials and maintains an Account for each credentialed client. Associated with each Client Account is an update-cache used to optimize access to isolated environments enabled for the particular client. Each client has one update-cache per credentialed IE.

By way of example, if personnel in HR want to interact with the payroll system on the IESS and upload payroll information, the client system used by the HR employee validates the credentials of the IESS before uploading sensitive payroll information. If the IESS credential validation fails, the client system disconnects and stops interacting with the IESS.","A related issue is security; ensuring that no malware of spyware gets downloaded into the clients isolated environments. By requiring a credentialed IESS, there a no risks of connecting to a malware site by mistake as such connections would be refused by the isolated environment infrastructure without establishing any connection beyond the initial attempt to validate credentials.","Full IESS credentials are provided by a standard SSL certificate issued by either a certificate authority or generated in-house. If the IESS is accessed over the internet, a preferred implementation uses a certificate issued by a Certificate Authority. If the IESS only is accessed via a private LAN, WAN or VPN, an in-house generated certificate would suffice, but a certificates issued by a Certificate Authority equally works.","The present invention establishes the initial secure communication using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a standardized technology widely available in modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux. Open source implementations of SSL include OpenSSL (www.openssl.org).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"160"},"First a certificate for the IESS is generated. Generation of the IESS certificate only is needed when creating a new certificate, or when a certificate has expired. Generally, a certificate is valid for one or more years if generated by a certificate authority. First a private and public key pair is generated . This is accomplished using commonly available tools, such as \u2018makekey\u2019 provided by OpenSSL. In a preferred implementation, the a certificate request is prepared (\u2018certreq\u2019 in OpenSSL) with the public key and transmitted to the Certificate Authority  together with information confirming the senders identity. The Certificate Authority generates a certificate  and delivers it back to the originator  and the certificate is installed on the IESS. In an alternate implementation, the certificate is self-generated using one of the available tools, such as \u2018testreq\u2019 from OpenSSL. The certificate  is used to establish the credentials of the IESS by clients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"170"},"The client initiates communication  with the IESS using SSL. In response to the initial contact, the IESS  accepts the request for the certificate  and delivers the certificate to the client. The client validates the certificate . Validation can take one of two forms: in a preferred implementation the certificate is compared against a local copy provided by the administrator as part of present invention, in an alternate implementation the certificate is validated against known and pre-approved certificate authorities. Modern operating systems, such as Linux and Windows, provide a mechanism to store pre-approved certificates. If the validation fails  the client disconnects  as the IESS is rogue, mis-configured, or has an invalid certificate. If the certificate validates , the client proceeds  and using SSL establishes secure and encrypted communication  with the IESS.","The client is now ready to have its client credentials validated  by the Client Policy Manager (CPM) within the IESS.","With possibly multiple isolated environments hosted on an IESS, proper authentication of clients is important. By way of example, if a particular isolated environment contains a payroll software application, only clients with the proper credentials (generally personnel in human resources) should have access to the payroll application. The Client Policy Manager (CPM) running on the IESS governs which clients have access to which isolated environment. The specific client privileges are set by the system administrator and are implemented by the CPM.","The connection between client and IESS, as describe above, is established using SSL, and is therefore secure and encrypted. The client only needs the client account as its credentials. All IEs available to a particular client are managed by the CPM and the key-pair needed for encryption is managed by SSL.","When a client wishes to use a particular application within an isolated environment; the client makes a request to the Client Policy Manager (CPM) for access to the requested IE. The CPM validates the client credentials at two levels: first the client is validated as having access to the IESS services, followed by validation of the client's credentials for the requested IE.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["200","202","204","206","207","208","224","210","212","214","218","224"]},"If the client is credentialed to run the particular IE , the IE needs to be either installed or potentially updated. If the IE is not installed on the client , it is copied to the client environment, and the IESS update-caches are updated to reflect the current state of the client copy. If the IE already is installed on the client , the update-caches on IESS are queried and updates propagated as necessary. The caching and installation are described in more detail below.","When a client starts the present invention he is presented with a list of available IEs based on his credentials.  illustrates by way of example embodiment , a client obtaining the list of credentialed applications and launching a chosen application. First the client is credentialed  as described above. The client requests a list of credentialed IEs  and the CPM  responds with a list of IEs available and credentialed for the particular client. The list is presented to the client . In a preferred embodiment the client is presented with a graphical user interface  allowing the client to choose from a list of credentialed applications  and starting the application directly by clicking either on the application name  or OK . The launch can be cancelled by selecting \u201cCancel\u201d . The client can also force a refresh  of available IEs, thereby updating the IE list . In a preferred embodiment the most recently chosen application is automatically highlighted. By way of example,  illustrates the scenario  with two credentialed applications (\u201cPayroll\u201d and \u201cBenefits\u201d) and one application no longer credentialed (\u201cInvestor Relations\u201d). By selecting \u201cOff-line\u201d  the user indicates no synchronization against the IESS and that the local already-installed IE should be run.","The Client Policy Manager (CPM) within the IESS is the main contact point between clients and the IESS. The functionality of the CPM fall in several broad categories: 1) delivery of certificates to clients and establishment of SSL, 2) general client account access, 3) administration, and 4) management and implementation of the caching subsystem.  illustrates by way of example embodiment , the architectural blocks of the CPM .","6.1 Certificates and SSL:","As disclosed previously, the IESS is credentialed by clients using a SSL certificate. The certificate serves dual roles, as a mechanism for the clients to validate the identity of the IESS and by providing keys for secure encrypted communication over SSL.

The SSL interface  is responsible for the IESS end of SSL. In modern operating systems SSL is in general pre-defined to use certain ports such as  and  for SSL certificates and https respectively.

Each client account record  in the database  contains at least the following fields:\n\n","The \u201cclient login\u201d is the \u201cuser-id\u201d used to validate the client account, while the \u201caccount holder name\u201d, is the actual name of the person to which the account is assigned. The \u201cstatus of account\u201d indicates if the account is valid and credentialed. Finally, the database maintains a list of isolated environments to which the user is credentialed. This list is presented to the user when requesting Client IE enumeration  as disclosed in section .","Associated with the client account are also the caching subsystem  and the billing and logging subsystem .","6.3 Update-Cache subsystem for Isolated Environments.","When a client requests access to a credentialed isolated environment, the IE is streamed in its entirety if not already present on the client system, or the client IE is selectively updated with changes as appropriate.

Some of the largest files are Word at 12 MB, Excel at 10 MB and PowerPoint at 6 MB. On a typical 1 Gbit\/sec corporate network a typical good transmission rate is about 100 MB\/sec, but can be significantly less. A typical ADSL connection runs at 1.5 Mbit\/sec or 150 kB\/sec and can be less.","The one-time installation of the entire environment with Office 2003 therefore typically takes about 3.1 sec or longer over corporate network. Over ADSL the Office IE takes 35 min or longer. While the 3.5 seconds on the office network is acceptable, the 35 minutes for ADSL access is not practical.

The message digest is a 128 bit or longer integer calculated in a manner to ensure that two different files have different message digests. Message Digests are well known within the art. Commonly deployed digests are MD5 (\u201cMessage-Digest algorithm 5\u201d of size 128 bit), MD6 (Message-Digest algorithm 6 with sizes up to 512 bits), and SHA-n (Secure Hash Algorithm \u2018n\u2019 with sizes up to 1024 bits). The message digest is used as part of the validation to see if a particular file should be streamed to the client. A practical issue is hash collision, where two different files produce the same hash value. SHA-2 has no known hash collisions and is the default in a preferred embodiment. To further reduce the risk of a hash-collision possibly affecting the update-caches, the size of the file (m_FileSize) and the time stamp of the most recent file change (m_LastChangeTime) are also used in the comparing against the update-cache.","All supported Message Digests Algorithms are predefined as integers and the one used encoded in the field \u2018m_MessageDigestAlgorithm\u201d.","Another field \u201cm_CompressionOn\u201d determines if compression is used for the particular file corresponding to the CacheLine.

All supported compression algorithms are pre-defined as integers and the one used encoded in the field \u201cm_CompressionAlgorithm\u201d. Compression algorithms are provided as part of modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux. In a preferred embodiment, the operating systems default compression algorithm is used. In an alternate embodiment a customized compression algorithm is used. A wide selection of open source and commercial no-loss compression algorithms exists, including but not limited to LZ, LZR, LZX, PKZIP, GZIP and ZIP.

The entire process is as follows:","Initially, the client and the IE are credentialed against the CPM as previously disclosed . The client  requests an update of the IE and transmits the client's u-cache to the CPMs cache mgr . The CacheMgr's traverses the update-cache one CacheLine at a time  and comparing against the u-cache received from the client . First test  is to see if the current CacheLine is present in the client's u-cache. If the CacheLine is not in the u-cache, it signifies a new file in the IE, and the file corresponding to the CacheLine is prepared to be transmitted to the client . If the CacheLine exists in the u-cache, a second test is performed. The second test  is to see if the CacheLine entry has been updated when compared to the corresponding u-cache CacheLine. If the IESS CacheLine indicates a change has been made, the file corresponding to the CacheLine is prepared to be transmitted  to the client. If the CacheLines are identical in the update cache and u-cache, no further steps on this CacheLine are necessary.","The second test  to see if two CacheLine Entries are identical is performed as follows: The client u-cache and the update-cache CacheLines are considered identical if all of the following are identical: m_FileName, m_Directory, m_LastChangeTime, m_FileSize, and m_MessageDigest. If one or more of said fields are different, the entry is deemed not too match.","The final step after identifying a file for transmittal to the client  is to test if the file should be compressed  per the field in the CacheLine. If the file is to be compressed , it's compressed  and transmitted . If compression is not activated, the file is transmitted .","Upon completing the comparison of the client's u-cache with the update-cache , the update-cache is sent to the client ","On the client, all new files are received  and copied into the environment . Finally, the u-cache is replaced with the update-cache corresponding to the just-completed update . The final step is to synchronize the client's new u-cache against the client's IE and remove files no longer included in the u-cache . If the client immediately reconnected , the update process  would detect no new files and the update process would be instantaneous.","In continuation of the example above, a typical Microsoft Office security patch modifies few of the 1800 files in full installation of Office. By way of example, if 50 files are modified only those 50 files need to be streamed to the client, corresponding to less than 3% of the total installation. This reduces the ADLS update from 35 minutes to 1 minute, which is a practical delay to install a patch over a slower network.","The present invention supports two modes of operation: an \u201coff-line\u201d mode of operation where the client runs an already-installed isolated environment without connecting to the IESS, and an \u201con-line\u201d mode where the client is fully validated and updates automatically are streamed.","By way of example, a user connects with the present invention while at the office, retrieves and updates all credentialed IEs and works with the applications within the IE as if they were locally installed.

As part of the load process, the AGCP  preloads the interceptors , including the Interception Layer (IL) , for each application process, the billing interceptors  and the checkpointer library  for each application process. The application process interception layer , the billing interceptors  and the checkpointing library  are shared libraries and pre-loaded together.

Multi-process applications are handled in a similar manner with one checkpointing thread created per process. As processes are created and terminated, checkpointing threads are added and removed as necessary as disclosed in Havemose. As part of initializing the checkpointing library , the checkpointing library registers  the current process with the checkpoint barrier  The registration ensures that the current thread and process is included in the barrier, and ensures that the current process' checkpoint thread  is called as part of the barrier The billing interceptor  run within the address space of the application process  and are automatically included in the checkpoints.","The Interception database IDB  is global to all application groups within the isolated environment. If the IDB  has not been loaded, the AGCP  launches the IDB  prior to the performing the load process disclosed above.","The checkpointer, billing interceptors and the isolated environment all need access to all intercepted functions. In general, the checkpointer operates on the running application and utilizes interception to capture resource and their usage. The isolated environment utilizes the interception to re-direct resource usage to the isolated environment, and the billing interceptors add billing counters to a variety of system calls. By way of example, and not limitation, when application A1  reaches function ifunc( ) , which is subject the interception, the function ifunc( )  is intercepted  and re-directed to the application process interception library . At this point ifunc( ), its context and parameters reflects the actual running application process. The intercepted call is first processed by the billing interceptor , then forwarded  to the checkpointing library , where all relevant stack information is saved. If ifunc( ) changes the process hierarchy, the change is communicated  to AGCP  in order to have AGCP  preload or remove the interceptors as previously disclosed. Control is then returned  to the application process interception layer . The application process interception layer calls  to the Interception Layer (IL) . The IL  remaps resources using the Interception Database  as disclosed in Havemose. Adjusted resources or data are returned  to the interceptor and sent back  to the calling application process via the return of ifunc( ).","Usage billing requires sampling and monitoring of application group execution. By way of example, an application user may be billed based on one or more of amount of CPU time used by the application, amount of resources required, number of open files, number of concurrent users, number of transactions, number of processes, and the number of time the application has been run.","The billing interceptors  run as part of the application group's application processes and are only activated when an intercepted function is called.
