{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/921,959, filed Aug. 2, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,191,239.","The present invention relates to the field of remote network connections and more particularly to securing a customized connection application.","With the technological developments of the last decade and growing popularity of online commerce, e-mail, online chatting and the Internet in general, the demand to have constant access to these innovative technological ways of communication is rapidly increasing. Some users cannot imagine their lives without the Internet and email; some cannot imagine their lives without being able to buy groceries online. Constant desire to be connected to the informational highway increases demand for reliable, fast, convenient network connection.","Anyone using current technology has dealt with networks at some point. Being connected to a local network where users share files and data on one server is a common scheme in workplaces. Companies would like their employees to use network connection tools that reflect company's policies, such as session duration limits, usage of particular Point-to-Point locations, etc. However, companies usually obtain network access tools from outside providers. The security of these network access tools may however become compromised.","According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method to secure a connection application in a multi-party access environment including a plurality of service providers. The method may include generating a customized connection application, and cryptographically signing the customized connection application. The customized connection application may be for installation on a client machine.","The customized connection application may be in the form of a self-extracting executable automatically to install the connection application on the client machine. In one embodiment, the method cryptographically signs the customized connection application using Authenticode\u2122 technology available from Microsoft\u2122 Corporation. The connection application may then be distributed to the plurality of service providers via a computer network for downloading by the client machine.","The invention extends to a machine-readable medium for executing any of the method described herein.","Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","Although the present invention is described below by way of various embodiments that include specific structures and methods, embodiments that include alternative structures and methods may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","In general, embodiments described below feature a system and a method that secure a connection application (e.g., a dialer) for distribution to multiple end-users. One embodiment of the present invention features a centralized network dialer customization system.","Network-Related Technology","Before describing embodiments of the present invention in detail, it may be helpful to discuss some of the concepts on which the present invention is based. A component of one embodiment of the present invention is a computer server. Servers are computer programs that provide some service to other programs, called clients. A client and server communicate by means of message passing often over a network, and use some protocol, (i.e., a set of formal rules describing how to transmit data), to encode the client's requests and\/or responses and the server's responses and\/or requests. The server may run continually waiting for client's requests and\/or responses to arrive or it may be invoked by some higher level continually running server that controls a number of specific servers. Client-server communication is analogous to a customer (client) sending an order (request) on an order form to a supplier (server) dispatching the goods and an invoice (response). The order form and invoice are part of the protocol used to communicate in this case.","Another component of one embodiment of the present invention is Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC), a collection of software structures written in C++ language and which are Microsoft Windows-based classes and which can respond to messages, make windows, and from which application specific classes can be derived. The current invention also utilizes the Remote Access Service (RAS) API, which provides an abstraction layer between the application and the underlying hardware that provides the Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP) connection. RAS is a feature built into Windows NT that enables users to log into an NT-based Local Area Network (LAN) using a modem, X.25 connection or Wide Area Network (WAN) link. RAS works with several major network protocols, including TCP\/IP, IPX, and Netbeui.","Another component of one embodiment of the present invention is a Point-to-Point Tunnel Protocol (PPTP), a new technology for creating Virtual Private Networks (VPN), developed jointly by Microsoft Corporation, U.S. Robotics and several remote access vendor companies, known collectively as the PPTP forum. A VPN is a private network of computers that uses the public Internet to network processing locations. Because the Internet is essentially an open network, PPTP is used to ensure that messages transmitted from one VPN node to another are secure.","Yet, another component of one embodiment of the present invention is a Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI), an Application Programming Interface (API) for connecting personal computers running Windows operating system to telephone services. TAPI was introduced in 1993 as the result of joint development by Microsoft Corporation and Intel Corporation. The standard supports connections by individual computers as well as Local Area Networks (LAN) connections serving many computers. Within each connection type, TAPI defines standards for simple call control and for manipulating call content.","Another component of one embodiment the present invention is an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An ISP is a service that provides access to the Internet. For a monthly fee, a service provider gives a customer a software package, username, password and Internet access phone number. Equipped with a modem (e.g., a dial-up, DSL, ISDN or wireless), a customer can then log onto the Internet and browse the World Wide Web (WWW) and USENET, send and receive e-mail, and access a particular network. In addition to serving individuals, ISPs also serve large companies, providing a direct connection from the company's networks to the Internet. ISPs themselves are connected to one another through Network Access Points (NAPs). NAP is a public network exchange facility where ISPs can connect with one another in peering arrangements. The NAPs are a key component of the Internet backbone because the connections within them determine how traffic is routed. They are also the points of most Internet congestion.","ISPs generally provide a plurality of Point of Presence gateways (POP) in order for a customer to gain an Internet access by making a local call. A POP (point-of-presence) is an access point to the Internet that is associated with a phone number. A connection established via such a POP causes a unique IP address to be assigned to a machine that accesses the Internet utilizing the established connection. The number of POPs that an ISP has and the number of subscribers are usually used as a measure of its size or growth rate.","Yet another component in one embodiment of the present invention is a servlet. Servlets are Java applications, which run on a Web server or application server and provide server-side processing, typically to access a database. It is a Java-based alternative to Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, interface programs, usually written in C or Perl, that enables an Internet server to run external programs to perform a specific function. The most important difference between servlets and CGI scripts is that a Java servlet is persistent. This means that once it is started, it stays in memory and can fulfill multiple requests. In contrast, a CGI script disappears once it has fulfilled a request.","Architecture","With these concepts in mind, an embodiment of a system architecture of the present invention can be explored. In one embodiment, the present invention includes customization system  and an end-user tool that allows a user to establish a network connection.  illustrates an exemplary customization system  that includes a web server , database server , a build server , and an update server . The web server  contains a phonebook generation tool , responsible for phonebook generation update and customization, and a customization tool , responsible for customization of a dialer application (hereinafter \u201cthe dialer\u201d). While the exemplary embodiment of the present invention describes the generation, distribution and updating of a customized dialer, it will be appreciated that the dialer is merely an example of a connection application with purposes of establishing a connection between a client and a server computer, or between peer computers within a network. Accordingly, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the generation, distribution and updating of an application for establishing a dialed connection over the Public Switched Telephone. Network (PSTN), and extends to the generation, distribution and updating of any customized connection application that operates to establish a connection between machines coupled via a network.","The database server  contains a customer database , a phonebook database , a profile database , a phonebook customization database , and customer phonebook database . It will be appreciated that databases may not be stored at the server machine and the database data may be uploaded to the server machine when necessary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["115","120","125","130","135","136","137"]},"Methodology","A flow chart detailing a method , according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, of generating and distributing a customized dialer is illustrated in . At  the customization occurs, during which the customer utilizing, in one embodiment, a series of web pages, generated by the web server , specifies information (or parameters) for the customization of a dialer that will incorporate the customer's needs. At  of , generation of an executable file takes place upon the customer completing the customization process. The executable file is generated by the build server , the description of which follows. At  the distribution of the executable file to the end-users or to the distributor, which in turn distributes it to the end-users, takes place. The above-mentioned back-end processes of the method  are described in detail below.","Methodology: Customization by the Customization Tool ","In one exemplary embodiment, the customization tool  is a web application developed utilizing HTML, JavaScript, and JavaServlets.","The customization tool  presents a customer of the system  with a sequence of web pages that guide the customer through a process of building a customized dialer incorporating the customer's needs. The output of the customization process implemented by the customization tool  is a \u201cprofile\u201d that defines a customization of a network connection application. Utilizing the customization process, a customer may define multiple customized network connection applications (e.g., dialers), each customized network connection application being described in terms of a profile.","An exemplary embodiment of a customization process that takes place at block  in , implemented by the customization tool , is described with the reference to  and . Upon the customer logging onto the customization system  system, the customer is presented with a sequence of web pages, generated by the web server  that facilitate the input of customization information specifying preferences of the customer. A first customization page , an example of which is illustrated in , is generated and presented at . The page  prompts the customer to select a customer account name under which all the customization information is stored. A partner code, representing an account number, may be automatically displayed after the customer login process. More specifically, the page  is utilized only for \u201cchannel\u201d customers of a primary customer. The selected customer account name is a coded name for the channel customer for which a customer's dialer is to be generated, and the customization system  stores all customization information entered during the process under the relevant customer account name.","At  the second web page , an example of which is illustrated in , is presented to the customer where the customer is prompted to select between the options of creating a new profile, or editing an existing profile.","A profile consists of all the files needed by the customization system  to create a complete, self-installing package distributable to a customer of the system , a distributor or directly to a customer's end-users. Customers may maximize or minimize the identification of the service or organization depending on what is included in a dialer profile. For example, the following features that are described in detail below may be included into a dialer profile: custom corporate logos, connection actions, addition and removal of access points (POPs), and pricing setting.","The customer is presented with the third web page , an example of which is illustrated in , at  giving the customer an option to enter a default authentication domain, which will allow the end-users to enter only a end-user name and password in order to be connected to the network, without specifying a domain name. At the third web page , the customer may be prompted for the back-up Domain Name System (DNS) server IP address. The back-up DNS server may be used where a Point-of-Presence (POP), which an end-user has dialed into, does not automatically assign an IP address. In one embodiment of the present invention all POPs in the phonebook database  have dynamic DNS addressing. The customer may specify if he\/she desires the end-users to have an option of saving their password in order to avoid entering it every time an end-user logs into the system.","The third web page  may also prompt the customer to specify if prices will be displayed next to each dial-in number when the dialer is invoked by the end-user. The customer may also desire to display prices in particular currencies. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the customer may enter a conversion rate in order for the dialer to display pricing in currency applicable to the end-user's geographical location.","Phonebook updates are uploaded to the end-user's machine upon establishment of a network connection through the dialer. The customer may, via the third web page , specify if it desires the end-users to choose a manual phonebook update instead of an automatic one.","Some customers may desire to limit network connection sessions of the end-users. The third web page  allows customers to specify the maximum connect time that the customer desires the end-users to have. In one embodiment, an unlimited option may be available for the customers to select.","In one embodiment of the present invention the dialer will be installed on end-users' machines with a default shortcut name. Via the third web page , the customer may specify its own shortcut name, for example, the name of the company.","Upon selection of the options displayed at the third web page , the customer at  may be presented with the fourth web page , an example of which is illustrated in , allowing the customer to add a personalized logo to the dialer application distributed to the end-users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":"702"},"In one embodiment, at  the customer is presented with a fourth web page , an example of which is illustrated in , allowing the customer to specify the dialer connect actions. Dialer connect actions are additional programs that may be executed at various points when the end-users connect to the Internet utilizing the customized dialer. For example, a connect action may be an automatic establishment of a VPN connection after the end-user connects to the Internet. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the customer may specify connect actions to execute at six different points during the end-user's connection process. Those actions may be a PostConnect action specifying programs to be executed after the connection is established; a PreConnect action specifying programs to execute prior to the establishment of the network connection; a PreDial action specifying programs to run immediately prior to dialing a point of access number; an OnError action specifying programs to run in case an error occurs; an OnCancel action specifying programs to run when the end-user decides to cancel a connection session; and Disconnect action specifying programs to run when the end-user disconnects from the Internet.","In box  of  the customer is presented with a drop-down menu to select an action type from the list described above to be added to a dialer profile. The description box  allows the customer to enter a short description of the programs that the customer wants to be executed. At box  the customer may specify the sequence in which the connect action to be executed. In a case where the connect actions are asynchronous, or there is only one action, the sequence of execution is not important. In box  the customer may specify the name of the program to be launched at a particular connect action. The customer is presented with a browse feature in order to specify the exact name of the program. The customer may specify the parameters, including the command line parameters, necessary to run the program in box . At box  the customer may specify that a program does not need to be loaded with the dialer to the end-users' machines. In one embodiment, the programs that need to be run at particular connect actions may be already installed on the end-users' machines. In one embodiment, the customers may select a sequence of connect action to run at the same time (asynchronous mode), or one after the other (synchronous mode) at . If the programs are running in synchronous mode, one program must completely finish executing before the next one can be launched in synchronous mode. In one embodiment if an error occurred while executing one of the programs, the connect action to be executed after the program may not be launched. At box , the customer may identify the POPs for which the connect actions should run. In one embodiment, the customer is presented with an option to create additional connect actions or to delete the existing ones.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the customized dialer may be configured to launch Microsoft's VPN (PPTP) after a successful connection is established. PPTP support may be built into the customized dialer and not require any additional client software.","At  of , the customer may add POPs to a phonebook, stored in the phonebook database , utilizing the sixth web page , an example of which is illustrated in . In one embodiment, the list of POPs to be added to the phonebook of the customization center  may be created through a text editor. Each POP to be added may be identified by the following parameters: a country code that may be represented in a 2-letter code; the POP's region identification number or state identification number; the city in which the POP is located; the area code of the phone number for the POP; the phone number for the POP, without the area code; the maximum analog speed supported by the POP; identification of whether one channel or two channel ISDN is available or if no ISDN is available for the POP to be added; identification of whether Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is available; identification of whether Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is available; the price to be charged for the utilization of the POP; the prefix used for routing the authentication request; the suffix to be used for routing the authentication request; a script name of a file containing a series of commands, parameters and expressions required to establish the connection via the POP.","At  of , the tool  presents a list of phonebooks that are valid for the customer as per the pricing plan associated to the customer. The list of phonebooks may be presented via a drop-down menu of a web page , an example of which is illustrated in . These phonebooks contain all the POPs in a service provider network, excluding the POPs filtered as per the filtering value associated to the pricing plan (see block  in ). The customer can further apply custom filtering and pricing rules to the phonebooks to arrive at their customized phonebooks. For some plans, the tool  may generate phonebooks that have price markups. The example web page , shown in , provides examples of such markups. At  the customer is presented with an eighth web page , an example of which is illustrated in , through which the customer may specify filter rules for various POPs. In box  the customer is presented with a list of the attributes that may be used in filtering the list of POPs presented to the end-users. In one embodiment, the filter rules may be the Structures Query Language (SQL) where clauses. The filtering rules may be generated utilizing a list of the attributes including, but not limited to: country code; the region or state identification of a POP; the city in which the POP is located; the phone number of the POP without an area code; the maximum analog speed supported by the POP; the price of the POP; identification if one channel or two channel ISDN is available or if no ISDN is available for the POP to be added. For example, in order to filter all POPs located in the Russian Federation, a filter rule may specify: Country Code=\u2018RU\u2019, where \u2018RU\u2019 is the 2-letter code for the Russian Federation.","At  the customer is presented with a ninth web page , an example of which is illustrated in , that allows the customer to specify pricing rules to be applied to the prices of the POPs in the customization system phonebook. Two types of the pricing rules may be available to the customer according to one embodiment of the present invention: the percentage markup or slab pricing. If percentage markup pricing is selected, the system  applies a specified markup percentage to the POP price listed in the customization system phonebook. The slab pricing applies a pricing formula specified by the customer to the listed prices in the customization system phonebook. For example, the customer may specify a particular amount to be added to a listed POP price if the listed price is within the customer-specified price range and a different amount to be added if the listed price is outside the customer-specified range. In one embodiment, the customer may also specify different rules for the POPs currently listed in the phonebook and the POPs that are going to be added to the phonebook in the future. In another embodiment of the present invention, the customer may specify different pricing rules for different countries.","At  of  the customer is presented with a review web page , an example of which is illustrated in , that shows the details of the customization process that was performed by the customer. If the customer is not satisfied with the details he or she may edit a dialer profile to make desired changes to the customization. If the customer is satisfied with the dialer profile he\/she may click on the Build Dialer button  in order to build a dialer according to the customer-specified customization information. Upon the customer requesting to build the customized dialer, the customization information is sent to the build server . The build server  generates a self-extracting (or self-installing) executable file that is capable of being distributed to the customer, a specified distributor or directly to the customer's end-users in order to provide the end-users with the Internet access through the customized dialer. In one embodiment of the present invention, upon the end-users connection to the system  utilizing the dialer, the build server  dynamically adds new files and removes outdated files utilizing the version numbers associated with each file and dynamically generates a self-extracting executable that replaces an outdated end-user's dialer file. This update process is described in more detail below.","At  the customer is presented with the download web page , an example of which is illustrated in . The web page  contains the list of files that are necessary to publish the customized dialer to the end users. In one embodiment those files are executable installation file generated by the build server , a phonebook file containing all the POPs in the customized phonebook, a zip phonebook file containing Perl scripts and data files necessary to generate smaller HTML files per each country, a phonebook file containing phonebooks in CSV and ASCII format and a Macintosh phonebook file which is in a format compatible with the Macintosh dialers.","In one embodiment, the customization system  utilizes the pricing and access point data maintained by a settlement system that described in detail in a co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09\/791,239, titled \u201cA Method and System to Facilitate Financial Settlement of Service Access Between Multiple Parties\u201d. The pricing data maintained by the settlement system specifies the method of pricing of a POP according to a particular pricing plan. The customization system , in one embodiment, retrieves a contract of a customer and the list of available phonebooks for the retrieved customer pricing plan.","In one embodiment, the customer may specify the rules for the termination of a connection if it is determined to be idle. The decision to terminate the connection may depend on the specified allowed duration of the idle connection before its termination, on the allowed minimum data transfer rate before the connection is terminated (this may be used to discount certain background traffic, which does not represent real end-user activity), on the allowed time to respond to a dialog box to renew the connection by the end-user before the connection is terminated. In one embodiment the absolute limit may be set on the length of sessions, regardless of the connection activity as described above.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the customer may require the customized dialer to support foreign languages through the use of external language resources and help files. In one embodiment at runtime, the customized dialer may determine the language of the operating system installed on the end-user's machine and load the associated language resource and help files stored at the end-user's machine. If external files are not found, the customized dialer may use the default language, i.e. English.","In one embodiment security information, such as end-user password, VPN password, calling card PIN, stored locally on the end-user's system may be encrypted using standard encryption algorithms well know in the art.","It will be appreciated that the above-described customization process need not be implemented utilizing a series of web pages. In one embodiment the customization may be performed through a software application and the customization information may then be uploaded to the centralized customization tool through a network. Further, the customization process need not be performed by the customer but by any other person authorized to do so.","Methodology: Update","In one embodiment of the present invention, the customization tool  updates multiple copies of a network connection application (e.g., a dialer) distributed by the customer to the end-users automatically upon each end-user connecting to a network access point. In an alternative embodiment, an end-user may manually invoke the update feature of the customized dialer distributed to him\/her by the customer. During the update process, the client dialer contacts the update server  and retrieves the list of files and their latest version numbers. The dialer compares the list of files stored locally with the list retrieved from the server . If the list and\/or the version numbers don't match, the dialer retrieves the affected files from the update server . In one embodiment of the present invention, the new build executable and DLL files are downloaded to the client machine and stored in temporary locations due to inefficiency of updating dialer files when the dialer is running. Upon the end-user exiting the dialer, the files on the client machine are updated to the files containing newer information.","In one embodiment the customer may not want the end-users to have access to the latest changes until, for example, the testing of all the new POPs is performed. In such a case the customer may instruct the customization system  not to update the dialer automatically unless instructed otherwise.","Methodology: Phonebook Generation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 16"],"b":["1500","115","175","180","115","115","115","175","180","100"]},"The generated phonebook files  may be customized according to the needs of a customer, (e.g., a particular POPs may be filtered or removed, and rules may be established for the pricing of POPs).","A phonebook management system (not shown) maintains a current \u201copen\u201d phonebook version number and tags changes with this version number. Each run of the phonebook generation tool  increases this phonebook version by one. When the phonebook generation tool  runs, it closes the current \u201copen\u201d phonebook version number, and opens a new \u201copen\u201d phonebook version. All subsequent changes to the phonebook database are tagged with the new \u201copen\u201d phonebook version number.","The phonebook generation tool  determines changes to the phonebook database since the last run of the tool , and generates phonebook and phonebook delta files  and .","A more detailed description will now be provided with reference to .","In one embodiment, the phonebook generation tool  generates delta files that contain cumulative changes to the phonebook database  since the last version of the phonebooks was published. In one embodiment if the size of the delta files is greater than 75% of the size of the whole phonebook, the delta files are not generated.","Referring to , at  the phonebook generation tool  creates the next open version phonebook number and updates the current phonebook version to publishing and creates a new open version phonebook. At , the phonebook generation tool  retrieves the complete list of POPs from the server. Upon retrieval of the complete POP list the phonebook generation tool  at  retrieves the latest customized phonebook. Application of the default filters to the list of POPs (for example, customer location filters) occurs at . At  the phonebook generation tool  applies customer-specified filters to the list of POPs (e.g., eliminates some of the countries that the customer specifically requested to be excluded from the available POPs). At  the phonebook generation tool  determines if the pricing plans for particular POPs have changed. If positive, then the necessary corrections are made to the list of POPs. In some instances the customer may specify his\/her own pricing rules, for example, to charge end-users 10% more than the price iPass charges the customer. These customer pricing rules are applied at . Upon application of the above-described rules, the phonebook generation tool  determines the new, modified and deleted POPs at . At , the new POPs list is printed to a full phonebook tree with the new open version phonebook number, and at box  the delta files  are printed into a delta files tree. In one embodiment the phonebook and delta trees are stored at the web server .","All the files are associated with a version number in order to facilitate a more efficient update process described above.","The phonebook generation tool  utilizes \u201cpricing\u201d and \u201caccess point\u201d data maintained in the access point and pricing databases  and  illustrated in . The pricing data includes buy and sell prices for all access points. Sell prices for access points combined with a number of other pricing parameters constitute a \u201cpricing plan\u201d. Each phonebook, for which a record is maintained within the phonebook database , has a pricing plan associated therewith. Access point information includes all POP related information. When access point information is modified, this data is tagged with the latest \u201copen\u201d version number.","Methodology: Customization by the End-Users of the Customers","In one embodiment of the present invention, the end-user invokes a customized network connection application in the form of a dialer  on the client machine  of .  illustrates a main dialog box  of the customized dialer , according to one embodiment, that is presented to the end-user upon invocation of the dialer . To establish a dial-up connection the end-user may select an access point from the list of all the available access points presented to him\/her in box . In order not to display the list of all available access points, most of which will be long distance calls, the end-user may enter his\/her location in box . The customized dialer , in one embodiment of the present invention, filters the list of access points based on the end-user's location and displays only the closest points of access in box . Upon selection of an access point, the end-user may click on a connection button  in order to instruct the customized dialer  to establish a network connection via the selected access point. In one embodiment of the present invention, the access points displayed in box  may be sorted by city name. Alternatively, the end-user may sort the access points list by phone numbers, connection speed, or price by clicking on the corresponding column headings. For example, to sort by price the end-user may click on box .","The end-user may specify the dialing settings to use by the customized dialer  when establishing a remote network connection.  illustrates an exemplary dial properties dialog box  that is presented to the end-user. Facilities using private branch exchange (PBX) (e.g., a private telephone network users of which share a number of outside lines), usually require an access code to obtain an outside line. Thus, in box , the end-user is prompted to enter an outside line code. Some phone lines are setup with a call waiting feature, which in one embodiment may need to be disabled prior to establishing a data connection. The end-user may enter in box  a phone number to dial in order to disable the call waiting feature. In box  the end-user may enter the country and area code from which the end-user is dialing; this information is, used by the customized dialer  to determine if an area code, a country code or an access code need to be dialed in order to establish a network connection via the end-user-selected access point. In one embodiment, if check box  is checked by the end-user, the selected number will automatically be dialed as a local number. Calling card information may be entered in box  to be used when dialing the end-user-selected access point number. Each calling card, may be defined by a name, access number, PIN and a dialing rule.","In order for the customized dialer  to establish the connection with the Internet, the end-user's information such as username, domain and password should be available. End-user information dialog box  illustrated in FIG.  prompts the end-user for such information. In one embodiment the end-user information dialog box  is automatically displayed if the end-user dials an access point without providing all the required end-user information.","The settings dialog box  illustrated in  allows the end-user, in one embodiment of the present invention, to specify settings used in establishing the remote connection. The end-user may specify in box  the number of redial attempts to be made by the customized dialer  when the network connection may not be established from the first dialing attempt. Alternatively, in box  the end-user may specify the duration of an attempt to establish the connection before redialing. For example, the end-user may desire for the customized dialer  to redial the same or different access point number if connection is not established within 90 seconds. Depending on the device used for the dial-up connection, particular features of the customized dialer  need to be invoked. Thus, the end-user may specify the dialing-up device that he\/she may select from the drop down menu .","In one embodiment, the end-user may select an option of automatic update of the phonebook upon establishment of the network connection by check box . This will ensure that the latest network access numbers are used next time the end-user invokes the customized dialer . A \u201csmart redial\u201d option, when enabled by the end-user check box , directs the customized dialer  to dial another number in the same city when the dial-up attempt failed using the first network access number. In one embodiment the end-user may wish to run particular applications upon the establishment of the network connection, for example a Web browser, such as Internet Explorer\u2122 (Microsoft Corporation). Instead of opening desired applications manually, the end-user may direct the customized dialer  automatically to launch specified applications when the network connection is established by adding software applications to box  utilizing Add , Modify  and Delete  buttons illustrated in . In another embodiment of the present invention, the end-user may select an option of launching a default web browser once the connection is established by checking on the Default Web Browser box .","In one embodiment of the present invention, the end-user may bookmark the access points that are most often used.  illustrates an exemplary dialog box  that the end-user may use in order to compile a list of favorite network access points. Window  allows the end-user to add a bookmark by entering the location of the access point.  illustrates an exemplary dialog box  that an end-user may utilize to modify a list of favorite network access points. Window  allows the end-user to modify the list of bookmarks by providing a Modify option  to change the properties of a bookmark and a Delete option  to remove a bookmark from the list.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the end-user may access an online help feature from any dialog boxes described above by clicking on a Help button.","Some settings may be saved in the configuration files on the client machine  when the end-user exits the customized dialer . The saved settings may be location filters (country, state, city, area code), connection type (modem, ISDN), selected access points, dial properties including dialing prefixes, the location of the end-user and calling card information, end-user information including end-user name, domain name and password and modem settings including redial attempts, redial timeout, modem device, update phonebook selected options, SmartRedial, bookmarks and programs to launch after the connection is established.","Certain area codes in the Unites States require 10\/11-digit dialing when placing calls within the area code. These dialing requirements are very regional and are constantly changing. In one embodiment of the present invention, a dialing rule file is downloaded to the client machine  along with the distribution of the customized dialer , containing all the area codes that require 10\/11 digit dialing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2300","2302","2304"]},"Build Server","As mentioned above, the customized connection application in the exemplary form of the dialer  may be in the form of a self-extracting executable. In one embodiment of the invention, the self-extracting executable that is generated by the customization tool  is signed using Microsoft's Authenticode technology.","Authenticode verifies who published the file and provides an indication of whether or not the file has been tampered with since the publisher signed it by incorporating a digital signature directly into an executable file. Installers are often downloaded using Internet Explorer, which can validate signatures generated with Authenticode.","To sign a file with Authenticode, an encryption module including a SignCode utility is installed on the build server  (see ), and is executed after each build of a connection application executable. The SignCode utility is available from Microsoft as part of their Authenticode SDK. A certificate signed by a well-known authority, such as Verisign, may be obtained to be used for Authenticode signing. Accordingly, the web server , database server , update server  and build server may be provided behind a firewall. The secure dialer  may be replicated to servers accessible to the public across the globe.","Referring in particular to , reference numeral  generally indicates a method, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, of securing a self-extracting executable for installing a connection application in the exemplary form of the dialer . As shown at block , the customization tool  builds a customized dialer  that is arranged in the form of a self-extracting installer file. The installer file includes all the components of the customized dialer  so that, upon execution of the installer file, a complete dialer  is installed on the client machine . Once the customized dialer  and its self-extracting installer has been built, at block , it is cryptographically signed with SSH credentials obtained from a trusted server (see block ). Thereafter, the secure self-extracting installer is distributed to customers, for example, service providers for downloading via the network as discussed above.","Referring to , reference numeral  generally indicates a method for verifying a self-extracting connection application on the client machine . A user desirous of installing the dialer  on his or her client machine  may download the self-extracting executable from any one of the service providers, as shown at block , via the Internet. When using a browser such as Internet Explorer to download a file signed with Authenticode technology, the browser may automatically generate a pop-up window asking the user if the file is to be saved or opened. If the user selects to save the file, Authenticode verification may not take place. However, if the user chooses to open the file (see block ) Authenticode then identifies the publisher of the software and verifies that the file has not been tampered with. As shown at block , the user may thus check to ensure that the connection application is from a trusted source and identify the publisher of the software. If the dialer  is not from a trusted source, then the user may abort the installation process as shown at block .","If the dialer  is from a trusted source, then the user may verify that the dialer  was not tampered with since it was published by the trusted source as shown at block . If the dialer  has been tampered with, the user may abort the installation process as shown at block . If, however, the dialer  has not been tampered with, then the installation of the dialer  may then be completed as shown at block .","Thus, if the security of any server from which the dialer  is downloaded becomes compromised, a user downloading the dialer  may be made aware of such a security breach. If the web server  with the updated files is compromised, the dialer  may then abort installation as the updated files may, for example, contain viruses.","The dialer , when installed on the client computer , can be used by the end-users to connect to the Internet from anywhere in the world. After connecting to the Internet, the dialer  may check for configuration, data and software updates and apply these updates to the installed client if appropriate updates are found.","A user attempting to install a connection application where the Authenticode signature is not recognized by Internet Explorer may receive one of the following messages:\n\n","In the foregoing specification the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to the specific exemplary embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
