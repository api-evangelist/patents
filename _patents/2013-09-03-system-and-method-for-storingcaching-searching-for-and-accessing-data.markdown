Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to storing\/caching data directly on transmission mediums and network transmission hardware. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for searching, accessing, querying, and performing computations of locally or globally distributed data, stored\/cached in the form of data packets, protocol data units (PDU), or protocol payloads, etc., continuously transmitted on a telecommunication network, and\/or on a microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit for the life of the data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s).","2. Problems in the Art","Each year it is estimated that between 1 and 2 billion gigabytes of unique information is created, and a high percentage of this information is created in a digital format. Of all that data, 90 percent is expected to be stored\/cached digitally. Contributing to this is the rapid growth of digitized books, magazines, videos, music, and other \u2018rich content\u2019 and \u2018mass access\u2019 data. This growing volume of data is often located remotely, must be transported between computing devices, and stored\/cached in a highly secure, accessible method. The exponential growth rate of generated data is expected to outpace improvements in communication bandwidth and storage\/caching capacity in the near future. Consequently, this creates an urgent need to store\/cache digital information in new ways that make it accessible at high speeds on a storage\/caching medium and where the medium may be exponentially improved.","The access speed to digital information is ultimately controlled by the input\/output (I\/O) capacity of any electronic device. I\/O is the lifeblood of computing, getting relevant information into and out of the processor, compute device, or appliance to the end-user on a timely basis. This has always been true, but never so much as in a networked computing environment.","Many associated I\/O problems impede high speed access to remotely stored\/cached data. Ethernet and TCP\/IP are widely accepted, but inefficient protocols, which are used to drive LANs, WANs, and ultimately the Internet. The TCP\/IP protocol suite has proven itself a basic foundation for communications of all kinds over essentially unreliable networks. But that fact alone makes it inefficient and creates network latency issues. TCP\/IP-based protocols have a complex, layered design, with many inter-layer dependencies that can easily demand extensive processing and significant buffer memory to implement. Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is a worldwide communications standard that defines a networking framework for implementing protocols in seven layers. Handling gigabit-class network traffic, servicing interrupts, moving data through long code-paths, and numerous kernel-to-application context switches are all expensive operations. Together, they yield long message latencies and use up a significant percentage of available processor power.","Another problem that impedes the high speed access to data is the venerable Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) shared data bus, which is one of the most prevalent I\/O architecture for compute devices. For example, the bandwidth for board-level transfer, and processor to cache transfer on a typical PC is much higher than from the PC to a peripheral network device via PCI bus.","Data storage\/caching centers have developed a variety of specialized networks, such as SANs (Storage Area Networks), specialized cluster links, NAS (Network Attached Storage), and RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) systems in order to improve access to local and remotely distributed data. However, as RAID, NAS, Fast and Gigabit Ethernet, SANs, and SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) links are usually implemented with PCI adapter cards or PCI components, all of the data traffic on these network devices is ultimately throttled by the low-speed I\/O devices.","I\/O problems are further complicated by the architecture of a typical data storage\/caching center. For example, a data storage\/caching center for Web applications or Business-to-Business (B2B) exchanges may have hundreds of servers all requiring shared access to terabytes of file storage\/caching. The workload is defined by server requests coming in through networked routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, caching appliances, and the like. Since file sharing by multiple servers is a fundamental requirement of this environment, storage\/caching is usually aggregated into shared storage\/caching pools, accessed by the servers using a file access protocol such as Network File System (NFS). The result is a complex and sophisticated infrastructure that has exploded in importance in just the past few years.","Consequently, there are challenges surrounding how individual servers fulfill growing client requests and connections from \u2018the outside world\u2019, and how these challenges impact organization of complex and discrete files, data, databases, and storage. PCI-X and Infiniband are two solutions that will greatly improve I\/O performance, and therefore increase broadband access to remotely stored\/cached digital information.","Infiniband is an architecture and specification for data flow between processors and I\/O devices that promises greater bandwidth and almost unlimited expandability in tomorrow's computer systems. In the next few years, Infiniband is expected to gradually replace the existing Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) shared-bus approach used in most of today's personal computers and servers. Offering throughput of up to 2.5 gigabytes per second and support for up to 64,000 addressable devices, this architecture also promises increased reliability, better sharing of data between clustered processors, and built-in security. Infiniband is the result of merging two competing designs, Future I\/O, developed by Compaq, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard, with Next Generation I\/O, developed by Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. For a short time before the group came up with a new name, Infiniband was called System I\/O.","PCI-X (Peripheral Component Interconnect Extended) is a new computer bus technology (the \u201cdata pipes\u201d between parts of a computer) that increases the speed data can move within a computer from 66 MHz to 133 MHz. This technology was developed jointly by IBM, HP, and Compaq, and PCI-X doubles the speed and amount of data exchanged between the computer processor and peripherals. With the current PCI design, one 64-bit bus runs at 66 MHz and additional buses move 32 bits at 66 MHz or 64 bits at 33 MHz. The maximum amount of data exchanged between the processor and peripherals using the current PCI design are 532 MB per second. With PCI-X, one 64-bit bus runs at 133 MHz with the rest running at 66 MHz, allowing for a data exchange of 1.06 GB per second. PCI-X is backwards-compatible, meaning that you can, for example, install a PCI-X card in a standard PCI slot but expect a decrease in speed to 33 MHz. You can also use both PCI and PCI-X cards on the same bus, but the bus speed will run at the speed of the slowest card. PCI-X is more fault tolerant than PCI. For example, PCI-X is able to reinitialize a faulty card or take it offline before computer failure occurs.","PCI-X was designed for servers to increase performance for high bandwidth devices such as Gigabit Ethernet cards, Fibre Channel, Ultra3 Small Computer System Interface, and processors that are interconnected as a cluster. Compaq, IBM, and HP submitted PCI-X to the PCI Special Interest Group (Special Interest Group of the Association for Computing Machinery) in 1998. PCI SIG approved PCI-X, and it is now an open standard that can be adapted and used by all computer developers. PCI SIG controls technical support, training and compliance testing for PCI-X. IBM, Intel, Microelectronics and Mylex plan to develop chipsets to support PCI-X. 3Com and Adaptec intend to develop PCI-X peripherals.","To accelerate PCI-X adoption by the industry, Compaq offers PCI-X development tools at their Web site.","When remotely storing digital information the following criteria should be considered: the frequency of read access, frequency of write access, size of each access request, permissible latency, permissible availability, desired reliability, security, etc. Some data is accessed frequently, yet rarely changed. Other data is frequently changed and requires low latency access. These factors should be taken into account, but are often compromised in the \u201cone size fits all\u201d design and operation of conventional data storage\/caching systems.","Preferably, a data storage\/caching system should be designed to be scaleable so a user can purchase only the capacity needed at any particular time. High reliability and high availability are also considerations as data users want remote access to data, and have become increasingly intolerant of lost, damaged, and unavailable data. Unfortunately, current conventional data storage\/caching architectures compromise these factors, and no single data storage\/caching architecture provides a cost-effective, highly reliable, highly available, and dynamically scaleable solution.","Today the end-user can have high-speed access to streaming and non-streaming data in the form of websites, electronic text documents, graphic images, or spreadsheets stored\/cached remotely by purchasing telecommunication bandwidth in the form of a T-1 or a fractional T-3 line, a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), or through their cable TV provider using a cable modem. However, no conventional digital information storage\/caching system addresses the needs of the end-users desire for widespread, low latency access to streaming and non-streaming multi-media data in the form of music, TV shows, movies, radio broadcasts, web casts, etc.","Advances in fiber optic transmission technology and its declining cost have enabled upgrades in front-end network systems such as cable TV network trunk and feeder systems. Traditionally, these systems have increased the bandwidth of a telecommunication network sufficiently to provide each subscriber his own dedicated channel to the head-end for receiving compressed digital video. In addition, direct broadcast satellite technology and other emerging wireless communication technologies also provide dedicated multimedia and video channels between a large number of end-users and the server systems. Personal computers and set top boxes for the end-user are also emerging, which enable networked multimedia applications.","The above mentioned improvements may typically improve the overall performance of current video server systems by a factor of only two or four times, whereas the current need in the industry requires improvements in the range of 100 to 1000 times to make interactive streaming video services economically feasible.","While the end-user (client) system and the front-end network system infrastructure is evolving rapidly to meet the requirement of non-streaming and interactive multimedia services, the constraints of current server architectures continue to be expensive and impractical for delivering these services. Current server systems are unable to process the large number of data streams that are required by streaming multimedia and video services. The current choices of servers are typically off-the-shelf mainframe or workstation technology based parallel computing systems. The hardware and software in both cases is optimized for computation intensive applications and for supporting multiple concurrent users (time-sharing) with very limited emphasis on moving data to and from a telecommunication network interface and the Input\/Output (I\/O) device.","Another key to acceptable multimedia audio and video streaming is the concept of Quality of Service (QoS). Quality of Service generally refers to a technique for managing computer system resources, such as bandwidth, by specifying user visible parameters such as message delivery time. Policy rules are used to describe the operation of data packet(s) to make these guarantees. Relevant standards for QoS in the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) are the RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol) and COPS (Common Open Policy Service) protocols. RSVP allows for the reservation of bandwidth in advance, while COPS allows routers and switches to obtain policy rules from a server.","A major requirement in providing Quality of Service is the ability to deliver multi-media frame data at a guaranteed uniform rate. Failure to maintain Quality of Service may typically result in an image that is jerky or distorted.","Traditional server system architectures have not been equipped with the functionality necessary for providing Quality of Service on a large scale. With an increasing load on server systems to provide streaming multimedia applications, an increased volume of user (end-clients), and the above mentioned deficiencies in current server system technology, a need exists to provide a server system architecture or a new data storage\/caching system with enhanced search and access capabilities which will be able to address the need of low latency, high-speed access to data.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,758,085 assigned to the International Business Machine (IBM) Corporation partially addresses the above-named problems by providing a plurality of intelligent switches in a Storage Area Network (SAN). When the end-user (client) makes a request to receive video and multimedia data, a request is sent to the host processor which in turn sends a request to a plurality of intelligent switches on the SAN. The intelligent switches include a cache for storing the requested data. The data is relayed directly from these switches to the end-user (client) requesting the multimedia data.","While the IBM system described above provides for the storage\/caching of data onto switches, it does not allow the individual switches to cooperate together as a distributed architecture in order to pool bandwidth together to supply the backbone network, nor does it allow for the data to reside directly on a telecommunication network medium. Current technology allows for only a 1-2 gigabyte data stream coming out of a single peripheral device such as an array of disks, wherein a telecommunication network backbone may accommodate a 10 gigabyte or higher data stream. Also, in the above referenced patent, the individual switches are not capable of working together to distribute a delivery request over multiple switches for load balancing and streaming of the requested data.","United States Patent Application 20010049740, filed by Karpoff, addresses many of the shortcomings of the previously referenced IBM U.S. Pat. No. 5,758,085, by describing various systems and methods for delivering streaming data packets to a client device, over a telecommunication network in response to a request for the data packets from the client device. The client request is received by a server or a controller device that is typically located on a network switch device. If received by a server, the server sends a request to the intelligent network controller device for the transfer of the requested data to the client.","In addition to the data storage network architecture and bus problems discussed above, rapid access to and intelligent searching of data is impeded by the requirements of traditional relational database structures.","It has been 16 months since terrorists attacked the United States, and federal agencies are struggling to find a way to best share information to prevent future acts of terrorism. The key to fighting terrorism is the real-time free flow of information between federal agencies as well as with state and local governments. More than ever before, successful interdiction is dependent upon collecting, analyzing, and appropriately sharing information that exists in different databases, transactions, and other data points. The effective use of accurate information from diverse sources is critical to the success in the fight against terrorism. There is no lack of desire to share information in a cooperative way, however, there is no easy, and inexpensive solution to accomplish the sharing of data stored in traditional database structures.","Recently, the FBI has chosen to pursue \u201cinvestigative data warehousing\u201d as a key technology for use in the war against terrorism. This technology uses data mining and analytical software to sift through vast amounts of digital information to discover patterns and relationships that point to potential criminal activity. The same technology is also widely used in the commercial sector to track consumer activity and predict consumer behavior.","The FBI plans to build a data warehouse that receives information from multiple FBI databases and sources. Eventually, this warehouse might receive and send warehoused data to and from other law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In the war against terrorism new information technology is critical to analyzing and sharing information on a real-time basis. Also, the FBI is working to focus on analytical capabilities far more than it has in the past. For example, the FBI might want to put in a request for information on flight schools and access all the reports the FBI has written on flight schools from various FBI databases and then analyze them using artificial intelligence software, however, they are far from having this capability, which is known as enterprise data warehousing in the business world.","Data warehousing and data analysis\/modeling tools are used extensively in the commercial sector to monitor sales in stores and automatically order new stock when inventories run low, monitor individual customer buying habits and try to influence consumer buying. The FBI is considering applying the same analysis techniques\/tools currently used by the private sector to search vast collections of data to identify suspicious trends. For example, analyzing data collected in various FBI databases and by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the CIA and other agencies could indicate suspicious activity that now is overlooked. Add to that data from credit card companies, airlines, banks, phone companies and other commercial entities, and actions and events that previously seemed innocent when considered separately, begin to trigger alarms when considered in context with other activities.","Most business executives make critical decisions based on data that's been cut and sliced for them by information managers. If executives could get closer to their core business data, they would increase their odds of making better-informed decisions. The promise of business-intelligence software is to make existing enterprise databases accessible through easy-to-use analytical and reporting functions. Business-intelligence software quickly and cheaply allows organizations to extract additional value from existing data warehouses and enterprise systems.","Business-intelligence software is nearly useless for companies that have \u201cdirty data.\u201d Before any quality feedback can be produced, databases must have consistent categories, language, and maintenance. Unfortunately, for most organizations due to mergers and acquisitions, the tendency is toward chaos. They end up trying to use incompatible databases to force new data into legacy information systems. Consequently, uniform data-entry protocols are lacking, or ignored, making it difficult to implement changes. For example, a data field such as, a supplier's name can be entered any number of ways by employees. Cleanup of such dirty data can be costly and can take from a few months to a few years.","Although the government has a huge effort underway for implementing data mining, business intelligence, and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) of transactions stored in traditional, structured data sources, intelligence agencies are in need of unstructured textual analysis to find patterns in unstructured data.","One company, Maya Viz, combines various elements of collaboration, knowledge management, and business intelligence to bring data into a visual form that can be manipulated and shared. This technology was first deployed in military command situations. The company's component architecture aims to transform relational database information pieces into nuggets, visualize them, and then through peer-to-peer connections, allow people to share the information with anyone.","Tacit Knowledge System's software automatically discovers expertise and activity across large organizations, and connects people and information. This software taps into existing content sources such as document repositories and e-mail archives to discover individual expertise and activity, and then makes end-users aware of relevant colleagues and data.","The U.S. has approximately 170,000 people working together to prevent attacks on the United States. This is an incredibly complex process, using multiple information technology systems to record information about case research, various memos, etc. In addition, a system that could tap into all those multiple information repositories and figure out who is working on what, would be phenomenally valuable to make critical connections between different agencies, departments, and analysts.","However, current data mining, warehousing, and business intelligence technologies are expensive and become difficult to implement, particularly when multiple federal, state, and local agencies become involved, all of which use their own proprietary technologies and data formats. The constraint of these current data technologies is the requirement for predetermining storage format, for example, table structure and upfront analysis.","There is therefore a need for a method of storing\/caching, searching, accessing, querying, and performing computations on data in the form of data packet(s) and\/or data streams continuously transmitted for the life of the data on a telecommunication network, and\/or a microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit. The resulting solution needs to be cost effective, avoid traditional I\/O problems, overcome the limitations of traditional relational database structures, and avoid other problems.","A general object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method for storing\/caching data, which overcomes the problems found in the prior art.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method to store\/cache data packet(s) by allowing them to be continuously transmitted on a telecommunications network, and\/or a microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit for the life of the data packet(s).","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method to store\/cache data stream(s) by allowing them to be continuously transmitted on a telecommunications network, and\/or a microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit for the life of the data stream(s).","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method for data storage\/caching that is highly scalable through additional access points.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method for data storage\/caching that is highly scalable through additional parallel connections.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method for data that can be easily erased without leaving a trace.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method for data storage\/caching that is redundant and fault tolerant.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method for data storage\/caching system that interfaces with public protocols and standards.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method for data storage\/caching system that interfaces with proprietary protocols and standards.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method to access data stored\/cached in the form of continuously transmitted data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s).","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method to search for data stored\/cached in the form of continuously transmitted data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s).","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method to query data stored\/cached in the form of continuously transmitted data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s).","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method to use data stored\/cached in the form of continuously transmitted data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s) as a chaotic database.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method to use data stored\/cached in the form of continuously transmitted data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s) as a structured linear database.","A further object, feature, or advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method for performing computations on data stored\/cached in the form of continuously transmitted data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s).","One or more of these and\/or other objects, features, or advantages of the present invention will be apparent based on the Specification and claims that follow.","According to one aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides for storing data by persistently maintaining the data on a network, through retransmission. The data can be associated with expiration properties. The expiration properties can include geographical information and\/or time attributes. The data can be in packets or streams.","Referring to previously filed U.S. Provisional Patent No. 60\/349,072 to Melick, et al, \u201cFiberSan\u201d was used as a name for one aspect of the present invention, and it is sometimes referred to as \u201cDataSpace\u201d throughout this disclosure, and is also referred to as a storage\/caching system or a network when appropriate. The term \u201cnetwork data packet\u201d will now be referred to as \u201cdata packet\u201d. The present invention relates generally to storing\/caching, searching, accessing, querying, and performing computations of data persistently maintained through retransmission, directly on the telecommunication network, and\/or a microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit. More particularly, the present invention relates to systems and methods for accessing, searching, querying, and performing computations on locally or globally distributed data which are stored\/cached in the form of data packets, protocol data units (PDUs), or protocol payloads, etc., continuously transmitted on a telecommunication network, and\/or on a microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit for the life of the data packet(s).","As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term \u201cdata\u201d is to be construed broadly to refer to a data packet, protocol data unit, protocol payload, data stream or other form of data.","As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term \u201cnetwork\u201d is to be construed broadly to refer to a network, a telecommunication network, or other type of network. It is to be understood that data present on a microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit associated with the network is still present on the network, and the microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit of the device can be considered part of the network in this context.","As used herein, the term \u201cstoring\u201d is to include \u201ccaching\u201d and querying is to include \u201csearching\u201d. These and other terms that may have different uses or particular connotation in particular contexts are to be construed broadly in defining the present invention.","Data content and applications have historically resided at the core of the Internet. However, in an effort to improve the performance of content delivery, distributed computing has evolved. Distributed computing is the process of moving content and applications closer the end user, in what is referred to as the \u201cedge\u201d. To support this transition, enterprises are creating their information technology systems on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), which elevates the need for distribution and computing closer to the \u201cedge\u201d.","The present invention allows data packets to \u201creverberate\u201d on a telecommunication network, and\/or microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit, remaining unresolved for delivery, on-demand for the life of the data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s). The present invention overcomes limitations associated with existing data storage\/caching, accessing and searching technologies. The present invention creates unique new revenue opportunities for carriers to better utilize their telecommunication network assets.","In the preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a number of advantages over traditional remote data storage\/caching, accessing, search, querying, and computational methods. These advantages can include: (1) reducing overall latency to and from remote data source(s); (2) providing direct access to data; (3) providing parallel multicasting capabilities; (4) improving multicasting efficiency in telecommunication networks; (5) reducing latency by moving the data storage\/caching and data storage\/caching logic to a telecommunication network, and\/or microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit which allows the synchronized communication between individual intelligent network controller devices; (6) eliminating the requirement for server or disk access by moving data storage\/caching directly onto the telecommunication network, and\/or microprocessor, data bus, or electronic circuit; (7) improving Quality of Service for streaming and non-streaming data as a result of reduced latency and increased bandwidth; (8) increasing the overall throughput and\/or reliability by implementing RAID methods on the intelligent network controller device(s), for example utilizing RAID to mirror the data across two or more separate DataSpaces; (9) reducing the time required for data backups, data replication and distribution by moving the administrative functions of data storage\/caching onto the intelligent network controller device; and (10) increasing availability by caching multiple copies of the same data, which is particularly useful for multi-media.","In the preferred embodiment, the present invention can (1) lower the cost to store\/cache data; (2) lower overall latency and improving access speeds; (3) provide new functionality that enables a host of new applications\/services to service providers and their customers; (4) provide a \u201cgeographic tag\u201d to improve data cache selection and data routing; and (5) provide new data search and query capabilities.","The present invention provides systems and methods for storing\/caching, accessing, querying, searching, and performing computations of data on telecommunication network infrastructure, which includes mediums, such as but not limited to, fiber optic cable, Category 5 wire, coaxial cable, airwaves, ground waves, vacuum, space, etc., which have been partitioned by the present invention's switches, which also may serve as nodes on a telecommunication network.

This research project addresses applications such as network monitoring, telecommunications data management, web personalization, manufacturing, sensor networks, and others, in which data takes the form of continuous data streams rather than finite stored data sets. Traditional database systems and data processing algorithms are ill-equipped to handle data streams effectively, and many aspects of data management and processing need to be re-examined in the presence of data streams.","The STREAM project is investigating data management and processing in the presence of multiple, continuous, rapid, time-varying data streams. Their work addresses problems including basic theory results, algorithms, and implementing a comprehensive prototype data stream management system. The STREAM project, and other data stream technologies are relevant to the present invention, as DataSpace is in fact a persistent data stream which is continuous, although more repetitious in nature, rapidly varying, and can be created from a compilation of multiple source streams. Therefore, the results and findings of the STREAM project and related work will be fundamentally useful in creating a streaming data manager for the present invention.","The data packets, PDUs, and\/or protocol payloads used by the present invention can be defined by any non-proprietary or proprietary protocols. Examples of non-proprietary protocols for defining data packets include but are not limited to, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames, Internet Protocol (IP) packets, or Cellular Digital Packet Data (CPCD) packets (commonly known as IP over wireless). Two proprietary protocols for defining data packets are Novell's IPX\/SPX protocol and Apple Computer's AppleTalk protocol. Closed network systems used by financial institutions, government, or the military might use a proprietary data packet protocol internally, particularly where security is an issue. A unique proprietary data packet protocol, in which a data packet's payload is defined and structured as a linear database, is disclosed in the previously mentioned U.S. patent application Ser.

This proprietary protocol is based on Simple Data Link (SDL), which is a variable length ATM protocol.","Referring to , the general topology of a DataSpace , \u2032 used in the preferred embodiment and several of the alternative network embodiments of the present invention is shown. A DataSpace , \u2032 is comprised of three basic components: (1) switches , \u2032 are equipped with a intelligent network controller device  as defined in , (2) \u2018working telecommunication medium\u2019  and \u2018spare telecommunication medium\u2019  to couple DataSpace switches , \u2032, and (3) a data link  to connect the DataSpace , \u2032 to a telecommunication network.","The switches , \u2032 can be configured in many different form factors, such as but not limited to carrier class soft switches, data network elements such as switches, routers, hubs, and bridges, programmable hardware with architecture similar to a Lucent Excel LNX programmable switch, host controllers, etc. The functions of the switch , \u2032 may be reduced to a microprocessor, such as but not limited to, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for deployment in a client device, such as, but not limited to, a personal computer , cable TV set-top box , PDA , ATM , radio , as shown in , , and , which enables the client device, a personal computer , cable TV set-top box , PDA , ATM , radio , to be used as one of the nodes in a DataSpace , \u2032.","The DataSpace switches , \u2032 can also be configured to operate as a new class of telecommunication switches based on an emerging technology known as XML switching. XML switching deployed on switches , \u2032 may use XML as a universal translator, which can automatically adapt to and transform to a myriad of XML schemas, protocols, and standards which have been, and are being developed for a variety of industries and applications. XML switching intelligence on a telecommunication network will enable a freer and faster flow of information from the DataSpace  to other DataSpaces \u2032, as shown in , , and  systems, applications, and end-users.","Sarvega, Inc. manufactures Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) switches powered by their XML Event Stream Operating System\u2122 (XESOS\u2122) technology to allow the intelligent routing of XML-based data at wire speeds.","The explosive growth of XML usage in corporate IT infrastructures has made it necessary to address the performance issues inherent in XML processing. XML processing tasks, such as XSL transformation, schema validation, XPATH-based classification, XML security, and intelligent routing are all inherently processing intensive. This has placed a significant burden on existing server infrastructure that is not optimized to perform these tasks. Sarvega's switches have been designed to provide the specialized processing and intelligence required to transparently offload XML processing from the general purpose server infrastructure.","Sarvega's XML switches could be modified to allow DataSpace switch logic to reside directly on their switch in order to give them the advantages associated with continuously transmitted data packet(s) or data streams containing information within XML constructs. This combination of Sarvega's mature XML processing integrated with the present invention's switching and processing logic would be one method of enabling applications such as a chaotic database.","Alternatively, Sarvega's XML switches could be incorporated as a stand-alone component(s) in a DataSpace controlled by present invention's switching hardware and logic.","The present invention can incorporate XML switching technology to store and tag geographic information for data packets, and be used for subsequent routing on a DataSpace , \u2032. Assigning and storing a DataSpace packet's information can be a self-provisioning feature, particularly for mobile devices that employ radio frequency positioning technology such as the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS), Loran, Shoran, or the emerging technology for precise local positioning known as ultra wideband (UWB). Another self-provisioned method, which is unique to the present invention uses geographic information related to an end-user, or hardware device, particularly for stationary devices such as desktop personal computers, Automatic Teller Machines (ATM), fax machines, etc. This end-user information can be acquired for use on the DataSpace through the use of an onboard software utility which maps manually input information such as zip code, address, or telephone number to a latitude and longitude.","In addition to the above mentioned self-provisioning methods for obtaining and incorporating geographic information for use in intelligent data packet routing, there are many other public and private sources for obtaining and provisioning geographic information as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/732,505 to Melick, et al., entitled UNIFED MESSAGE SYSTEM, incorporated herein by reference. The United States Postal Service databases and systems map longitude and latitude to street address and zip code. Corporate entitles, such as telephone companies, maintain cross-reference databases for telephone number to latitude and longitude information, Also, fee-based service providers, such as Quova, map IP addresses to latitude and longitude.","Geographical information obtained from of the above mentioned means can be used to augment the intelligent routing capabilities of DataSpace switches , \u2032 in order to cache data, particularly data that is geographically\/demographically sensitive, closer to an end-user.","The geographical information and\/or time information can be used in associating expiration properties with the data. Based on expiration or related binding properties, access to data can be limited. For example, data can be accessible only during pre-defined time frames. Geographical and time information can be combined to create more complex binding properties.","A DataSpace , \u2032 uses a telecommunication network infrastructure to store\/cache data in the form of data packets, PDUs, or protocol payloads, etc., continuously transmitted on the network for the life of the data packet(s) or data stream(s). The time of transit between DataSpace switches , \u2032 will be relatively short in comparison to the time stored in the Random Access Memory (RAM) on these switches. The RAM will contain a processing buffer for sending a data packet and subsequent receiving and re-sending of the same data packet. This buffer may also be provided by intelligently routing data packets over a minimum length of network transmission medium to buffer the time required to process a data packet. On a network the length of transmission medium can be reduced by intelligently routing data packets over multiple channels to buffer the time between the sending and receiving of the same data packet. Alternatively, an air gap between terrestrial satellite ground stations and orbiting satellites may be used to create a buffer between the sending and receiving of the same data packet. A buffering device on a DataSpace , \u2032 that uses fiber optic medium could be created in the future by intentionally slowing light down, or even stopping it completely by directing it into super-cooled, sodium atoms as described in a Jan. 25, 2001 article by Bill Delaney, posted on the CNN.com web-site (C:\\WINDOWS\\Temporary Internet Files\\OLK40D4\\CNN.com\u2014US\u2014Bill Delaney Harvard scientist stops light\u2014Jan. 25, 2001.html).","For matters of practicality and creating easy migration paths to the widespread use of DataSpaces , \u2032 in the marketplace, the DataSpace switches , \u2032 are designed to receive data packets for storage\/caching over data link , using any standard messaging protocol. Typical examples of messaging protocols used in accordance with the present invention for sending messages between the various nodes on the DataSpace , \u2032, include but are not limited to: Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI), Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), Fiber Channel (FC), Infiniband (IB), Gigabit Ethernet (GE), Ten Gigabit Ethernet (10GE), and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET). Any messaging protocol, or combination of messaging protocols which allows for the communication of messages between the various nodes of a telecommunication network are intended to be within the scope of the invention.","In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the DataSpace switches , \u2032 are coupled to working transmission medium  and spare transmission medium  configured in a bi-directional ring topology. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the working transmission medium  and spare transmission medium  are fiber optic cabling, but in other non-carrier class implementations, the transmission medium could be copper or even airwaves. The spare transmission medium , or what is commonly referred to as \u2018protect ring fibers\u2019 in the telecommunication industry, provide redundancy and greater reliability as a mechanism to re-route traffic in the opposite direction in case working transmission medium  fails. In addition, if a switch , \u2032 on the working transmission medium  fails, the back-up switch , \u2032 on the spare transmission medium  will automatically take over.","The present invention can be deployed on a fiber optic network with a modified version of a standard protocol such as, but not limited to SONET. SONET is a standard way to multiplex high-speed traffic from multiple vendors multiplexing onto fiber optic backbone cabling. SONET is a four layered protocol. Layer 1 is the Photonic Layer, which converts electronic signals into optical signals and vice versa. Layer 2, the Section Layer, monitors the condition of the transmission between the SONET equipment and optical amplifiers. Layer 3 is the Line Layer, which synchronizes and multiplexes multiple streams, from multiple sources, into a single data stream in a uniform format. Layer 4 is the Path Layer which assembles and disassembles voice and data into frames. In the present invention, the Path Layer could use a modified addressing convention to identify which data packets are to be stored\/cached on the DataSpace , \u2032 by continuously transmitting them on the storage\/caching network for the life of the data packet. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is a new high-speed, replacement technology for SONET which can also be used as the basis to create a DataSpace , \u2032.","By increasing the size of a telecommunication network, and\/or speed of the network elements, such as switches, bridges and\/or routers, or by adding DataSpace switches , \u2032, a DataSpace , \u2032 is a highly scalable and load balanced data storage\/caching solution without adding much complexity.","In the present invention, data integrity, recovery, and re-construction can be accomplished by a variety of methods in the case of transmission or equipment failure, or maintenance.","Re-Directed Data\u2014In the event a DataSpace switch, or other hardware, is removed or ceases to function properly, the DataSpace switch responsible for sending data packet(s) to another DataSpace switch can re-route them to a back-up DataSpace switch, or another DataSpace. The process of re-directing data packet(s) can be manual and\/or automated.","RAID-type Implementation\u2014Critical data residing on a DataSpace may be protected using a similar method found in RAID algorithms. Separate and redundant DataSpaces can be used to implement the striping and\/or mirroring of data across multiple DataSpaces. Under the proper mirroring configuration, if one DataSpace becomes inoperable or inaccessible, another DataSpace(s) can re-construct data and service requests as needed.","Integrity Node\u2014A DataSpace integrity node can be placed on the DataSpace to check for any number of possible situations indicating corrupted or missing data. This node could be used in conjunction with the RAID-type Implementation for data recovery. The Integrity Node could be directed to look for: out-of-order packets (if ordering is required), and\/or missing packets by performing packet count (if the number of packets is static), and\/or CRC checking on segments of a DataSpace.","Alternative Data Storage\u2014A DataSpace can export data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s) to other storage devices as a safe-store method in the event a DataSpace needs to backup to a form of permanent storage. In addition, if data on a DataSpace becomes lost or corrupted, a DataSpace can re-construct the data from the safe-storage device. Examples of these safe-storage devices include disk drives, floppy drives, and\/or optical drives.","Referring to , the intelligent network controller device , \u2032 includes a Central Processing Unit (CPU) , data cache memory  which is used to support processing, a systems interface  (typically a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC))\u2014which may include an optional computation engine , which can be used to accelerate operations such as RAID check sum calculations, encryption, compression, and data routing=), and at least one communication port , \u2032 which is used to communicate with the external network, other intelligent network controller devices , \u2032, or other forms of data storage\/caching, such as SANs, NAS, etc., or other peripherals.

By implementing a cache, time-costly disk I\/O operations are minimized resulting in reduced access times and contention for disk resources. When data, such as file directory information is continually accessed on a typical storage device like magnetic media, it makes sense to store that information in a low-latency memory location such as cache. Using cache, once the first read to a disk is performed the cache is also updated with the content retrieved by the disk read request. As a result, subsequent read requests for the same data element previously retrieved will be served from the cache in lieu of performing another disk operation.","Cache can be co-located locally with the file system and\/or operating system, or remotely on a storage system such as a Storage Area Network (SAN), traditional networked server, and storage cluster. In the case of remote storage devices, the cache can be located on the storage system and is delivered over a standard network transport, such as, but not limited to TCP\/IP. Using the present invention to cache data on a DataSpace allows subsequent requests for data to a remote networked storage\/caching device without having to traverse the entire network.","In addition, multiple DataSpaces can be implemented and configured to provide distributed caching.","CONTENT MANAGEMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL ROUTING APPLICATION\u2014Data that is highly accessed for Internet web sites and multi-media can be cached to many DataSpaces. For example, a DVD movie or series of movies can be stored\/cached on a network closer to the edge or cached on other DataSpaces between the originating source and the user, and continuously transmitted indefinitely for quick access by users.","Combined with geographical routing information, data can be tailored for a user's demographics. A DataSpace can maintain information about users served via geographical routing information and intelligently cache data in relevant DataSpace(s) closest to the user.","FILE SYSTEMS APPLICATION\u2014Traditionally, file systems typically store relevant information on the data storage\/caching device they are managing. Sometimes this data is stored\/cached in \u201csuperblocks\u201d, or blocks of data on a disk device. When file system information is stored\/cached on a DataSpace instead of the actual disk, managing file systems would be more easily distributed, and many file system operations would become more efficient and faster.","MOBILE DATA SYSTEMS APPLICATION\u2014When multiple entities or assets are in a mobile environment, such as, but not limited to people, vehicles, freight, luggage, military assets, etc., each of these can be nodes within a hybrid DataSpace. A hybrid DataSpace includes both wireless and wireline network transport mediums. Among the benefits of this are, (1) high-speed access to real-time data by DataSpace nodes; (2) faster data distribution to multiple DataSpaces; and (3) ease in adding additional DataSpace monitoring or intelligence nodes.","DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS APPLICATION\u2014When data is characterized as high read\/low write, traditional data systems require a central data store(s) to be updated before current data is available to users. Examples include, asset tracking, monitoring systems, telematics, and broadcast data. Also, central data store(s) may provide other access points via a distribution, or replication model, to other data storage\/caching systems and\/or devices.","A DataSpace provides immediate access to data for a large number of users without the costs normally incurred by adding access for many users to traditional data systems. A DataSpace is suited to this environment because the processing latency at a DataSpace node is negligible in comparison to the contention of many users vying for traditional storage\/caching resources. When additional DataSpace resources are required to support additional users, the addition of DataSpace nodes allows for faster distribution of data rather than the traditional processing of data via a sophisticated distribution and\/or replication environment that requires data to be completely distributed and\/or replicated before it can become available to all users.","SEARCH ENGINE APPLICATION\u2014The DataSpace may be configured for use as an Internet search engine. When a company, user, content provider, etc., wishes to provide searching capabilities for their data, such as but not limited to, keywords, languages, phrases, geographical location, time stamps, speech patterns, recording, video, graphics, meta information and other associated data elements, etc., it can be uploaded and stored on a DataSpace(s). DataSpace switches can be programmed to use various methods to search data using criteria, such as but not limited to, geographic region, languages, expiration of search information, keywords, meta information, patterns, categories, etc., and to control access and permission restrictions.","Current Internet search engines, such as but not limited to, Yahoo!, Metacrawler, Google, etc., could redirect search requests to a DataSpace, use the DataSpace to search and\/or utilize a DataSpace as a resource for their own \u201cbot\u201d or information acquisition technologies. Users could subscribe to a DataSpace and quickly upload, change, add, delete, or modify search criteria and information stored on a DataSpace. When service providers use a DataSpace to update or \u201cpush\u201d data they have more control on subsequent DataSpace search requests. For example, a web-site owner distributing information regarding their web-site to a DataSpace may want search results to be determined by time-of-day, day-of-week, special of the day, inventory counts, closeouts, pricing or other parameters. In addition, the web site owner may want to provide different results for different users including, but not limited to, the content, the language, and\/or dialect based upon the origin of the DataSpace search request. A common example of time-of-day routing can be found in the telephony market where specific 800 numbers are routed based upon parameters such as time-of-day and\/or originating call location. In these cases, many 800 number customers are allowed access to telephone systems that implement their routing decisions based on a myriad of reasons. Similarly, a DataSpace allows users to update specific information real-time on a DataSpace that would yield different search engine results.","If a service provider stores the actual web content on the DataSpace, a DataSpace could generate and return results based upon the content stored. For example, a web page stored on a DataSpace that contains an Iowa basketball sports story titled \u201cIowa Women Beat Purdue Men 90-3.\u201d In addition, the web content may contain other information keywords or meta-tags for search engine purposes, such as, \u201cpurdue, iowa, scores, sports, college, basketball\u201d, etc. When the DataSpace is searching for a request, it will evaluate all the information stored within a page, such as the actual score, title, or news story content itself in combination with, and\/or information pertaining to searching stored in meta tags as previously described.","A DataSpace-based search engine could provide the ability to expire or restrict access to searching. This could allow for different levels of search capability for both the user and content provider. Examples include: (1) A news story with a related MP3 file has an expiration date for searching because the news story is no longer relevant; (2) versioning of content for different users; (3) access restrictions by ISP, IP address (range or specific), users; (4) geographic location, grouping, company, service etc.; (5) service level restrictions by content provider, user, DataSpace provider, DataSpace subscriber, etc.","Likewise, hosting providers or content providers, such as AOL, Microsoft, WorldCom, UUNet, Akamai, etc., could upload information about content, and store, service, manage, and create data directly on the DataSpace. This could be done automatically and dynamically at any time interval, or as changes are made to the content.","DOMAIN NAME SERVICES APPLICATION\u2014Another application for the present invention is using a DataSpace as a mechanism to update and maintain Domain Name Services (DNS), or to be a DNS server itself. DNS information on a DataSpace could provide for instantaneous updates for DNS servers located as an example, in Botswana, the United States, and China simultaneously. Today, when an application or device needs to resolve a domain name, it typically goes to a DNS server, which is not updated in real-time.","A DataSpace may have global reach, and could be a centralized distribution system for DNS services. Registrars could update a DataSpace in near real-time, and ISP providers can use the DataSpace for up-to-date DNS resolution directly, or indirectly, for their customers. One benefit to using the present invention for real-time DNS services is having more dynamic capability for re-routing requests by time-of-day, load, geography, outages, type of request, etc.","LINEAR DATABASE APPLICATION\u2014A complimentary technology to a DataSpace is Linear Databases. Linear Databases are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/698,793 entitled METHOD OF TRANSMITTING DATA INCLUDING A STRUCTURED LINEAR DATABASE to Melick, et al. A Linear Database defines a structure for data stored in the form of a data packet(s), and can be used as a universal data interchange method.","GRID COMPUTING APPLICATION\u2014Grid computing is the application of many distributed computer resources in a network dedicated to a single problem at the same time. Among the cornerstones of grid computing are the cataloging and management of compute and network resources, and to provide access to these resources using application programming interfaces (APIs) and tools.","An example is collecting data, such as space radio signals at many collection points, and distributing the data to various compute facilities for processing. Depending on the task, compute resource(s) located on the grid may be needed for pure raw processing power or because it contains specific hardware and\/or software developed to complete a specific task.","In addition, sets of data may be of interest to many different parties located on the gird for their own analysis and tasks. An example of this type of data would be weather data that would be useful to agriculture, aviation, defense and other private and public entities. This use of data can require many types of regulated\/unregulated distribution data access methods. If an entity located on a grid wishes to use this kind of data, they either must pull it from a data store or have it pushed or delivered to them.","Grid computing is a methodology and architecture intended to create a system that easily integrates and automates some of the nuances specific to tasks that require high-contention devices, e.g. super-computer resources for sophisticated modeling. Super-computing resources are distributed to a few global locations relative to other types of available processing resources and typically require some form of scheduling and permission prior to acquiring the resource. The grid allows for sizeable tasks to be broken down into manageable sub-tasks that could be spread across multiple resources. By parsing these sub-tasks among different resources, one could reduce the total amount of work typically required of a super-computer oriented task and\/or break a task up among different super-computer resources.","Depending on the application, sizes of the datasets used in grid computing can be quite large and range in size greater than 10 million objects representing gigabytes and terabytes of data. When dealing with different data use methods, distribution of resources and types of datasets, a DataSpace can aid in the processing of this data by caching and storing it on the network so that more than one compute resource can access it simultaneously. This would allow for the use of multiple resources for analyzing data interconnected by a DataSpace.","A DataSpace is not a replacement for current data storage methods, however it can provide persistence of data objects, which can be useful in a grid system configured for performing tasks across multiple systems relating to the same object. An example of object processing would be a series of interconnected systems providing services for travelers. The passenger \u201cobject\u201d would be passed among different systems performing different functions, for example, booking, ticketing, baggage, security, billing, etc.","A DataSpace is also useful in the event that an object is cached for use by different systems. When tasks are serialized, once an object has been processed and placed on the DataSpace, the next available resource can perform the next task for the object without having to employ a sophisticated queuing scheme.","As referenced in other areas of the DataSpace and chaotic databases application, an object database could easily be developed for storing objects of different sizes and formats. In addition, a DataSpace provides a mechanism to store \u201cobject meta\u201d information, such as processing history, processing performance, operation and measurement information, origin, access, etc.","A DataSpace can be useful for caching data used by many systems within the same timeframe. An example of this type of data would be the real-time monitoring and analysis by many different military systems for battlefield information. Using a DataSpace to store\/cache the real-time battlefield data eliminates the need to send the data to a common store for analysis systems to pull from.","The predominant benefit a DataSpace provides to grid computing is the ability to add persistence to objects and data elements to make them readily available at the time a resource on the grid becomes available. A DataSpace can span different geographic locations and can be easily integrated into a grid. Within the context of grid computing, a DataSpace can be viewed as a large shareable RAM drive that can be easily accessed by all the interconnected grid devices.","CHAOS DATABASE APPLICATION\u2014One of the problems with using traditional element storage systems such as a relational database is the need to define database elements such as, tables and indexes prior to the import, creation or storage of data elements. While advances in technologies such as XML and predictive data modeling are aiding in the effort to reduce the amount of pre-implementation design and planning required for the storage of data, they are all constrained by the underlying data access speed limits posed by magnetic media devices.","Another limit of traditional database systems is the requirement for a thorough understanding of the data to be received or stored. While in some instances this is a very easy task, in other situations it can be very difficult and challenging. There are two trends impacting data storage in the future. The first trend is that more data from more distinct and unknown organizations will need to be processed. Secondly, realizing that some data has a short lifetime of usefulness, a push towards analyzing data closer to real-time will increase the demand for minimizing the amount of resources and time spent performing traditional pre-implementation database activities.","A DataSpace may be configured to provide a new type of element storage system we call Chaos Element Base (CEB). The CEB is focused primarily towards an element storage system that supports intense queries, volatile storage elements with limited updates, the import of storage elements in their original format with little modification from many sources and formats, and the use of meta-data information related to the storage elements.","CEBs equip the end-user with the ability to perform their own queries and reporting thus reducing dependency on the IT department. Querying a CEB will employ a natural-type of access similar to those found on today's Internet search engines. Other advanced searching, querying and reporting applications may be layered on a CEB providing additional functionality. As an example, a SQL-type of query engine may be is layered on the CEB to provide end-users with an applicable SQL instruction set.","Another example of a type of querying application that can be implemented on a chaotic database is associated with the Stanford's Stream Data Manager (STREAM) systems being development at Stanford University. While STREAM systems will focus on continuous data feeds, the CEB focuses on providing a persistent data stream. Querying technologies developed for STREAM such as OpenCQ and NiagraraCQ, support continuous queries on data streams, and can be applied to a CEB.","Another area a CEB can be implemented is for the storage\/caching and sharing of business objects. This is accomplished without converting an object into a traditional database thus reducing the complexity of integration. As a CEB stores data independent of formats, the storage of objects of different size and complexity are minimized in comparison to force-fitting data into traditional database technologies.","When data objects are frequently updated and shared with multiple systems it is essential to provide a method of locking to eliminate the risk of updating the same record simultaneously. There are several types of locking procedures that would be applicable to a CEB, including exclusive locks and read-only locks. These methods of locking can be implemented on a chaotic database using the \u201cmeta\u201d area of data elements in the CEB architecture, which allows only one client access to a particular data at any given point, eliminating the risk of contention among clients.","In some cases, an object has a short lifespan and yet needs to be shared among disparate systems. A CEB can provide this level of functionality as well and also provide object expiration rules for object garbage collection typically found in object-oriented systems today.","When data is stored in its original format, it provides two advantages. The original context in which the data was received is preserved, which provides added meaning to the data, and the steps for importing data elements into a CEB are eliminated, or substantially reduced vs. a traditional relational database. The steps eliminated or reduced include: (1) pre-definition of data elements; (2) design of relational database SQL table and indexes; (3) creation of SQL table; and (4) the import of data and insertion into SQL table(s).","Data may be imported directly into a CEB, thus reducing the time, resources, and analysis typically required to load data into a traditional relational database. This is important when dealing with data that is real-time, time-sensitive and\/or has a short-shelf life.","DATA WITHOUT A TRACE\u2014In some applications it may be beneficial to delete without leaving a trace. When deleting information from a general computing device's traditional storage device, such as magnetic media-based disk drives, its existence is removed from the eyes of an operating system, file system and user, however, the fingerprint or physical properties of the data remain on the device. An example of a data trace includes pits created in magnetic media devices, such as disk drives. Unless additional safe-guards are implemented, the data will remain in its original physical form on the storage unit until it is overwritten by another operation.","Today, special programs provide random generation of data to \u201cwipe\u201d a file from a disk. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the data element once it has been wiped. These programs are slow since it requires numerous I\/O operations to be performed on the disk as described in Norton's Wipe Info utility describing U.S. government wiping methods.","This utility combines several wiping and overwriting processes conforming to DoD (Department of Defense) document 5220-22-M, and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, for the ultimate security level when eliminating data from digital media.","Overwrites the data with 00s","Verifies the 00 overwrite","Overwrites with FFs","Verifies the FF overwrite","Writes a random value, or a value that you choose from 00 to FF","Verifies the random overwrite","Re-verifies the random overwrite to ensure that it was written correctly","Repeats as many times as you specify, up to 100","In situations where data needs to be quickly removed and its traces eliminated, a DataSpace provides this functionality. As a DataSpace stores\/caches data on a telecommunication network's infrastructure, and\/or an electronic circuit, data bus, or microprocessor s RAM, all traces of data are eliminated once a DataSpace is shutdown, or the life of data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s) has expired.","A DataSpace requires less time than traditional disk-wiping methods, because it eliminates excessive physical disk I\/O's associated with traditional medias devices such as magnetic disk drives. In addition, when a DataSpace is shutdown, it can be configured in a manner where there is no remaining physical fingerprint or evidence of data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s) previous existence.","COMPUTE APPLICATIONS\u2014A DataSpace's unique architecture and use of continuously transmitted data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s) can also be configured for various compute applications.","DISTRIBUTED COMPUTE DEVICE\u2014An example of the architecture of a distributed compute device is illustrated in .

(Delete One Of The Periods)","TRANSMETA-LIKE COMPUTE DEVICE\u2014Transmeta Corporation manufactures the Crusoe processor, which is an x86-compatible chip specially designed for the handheld and lightweight mobile computing market. The Crusoe processor is a hardware-software hybrid chip that consumes significantly less power than standard processors by transferring the function of millions of transistors with their proprietary \u201ccode-morphing\u201d software.","The Code Morphing software is designed to dynamically translate x86 instructions into VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) instructions for the underlying Crusoe hardware engine. The Code Morphing software resides in flash ROM. The Code Morphing software consists of two main modules that work in conjunction to implement the functions of an x86 processor.","The Interpreter software contains a module that interprets x86 instructions one at a time, much like a traditional microprocessor. The Interpreter functionality also filters infrequently executed code from being needlessly optimized and gathers run time statistical information about the x86 instructions it sees for determining whether optimizations are necessary.","The Translator software detects critical, frequently used x86 instruction sequences. The Code Morphing software invokes a module that recompiles the x86 instructions into optimized VLIW instructions, called \u201cTranslations.\u201d The native translations reduce the number of instructions executed and results in better performance.","Further efficiencies are possible by saving the translations in memory that is inaccessible to normal x86 code. This special memory area is named the \u201cTranslation Cache\u201d and allows the Code Morphing software to re-use translations and eliminate redundancies. Upon encountering previously translated x86 instruction sequences, the Code Morphing software skips the translation process and executes the cached translation directly out of the Translation Cache.","Caching and re-using translations exploits the high degree of repetition typically found in real world workloads. The Code Morphing software matches repeated executions with entries in the Translation Cache and the optimized translation is executed at full speed with minimal overhead. The initial cost of the translation is amortized over repeated executions.","A DataSpace , \u2032 as shown in  can be adapted for use with Transmeta, or Transmeta-like processors to enhance compute functionality on a DataSpace , \u2032.

Where \u201cN\u201d equals \u201c1\u201d in a bit frame, DataSpace switch would only process bit position  within a bit frame and DataSpace switch would only process bits contained within bit position \u201c128\u201d, etc.","After the DataSpace switch has added and subtracted bit values in two or more data packet(s) and\/or data streams, it outputs a resultant data packet(s) and\/or data stream(s) corresponding to bit position it is processing.

the data to be stored on the DataSpace. These data elements may or may not be registered with the DataSpace DOE. They are not limited to one DES data frame and could span multiple data frames.","When a new element is added to a DataSpace, the DataSpace switch inserts the data element(s) into the DataSpace creating a new frame(s). In an effort to reduce the complexity of free space management, new data frames are allocated for new data elements as they are entered in the DataSpace.","The DataSpace will inspect the DataSpace DES and DOE areas for data that has expired, or marked for deletion. These data packets will simply be removed from the DataSpace.","Using LDL as a DataSpace protocol eliminates the need to manipulate the data payloads typically required by other protocols. Other protocols require this manipulation to remove any data segments within the data payloads that are identical to the ones used by the protocol for segregating the separate data payloads. As an example, if a DataSpace is implemented in a protocol such as Ethernet, a combination of characters, such as Ethernet's  octet sized preamble, would be used as a marker\/indicator in between multiple PDUs as a means to delineate the multiple PDUs. In this example, insertion of an element into the DataSpace DES would require substituting modified sequences that differ from the PDU delineation sequence, with sequences identical to those used by the DataSpace element delineation. In addition, when data is removed from the DataSpace DES payload for inspection or delivery, the payload would have to be inspected again and any substituted sequences removed and the original sequences reconstructed. Using the LDL protocol removes the requirement for manipulating the DES payloads on insertion and\/or reading.","In cases where payloads to be stored are greater than one frame, a linkage is maintained between the frames so that the entire payload can be extracted. The LDL DES extended frame contains a field named \u201cNext LDL Frame ID.\u201d, which is the next sequential 64K octets of the data element stored\/cached on a DataSpace. This is an iterative process until no more frames are required for storing the entire data element. When the last frame containing the element is reached, its \u201cNext LDL Frame ID\u201d field is set to a value of zero.","For some data elements, it is useful to add an additional meta-information frame that describes the nature of the data element contained in the next frame(s). Examples of this type of information are source origination, method of delivery, etc.","When an element is inserted into a DataSpace, a separate meta-data frame can be constructed and linked to the next series of frame(s) containing the actual data element. If the data element is managed by the DataSpace DOE, a meta-data frame will be the first frame in the data element stream of frames.","The fields and block sizes described in Tables 10 through 17 are examples, and may be changed, deleted, modified, or eliminated, as required during implementation.","While the DataSpace has been illustrated and prototyped in a form that would indicate its architecture is static, a DataSpace's configuration can also be dynamic in nature for any period of time including the lifespan of a DataSpace. DataSpace components including but not limited to DataSpace switches, intelligent controllers, clients, network transport mediums, processors, etc., can be inserted, removed and re-configured as required. Examples of a when DataSpace re-configuration may be required are when DataSpace component(s) fail, DataSpace components are added or removed for performance, reliability and scalability reasons, adding new functionality or processing capabilities, new applications, and for general operation, management and maintenance functionality.","While the present invention has been described by way of example, in terms of two prototype systems, and in terms of the specific embodiments, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.
