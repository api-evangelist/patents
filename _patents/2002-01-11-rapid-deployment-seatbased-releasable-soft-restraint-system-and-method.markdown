title: Rapid deployment seat-based releasable soft restraint system and method
abstract: An apparatus and method for rapidly restraining a person for an extended period of time at a seat are disclosed. The inventive apparatus includes a pair of wrist cuff modules, each supplied with a releasable connector, configured to either attach to existing hardware on one or more seats, or to a first interconnect for releasably connecting the wrist cuff modules to one another behind the seat in which the restrained person is positioned. A set of two ankle cuff modules with a second interconnect and an elongated connection member secured to the second interconnect is provided for securing the person's legs by applying the ankle cuff modules to the ankles and then connecting the connection member to a seat. The second interconnect may be provided with an optional quick release mechanism that enables instant disconnection of the second interconnect from the ankle cuff modules to immediately free the person's legs in case of an emergency.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO PREVIOUSLY FILED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present patent application is a continuation-in-part of a previously filed commonly assigned U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No.: 60\/261,327, entitled \u201cRapid Deployment Releasable Airplane Passenger Soft Restraint System and Method\u201d filed on Jan. 13, 2001.","The present invention is directed to a soft mechanical restraint system that may be easily and quickly deployed by a first person on a subject being held in a restrained position by a second person, and then attached to one or more seats, such that the subject is safely restrained for an extended period of time in relative comfort.","There are many thousands of human service and law enforcement agencies and facilities that provide care and supervision to aggressive, suicidal, and emotionally disturbed persons or otherwise dangerous persons (hereinafter commonly referred to as \u201cEDPs\u201d).","Another common problem faced each day by airline and other transportation personnel (e.g. train conductors, bus drivers, etc.) is dealing with intoxicated or aggressive passengers. For example, \u201cair rage\u201d is a serious problem that poses a great danger to airline safety. Emotionally disturbed and\/or intoxicated passengers may get out of control and threaten the safety of other passengers and airline crew members as well as their own safety. Furthermore, potential hijackers and other dangerous persons may also pose a significant threat to airline safety.","During \u201cair rage\u201d, hijack attempts, or other vehicle-related incidents, the dangerous and\/or aggressive passengers may need to be restrained by untrained individuals such as other passengers and crew members, and then held down for extended periods of time. In one recent incident, an aggressive airline passenger restrained by fellow passengers died due to positional asphyxiation from an improperly applied hold. While this is less of an issue in a hijack situation, such incidents point to the fact that restraint of dangerous persons on an airplane or other public vehicle (such as a train or a bus) poses a danger not only to other passengers and vehicle personnel, but also to the restrained individuals themselves.","In addition, staff and officers working in human service and law enforcement agencies and facilities that provide care and supervision to aggressive, suicidal, and emotionally disturbed persons, regularly come into physical contact with the EDPs through the use of physical subduing or restraint holds when the EDP becomes aggressive.","Although there are many types of well-known physical subduing holds, the safest and most advantageous physical subduing hold is a Primary Restraint Technique (PRT) described in greater detail in a commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,273,091 entitled \u201cAPPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SAFELY MAINTAINING A RESTRAINING HOLD ON A PERSON\u201d. The PRT approach is particularly advantageous in confined areas such as vehicle (e.g. airplane, train, or bus) aisles.","While restraint holds, such as the PRT, are useful for relatively short periods of time, often restraint of the EDP is necessary for an extended period. This is especially true when the EDP must be restrained in a vehicle, or is otherwise being transported in a vehicle. In such cases, the EDP must be restrained using some sort of a mechanical restraint system. Typically, this involves placing wrist and ankle mechanical restraints on the EDP so that the EDP may be restrained for an extended period of time at or near the place of the restraint hold, or transported to another location while wearing the restraints. Most previously known restraint systems involve mechanical locks\u2014for example, one popular restraint utilizes a mechanical spring-loaded lock that requires a special key to open. It takes at least 4-5 staff members to successfully apply such restraints at a speed of no lower than 2-3 minutes per restraint. During the application of these restraints, the EDP must be held down and poses a constant threat to the staff members until the restraining process is complete. Such a concerted effort is simply impossible aboard most vehicles because of the limited space available. For example, no more than two persons in addition to the EDP may operate in an airplane aisle.","Furthermore, removal of such restraints in emergency situations (i.e. in a medical or other emergency) takes a significant amount of time since a key must be located and used to open each restraint on each limb\u2014this is especially problematic because without the key, which may not be immediately available in case of an emergency, the restraints cannot be removed at all. This is particularly dangerous when the EDP is being restrained in a vehicle because if the vehicle suffers an accident, the EDP may need to be removed from the vehicle very quickly. Moreover, even after the EDP is placed in a previously known restraint system, there is no way to place the EDP in a comfortable restrained position where the EDP will not pose a danger to themselves or to others, unless the EDP is subjected to constant supervision and observation. Finally, such complex restraint systems are expensive, heavy, and require extensive training to use properly.","Manipulation of the previously known restraints once attached is difficult as well, requiring several people to pull webbing through complex system of buckles and connectors to connect cuff restraints to one another. And often, once an EDP is moved to a stationary restraint area, such as a seat, the restraints used during EDP transport must be removed and replaced with stationary restraints.","Some of the above problems and challenges are advantageously solved by a novel circular cuff module that may be applied to each of an EDP's limbs quickly (and removed therefrom) by staff members without use of complex locking mechanisms that is disclosed in the commonly assigned co-pending U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Several advantageous approaches to interconnecting the novel cuff modules are disclosed as well.","However, one of the main challenges of previously known restraint systems, including the one disclosed in the above-incorporated \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d patent application, is in how the cuff restraints are connected to stationary positions such as vehicle or other seats where the EDP may be secured for an extended period of time. This issue is of particular importance when the EDP is restrained aboard a vehicle. Of course custom designed seats with built-in stationary restraints may be provided, but such an approach is very expensive and significantly limited in usefulness.","Another issue is how the wrist and ankle restraints are connected to one another. While connecting ankle cuff modules to one another by a simple interconnect may serve to prevent the EDP from kicking, application of a simple wrist interconnect may pose a problem with particularly violent and\/or aggressive EDPs. Similarly, while a simple wrist interconnect may prevent the EDP from using their hands independently from one another, the EDP is not prevented from flailing their arms at elbows and shoulder if the restrained wrists are at the EDP's front, where the EDP may still attack other persons even if the wrists are pulled together. Securing the EDP's wrists behind their back is a partial solution, but a nimble EDP can contort themselves to move their wrists to the front of their body. With respect to ankle restraints, while the novel circular cuff modules, disclosed in the above-incorporated patent application, include connectors to releasably connect to stationary connectors (such as may be disposed on a bed), other types of ankle modules and respective interconnects do not possess any mechanism to connect to stationary connectors. Most importantly, most previously known restraint systems cannot be releasably but securely connected to stationary areas, such as ordinary vehicle seats, and, even if securely connected to such areas, cannot be quickly released in case of an emergency.","Thus, it would be desirable to provide an apparatus and method for quickly and easily applying mechanical restraints to a person being controlled through a restraining hold, or who is otherwise immobile, in a confined area such as a vehicle aisle. It would furthermore be desirable to provide a mechanical restraint apparatus that is relatively comfortable to the subject and that may be quickly and easily removed in case of an emergency. It would additionally be desirable to provide a mechanical restraint system that severely restricts the range of motion of the person's arms and legs. It would further be desirable to provide a mechanical restraint system that can be attached to commonly used vehicle or other seats. It would also be desirable to provide a lightweight mechanical restraint system that is easy to transport and use and that is inexpensive to manufacture. Moreover, it would be desirable to provide a mechanical restraint system that may be easily be placed in an extended restraint mode without requiring additional equipment.","The apparatus of the present invention, and method of use thereof, remedies the problems associated with applying mechanical restraints to violent and\/or struggling EDPs (and with removing the restraints therefrom). In brief summary, the inventive rapid deployment restraint apparatus advantageously provides: (1) quick and easy application to the EDP in a confined area such as a vehicle aisle, as well as quick and easy removal in case of an emergency; (2) severe restriction to the range of motion of the EDPs arms and legs; (3) easy attachment to commonly used vehicle or other seats; (4) lightweight and simple construction making the inventive restraints easy to transport and use and inexpensive to manufacture; and (5) easy placement in an extended restraint mode without requiring additional equipment.","The inventive apparatus and method enables rapid restraint of the EDP for an extended period of time at a seat and also enables quick release of the EDP in case of an emergency. The inventive apparatus includes a pair of wrist cuff modules each supplied with a releasable connector configured to either attach to existing hardware on one or more seats, or to a first interconnect for releasably connecting the wrist cuff modules to one another behind the seat in which the EDP is positioned. A set of two ankle cuff modules with a second interconnect and an elongated connection member secured to the second interconnect is provided for securing the EDP's legs by applying the ankle cuff modules to the ankles and then connecting the connection member to a seat. The second interconnect may be provided with an optional quick release mechanism that enables instant disconnection of the second interconnect from the ankle cuff modules to immediately free the EDP's legs in case of an emergency.","Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims.","The present invention relates to an advantageous soft mechanical restraint apparatus and method that may be quickly and easily applied by a first person to a subject being held in a restraining hold by a second person in a confined area, and that may be secured to common vehicle or other seats to restraint the subject for an extended period of time in relative comfort.","It should be understood that while the present invention refers to EDPs, the inventive apparatus, and methods of use thereof, may be applied in virtually any situation where a subject is being restrained and application of mechanical restraints is warranted. Furthermore, while the present invention is described with regard to vehicle seats, it may be advantageously utilized with seats of any other type. Moreover, the various embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to male and female seat-belt type connectors by way of example only. It should be understood to one skilled in the art that other matched releasable connector sets may be readily substituted for seat-belt type connectors without departing from the spirit of the invention. Finally, the male and female seat-belt type connectors shown in the figures and described as mounted on various elements of the inventive apparatus, may be readily interchanged with one another without departing from the spirit of the invention.","Before application of any sort of mechanical restraints, it is important that control over a struggling EDP is established by placing the EDP into a restraining hold. The Primary Restraint Technique (hereinafter \u201cPRT\u201d) is an advantageous modular single person restraint that is applied by an EDP care professional (hereinafter \u201cstaff member\u201d) to an EDP from behind. The maneuvers involved in implementing the PRT are described in greater detail in Primary Restraint Technique (PRT) described in greater detail in a commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,273,091 entitled \u201cAPPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SAFELY MAINTAINING A RESTRAINING HOLD ON A PERSON\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. It should be noted, however, that the restraint apparatus of the present invention does not require use of the PRT\u2014it may be advantageously be utilized in any situation where the EDP is physically restrained by one or more staff members or other individuals. Of course, if the EDP is not ambulatory (i.e. unconscious or asleep), it is not necessary to apply any restraint holds before application of the inventive restraints. The PRT is particularly advantageous for deployment of the inventive apparatus in a vehicle aisle because the PRT works well in confined areas and only requires a single person to restrain the EDP while the inventive apparatus is being applied.","In summary, the seat-based restraint apparatus of the present invention comprises: (1) an arm restraint system with a wrist cuff module for each wrist, each wrist cuff module supplied with a releasable connector for securing the wrist cuff module to available corresponding releasable seat connectors positioned either on the seat in which the EDP is positioned or on one or more proximal seats. If releasable seat connectors are not available, a flexible first interconnect is supplied for releasably connecting the wrist cuff modules to one another behind the EDP's seat; and (2) a leg restraint system with an ankle cuff module for each ankle, a flexible second interconnect for connecting the ankle cuff modules to one another, and a connection element positioned on the second interconnect and supplied with a releasable connector, that can be used to substantially immobilize the EDPs legs by securing them to the seat in which the EDP is restrained, or to another proximal seat. The leg restraint system may be provided with an optional quick release mechanism for instantly releasing the leg restraint system in case of an emergency.","It should be understood to one skilled in the art that the arm and leg restraint systems of the present invention can be readily utilized independently from one another without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, in certain situations only the arm restraint system may be used, while in another situation, only the leg restraint system may be utilized.","Referring now to , an arm restraint system  is shown. The arm restraint system , includes a first wrist cuff module  having a releasable connector  attached thereto, and a second wrist cuff module  having a releasable connector  attached thereto. The releasable connectors ,  are preferably elongated flexible members (for example, composed of nylon or other webbing) terminating in male seat belt connectors (although as noted above, female seat-belt connectors may be readily substituted).","Preferably, the cuff modules  and  are the circular cuff modules described in the co-pending commonly assigned U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. One of the advantages of the circular cuff modules is that they possess integrated the releasable connectors (e.g. releasable connectors , ), and are quick and easy to apply to the EDP.","However, the arm restraint system  may be utilized with a set of any other generally circular cuff modules (for example, any commercially available resilient cuff restraints) as long as each cuff module includes (or is modified to include) the releasable connectors , . It should be noted that the cuff modules ,  are shown in simplified views in the various figures and may include additional elements (such as locking mechanisms) that are not shown in the figures because such additional elements are not relevant to the present invention.","Most vehicle seats (such as car, airplane or bus seats) shown as seats , , include existing seat-belt type hardware, such as a flexible member  with a releasable connector  and a flexible member  with a releasable connector , either on or between the seats, that are used for securing seat-belts around passengers. Optionally, any vehicle or non-vehicle seat  may be modified to include securely fastened flexible members ,  with respective releasable connectors , .","Referring now to  to D, when flexible members ,  with respective releasable connectors ,  are not available (for example, not supplied with the seat , or used for seat-belts of other nearby persons), a flexible wrist interconnect  may be provided. The interconnect  includes an elongated body  composed of a strong flexible material such as nylon webbing (for example, such as webbing used in seat belts and parachute straps) with a first end having a releasable connector  mounted thereon, and a second end having a releasable connector  mounted thereon. The releasable connectors ,  are preferably configured to releasably connect to respective releasable connectors , . Thus, the releasable connectors ,  are preferably female seat-belt type connectors (or male seat-belt type connectors if the releasable connectors ,  are configured with female seat-belt type connectors). The interconnect  is placed behind the seat  (in which the EDP is restrained) and connected to the releasable connectors , , thereby restricting the motion of the EDP's arms.","The interconnect  may be supplied with an optional tensioning device , such as a tensioning buckle passing a portion of the interconnect body  therethrough, for controlling the length of the interconnect . Thus, when the interconnect  is connected to the releasable connectors , , the tensioning device  may be activated to tighten the interconnect  to advantageously further restrict the motion of the EDP's arms.","Optionally, the EDP's arms may be further immobilized by securing the EDP's wrists to the sides of the EDP's body by utilizing an additional wrist cuff module interconnect (not shown) that releasably connects to the cuff modules ,  and around the EDPs body, and serves to further secure the EDP in the seat . Preferably, the additional wrist cuff interconnect is one disclosed in a commonly assigned co-pending U.S. patent application entitled \u201cRapid Deployment Soft Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Referring now to , a first embodiment of the leg restraint system  of the present invention is shown. The leg restraint system  includes a first ankle cuff module , a second ankle cuff module , and an ankle interconnect  therebetween. The ankle interconnect  may be a length of flat flexible webbing (for example composed of nylon or similar material). Preferably, the cuff modules  and  are the circular cuff modules described in the co-pending commonly assigned U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. However, the leg restraint system  may be utilized with a set of any other generally circular cuff modules (for example, any commercially available resilient cuff restraints) capable of connecting to an interconnect device. It should be noted that the cuff modules ,  are shown in a simplified view and may include additional elements (such as locking mechanisms) that are not shown because such additional elements are not relevant to the present invention.","The interconnect  has its first end connected to a rigid loop  disposed on an outer surface of the cuff module  and its second end connected to a rigid loop  disposed on an outer surface of the cuff module . Optionally, the interconnect  may be attached to the cuff modules ,  in another manner. The length of the interconnect  may be selected as a matter of design choice. For example, if it is very short, the EDP will be unable to walk when being transported to or from the seat , while if it is long, the range of motion of EDP's legs will not be sufficiently restricted.","An elongated connection member , such as flat flexible webbing (composed of nylon or similar material), is connected perpendicular to the interconnect , and preferably at a substantially central position of the interconnect . The connection member  is preferably of a length sufficient to secure it to a bottom portion of the seat  or, as shown in , to another seat in front or behind the seat . The connection member  terminates in a releasable connector  that may be a male seat-belt type connector or a female seat-belt type connector (not shown). The connection member  is optionally provided with a tensioning mechanism , disposed thereon, for controlling the length of the connection member , such that when the connection member  is secured to a seat, the tensioning mechanism  may be engaged to further immobilize the EDP's legs.","Referring now to , exemplary implementations of the arm restraint system  and the leg restraint system  are shown. An EDP  is seated in the seat , with the EDP's arms restrained by the cuff modules ,  with the releasable connectors ,  secured to respective releasable connectors ,  of the seat . The EDP's legs are restrained by the cuff modules ,  secured by connecting the connection member , via the releasable connector , to a releasable connector  mounted on a flexible member  fastened to a seat  in front of the seat , or, optionally connecting the connection member , via the releasable connector , to a releasable connector  mounted on a flexible member  fastened to a seat  behind the seat . Alternatively, the connection member  may be secured to another portion of one of the seats ,  and , for example by simply wrapping it around the seat portion (not shown). In any case, the tensioning mechanism  may be engaged to further immobilize the EDP's legs.","While the leg restraint system  can be released relatively quickly by disengaging the connection member  from the seat to which it is connected, in certain cases, such as in a vehicle emergency, or in a medical emergency, the EDP must be released from the leg restraint system  immediately. Referring now to , a second embodiment of the leg restraint system  is shown as a leg restraint system . The leg restraint system  is substantially similar to the leg restraint system  in construction and operation, and is utilized in a similar manner (for example, as shown in FIG. B), except that the leg restraint system  includes a quick release mechanism that enables the EDP's legs to be instantly freed from the leg restraint system .","The leg restraint system  includes a first ankle cuff module  having a first rigid loop  disposed perpendicular to its outer surface, a second ankle cuff module  having a second rigid loop  disposed perpendicular to its outer surface, and an ankle interconnect  releasably connected therebetween. Preferably, the cuff modules  and  are the circular cuff modules described in the co-pending commonly assigned U.S. patent application entitled \u201cSoft Circular Restraint Apparatus and Method\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. However, the leg restraint system  may be utilized with a set of any other generally circular cuff modules (for example, any commercially available resilient cuff restraints) each having at least one substantially perpendicular rigid loop. It should be noted that the cuff modules ,  are shown in a simplified view and may include additional elements (such as locking mechanisms) that are not shown because such additional elements are not relevant to the present invention.","The ankle interconnect  has a first end and a second end and may be a length of flat flexible webbing (for example, composed of nylon or similar material). The length of the interconnect  may be selected as a matter of design choice. For example, if it is very short, the EDP will be unable to walk when being transported to or from the seat , while if it is long, the range of motion of EDP's legs will not be sufficiently restricted.","An elongated connection member , such as flat flexible webbing (composed of nylon or similar material), and having a proximal end and a distal end, is connected by its proximal end perpendicularly to the interconnect , and preferably at a substantially central position of the interconnect . The connection member  is preferably of a length sufficient to secure it to a bottom portion of the seat  or, as shown in , to a seat in front of or behind the seat . The connection member  distal end terminates in a releasable connector  that may be a male seat-belt type connector or a female seat-belt type connector (not shown).","The interconnect  includes a first elongated loop  positioned perpendicular to its top surface at a predetermined distance from its first end, and a second elongated loop , positioned next to the elongated loop , also perpendicular to its top surface at the same predetermined distance away from its first end. The elongated loops ,  may be composed of wire, plastic or an elastic material. The interconnect  also includes a first hole  defined proximal to its first end, and a second hole , next to the hole , also defined proximal to its first end, the holes ,  being positioned and sized such that when the first end of the interconnect  is threaded through the rigid loop  from bottom to top and then folded upon itself, the holes ,  are aligned with the respective elongated loops ,  so that the elongated loops ,  pass through the respective holes ,  to thereby at least temporarily connect the first end of the interconnect  to the rigid loop . The holes ,  may optionally be reinforced with rings (for example made from metal or plastic) as shown in .","The interconnect  also includes a third elongated loop  positioned perpendicular to its top surface at a predetermined distance from its second end, and a fourth elongated loop , positioned next to the elongated loop , also perpendicular to its top surface at the same predetermined distance away from its second end. The elongated loops ,  may be composed of wire, plastic or an elastic material. The interconnect  also includes a third hole  defined proximal to its second end, and a fourth hole , next to the hole , also defined proximal to its second end, the holes ,  being positioned and sized such that when the second end of the interconnect  is threaded through the rigid loop  from bottom to top and then folded upon itself, the holes ,  are aligned with the respective elongated loops ,  so that the elongated loops ,  pass through the respective holes ,  to thereby at least temporarily connect the first end of the interconnect  to the rigid loop . The holes ,  may optionally be reinforced with rings (for example made from metal or plastic) as shown in .","A first enclosed channel  is positioned on the connection member  and oriented toward the elongated loops , , and a second enclosed channel  is also positioned on the connection member  and oriented toward the elongated loops , . The channels ,  may be composed of a material such as metal, cloth, or plastic and may be independent of one another or connected to form a dual channel . A third enclosed channel , composed of a flexible material, is preferably centrally disposed along a substantial portion of the length of the connection member  between the channels ,  and the distal end of the connection member .","Quickly releasable connection of the cuff modules ,  to the interconnect  is accomplished by a flexible thin connection line  having a first end and a second end, the connection line  being sized and configured to fit though the respective elongated loops , , , and , once the elongated loops , , , and  are passed through the respective holes , , , and . The connection line  may be any strong thin material such as wire or resilient plastic. Optionally, the connection line  may be coated with a resilient material to facilitate passage through the elongated loops , , , and . A release tab  is attached to the second end of the connection line . The release tab  preferably includes a releasable connector ,  for releasably securing the release tab  to a portion of the connection member  between the channel  and the releasable connector . The releasable connector ,  may be a pair of hook and loop material strips (such as Velcro\u00ae) or another set of connection elements such as releasable glue strips, a snap-in button, or the like.","During normal use of the leg restraint system , shown in , the first end of connection line  is threaded first through the third channel  from the direction of the distal end of the connection member , then through the channel , through the elongated loops , , , and  and inserted into the channel . Optionally, upon exiting the channel , the first end of connection line  may be threaded first through the channel , then through the elongated loops , , , and  and inserted into the channel . The release tab  is then releasably connected to the connection member  via the releasable connector , . The connection line  serves to connect the cuff modules  and  to the interconnect  by preventing the first and second ends of the interconnect  from unfolding from around the respective rigid loops  and .","In case of an emergency, the cuff modules  and  may be instantly released from the interconnect  as shown in FIG. B. First, the release tab  is detached from the connection member  by disengaging the releasable connector , , and then pulled sharply to a sufficient distance to cause the second end of the connection line  to exit from the elongated loops , , , and , to thereby allow instant disconnection of the interconnect  from the cuff modules ,  immediately freeing the EDP's legs.","In conclusion, the above-described arm and leg restraint systems of the present invention are easy and intuitive to use and inexpensive to manufacture. The construction of the inventive arm and leg restraint systems makes them easy to deploy in confined areas. Furthermore, the inventive quick release mechanism of the leg restraint system  makes it invaluable in case of an emergency.","Thus, while there have shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the devices and methods illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
