Mainframe computer systems typically support legacy applications created before the development and wide-spread deployment of distributed computing architectures. These legacy applications provide mainframe users with access to vast quantities of information typically stored in large shared databases. After the user provides a password to gain access to the mainframe operating environment, the user may be presented with a list of applications the user is entitled to access. The user may need to supply an additional password to use one or more of these applications, or may be able to use some or all of the applications without providing an additional password or other security information. In contrast to mainframe computer systems, alternative platform computer systems such as client-server networks typically rely on a distributed computing architecture in which one or more servers control network traffic and manage network devices, such as storage devices or printers, while each client supports user applications. An alternative platform user provides a password to gain access to a particular client computer, rather than an associated server, and typically must provide an additional password or other security information to access particular applications supported on the client computer. By integrating mainframe and alternative platform computer systems, businesses and other organizations may provide users with access to applications and data through either a mainframe or alternative platform client computer, depending on the location of these users and other factors.","As computer systems and the information needs of users continue to become increasingly complex and geographically distributed, security issues have become increasingly important. Although both mainframe and alternative platform computer systems require a user to provide a password to access associated applications and data, these systems often use different command formats, password rules, and procedures for changing passwords. As a result, many users must enter one user password to access the mainframe operating environment and one or more user passwords to access each alternative operating environment, while maintaining all such passwords in their memory or in their records. Furthermore, since users frequently forget at least one of their multiple passwords, demand on help desk and other administrative services to change or bypass the forgotten passwords may be substantially increased.","Even if a user were able to adopt a single password suitable for both mainframe and alternative computer systems, a user may elect to change his or her password. In addition, security software typically requires a user to periodically change his or her password. Thus, even if the user has a single password suitable for all mainframe and alternative platform computer systems, the user must personally synchronize, after each change election and at each required change interval, the user password between the various operating environments by submitting and validating a new password at the mainframe client computer and at each alternative platform client computer the user wishes to access. This process is inconvenient, inefficient, time-consuming, and often ineffective since users may neglect to enter the new password in every operating environment to which they may need access.","Some mainframe computer systems synchronize passwords between different mainframe platforms within a mainframe operating environment by broadcasting a password change made in connection with one mainframe platform to some or all of the other mainframe platforms. This technique, however, does not synchronize passwords between mainframe and alternative platform computer systems, which may have vastly different command formats and password rules. Furthermore, because many alternative platform computer systems are widely distributed, involving a large number of client and server computers, even extending this technique to include broadcasting each password change from the mainframe platform throughout each alternative operating environment would overburden the mainframe platform due to the tremendous amount of message traffic. Thus, businesses and other organizations have been unable to efficiently and effectively integrate mainframe and alternative platform computer systems in a secured environment supporting password synchronization.","According to the present invention, disadvantages and problems associated with the use of user passwords in integrated or cooperating mainframe and alternative computer operating environments have been substantially reduced or eliminated.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a system for synchronizing a user password between mainframe and alternative computer operating environments includes a mainframe access module that receives a current user password from an associated mainframe client computer and provides a user with access to selected applications or data in the mainframe operating environment according to the current user password. The mainframe access module also receives a new user password in response to providing the access and communicates the new user password. A mainframe platform coupled to the mainframe access module receives the new user password, stores the new user password, and communicates the new user password. A messaging platform coupled to the mainframe platform receives the new user password from the mainframe platform and communicates a broadcast message containing the new user password. Multiple alternative platforms each coupled to the messaging platform receive the broadcast message from the messaging platform and store the new user password to synchronize the new user password between the mainframe and alternative computer operating environments. Each alternative platform is capable of receiving the new user password from an associated alternative platform client computer and, in response, providing the user with access to the alternative platform client computer.","The system and method of the present invention provide a number of important technical advantages. Unlike previous techniques, which require a user to personally synchronize his or her user password by submitting and validating the password at each mainframe and alternative platform client computer the user may wish to access, the present invention automatically synchronizes the user password between the mainframe and alternative computer operating environments without overburdening mainframe platforms with substantially increased message traffic. Thus, a user need remember only a single user password and may use that password to access applications or data using any mainframe or alternative platform client computer within the system. Furthermore, unlike with previous techniques, when changing his or her password at required intervals or for any other reason, the user only has to change the password using one client computer in either the mainframe or alternative operating environment. Other technical advantages are apparent to those skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["8","10","11","12","8","22","10","34","40","11","12","11","12","8","34","40","22","10"]},"Mainframe client computer  provides a user interface suitable to access and interact with the applications and data within mainframe operating environment .

Mainframe access module  may compare the received and stored user passwords in cooperation with mainframe platform .","Mainframe access module  may also verify the validity of any supplied user identification in a similar manner. In one embodiment, it may be desirable to verify the validity of the user identification to ensure that a password change is not propagated to other computer operating environments when the password is associated with, as an example and not by way of limitation, a root user identification or administrator user identification.

Such geographic distribution may allow mainframe platforms , , and  to more efficiently and effectively service local users over a vast geographic region. Furthermore, the user passwords may also be stored in association with more than one mainframe platform , , or . Such data redundancy may prevent loss of information in the event one of the mainframe platforms , , or  becomes damaged or disabled.
