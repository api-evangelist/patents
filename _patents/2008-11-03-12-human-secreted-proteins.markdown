Each of the above referenced patent applications is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","This application refers to a \u201cSequence Listing\u201d listed below, which is provided as a text file. The text file contains a document entitled \u201cPF489P2D2_SequenceListing.txt\u201d (293,353 bytes, created Nov. 3, 2008), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates to newly identified polynucleotides and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides, uses of such polynucleotides and polypeptides, and their production.","Unlike bacterium, which exist as a single compartment surrounded by a membrane, human cells and other eucaryotes are subdivided by membranes into many functionally distinct compartments. Each membrane-bounded compartment, or organelle, contains different proteins essential for the function of the organelle. The cell uses \u201csorting signals,\u201d which are amino acid motifs located within the protein, to target proteins to particular cellular organelles.","One type of sorting signal, called a signal sequence, a signal peptide, or a leader sequence, directs a class of proteins to an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER separates the membrane-bounded proteins from all other types of proteins. Once localized to the ER, both groups of proteins can be further directed to another organelle called the Golgi apparatus. Here, the Golgi distributes the proteins to vesicles, including secretory vesicles, the cell membrane, lysosomes, and the other organelles.","Proteins targeted to the ER by a signal sequence can be released into the extracellular space as a secreted protein. For example, vesicles containing secreted proteins can fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space\u2014a process called exocytosis. Exocytosis can occur constitutively or after receipt of a triggering signal. In the latter case, the proteins are stored in secretory vesicles (or secretory granules) until exocytosis is triggered. Similarly, proteins residing on the cell membrane can also be secreted into the extracellular space by proteolytic cleavage of a \u201clinker\u201d holding the protein to the membrane.","Despite the great progress made in recent years, only a small number of genes encoding human secreted proteins have been identified. These secreted proteins include the commercially valuable human insulin, interferon, Factor VIII, human growth hormone, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoietin. Thus, in light of the pervasive role of secreted proteins in human physiology, a need exists for identifying and characterizing novel human secreted proteins and the genes that encode them. This knowledge will allow one to detect, to treat, and to prevent medical disorders by using secreted proteins or the genes that encode them.","The present invention relates to novel polynucleotides and the encoded polypeptides. Moreover, the present invention relates to vectors, host cells, antibodies, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing the polypeptides and polynucleotides. Also provided are diagnostic methods for detecting disorders and conditions related to the polypeptides and polynucleotides, and therapeutic methods for treating such disorders and conditions. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying binding partners of the polypeptides.","The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of certain terms used throughout this specification.","In the present invention, \u201cisolated\u201d refers to material removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring), and thus is altered \u201cby the hand of man\u201d from its natural state. For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be \u201cisolated\u201d because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. The term \u201cisolated\u201d does not refer to genomic or cDNA libraries, whole cell total or mRNA preparations, genomic DNA preparations (including those separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto blots), sheared whole cell genomic DNA preparations or other compositions where the art demonstrates no distinguishing features of the polynucleotide\/sequences of the present invention.","In the present invention, a \u201csecreted\u201d protein refers to those proteins capable of being directed to the ER, secretory vesicles, or the extracellular space as a result of a signal sequence, as well as those proteins released into the extracellular space without necessarily containing a signal sequence. If the secreted protein is released into the extracellular space, the secreted protein can undergo extracellular processing to produce a \u201cmature\u201d protein. Release into the extracellular space can occur by many mechanisms, including exocytosis and proteolytic cleavage.","In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are at least 15, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 125, at least 500, or at least 1000 continuous nucleotides but are less than or equal to 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, 7.5 kb, 5 kb, 2.5 kb, 2.0 kb, or 1 kb, in length. In a further embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention comprise a portion of the coding sequences, as disclosed herein, but do not comprise all or a portion of any intron. In another embodiment, the polynucleotides comprising coding sequences do not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene (i.e., 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 to the gene of interest in the genome). In other embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 genomic flanking gene(s).","As used herein, a \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained within the clone deposited with the ATCC\u2122. For example, the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence, including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated sequences, the coding region, with or without the signal sequence, the secreted protein coding region, as well as fragments, epitopes, domains, and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover, as used herein, a \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a molecule having the translated amino acid sequence generated from the polynucleotide as broadly defined.","In the present invention, the full length sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in multiple clones (contig analysis). A representative clone containing all or most of the sequence for SEQ ID NO:X was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (\u201cATCC\u2122\u201d). As shown in Table XIV, each clone is identified by a cDNA Clone ID (Identifier) and the ATCC\u2122 Deposit Number. The ATCC\u2122 is located at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA. The ATCC\u2122 deposit was made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for purposes of patent procedure.","A \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d of the present invention also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing, under stringent hybridization conditions, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X, the complement thereof, or the cDNA within the clone deposited with the ATCC\u2122. \u201cStringent hybridization conditions\u201d refers to an overnight incubation at 42 degree C. in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 \u03bcg\/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1\u00d7SSC at about 65 degree C.","Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the polynucleotides of the present invention at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency); salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 degree C. in a solution comprising 6\u00d7SSPE (20\u00d7SSPE=3M NaCl; 0.2M NaHPO; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 ug\/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50 degree C. with 1\u00d7SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5\u00d7SSC).","Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and\/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt's reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility.","Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA+ sequences (such as any 3\u2032 terminal polyA+ tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a","complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of \u201cpolynucleotide,\u201d since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer).","The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. \u201cModified\u201d bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms.","The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres, and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

In the case where dose dependency does exist, it need not be identical to that of the polypeptide, but rather substantially similar to the dose-dependence in a given activity as compared to the polypeptide of the present invention (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about 25-fold less and, preferably, not more than about tenfold less activity, and most preferably, not more than about three-fold less activity relative to the polypeptide of the present invention.)","Polynucleotides and Polypeptides of the Invention","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 1","Translation products corresponding to this gene share sequence homology with a protein from that is described as upregulated in response to thyroid hormone in tadpoles, and is thought to be important in the tail resorption process during metamorphosis (See Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1996 Mar. 5):93(5): 1924-9, which is herein incorporated by reference). In addition, translation products corresponding to this gene share sequence homology with a recently described group of proteins, called hedgehog interacting proteins (HIPs) (See International Publication No. WO98\/12326, which is herein incorporated by reference). These proteins bind to hedgehog polypeptides such as Shh and Dhh with high affinity (Kd approx. 1 nM). HIPs exhibit spatially and temporally restricted expression domains indicative of important roles in hedgehog-mediated induction. They regulate differentiation of neuronal cells, regulate survival of differentiated neuronal cells, proliferation of chondrocytes, proliferation of testicular germ line cells and\/or expression of patched or hedgehog genes. The biological activity of this polypeptide is assayed by techniques known in the art, otherwise disclosed herein and as described in International Publication No. WO98\/12326, which is herein incorporated by reference.","Preferred polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, the following amino acid sequence:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"right"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"(SEQ ID NO: 47)"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"MLRTSTPNLCGGLHCRAPWLSSGILCLCLIFLLGQVGLLQGHPQCLDYGP"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"PFQPPLHLEFCSDYESFGCCDQHKDRRIAARYWDIMEYFDLKRHELCGDY"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"IKDILCQECSPYAAHLYDAENTQTPLRNLPGLCSDYCSAFHSNCHSAISL"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"LTNDRGLQESHGRDGTRFCHLLDLPDKDYCFPNVLRNDYLNRHLGMVAQD"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"PQGCLQLCLSEVANGLRNPVSMVHAGDGTHRFFVAEQVGVVWVYLPDGSR"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"LEQPFLDLKNIVLTTPWIGDERGFLGLAFHPKFRHNRKFYIYYSCLDKKK"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"VEKIRISEMKVSRADPNKADLKSERVILEIEEPASNHNGGQLLFGLDGYM"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"YIFTGDGGQAGDPFGLFGNAQNKSSLLGKVLRIDVNRAGSHGKRYRVPSD"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"NPFVSEPGAHPAIYAYGIRNMWRCAVDRGDPITRQGRGRIFCGDVGQNRF"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"EEVDLILKGGNYGWRAKEGFACYDKKLCHNASLDDVLPIYAYGHAVGKSV"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"TGGYVYRGCESPNLNGLYIFGDFMSGRLMALQEDRKNKKWKKQDLCLGST"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"TSCAFPGLISTHSKFIISFAEDEAGELYFLATSYPSAYAPRGSIYKFVDP"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"SRRAPPGKCKYKPVPVRTKSKRIPFRPLAKTVLDLLKEQSEKAARKSSSA"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"TLASGPAQGLSEKGSSKKLASPTSSKNTLRGPGTKKKARVGPHVRQGKR"},{"entry":{}},{"entry":"RKSLKSHSGRMRPSAEQKRAGRSLP."}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Preferred polypeptides of the present invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, or all sixteen of the immunogenic epitopes shown in SEQ ID NO: 29 as residues: Asp-52 to Glu-57, Arg-89 to Tyr-95, Asp-102 to Glu-107, Ser-117 to Ser-128, Glu-137 to Gly-145, Arg-192 to Arg-199, Val-231 to Gly-243, Val-250 to Glu-256, Arg-312 to Asn-318, Glu-338 to Asp-349, Pro-405 to Lys-417, Thr-423 to Ile-428, Lys-442 to Ser-453, Glu-467 to Ala-475, Thr-478 to Arg-494, and\/or Pro-497 to Arg-526.

The nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:11) was obtained by sequencing a cloned cDNA, which was deposited on Nov. 17, 1998 at the American Type Culture Collection, and given Accession Number 203484. The deposited gene is inserted in the pSport plasmid (LIFE TECHNOLOGIES\u2122, Rockville, Md.) using the SalI\/NotI restriction endonuclease cleavage sites.","The present invention is further directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:11 is intended DNA fragments at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt in length which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments 50-1500 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention, as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or as shown in SEQ ID NO:11. By a fragment at least 20 nt in length, for example, is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:11. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited size, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. Representative examples of polynucleotide fragments of the invention include, for example, fragments that comprise, or alternatively, consist of, a sequence from about nucleotide 1 to about 50, from about 51 to about 100, from about 101 to about 150, from about 151 to about 200, from about 201 to about 250, from about 251 to about 300, from about 301 to about 350, from about 351 to about 400, from about 401 to about 450, from about 451 to about 500, and from about 501 to about 550, and from about 551 to about 570 of SEQ ID NO:11, or the complementary strand thereto, or the cDNA contained in the deposited gene. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of the corresponding protein.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of the protein set forth in  and\/or Table I, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table I can be used to determine regions of the protein which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table I, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table I). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table I include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in  (SEQ ID NO:29). As set out in  and in Table I, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence shown in , up to the alanine residue at position number 524 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n1-524 of , where n1 is an integer from 1 to 524 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in  (which is identical to the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:29).

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities (e.g., ability to illicit mitogenic activity, induce differentiation of normal or malignant cells, bind to EGF receptors, etc.)), may still be retained. For example the ability to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in , up to the glutamine residue at position number 7, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-m1 of , where m1 is an integer from 7 to 528 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in . Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:29 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: M-1 to L-528;

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Northern analysis indicates that a 2.5-3.0 kb transcript of this gene is expressed primarily in testes tissue and A549 lung carcinoma tissue, but interestingly is absent from normal lung tissue. This gene is also expressed in osteoarthritis tissue and human fetal tissues.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, developmental disorders, and degenerative disorders; osteoarthritis, and lung cancer. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of developing tissues, cartilage, and bone, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. bone, lung, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","Based upon the tissue distribution in testes tissue, lung carcinoma tissue, and osteoarthritic and fetal tissues, and the homology to several proteins involved in the development, differentiation, and\/or proliferation of various cells, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene may be useful for the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders involving the proliferation of cells, particularly cancers cells such as lung carcinoma cells, as well as for diseases and\/or disorders of the testes, fetal tissues and for the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of osteoarthritis.","The expression in lung carcinoma tissue indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of lung carcinomas. Polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene may be useful for the prevention of the growth of lung carcinomas. Alternatively, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene may be useful in the detection of lung carcinomas. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies and or small molecules which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene. Also provided is a kit for detecting lung carcinomas. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for translation products corresponding to this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting lung carcinomas in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for translation products corresponding to this gene to a bodily fluid or biological sample from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein.","More generally, tissue distribution in testes tissue indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and\/or diagnosis of conditions concerning proper testicular function (e.g. endocrine function, sperm maturation), as well as cancer. Therefore, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful in the treatment of male infertility and\/or impotence. Polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are also useful in assays designed to identify binding agents, as such agents (antagonists) are useful as male contraceptive agents. Similarly, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful in the treatment and\/or diagnosis of testicular cancer. The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that may be expressed, particularly at low levels, in other tissues of the body. Therefore, translation products corresponding to this gene may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflammation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications.","Furthermore, the tissue distribution in osteoarthritic tissue suggests that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and\/or diagnosis of diseases of connective tissue, particularly osteoarthritis, including but not limited to inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and cartilage tears and physical injury. Additionally, translation products corresponding to this gene, as well as antibodies directed against these translation products, may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:11 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 2595 of SEQ ID NO:11, b is an integer of 15 to 2609, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:11, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 2","Translation products corresponding to this gene, sometimes referred to herein as TIDE (for Ten Integrin Domains with EGF homology), share sequence homology with integrins, which are a superfamily of dimeric ab cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate the adhesive functions of many cell types, enabling cells to interact with one another and with the extracellular matrix (See 56, 169-178 (1999); all information and references contained within this publication are hereby incorporated herein by reference). Eight human integrin \u2018b\u2019 subunits have been described to date, and in combination with the 12 known \u2018a\u2019 subunits form a large family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors that mediate cell adhesion to counter-receptors on neighboring cells, and to ECM proteins (reviewed by Hynes, 1992). Integrin-ligand interactions are crucial for fundamental biological processes such as cell migration and motility, and lymphocyte extravasation.","In another embodiment, polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of the open reading frame upstream of the predicted signal peptide are contemplated by the present invention.

However, a common feature is that these repeats are found in the extracellular domain of membrane-bound proteins or in proteins known to be secreted (exception: prostaglandin G\/H synthase). The EGF domain includes six cysteine residues which have been shown (in EGF) to be involved in disulfide bonds.

Since the location of these domains have been predicted by computer analysis, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define each domain. In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of TIDE.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions of TIDE. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of TIDE set forth in  and\/or Table II, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table II can be used to determine regions of TIDE which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table II, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table II). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table II include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table II, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened TIDE muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an TIDE mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six TIDE amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the TIDE amino acid sequence shown in , up to the leucine residue at position number 489 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.

In another embodiment, N-terminal deletions of the TIDE polypeptide can be described by the general formula n2-494, where n2 is a number from 2 to 489, corresponding to the position of amino acid identified in .

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened TIDE mutein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an TIDE mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six TIDE amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the TIDE polypeptide shown in , up to the phenylalanine residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-ml of , where ml is an integer from 6 to 494 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in . Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the TIDE polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:30 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: M-1 to Y-493;

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In addition, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules having nucleotide sequences related to extensive portions of SEQ ID NO:12 which have been determined from the following related cDNA genes: HLHFV34R (SEQ ID NO:68), HSRDA85R (SEQ ID NO:69), HSRAZ62R (SEQ ID NO:70), HSRDA17R (SEQ ID NO:71), and HSLEC45R (SEQ ID NO:72).","A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is obtained from human osteoblasts, synovial hypoxia tissue, osteoblast and osteoclast, bone marrow stromal cells, umbilical vein, smooth muscle, placenta, and fetal lung. The polynucleotide of this invention was discovered in a human osteoblast II cDNA library.","This gene is expressed primarily in synovial hypoxia tissue, osteoblast and osteoclast, bone marrow stromal cells, and to a lesser extent in umbilical vein, smooth muscle, placenta, and fetal lung cDNA libraries. Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, disorders of bone and connective tissues, immune and hematopoietic diseases and\/or disorders, vascular disorders, and other disorders involving aberrations in cell-surface interactions. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the connective tissue and skeletal system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., cartilage, bone, vascular, hypoxic tissue, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","Based on the sequence similarity to the human integrin beta-8 subunit, translation product of this gene is expected to share at least some biological activities with integrin proteins, and specifically the human integrin beta-8 subunit. Such activities are known in the art, some of which are described elsewhere herein.","Specifically, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are also useful for modulating the differentiation of normal and malignant cells, modulating the proliferation and\/or differentiation of cancer and neoplastic cells, and modulating the immune response. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may represent a diagnostic marker for hematopoietic and immune diseases and\/or disorders. The full-length protein should be a secreted protein, based upon homology to the integrin family. Therefore, it is secreted into serum, urine, or feces and thus the levels is assayable from patient samples. Assuming specific expression levels are reflective of the presence of immune disorders, this protein would provide a convenient diagnostic for early detection. In addition, expression of this gene product may also be linked to the progression of immune diseases, and therefore may itself actually represent a therapeutic or therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and cellular transformation, particularly those of the immune and hematopoietic systems. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may also be involved in the pathogenesis of developmental abnormalities based upon its potential effects on proliferation and differentiation of cells and tissue cell types. Due to the potential proliferating and differentiating activity of said polynucleotides and polypeptides, the invention is useful as a therapeutic agent in inducing tissue regeneration, for treating inflammatory conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, etc.). Moreover, the invention is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in rapidly proliferating cells and tissue cell types, particularly in adenocarcinoma cells, and other cancers.","Alternatively, the expression within cellular sources marked by proliferating cells indicates polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis, treatment, and\/or prevention of developmental diseases and disorders, including cancer, and other proliferative conditions. Representative uses are described in the \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d and \u201cRegeneration\u201d sections below and elsewhere herein. Briefly, developmental tissues rely on decisions involving cell differentiation and\/or apoptosis in pattern formation.","Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).","Alternatively, this gene product is involved in the pattern of cellular proliferation that accompanies early embryogenesis. Thus, aberrant expression of this gene product in tissues\u2014particularly adult tissues\u2014may correlate with patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, such as found in various cancers. Because of potential roles in proliferation and differentiation, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene may have applications in the adult for tissue regeneration and the treatment of cancers. It may also act as a morphogen to control cell and tissue type specification. Therefore, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful in treating, detecting, and\/or preventing said disorders and conditions, in addition to other types of degenerative conditions. Thus this protein may modulate apoptosis or tissue differentiation and is useful in the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of degenerative or proliferative conditions and diseases. The protein is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in proliferating and cancerous cells and tissues. The protein can also be used to gain new insight into the regulation of cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","The translation product of this gene, sometimes referred to herein as TIDE (for Ten Integrin Domains with EGF homology), shares sequence homology with integrins, which are a superfamily of dimeric ab cell-surface glycoproteins that mediate the adhesive functions of many cell types, enabling cells to interact with one another and with the extracellular matrix (See Genomics 56, 169-178 (1999); all information and references contained within this publication are hereby incorporated herein by reference).","The gene encoding the disclosed cDNA is believed to reside on chromosome 13, at locus 13q33. Accordingly, polynucleotides related to this invention are useful as a marker in linkage analysis for chromosome 13, generally, and particularly at locus 13q33.","The tissue distribution and homology to the human integrin beta-8 subunit indicates polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of immune system disorders. Representative uses are described in the \u201cImmune Activity\u201d and \u201cinfectious disease\u201d sections below, in Example 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 27, and elsewhere herein.","Briefly, the expression indicates a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and\/or activation of hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. Involvement in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes indicates a usefulness for treatment of cancer (e.g. by boosting immune responses). Expression in cells of lymphoid origin, indicates the natural gene product is involved in immune functions. Therefore it would also be useful as an agent for immunological disorders including arthritis, asthma, immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatous Disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, acne, neutropenia, neutrophilia, psoriasis, hypersensitivities, such as T-cell mediated cytotoxicity; immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues, such as host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host diseases, or autoimmunity disorders, such as autoimmune infertility, lense tissue injury, demyelination, systemic lupus erythematosis, drug induced hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's Disease, and scleroderma. Moreover, the protein may represent a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells, or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. Thus, this gene product is thought to be useful in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types. Based upon the tissue distribution of this protein, antagonists directed against this protein is useful in blocking the activity of this protein. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene.","Also provided is a kit for detecting tumors in which expression of this protein occurs. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting these tumors in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene to a bodily fluid or biological sample from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein.","Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:12 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 2485 of SEQ ID NO:12, b is an integer of 15 to 2499, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:12, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 3","Translation products corresponding to this gene share sequence homology with RAMP3 (receptor-activity-modifying proteins), which another group has recently published, which is thought to be important in the transport of the calcitonin-receptor-like receptor (CRLR) to the plasma membrane. RAMPs regulate the transport and ligand specificity of the calcitonin-receptor-like-receptor. There are two other related receptor-activity-modifying proteins, known as RAMP1 and RAMP2 (Nature 1998 May 28; 393(6683):333-9). RAMP1 is thought to present the receptor at the cell surface as a mature glycoprotein and a Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor.","Alternatively, RAMP2-transported receptors are core-glycosylated and are adrenomedullin receptors. CGRP (a 37-amino-acid neuropeptide) and its receptors are widely distributed in the body, and it is the most potent endogenous vasodilatory peptide discovered so far (1997; 11(2-3):167-239). Specific binding sites for adrenomedullin were present in every region of human brain (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, hypothalamus, pons and medulla oblongata), suggesting that a novel neurotransmitter\/neuromodulator role may exist for adrenomedullin in human brain (1997; 18(8):1125-9).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0138"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0139"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},"Alpha, beta, turn and coil regions; hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity; amphipathic regions; flexible regions; antigenic index and surface probability are shown.","Preferred polypeptides of the present invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, or all three of the immunogenic epitopes shown in SEQ ID NO: 31 as residues: Ala-5 to Gln-10, Pro-23 to Cys-28, and\/or Arg-140 to Asp-145. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention.

Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:31), which was determined by sequencing a cloned cDNA (HTLEW81). The nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:13) was obtained by sequencing a cloned cDNA (HTLEW81), which was deposited on Nov. 17, 1998 at the American Type Culture Collection, and given Accession Number 203484. The deposited gene is inserted in the pSport plasmid (LIFE TECHNOLOGIES\u2122, Rockville, Md.) using the SalI\/NotI restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. The present invention is further directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein.","By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:13 is intended DNA fragments at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt in length which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments 50-1500 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention, as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or as shown in SEQ ID NO:13. By a fragment at least 20 nt in length, for example, is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:13. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited size, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. Representative examples of polynucleotide fragments of the invention include, for example, fragments that comprise, or alternatively, consist of, a sequence from about nucleotide 1 to about 50, from about 51 to about 100, from about 101 to about 150, from about 151 to about 200, from about 201 to about 250, from about 251 to about 300, from about 301 to about 350, from about 351 to about 400, from about 401 to about 450, from about 451 to about 500, and from about 501 to about 550, and from about 551 to about 600, from about 601 to about 650, from about 651 to about 700, from about 701 to about 750, from about 751 to about 800, from about 801 to about 850, from about 851 to about 900, from about 901 to about 950, from about 951 to about 1000, from about 1001 to about 1050, from about 1051 to about 1100, from about 1101 to about 1150, from about 1151 to about 1200, from about 1201 to about 1250, from about 1251 to about 1300, from about 1301 to about 1339 of SEQ ID NO:13, or the complementary strand thereto, or the cDNA contained in the deposited gene. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of the corresponding protein.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of the protein set forth in  and\/or Table III, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table III can be used to determine regions of the protein which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table III, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table III). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table III include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table III, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence shown in , up to the arginine residue at position number 143 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n1-148 of , where n1 is an integer from 2 to 143 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in  (which is identical to the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:31).

Moreover, a cytoplasmic tail encompassing amino acids 139 to 149 of this protein has also been determined. Based upon these characteristics, it is believed that the protein product of this gene shares structural features to type Ia membrane proteins.","Northern analysis indicates that a 1.4 kb transcript of this gene is primarily expressed in small intestine tissue, and to a lesser extent in colon and prostate tissue.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, gastrointestinal and neurodegenerative diseases and disorders. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the central nervous and gastrointestinal systems, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., brain, CNS, gastrointestinal, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution and homology to RAMP3 suggest that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the detection\/treatment of neurodegenerative disease states and behavioural disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Tourette Syndrome, schizophrenia, mania, dementia, paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, learning disabilities, ALS, psychoses, autism, and altered behaviors, including disorders in feeding, sleep patterns, balance, and perception. In addition, the gene or gene product may also play a role in the treatment and\/or detection of developmental disorders associated with the developing embryo.","Alternatively, the tissue distribution in small intestine and colon tissues indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and\/or treatment of disorders involving the small intestine. This may include diseases associated with digestion and food absorption, as well as hematopoietic disorders involving the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, or other hematopoietic cells and tissues within the body. Similarly, expression of this gene product in colon tissue indicates again involvement in digestion, processing, and elimination of food, as well as a potential role for this gene as a diagnostic marker or causative agent in the development of colon cancer, and cancer in general. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:13 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 1325 of SEQ ID NO:13, b is an integer of 15 to 1339, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:13, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 4","Translation products corresponding to this gene share sequence homology with a proteoglycan from , and this proteoglycan is believed to participate in the osteogenic processes of cartilage ossification (See Genbank Accession No. gi|222847).

The data representing the structural or functional attributes of the protein set forth in  and\/or Table IV, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table IV can be used to determine regions of the protein which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table IV, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in .

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities (e.g., ability to illicit mitogenic activity, induce differentiation of normal or malignant cells, bind to EGF receptors, etc.)), may still be retained. For example the ability to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in , up to the glutamine residue at position number 7, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-m1 of , where m1 is an integer from 7 to 331 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in . Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:32 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: M-1 to F-331; M-1 to R-330; M-1 to G-329; M-1 to I-328; M-1 to P-327; M-1 to L-326; M-1 to R-325; M-1 to P-324; M-1 to L-323; M-1 to C-322; M-1 to F-321; M-1 to Y-320; M-1 to A-319; M-1 to S-318; M-1 to P-317; M-1 to F-316; M-1 to L-315; M-1 to S-314; M-1 to L-313; M-1 to N-312; M-1 to I-311; M-1 to P-310; M-1 to N-309; M-1 to G-308; M-1 to D-307; M-1 to L-306; M-1 to R-305; M-1 to I-304; M-1 to D-303; M-1 to E-302; M-1 to L-301; M-1 to Q-300; M-1 to R-299; M-1 to R-298; M-1 to T-297; M-1 to H-296; M-1 to K-295; M-1 to H-294; M-1 to E-293; M-1 to E-292; M-1 to P-291; M-1 to D-290; M-1 to C-289; M-1 to F-288; M-1 to V-287; M-1 to D-286; M-1 to R-285; M-1 to Q-284; M-1 to M-283; M-1 to T-282; M-1 to E-281; M-1 to I-280; M-1 to L-279; M-1 to N-278; M-1 to N-277; M-1 to Q-276; M-1 to L-275; M-1 to H-274; M-1 to V-273; M-1 to S-272; M-1 to R-271; M-1 to L-270; M-1 to S-269; M-1 to P-268; M-1 to P-267; M-1 to L-266; M-1 to P-265; M-1 to G-264; M-1 to P-263; M-1 to I-262; M-1 to S-261; M-1 to D-260; M-1 to L-259; M-1 to L-258; M-1 to N-257; M-1 to D-256; M-1 to S-255; M-1 to L-254; M-1 to Y-253; M-1 to L-252; M-1 to F-251; M-1 to Q-250; M-1 to L-249; M-1 to K-248; M-1 to E-247; M-1 to M-246; M-1 to A-245; M-1 to R-244; M-1 to F-243; M-1 to A-242; M-1 to A-241; M-1 to P-240; M-1 to Q-239; M-1 to I-238; M-1 to G-237; M-1 to S-236; M-1 to S-235; M-1 to Q-234; M-1 to L-233; M-1 to R-232; M-1 to N-231; M-1 to L-230; M-1 to R-229; M-1 to V-228; M-1 to D-227; M-1 to L-226; M-1 to F-225; M-1 to E-224; M-1 to I-223; M-1 to G-222; M-1 to S-221; M-1 to P-220; M-1 to L-219; M-1 to V-218; M-1 to P-217; M-1 to L-216; M-1 to A-215; M-1 to E-214; M-1 to L-213; M-1 to Q-212; M-1 to N-211; M-1 to E-210; M-1 to P-209; M-1 to L-208; M-1 to I-207; M-1 to L-206; M-1 to D-205; M-1 to Q-204; M-1 to L-203; M-1 to A-202; M-1 to H-201; M-1 to L-200; M-1 to L-199; M-1 to R-198; M-1 to F-197; M-1 to A-196; M-1 to D-195; M-1 to N-194; M-1 to D-193; M-1 to I-192; M-1 to S-191; M-1 to S-190; M-1 to I-189; M-1 to L-188; M-1 to N-187; M-1 to N-186; M-1 to S-185; M-1 to L-184; M-1 to D-183; M-1 to I-182; M-1 to R-181; M-1 to K-180; M-1 to L-179; M-1 to K-178; M-1 to T-177; M-1 to L-176; M-1 to G-175; M-1 to K-174; M-1 to F-173; M-1 to D-172; M-1 to E-171; M-1 to A-170; M-1 to R-169; M-1 to I-168; M-1 to R-167; M-1 to S-166; M-1 to I-165; M-1 to R-164; M-1 to N-163; M-1 to F-162; M-1 to R-161; M-1 to A-160; M-1 to Y-159; M-1 to L-158; M-1 to Y-157; M-1 to A-156; M-1 to T-155; M-1 to R-154; M-1 to R-153; M-1 to P-152; M-1 to L-151; M-1 to P-150; M-1 to P-149; M-1 to I-148; M-1 to D-147; M-1 to E-146; M-1 to L-145; M-1 to D-144; M-1 to I-143; M-1 to D-142; M-1 to D-141; M-1 to C-140; M-1 to Y-139; M-1 to V-138; M-1 to S-137; M-1 to S-136; M-1 to G-135; M-1 to L-134; M-1 to C-133; M-1 to V-132; M-1 to C-131; M-1 to V-130; M-1 to L-129; M-1 to C-128; M-1 to T-127; M-1 to P-126; M-1 to L-125; M-1 to G-124; M-1 to H-123; M-1 to N-122; M-1 to P-121; M-1 to Q-120; M-1 to S-119; M-1 to S-118; M-1 to L-117; M-1 to L-116; M-1 to L-115; M-1 to G-114; M-1 to A-113; M-1 to T-112; M-1 to T-111; M-1 to P-110; M-1 to R-109; M-1 to T-108; M-1 to M-107; M-1 to T-106; M-1 to P-105; M-1 to N-104; M-1 to S-103; M-1 to S-102; M-1 to P-101; M-1 to T-100; M-1 to G-99; M-1 to P-98; M-1 to A-97; M-1 to T-96; M-1 to T-95; M-1 to S-94; M-1 to K-93; M-1 to A-92; M-1 to P-91; M-1 to S-90; M-1 to I-89; M-1 to S-88; M-1 to T-87; M-1 to A-86; M-1 to P-85; M-1 to A-84; M-1 to L-83; M-1 to S-82; M-1 to T-81; M-1 to V-80; M-1 to K-79; M-1 to V-78; M-1 to E-77; M-1 to P-76; M-1 to L-75; M-1 to Q-74; M-1 to D-73; M-1 to G-72; M-1 to Y-71; M-1 to D-70; M-1 to T-69; M-1 to L-68; M-1 to E-67; M-1 to E-66; M-1 to Y-65; M-1 to N-64; M-1 to S-63; M-1 to L-62; M-1 to D-61; M-1 to I-60; M-1 to V-59; M-1 to E-58; M-1 to G-57; M-1 to Y-56; M-1 to N-55; M-1 to D-54; M-1 to P-53; M-1 to N-52; M-1 to L-51; M-1 to V-50; M-1 to D-49; M-1 to N-48; M-1 to R-47; M-1 to L-46; M-1 to P-45; M-1 to L-44; M-1 to V-43; M-1 to E-42; M-1 to F-41; M-1 to S-40; M-1 to D-39; M-1 to G-38; M-1 to E-37; M-1 to R-36; M-1 to P-35; M-1 to M-34; M-1 to Q-33; M-1 to E-32; M-1 to E-31; M-1 to R-30; M-1 to R-29; M-1 to K-28; M-1 to R-27; M-1 to E-26; M-1 to K-25; M-1 to R-24; M-1 to P-23; M-1 to L-22; M-1 to S-21; M-1 to A-20; M-1 to T-19; M-1 to G-18; M-1 to T-17; M-1 to E-16; M-1 to Q-15; M-1 to L-14; M-1 to V-13; M-1 to L-12; M-1 to A-11; M-1 to L-10; M-1 to L-9; M-1 to S-8; M-1 to L-7; of SEQ ID NO:32. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In addition, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules having nucleotide sequences related to extensive portions of SEQ ID NO:14 which have been determined from the following related cDNA genes: HARAY79R (SEQ ID NO:80), HARAO44R (SEQ ID NO:81), HARAJ74R (SEQ ID NO:82), HARAO66R (SEQ ID NO:83), HARAN19R (SEQ ID NO:84), and HARAT78R (SEQ ID NO:85).","Northern analysis indicates that this gene is expressed in adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla tissues. This gene is also expressed in retinal tissue.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, retinal disorders. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the retina, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., retinal, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution in retinal tissue, and the homology to a proteoglycan involved in the ossification process indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment of disorders of the retina which involve the adhesion of tissues, or the binding of certain proteins to the cell surface. Polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment of retinal disorders such as retinal detachment in individuals suffering from myopia, or in the treatment of macular degeneration. Furthermore, this gene may serve as a tumor marker for retinoblastomas, or related tumors. More generally, the tissue distribution in retinal tissue indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of eye disorders including blindness, color blindness, impaired vision, short and long sightedness, retinitis pigmentosa, retinitis proliferans, and retinoblastoma, retinochoroiditis, retinopathy and retinoschisis. Based upon the tissue distribution of this protein, antagonists directed against this protein are useful in blocking the activity of this protein. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene.","Also provided is a kit for detecting tumors in which expression of this protein occurs. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting these tumors in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene to a bodily fluid from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:14 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 1375 of SEQ ID NO:14, b is an integer of 15 to 1389, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:14, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 5","Translation products corresponding to the CD33-like gene (SEQ ID NOs: 33 and\/or 149) share sequence homology with the CD33 protein (See Genbank Accession BAA24983). The expression pattern of CD33 within the hematopoietic system indicates a potential role in the regulation of myeloid cell differentiation. However, this expression is absent from hematopoietic stem cells.","CD33 is expressed in clonogenic leukemia cells in about 90% of patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While about 60-70% of adults suffering from AML experience complete remission due to chemotherapy application, most of these patients will ultimately die of relapsed leukemia. It is believed that, like CD33, the CD33-like protein of the present invention is also expressed by clonogenic leukemia cells from the vast majority of patients with AML. Thus, there is a clear need to identify and isolate nucleic acid molecules encoding additional polypeptides having CD33-like protein activity. It is believed that cancerous tissue contains significantly greater amounts of CD33-like protein gene copy number and expresses significantly enhanced levels of CD33-like protein and mRNA encoding the CD33-like protein when compared to a \u201cstandard\u201d mammal, i.e.\u2014a mammal of the same species not having the cancer or inflammatory disease. Thus, enhanced levels of the CD33-like protein will be detected in certain bodily fluids (e.g., serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) from mammals when compared to sera from mammals of the same species not having the cancer or inflammatory disease.","Translation products corresponding to the CD33-like and CD33-likeSV (a splice variant of CD33-like) (SEQ ID NOs: 33 and\/or 149) share sequence homology with a number of CD33-related Siglecs, namely Siglecs-3, -5 (See Genbank Accession AAD50978), -6 (See Genbank Accession NP001236), -7 (See Genbank Accession AAF12759), -8 (See Genbank Accession AAF27622), and -9 (See Genbank Accession AAF87223). Siglecs are sialic acid binding proteins, and are members of the Ig superfamily which are expressed at the cellular surface. Each Siglec member exhibits distinct sialic acid binding properties, and has a characteristic tissue expression profile. Based upon the homology, it is thought that CD33-like and CD33-likeSV will share at least some of the biological activities of other Siglecs (e.g., sialic acid binding). CD33-likeSV is thought to exist as a monomer in the plasma membrane (See  and\/or Example 54).

In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of the corresponding protein.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of the protein set forth in , , and\/or Tables V or XIII, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Tables V and XIII can be used to determine regions of the protein which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Tables V and XIII, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate , (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Tables V and XIII). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Tables V and XIII include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequences set out in  and . As set out in , and in Tables V and XIII, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence shown in , up to the alanine residue at position number 634 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n1-639 of , where n1 is an integer from 2 to 634 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in  (which is identical to the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:33).

and A-634 to Q-639 of SEQ ID NO:33. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g. fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities (e.g., ability to illicit mitogenic activity, induce differentiation of normal or malignant cells, bind to EGF receptors, etc.)), may still be retained. For example the ability to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in , up to the leucine residue at position number 7, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-m1 of , where m1 is an integer from 7 to 638 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in . Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:33 include polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, an amino acid sequence selected from residues: M-1 to F-638;

Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In addition, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules having nucleotide sequences related to extensive portions of SEQ ID NO:15 and\/or SEQ ID NO:148, which have been determined in part from the following related cDNA genes: HTOFA26R (SEQ ID NO:93), HWAEM43R (SEQ ID NO:94), HDPMQ69R (SEQ ID NO:95), HDPGA09RA (SEQ ID NO:96), HEOMH10R (SEQ ID NO:97), and HFKCT73F (SEQ ID NO:98).","The CD33-like polypeptide sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 33 of this gene has been determined to have a transmembrane domain at about amino acid position 496-512 of the amino acid sequence referenced in Table XIV for this gene. Moreover, a cytoplasmic tail encompassing amino acids 513 to 639 of this protein has also been determined. Based upon these characteristics, it is believed that the protein product of this gene shares structural features to type Ia membrane proteins.","The CD33-likeSV polypeptide sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 149 has been determined to have a transmembrane domain at about amino acid position 539-572 of SEQ ID NO: 149. Moreover, a cytoplasmic tail encompassing amino acids 573-697 of SEQ ID NO: 149 has also been determined Additionally, polypeptides encompassed by the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, four, or all five of the CD33-likeSV Ig-like domains represented in SEQ ID NO: 149 as amino acids Phe-21 to Ala-141; Leu-142 to Tyr-236; Leu-253 to Gln-341; Val-358 to Val-442; and His-443 to Pro-538 (See  for domains).","Northern analysis indicates that CD33-like is expressed highest in spleen tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes, and to a lesser extent in ovary and lung tissue.","Additionally, Northern blot analysis reveals the presence of a major CD33-likeSV mRNA transcript of approximately 3.0 kb, with highest levels in spleen, lymph node, blood leukocytes, and appendix. CD33-likeSV is also expressed in eosinophils, B cells and monocytes.","Therefore, CD33-like polynucleotides and polypeptides, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of the following diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, disorders of the immune system, in particular the immunodiagnosis of acute leukemias. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful to provide immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., immune, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid or spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue from an individual not having the disorder.","Similarly, CD33-likeSV polynucleotides and polypeptides, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of the following diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, disorders of the immune system, including inflammatory and allergic disorders.

CD33 MoABs have been used in preliminary therapeutic trials for purging bone marrow of AML patients, either before transplantation or for diseases resistant to chemotherapy. To prevent AML patients in remission from suffering relapse, or due to the lack of an appropriate allogenic bone marrow donor, a method is necessary for purging leukemia cells from the autografts of patients with advanced AML. By the invention, this method is provided by which bone marrow from an AML patient is obtained by, for example, percutaneous aspirations from the posterior iliac crest, isolating bone marrow mononuclear by FICOLL\u2122-hypaque density gradient centrifugation, and incubating with an anti-CD33-like protein MoAB, for example, 3-5 times for 15-30 min. at 4-6 degrees C., followed by incubation with rabbit complement at about 37 degrees C. for 30 minutes. The patient is then subject to myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by reinfusion of the treated autologous bone marrow according to standard techniques. By the invention, clonogenic tumor cells are depleted from the bone marrow while sparing hematopoietic cells necessary for engraftment.","In a further embodiment, the invention provides an in vivo method for selectively killing or inhibiting growth of tumor cells expressing CD33-like protein antigen of the present invention. The method involves administering to the patient an effective amount of an antagonist to inhibit the CD33-like protein receptor signaling pathway. By the invention, administering such antagonist of the CD33-like protein to a patient may also be useful for treating inflammatory diseases including arthritis and colitis. Antagonists for use in the present invention include polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised aginst the CD33-like protein or a fragment thereof, antisense molecules which control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple-helix formation, proteins or other compounds which bind the CD33-like protein domains, or soluble forms of the CD33-like protein, such as protein fragments including the extracellular region from the full length receptor, which antagonize CD33-like protein mediated signaling by competing with the cell surface CD33-like protein for binding to CD33 receptor ligands.","The tissue distribution of CD33-likeSV in blood leukocytes, B cells and eosinophils, and the homology to other CD33 related Siglecs, indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to CD33-like and CD33-likeSV are useful for the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders of the immune system.","The homology to a number of CD33 related Siglec proteins indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to CD33-like and CD33-likeSV may be useful as a target for immunotherapy in diseases and\/or disorders involving the immune system, and more particularly diseases and\/or disorders related to leukocytes. The expression in eosinophils indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to CD33-like and\/or CD33-likeSV are useful for the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders related to eosinophils, such as, for example, eosinophil adenoma, eosinophilic granuloma, eosinophilic leukemia, and eosinophilic nonallergic rhinitis, allergic disorders, and\/or hypereosinophilic disorders. Additionally, the expression in blood leukocytes indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to CD33-like and CD33-likeSV are useful for the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders relating to other blood leukocytes, such as monocytes, for example.","Alternatively, the homology to other CD33 related Siglec proteins indicates that translation products corresponding to CD33-like and CD33-likeSV may play a useful role in the activation of cells involved in the destruction of pathogens. This may occur, by way of a non-limiting hypothesis, through an interaction between CD33-like and\/or CD33-likeSV translation products and non-sialylated pathogens. Furthermore, the binding of CD33-like and\/or CD33-likeSV translation products to erythrocytes suggests that these translation products may function in the elimination of erythrocytes from the blood stream and\/or self-recognition, and may play a role in the recognition of sialic acid on the surface of erythrocytes. Sialidase treated erythrocytes were not bound by translation products corresponding to CD33-like and\/or CD33-likeSV. Thus, translation products corresponding to CD33-like and\/or CD33-likeSV may be involved in the clearance of erythrocytes from the blood stream, self-recognition and\/or immune system activation.","Polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention, can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. If these polynucleotides or polypeptides, or agonists or antagonists of the present invention, do exhibit activity in a particular assay, it is likely that these molecules may be involved in the diseases associated with the biological activity. Thus, the polynucleotides and polypeptides, and agonists or antagonists could be used to treat the associated disease.","CD33-like and CD33-likeSV polypeptides are believed to be involved in biological activities associated with immune cell activation, pathogen recognition, erythrocyte binding, and\/or eosinophilic and other immune cell disorders. Accordingly, compositions of the invention (including polynucleotides, polypeptides and antibodies of the invention, and fragments and variants thereof) may be used in the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders associated with aberrant CD33-like and CD33-likeSV activity. In preferred embodiments, compositions of the invention (including polynucleotides, polypeptides and antibodies of the invention, and fragments and variants thereof) may be used in the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders relating to blood disorders (e.g., polycythemia, and\/or as described under \u201cImmune activity\u201d and \u201cCardiovascular Disorders\u201d below), hypereosinophilic disorders, allergic disorders, pathogen recognition, erythrocyte binding, and immune system disorders (e.g., pathogen infections, and\/or as described under \u201cImmune activity\u201d below). Thus, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies of the invention are useful in the diagnosis, detection and\/or treatment of diseases and\/or disorders associated with activities that include, but are not limited to, blood disorders, hypereosinophilic disorders, allergic disorders, pathogen recognition, erythrocyte binding, and immune system disorders.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:15 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 2281 of SEQ ID NO:15, b is an integer of 15 to 2295, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:15, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases.

The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a CD33 homolog derived from a human primary dendritic cells cDNA library. More particularly, the polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a human siglec homolog, sometimes hereafter referred to as \u201cCD33-like 3\u201d and\/or \u201csiglec 7\u201d. The invention also relates to inhibiting the action of such polypeptides.","The siglecs (sialic acid binding Ig-like lectins) are type 1 membrane proteins that constitute a distinct subset of the Ig superfamily, characterised by their sequence similarities and abilities to bind sialic acids in glycoproteins and glycolipid (Crocker, P. R., et al., Glycobiology:8 (1998)). Members of the Ig Superfamily of proteins are defined as molecules that share domains of sequence similarity with the variable or constant domains of antibodies.","Many Ig superfamily proteins consist of multiple tandem Ig-like domains connected to other domains, such as Fn-III repeat domains (Vaughn, D. E., and P. J. Bjorkman, Neuron, 16:261-73 (1996)). At the primary structural level, traditional Ig-like domains can be identified by the presence of two cysteine residues separated by approximately 55-75 amino acid residues, and an \u201cinvariant\u201d tryptophan residue located 10-15 residues C-terminal to the first of the two conserved cysteine residues. The two conserved cysteine residues are thought to be involved in disulfide bonding to form the folded Ig structures (Vaughn, D. E., (1996)).","Ig-like domains further share a common folding pattern, that of a sandwich or fold structure of two b-sheets consisting of antiparallel b-strands containing 5-10 amino acids (Huang, Z., et al., Biopolymers, 43:367-82 (1997)). Ig-like domains are divided, based upon sequence and structural similarities, into four classifications known as C1, C2, I and V-like domains.","The functional determinants of the Ig-like domains are presented on the faces of b-sheets or the loop regions of the Ig-fold. Accordingly, protein-protein interactions can occur either between the faces of the b-sheets, or the loop regions of the Ig-fold (Huang, Z., (1998)). These Ig-like domains are involved in mediating a diversity of biological functions such as intermolecular binding and protein-protein homophilic or heterophilic interactions.","Thus, Ig-like domains play an integral role in facilitating the activities of proteins of the Ig superfamily. In mammals, the group currently comprises sialoadhesin\/siglec-1, CD22\/siglec-2, CD33\/siglec-3, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG\/siglec-4), siglecs-5, -6 and 7 (Crocker, P. R., et al., EMBO J., 13:4490-503 (1994); Sgroi, D., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 268:7011-18 (1993); Freeman, D.

Chem., 274:22729-738 (1999); Nicol, G., et al., J. Biol. Chem., In Press (1999)). Siglec-7 has also recently been characterised independently as the NK receptor p75\/AIRM1 (Falco, M., et al., J. Exp. Med., 190:793-802 (1999)). In addition, the gene encoding another siglec-like sequence, OBBP-like protein has been reported but there is no information on its binding activity (Yousef, G. M., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., In Press (1999)).","Each of these proteins has an extracellular region made up of a membrane distal V-set domain followed by varying numbers of C2 set domains which range from 16 in sialoadhesin to 1 in CD33. In the cases of sialoadhesin, CD22, MAG and CD33, the sialic acid binding site has been mapped to the V-set domain and for sialoadhesin it has been further characterised at the molecular level by X-ray crystallography 11 (Nath, D., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270:26184-91 (1995); van der Merwe, P. A., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271:9273-80 (1996); Tang, S., et al., J. Cell Biol., 138:1355-66 (1997); Taylor, V. C., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 274:11505-12 (1999); May, A. P., et al., Molecular Cell, 1:719-28 (1998)).","Apart from MAG and SMP that are found exclusively in the nervous system, all siglecs characterised to date are expressed on discrete subsets of hemopoietic cells and can provide useful lineage-restricted markers. Thus, CD22 is present only on mature B cells, sialoadhesin is on macrophage subsets, CD33 is a marker of early committed myeloid progenitor cells, siglec-5 is expressed by monocytes and mature neutrophils, siglec-6 is on B cells and siglec-7 is expressed by NK cells and monocytes (Dorken, B., et al., J. Immunology, 136:4470-79 (1986); Crocker, P. R., et al., J. Exp. Med., 164:1862-75 (1986); Peiper, S. C., et al., In Leukocyte Typing IV. Oxford University Press, Oxford. 814-16 (1989); Cornish, A.

Chem., In Press (1999)).","These expression patterns indicate discrete functions amongst hemopoietic cell subsets, but apart from CD22, a well-characterised negative regulator of B cell activation (reviewed in Cyster, J. G. and C. C. Goodnow, Immunity, 6:509-17 (1997)), the biological functions of siglecs expressed in the hemopoietic system are unknown. Proposed functions include cell-cell interactions through recognition of sialylated glycoconjugates on other cells. However, a number of studies have also shown that cell-cell adhesion mediated by siglecs can be modulated by cis-interactions with sialic acids present in the host plasma membrane. This is particularly striking for CD22, CD33 and siglec-5, whose binding activities can be greatly increased if host cells are pretreated with sialidase to remove the cis-competing sialic acids (Freeman, D. S., et al., Blood, 85:2005-12 (1995); Cornish, A. L., et al., Blood, 92:2123-132 (1998); Sgroi, D., et al., P.N.A.S., 92:4026-30 (1995)).","Besides potential roles in cellular interactions, there is growing evidence that, similar to CD22, the more recently characterised siglecs are involved in signalling functions. The cytoplasmic tails of CD33 and siglecs-5, -6 and -7 have two well-conserved tyrosine-based motifs that are similar to well-characterised signaling motifs in other leukocyte receptors (Gergely, J., et al., Immun. Lett., 68:3-15 (1999)). Where studied, both tyrosine residues can be phosphorylated by src-like kinase(s) and, in the case of the membrane proximal tyrosine, this leads to subsequent recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Falco, M., et al., J. Exp. Med., 190:793-802 (1999); Taylor, V. C., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 274:11505-12 (1999)).","Thus there exists a clear need for identifying and exploiting novel members of the siglec family of immunoglobulin proteins. Although structurally related, such proteins may possess diverse and multifaceted functions in a variety of cell and tissue types. The purified siglec proteins of the invention are research tools useful for the identification, characterization and purification of cell signaling molecules. Furthermore, the identification of new sigecs permits the development of a range of derivatives, agonists and antagonists at the nucleic acid and protein levels which in turn have applications in the treatment and diagnosis of a range of conditions such as cancer, inflammation, neurological disorders and immunological disorders, amongst many other conditions. The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a member of the sigec family and has been termed CD33-like 3. This identification has been made as a result of amino acid sequence homology to the human cd3311 (See Genbank Accession No. gi|2913995).","Preferred polypeptides of the present invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, or all twelve of the immunogenic epitopes shown in SEQ ID NO: 34 as residues: Gly-12 to Tyr-26, Val-52 to Asp-59, Gln-88 to Asp-93, Arg-124 to Asn-129, His-193 to Arg-198, Gln-207 to Thr-213, Gln-338 to Arg-346, Ser-378 to Ala-384, Ser-413 to Arg-420, Ser-428 to Glu-434, His-443 to Ser-451, and\/or Glu-454 to Ser-461.

Since the location of these domains have been predicted by computer analysis, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define each domain.","In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of CD33-like 3.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions of CD33-like 3. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of CD33-like 3 set forth in  and\/or Table VI, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table VI can be used to determine regions of CD33-like 3 which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table VI, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table VI). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table VI include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table VI, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, modulate cellular interaction, or signalling pathways, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened CD33-like 3 muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an CD33-like 3 mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six CD33-like 3 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the CD33-like 3 amino acid sequence shown in , up to the glutamic acid residue at position number 462 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n1-467 of , where n1 is an integer from 2 to 462 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in  (which is identical to the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:34). In another embodiment, N-terminal deletions of the CD33-like 3 polypeptide can be described by the general formula n2-467, where n2 is a number from 2 to 462, corresponding to the position of amino acid identified in .

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened CD33-like 3 mutein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a CD33-like 3 mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six CD33-like 3 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the CD33-like 3 polypeptide shown in , up to the leucine residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-ml of , where ml is an integer from 6 to 467 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in .","Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the CD33-like 3 polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:34 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: M-1 to P-466;

Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In addition, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules having nucleotide sequences related to extensive portions of SEQ ID NO:16 which have been determined from the following related cDNA genes: HGBAY02R (SEQ ID NO:100) and HLYBY62R (SEQ ID NO:101).","A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is obtained from human NK cells, T-cells, primary dendritic cells, placenta, spleen, primary breast cancer, gall bladder, apoptotic t-cells, macrophage, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia spleen. The polynucleotide of this invention was discovered in a human primary dendritic cell cDNA library.","Based on the sequence similarity to the human CD33L1, translation product of this gene is expected to share at least some biological activities with CD33 proteins, and specifically myeloid modulatory proteins and\/or siglec proteins. Such activities are known in the art, some of which are described elsewhere herein.","Specifically, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are also useful for modulating the differentiation of normal and malignant cells, modulating the proliferation and\/or differentiation of cancer and neoplastic cells, and modulating the immune response. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may represent a diagnostic marker for hematopoietic and immune diseases and\/or disorders. The full-length protein should be a secreted protein, based upon homology to the CD33 family. Therefore, it is secreted into serum, urine, or feces and thus the levels is assayable from patient samples. Assuming specific expression levels are reflective of the presence of immune disorders, this protein would provide a convenient diagnostic for early detection. In addition, expression of this gene product may also be linked to the progression of immune diseases, and therefore may itself actually represent a therapeutic or therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and cellular transformation, particularly those of the immune and hematopoietic systems. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may also be involved in the pathogenesis of developmental abnormalities based upon its potential effects on proliferation and differentiation of cells and tissue cell types. Due to the potential proliferating and differentiating activity of said polynucleotides and polypeptides, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful as a therapeutic agent(s) in inducing tissue regeneration, for treating inflammatory conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, etc.). Moreover, the invention is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in rapidly proliferating cells and tissue cell types, particularly in adenocarcinoma cells, and other cancers.","This gene is expressed predominantly on NK cells, and to a lesser extent on T-cells. Therefore, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of the following diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, immune disorders and cancer, as well as the immunodiagnosis of acute leukemias. Similarly, polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful to provide immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system, and breast tissue, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. immune, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid or spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution in NK cells, in combination with the homology to siglec family of proteins, indicates that polynucleotides, translation products and antibodies corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of immune system disorders. NK cells are bone-marrow derived granular lymphocytes that play an important role in natural immunity to infectious diseases and have the capacity to kill certain virally-infected cells and tumor cells that have down-regulated MHC Class-I antigen expression. The killing and proinflammatory activities of NK cells are regulated through a variety of cell surface receptors that can mediate either activity or inhibitory signals. The best understood receptors are those that recognize MHC Class I molecules at the cell surface and deliver a negative signal, thereby protecting normal host cells from cytotoxicity. These receptors can belong either to the C-type lectin superfamily or the Ig superfamily, although in humans the majority are members of the Ig superfamily known as killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs). Representative uses are described in the \u201cImmune Activity\u201d and \u201cinfectious disease\u201d sections below, in Example 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 27, and elsewhere herein.","Briefly, the expression indicates a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and\/or activation of hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. Involvement in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes indicates a usefulness for treatment of cancer (e.g. by boosting immune responses). Expression in cells of lymphoid origin, indicates the natural gene product is involved in immune functions. Therefore it would also be useful as an agent for immunological disorders including arthritis, asthma, immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatous Disease, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, acne, neutropenia, neutrophilia, psoriasis, hypersensitivities, such as T-cell mediated cytotoxicity; immune reactions to transplanted organs and tissues, such as host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host diseases, or autoimmunity disorders, such as autoimmune infertility, lense tissue injury, demyelination, systemic lupus erythematosis, drug induced hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's Disease, and scleroderma. Moreover, the protein may represent a secreted factor that influences the differentiation or behavior of other blood cells, or that recruits hematopoietic cells to sites of injury. Thus, this gene product is thought to be useful in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types. Based upon the tissue distribution of this protein, antagonists directed against this protein is useful in blocking the activity of this protein. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene.","Also provided is a kit for detecting tumors in which expression of this protein occurs. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting these tumors in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene to a bodily fluid from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:16 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 1734 of SEQ ID NO:16, b is an integer of 15 to 1748, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:16, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 7","This invention relates to newly identified polynucleotides, polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides, the use of such polynucleotides and polypeptides, as well as the production of such polynucleotides and polypeptides. The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a human integrin alpha 11 homolog derived from a human osteoblast II cDNA library. More particularly, the polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a human integrin alpha 11-subunit homolog, sometimes hereafter referred to as \u201cintegrin alpha 11\u201d, \u201cintegrin alpha 11-subunit\u201d, \u201ca11\u201d, \u201cA11-subunit\u201d, and\/or \u201cIntegrin a11-subunit\u201d. The invention also relates to inhibiting the action of such polypeptides. The integrins are a large family of cell adhesion molecules consisting of noncovalently associated ab heterodimers.","We have cloned and sequenced a novel human integrin a-subunit cDNA, designated a11. The a11 cDNA encodes a protein with a 22 amino acid signal peptide, a large 1120 residue extracellular domain that contains an I-domain of 207 residues and is linked by a transmembrane domain to a short cytoplasmic domain of 24 amino acids. The deduced a11 protein shows the typical structural features of integrin a-subunits and is similar to a distinct group of a-subunits from collagen-binding integrins. However, it differs from most integrin a-chains by an incompletetely preserved cytoplasmic GFFKR motif.","The human ITGA11 gene was located to bands q22.3-23 on chromosome 15, and its transcripts were found predominantly in bone, cartilage as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Expression of the 5.5 kilobase all mRNA was also detectable in ovary and small intestine.","All vertebrate cells express members of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules, which mediate cellular adhesion to other cells and extracellular subtratum, cell migration and participate in important physiologic processes from signal transduction to cell proliferation and differentiation (Hynes, 92; Springer, 92).","Integrins are structurally homologous heterodimeric type-I membrane glycoproteins formed by the noncovalent association of one of eight b-subunits with one of the 17 different a-subunits described to date, resulting in at least 22 different ab complexes. Their binding specificities for cellular and extracellular ligands are determined by both subunits and are dynamically regulated in a cell-type-specific mode by the cellular environment as well as by the developmental and activation state of the cell {Diamond and Springer, 94}. In integrin a-subunits, the aminoterminal region of the large extracellular domain consists of a seven-fold repeated structure which is predicted to fold into a b-propeller domain {Corbi et al., 1987; Springer, 1997}. The three or four C-terminal repeats contain putative divalent cation binding motifs that are thought to be important for ligand binding and subunit association {Diamond and Springer, 94}. The a1, a2, a 10, aD, aE, aL, aM and aX-subunits contain an approximately 200 amino acid I-domain inserted between the second and third repeat that is not present in other a-chains {Larson et al., 1989}. Several isolated I-domains have been shown to independently bind the ligands of the parent integrin heterodimer {Kamata and Takada, 1994; Randi and Hogg, 1994}. The a3, a5-8, aIIb and aV-subunits are proteolytically processed at a conserved site into disulphide-linked heavy and light chains, while the a4-subunit is cleaved at a more aminoterminal site into two fragments that remain noncovalently associated {Hemler et al., 90}. Additional a-subunit variants are generated by alternative splicing of primary transcripts {Ziober et al., 93; Delwel et al., 95; Leung et al., 98}.","The extracellular domains of a-integrin subunits are connected by a single spanning transmembrane domain to short, diverse cytoplasmic domains whose only conserved feature is a membrane-proximal KXGFF(K\/R)R motif {Sastry and Horwitz, 1993}. The cytoplasmic domains have been implicated in the cell-type-specific modulation of integrin affinity states {Williams et al., 1994}.","The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a member of the integrin family and has been termed integrin alpha 11 subunit (\u201ca11\u201d). This identification has been made as a result of amino acid sequence homology to the human integrin alpha 1 subunit (See Genbank Accession No. gi|346210).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0268","num":"0267"},"figref":"FIGS. 19A-F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0269","num":"0268"},"figref":"FIGS. 20A-E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0270","num":"0269"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},"Its translation product has homology to the characteristic immunoglobulin and major histocompatibility complex protein domain of integrin family members.

Since the location of these domains have been predicted by computer analysis, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define each domain. In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of a11.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions of the present invention.","The data representing the structural or functional attributes of a11 set forth in  and\/or Table VII, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table VII can be used to determine regions of all which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table VII, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table VII). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table VII include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table VII, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened a11 muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an a11 mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six a11 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the a11 amino acid sequence shown in , up to the threonine residue at position number 1184 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities (e.g., ability to illicit mitogenic activity, induce differentiation of normal or malignant cells, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened a11 mutein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an a11 mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six a11 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the a11 polypeptide shown in , up to the glycine residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-m1 of , where m1 is an integer from 6 to 1189 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in . Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the a11 polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:35 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: M-1 to L-1188;

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In addition, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules having nucleotide sequences related to extensive portions of SEQ ID NO:17 which have been determined from the following related cDNA genes: HEEAB54R (SEQ ID NO:104), HRDAF83R (SEQ ID NO:105), HOUBC62R (SEQ ID NO:106), HCDBI19R (SEQ ID NO:107), HOHCU94R (SEQ ID NO:108), HOACC13R (SEQ ID NO:109), HCDAP21R (SEQ ID NO:110), HNHHA34R (SEQ ID NO:111), HOHEA75R (SEQ ID NO:112) and HNGEL59R (SEQ ID NO:113).","A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is obtained from human ovary, small intestine, fetal heart, fetal brain, large intestine, osteoblasts, human trabelcular bone cells, messangial cells, adipocytes, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, breast cancer cells, and bone marrow tissues and cells. The polynucleotide of this invention was discovered in a human osteoblast II cDNA library.","Based on the sequence similarity to the human integrin alpha 1 subunit, translation product of this gene is expected to share at least some biological activities with integrin proteins, and specifically the integrin alpha 1 protein. Such activities are known in the art, some of which are described elsewhere herein.","Specifically, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are also useful for modulating the differentiation of normal and malignant cells, modulating the proliferation and\/or differentiation of cancer and neoplastic cells, and modulating the immune response. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may represent a diagnostic marker for hematopoietic and immune diseases and\/or disorders. The full-length protein should be a secreted protein, based upon homology to the integrin family. Therefore, it is secreted into serum, urine, or feces and thus the levels is assayable from patient samples. Assuming specific expression levels are reflective of the presence of immune disorders, this protein would provide a convenient diagnostic for early detection. In addition, expression of this gene product may also be linked to the progression of immune diseases, and therefore may itself actually represent a therapeutic or therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and cellular transformation, particularly those of the immune and hematopoietic systems. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may also be involved in the pathogenesis of developmental abnormalities based upon its potential effects on proliferation and differentiation of cells and tissue cell types. Due to the potential proliferating and differentiating activity of said polynucleotides and polypeptides, the invention is useful as a therapeutic agent in inducing tissue regeneration, for treating inflammatory conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, etc.). Moreover, the invention is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in rapidly proliferating cells and tissue cell types, particularly in adenocarcinoma cells, and other cancers.","Alternatively, the expression within cellular sources marked by proliferating cells indicates this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis, treatment, and\/or prevention of developmental diseases and disorders, including cancer, and other proliferative conditions. Representative uses are described in the \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d and \u201cRegeneration\u201d sections below and elsewhere herein. Briefly, developmental tissues rely on decisions involving cell differentiation and\/or apoptosis in pattern formation.","Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).","Alternatively, this gene product is involved in the pattern of cellular proliferation that accompanies early embryogenesis. Thus, aberrant expression of this gene product in tissues\u2014particularly adult tissues\u2014may correlate with patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, such as found in various cancers. Because of potential roles in proliferation and differentiation, this gene product may have applications in the adult for tissue regeneration and the treatment of cancers. It may also act as a morphogen to control cell and tissue type specification. Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are useful in treating, detecting, and\/or preventing said disorders and conditions, in addition to other types of degenerative conditions. Thus, this protein may modulate apoptosis or tissue differentiation and is useful in the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of degenerative or proliferative conditions and diseases. The protein is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in proliferating and cancerous cells and tissues. The protein can also be used to gain new insight into the regulation of cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","This gene is expressed almost exclusively in osteoblasts, human trabelcular bone cells, messangial cells, adipocytes, and to a lesser extent in osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, breast cancer cells, and bone marrow.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of the following diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, disorders of the skeletal system, connective tissues, and immune and hematpoietic diseases and\/or disorders. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful to provide immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the connective tissue and skeletal system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. immune, hematopoietic, skeletal, bone, cartilage, developmental, reproductive, secretory, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids or cell types (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid or spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution in osteoblasts and homology to integrin alpha subunit 10 indicates that the protein products of this gene are useful for the treatment of disorders and conditions affecting the skeletal system, in particular osteoporosis as well as disorders afflicting connective tissues (e.g., arthritis, trauma, tendonitis, chrondomalacia and inflammation), such as in the diagnosis and treatment of various autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis as well as dwarfism, spinal deformation, and specific joint abnormalities as well as chondrodysplasias (i.e., spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, familial osteoarthritis, Atelosteogenesis type II, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid). polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of hematopoietic related disorders such as anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or leukemia since stromal cells are important in the production of cells of hematopoietic lineages. Such a use is consistent with the observed homology to integrin family members, in conjunction with the tissue distribution in bone marrow cells.","Integrins play pivotal roles in cell migration, inflammation, proliferation, and cellular infiltration. Thus, the present invention is expected to share at least some of these activities. Representative uses are described in the \u201cImmune Activity\u201d and \u201cinfectious disease\u201d sections below, in Example 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 27, and elsewhere herein. Briefly, the uses include bone marrow cell ex-vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia. The gene product may also be involved in lymphopoiesis, therefore, it can be used in immune disorders such as infection, inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency etc. In addition, this gene product may have commercial utility in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and\/or proliferation of various cell types. Based upon the tissue distribution of this protein, antagonists directed against this protein is useful in blocking the activity of this protein. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene.","Also provided is a kit for detecting tumors in which expression of this protein occurs. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting these tumors in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene to a bodily fluid from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein.","Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:17 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 4981 of SEQ ID NO:17, b is an integer of 15 to 4995, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:17, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 8","The present invention relates to a novel peptidoglycan recognition binding proteins expressed by chondrosarcoma tissue. More specifically, isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding a human peptidoglycan recognition protein-related protein, sometimes referred to herein as \u201chuman tag7\u201d or \u201ctag7\u201d or \u201chtag7\u201d. Further provided are vectors, host cells and recombinant methods for producing the same. The invention also relates to both the inhibition and enhancement of activities of the tag7 protein, polypeptides and diagnostic methods for detecting tag7 gene expression.","Peptidoglycan, as well as Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is a surface component of many bacteria which illicit a wide range of physiological and immune responses in humans. Specifically, peptidoglycan has been shown to manifest itself clinically by reproducing most of the symptoms of bacterial infection, including fever, acute-phase response, inflammation, septic shock, leukocytosis, sleepiness, malaise, abcess formation, and arthritis (see Dziarski et al., JBC, 273 (15): 8680 (1998)). Furthermore, the type of peptidoglycan (i.e.\u2014the specific stereoisomers or analogs of muramyl dipeptide, N-acetylglucosaminyl-beta(1-4)-N-acteylmuramyl tetrapeptides, etc.), were shown to elicit a broad range of activities, including exhibiting greater pyrogenicity, inducing acute joint inflammation, stimulating macrophages, and causing hemorrhagic necrosis at a primed site (See Kotani et al., Fed Proc, 45(11): 2534 (1986)). It has been demonstrated in humans that a lipopolysaccharide binding protein exists that was discovered as a trace plasma protein (See Schumann et al., Science, 249(4975):1429 (1990)). It is thought that one of the modes of action by which this lipopolysaccharide binding protein functions is by forming high-affinity complexes with lipopolysaccharide, that then bind to macrophages and monocytes, inducing the secretion of tumor necrosis factor. Dziarski and Gupta (See Dziarski et al., JBC, 269(3): 2100 (1994)) demonstrated that a 70 kDa receptor protein present on the surface of mouse lymphocytes served to bind heparin, heparinoids, bacterial lipoteichoic acids, peptidoglycan, and lipopolysaccharides. Recently, Dziarski et al. demonstrated that the CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein present on the surface of macrophage and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, bound peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide.","Furthermore, the binding affinity of CD14 for lipopolysaccharide was significantly increased in the presence of a LPS-binding protein present in plasma. It is thought that the LPS-binding protein functions as a transfer molecule, whereby it binds LPS and presents it to the CD14 receptor (See Dziarski et al., JBC, 273(15): 8680 (1998)). Yoshida et al. isolated a peptidoglycan binding protein from the hemolymph of the Silkworm, , using column chromatography. This protein was found to have a very specific affinity for peptidoglycan (See Yoshida et al., JBC, 271(23): 13854 (1996)).","Additionally, Kang et al. recently cloned a peptidoglycan binding protein from the moth . The peptidoglycan binding protein was shown to bind strongly to insoluble peptidoglycan (See Kang et al., PNAS, 95(17): 10078 (1998)). In this study the peptidoglycan binding protein was upregulated by a bacterial infection in . The insect immune system is regarded as a model for innate immunity. Thus, Kang et al were able to gene both mouse and human homologs of the peptidoglycan binding protein. All of these peptidoglycan binding proteins shared regions of homology, as well as four conserved cysteine residues which may function in the tertiary structure of the protein, possibly in helping to form binding domains. Given that peptidoglycan is an integral component of bacterial cell walls, and that it induces many physiological responses from cytokine secretion to inflammation and macrophage activation, it appears as if this family of proteins is a ubiquitous group involved in the binding and recognition of peptidoglycan, the presentation of antigens (e.g., cell wall components, etc.), and the activation of the immune system, such as the secretion of cytokines, such as TNF. TNF is noted for its pro-inflammatory actions which result in tissue injury, such as induction of procoagulant activity on vascular endothelial cells (Pober, J. S. et al., J. Immunol. 136:1680 (1986)), increased adherence of neutrophils and lymphocytes (Pober, J. S. et al., J. Immunol. 138:3319 (1987)), and stimulation of the release of platelet activating factor from macrophages, neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells (Camussi, G. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1390 (1987)).","Recent evidence implicates TNF in the pathogenesis of many infections (Cerami, A. et al., Immunol. Today 9:28 (1988)), immune disorders, neoplastic pathology, e.g., in cachexia accompanying some malignancies (Oliff, A. et al., Cell 50:555 (1987)), and in autoimmune pathologies and graft-versus host pathology (Piguet, P.-F. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1280 (1987)). The association of TNF with cancer and infectious pathologies is often related to the host's catabolic state. A major problem in cancer patients is weight loss, usually associated with anorexia. The extensive wasting which results is known as \u201ccachexia\u201d (Kern, K. A. et al. J. Parent. Enter. Nutr. 12:286-298 (1988)). Cachexia includes progressive weight loss, anorexia, and persistent erosion of body mass in response to a malignant growth. The cachectic state is thus associated with significant morbidity and is responsible for the majority of cancer mortality.","A number of studies have suggested that TNF is an important mediator of the cachexia in cancer, infectious pathology, and in other catabolic states. TNF is thought to play a central role in the pathophysiological consequences of Gram-negative sepsis and endotoxic shock (Michie, H. R. et al., Br. J. Surg. 76:670-671 (1989); Debets, J. M. H. et al., Second Vienna Shock Forum, p. 463-466 (1989); Simpson, S. Q. et al., Crit. Care Clin. 5:27-47 (1989)), including fever, malaise, anorexia, and cachexia. Endotoxin is a potent monocyte\/macrophage activator which stimulates production and secretion of TNF (Kornbluth, S. K. et al., J. Immunol. 137:2585-2591 (1986)) and other cytokines. Because TNF could mimic many biological effects of endotoxin, it was concluded to be a central mediator responsible for the clinical manifestations of endotoxin-related illness. TNF and other monocyte-derived cytokines mediate the metabolic and neurohormonal responses to endotoxin (Michie, H. R. et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 318:1481-1486 (1988)). Endotoxin administration to human volunteers produces acute illness with flu-like symptoms including fever, tachycardia, increased metabolic rate and stress hormone release (Revhaug, A. et al., Arch. Surg. 123:162-170 (1988)). Elevated levels of circulating TNF have also been found in patients suffering from Gram-negative sepsis (Waage, A. et al., Lancet 1:355-357 (1987); Hammerle, A. F. et al., Second Vienna Shock Forum p. 715-718 (1989); Debets, J. M. H. et al., Crit. Care Med. 17:489-497 (1989); Calandra, T. et al., J. Infec. Dis. 161:982-987 (1990)). Passive immunotherapy directed at neutralizing TNF may have a beneficial effect in Gram-negative sepsis and endotoxemia, based on the increased TNF production and elevated TNF levels in these pathology states, as discussed above.","Antibodies to a \u201cmodulator\u201d material which was characterized as cachectin (later found to be identical to TNF) were disclosed by Cerami et al. (EPO Patent Publication 0,212,489, Mar. 4, 1987). Such antibodies were said to be useful in diagnostic immunoassays and in therapy of shock in bacterial infections. Rubin et al. (EPO Patent Publication 0,218,868, Apr. 22, 1987) disclosed monoclonal antibodies to human TNF, the hybridomas secreting such antibodies, methods of producing such antibodies, and the use of such antibodies in immunoassay of TNF. Yone et al. (EPO Patent Publication 0,288,088, Oct. 26, 1988) disclosed anti-TNF antibodies, including mnAbs, and their utility in immunoassay diagnosis of pathologies, in particular Kawasaki's pathology and bacterial infection. The body fluids of patients with Kawasaki's pathology (infantile acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; Kawasaki, T., Allergy 16:178 (1967); Kawasaki, T., Shonica (Pediatrics) 26:935 (1985)) were said to contain elevated TNF levels which were related to progress of the pathology (Yone et al., supra).","Accordingly, there is a need to provide molecules that are involved in pathological conditions. Such novel proteins could be useful in augmenting the immune system in such areas as immune recognition, antigen presentation, and immune system activation. Antibodies or antagonists directed against these proteins is useful in reducing or eliminating disorders associated with TNF and TNF-like cytokines, such as endotoxic shock and auto-immune disorders, for example.","The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a member of the novel peptidoglycan recognition binding protein family and has been termed human tag7. This identification has been made as a result of amino acid sequence homology to the mouse tag7 (See Genbank Accession No. emb|CAA60133).","The translation product of this gene also shares sequence homology with antimicrobial BGP-A, a bovine antimicrobial peptide from bovine neutrophils. Preferred polypeptides of this invention comprise residues 184 to 196 shown in SEQ ID NO: 36. This polypeptide is believed to be the active mature form of the translation product of this gene.","Preferred polypeptides of the present invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, one, two, three, four, five, or all five of the immunogenic epitopes shown in SEQ ID NO: 36 as residues: Ala-63 to Asn-68, Ala-71 to Gln-81, Tyr-135 to Thr-141, Leu-167 to Gln-174, and\/or Pro-191 to Pro-196.

The polynucleotide contains an open reading frame encoding the htag7 polypeptide of 198 amino acids. htag7 exhibits a high degree of homology at the amino acid level to the mouse tag7 (as shown in ). The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding the htag7 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:36). The nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:18) was obtained by sequencing a cloned cDNA (HCDDP40), which was deposited on November 17 at the American Type Culture Collection, and given Accession Number 203484.","The present invention is further directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:18 is intended DNA fragments at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt in length which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments 50-1500 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention, as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or as shown in SEQ ID NO:18. By a fragment at least 20 nt in length, for example, is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:18. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited size, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. Representative examples of htag7 polynucleotide fragments of the invention include, for example, fragments that comprise, or alternatively, consist of, a sequence from about nucleotide 1 to about 50, from about 51 to about 100, from about 101 to about 150, from about 151 to about 200, from about 201 to about 250, from about 251 to about 300, from about 301 to about 350, from about 351 to about 400, from about 401 to about 450, from about 451 to about 500, from about 501 to about 550, from about 551 to about 600, from about 601 to about 650, from about 651 to about 700, from about 701 to about 726, and from about 130 to about 379 of SEQ ID NO:18, or the complementary strand thereto, or the cDNA contained in the deposited gene. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini.","Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid molecules encoding a member selected from the group: a polypeptide comprising or alternatively, consisting of, the PGRP-like domain (amino acid residues from about 34 to about 117 in  (amino acids from about 34 to about 117 in SEQ ID NO:36). Since the location of these domains have been predicted by computer analysis, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define each domain. As indicated, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode a htag7 polypeptide may include, but are not limited to those encoding the amino acid sequence of the PGRP-like domain of the polypeptide, by itself; and the coding sequence for the PGRP-like domain of the polypeptide and additional sequences, such as a pre-, or pro or prepro-protein sequence. In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of htag7.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions of htag7. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of htag7 set forth in  and\/or Table XII, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table XII can be used to determine regions of htag7 which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table XII, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table XII). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table XII include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table XII, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, modulate cellular interaction, or signalling pathways, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened htag7 muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an htag7 mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six htag7 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the htag7 amino acid sequence shown in , up to the proline residue at position number 191 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.

For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of infected tissues and the immune system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. immune, hematopoietic, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","Based on the sequence similarity to the mouse tag7 and the PGRP-like domain, translation product of this gene is expected to share at least some biological activities with tag7 proteins, and specifically cytokine modulatory proteins. Such activities are known in the art, some of which are described elsewhere herein. Specifically, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are also useful for modulating the differentiation of normal and malignant cells, modulating the proliferation and\/or differentiation of cancer and neoplastic cells, such as chondrosarcomas, and modulating the immune response. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may represent a diagnostic marker for hematopoietic and immune diseases and\/or disorders. The full-length protein should be a secreted protein, based upon homology to the tag7 protein. Therefore, it is secreted into serum, urine, or feces and thus the levels is assayable from patient samples. Assuming specific expression levels are reflective of the presence of immune disorders, this protein would provide a convenient diagnostic for early detection. In addition, expression of this gene product may also be linked to the progression of immune diseases, and therefore may itself actually represent a therapeutic or therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer.","Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and cellular transformation, particularly those of the immune and hematopoietic systems. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may also be involved in the pathogenesis of developmental abnormalities based upon its potential effects on proliferation and differentiation of cells and tissue cell types. Due to the potential proliferating and differentiating activity of said polynucleotides and polypeptides, the invention is useful as a therapeutic agent in inducing tissue regeneration, for treating inflammatory conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, etc.).","Moreover, the invention is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in rapidly proliferating cells and tissue cell types, particularly in adenocarcinoma cells, and other cancers. The translation product of this gene shares sequence homology with Tag7, which is a mouse cytokine that, in soluble form, triggers apoptosis in mouse L929 cells in vitro.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 9","This invention relates to newly identified polynucleotides, polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides, the use of such polynucleotides and polypeptides, as well as the production of such polynucleotides and polypeptides. The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a human butyrophilin homolog derived from a human testes tumor cDNA library. The polypeptide of the present invention is sometimes hereafter referred to as \u201cButyrophlin and B7-like IgG superfamily receptor\u201d, and\/or \u201cBBIR II\u201d. The invention also relates to inhibiting the action of such polypeptides.","Butyrophilin is a glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is secreted in association with the milk-fat-globule membrane from mammary epithelial cells. The butyrophilin gene appears to have evolved from a subset of genes in the immunoglobulin superfamily and genes encoding the B30.2 domain, which is conserved in a family of zinc-finger proteins. Furthermore, expression analysis of butyrophilin genes has shown that butyrophilin expression increases during lactation in conjunction with an increase in milk fat content. These results suggest that the stage-specific expression of milk fat globule membrane glycoproteins in mammary epithelial cells is regulated in a similar but not necessarily identical mechanism to that of a major milk protein, beta-casein.","The polypeptide of the present invention has been putatively identified as a member of the milk fat globule membrane glycoprotein family, and more particularly the butyrophilin family, and has been termed Butyrophlin and B7-like IgG superfamily receptor (\u201cBBIR II\u201d). This identification has been made as a result of amino acid sequence homology to the bovine butyrophilin precursor (See Genbank Accession No. gi|162773).","Preferred polynucleotides of the invention

Since the location of this form of the protein has been predicted by computer analysis, one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly (e.g., by about 1 to 15 amino acid residues) depending on the criteria used to define this location. In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of BBIR II.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions of BBIR II. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of BBIR II set forth in  and\/or Table VIII, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table VIII can be used to determine regions of BBIR II which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table VIII, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table VIII). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table VIII include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table VIII, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened BBIR II muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an BBIR II mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six BBIR II amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the BBIR II amino acid sequence shown in , up to the cystein residue at position number 313 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.

In another embodiment, N-terminal deletions of the BBIR II polypeptide can be described by the general formula n2-318, where n2 is a number from 2 to 313, corresponding to the position of amino acid identified in . N-terminal deletions of the BBIR II polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:37 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: N-terminal deletions of the BBIR II polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:37 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: A-2 to T-318;

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities (e.g., ability to illicit mitogenic activity, induce differentiation of normal or malignant cells, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened BBIR II mutein to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an BBIR II mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six BBIR II amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the BBIR II polypeptide shown in , up to the serine residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-ml of , where ml is an integer from 6 to 318 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in . Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the BBIR II polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:37 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues M-1 to P-317; M-1 to F-316; M-1 to L-315; M-1 to A-314; M-1 to C-313; M-1 to P-312; M-1 to S-311; M-1 to P-310; M-1 to F-309; M-1 to S-308; M-1 to W-307; M-1 to P-306; M-1 to N-305; M-1 to P-304; M-1 to G-303; M-1 to K-302; M-1 to K-301; M-1 to L-300; M-1 to T-299; M-1 to T-298; M-1 to S-297; M-1 to G-296; M-1 to G-295; M-1 to S-294; M-1 to I-293; M-1 to Q-292; M-1 to L-291; M-1 to L-290; M-1 to S-289; M-1 to H-288; M-1 to P-287; M-1 to K-286; M-1 to E-285; M-1 to V-284; M-1 to F-283; M-1 to H-282; M-1 to V-281; M-1 to E-280; M-1 to G-279; M-1 to L-278; M-1 to 1-277; M-1 to Q-276; M-1 to L-275; M-1 to K-274; M-1 to L-273; M-1 to T-272; M-1 to G-271; M-1 to M-270; M-1 to V-269; M-1 to L-268; M-1 to K-267; M-1 to A-266; M-1 to R-265; M-1 to C-264; M-1 to P-263; M-1 to G-262; M-1 to V-261; M-1 to P-260; M-1 to R-259; M-1 to L-258; M-1 to 1-257; M-1 to Y-256; M-1 to F-255; M-1 to D-254; M-1 to M-253; M-1 to F-252; M-1 to S-251; M-1 to L-250; M-1 to S-249; M-1 to P-248; M-1 to F-247; M-1 to S-246; M-1 to D-245; M-1 to Y-244; M-1 to 1-243; M-1 to H-242; M-1 to S-241; M-1 to S-240; M-1 to S-239; M-1 to Y-238; M-1 to K-237; M-1 to R-236; M-1 to K-235; M-1 to G-234; M-1 to A-233; M-1 to Q-232; M-1 to G-231; M-1 to H-230; M-1 to K-229; M-1 to R-228; M-1 to R-227; M-1 to W-226; M-1 to D-225; M-1 to G-224; M-1 to I-223; M-1 to Q-222; M-1 to V-221; M-1 to R-220; M-1 to S-219; M-1 to E-218; M-1 to V-217; M-1 to E-216; M-1 to R-215; M-1 to S-214; M-1 to L-213; M-1 to H-212; M-1 to A-211; M-1 to H-210; M-1 to R-209; M-1 to M-208; M-1 to S-207; M-1 to C-206; M-1 to S-205; M-1 to 1-204; M-1 to S-203; M-1 to G-202; M-1 to A-201; M-1 to N-200; M-1 to E-199; M-1 to Q-198; M-1 to V-197; M-1 to T-196; M-1 to L-195; M-1 to S-194; M-1 to I-193; M-1 to E-192; M-1 to V-191; M-1 to D-190; M-1 to F-189; M-1 to L-188; M-1 to G-187; M-1 to H-186; M-1 to M-185; M-1 to D-184; M-1 to R-183; M-1 to N-182; M-1 to T-181; M-1 to R-180; M-1 to S-179; M-1 to D-178; M-1 to T-177; M-1 to S-176; M-1 to L-175; M-1 to D-174; M-1 to Q-173; M-1 to G-172; M-1 to Q-171; M-1 to P-170; M-1 to G-169; M-1 to K-168; M-1 to W-167; M-1 to K-166; M-1 to A-165; M-1 to T-164; M-1 to P-163; M-1 to R-162; M-1 to P-161; M-1 to F-160; M-1 to W-159; M-1 to G-158; M-1 to S-157; M-1 to S-156; M-1 to Q-155; M-1 to C-154; M-1 to L-153; M-1 to L-152; M-1 to Q-151; M-1 to I-150; M-1 to D-149; M-1 to R-148; M-1 to D-147; M-1 to V-146; M-1 to Y-145; M-1 to G-144; M-1 to A-143; M-1 to I-142; M-1 to S-141; M-1 to I-140; M-1 to L-139; M-1 to P-138; M-1 to V-137; M-1 to S-136; M-1 to G-135; M-1 to L-134; M-1 to A-133; M-1 to S-132; M-1 to V-131; M-1 to Q-130; M-1 to L-129; M-1 to E-128; M-1 to W-127; M-1 to I-126; M-1 to A-125; M-1 to K-124; M-1 to Q-123; M-1 to Y-122; M-1 to Y-121; M-1 to S-120; M-1 to Q-119; M-1 to S-118; M-1 to S-117; M-1 to I-116; M-1 to R-115; M-1 to C-114; M-1 to G-113; M-1 to Y-112; M-1 to L-111; M-1 to G-110; M-1 to A-109; M-1 to D-108; M-1 to L-107; M-1 to V-106; M-1 to T-105; M-1 to I-104; M-1 to N-103; M-1 to E-102; M-1 to L-101; M-1 to R-100; M-1 to L-99; M-1 to S-98; M-1 to I-97; M-1 to R-96; M-1 to G-95; M-1 to E-94; M-1 to A-93; M-1 to 1-92; M-1 to S-91; M-1 to D-90; M-1 to K-89; M-1 to V-88; M-1 to L-87; M-1 to K-86; M-1 to T-85; M-1 to R-84; M-1 to G-83; M-1 to Q-82; M-1 to Y-81; M-1 to Q-80; M-1 to P-79; M-1 to M-78; M-1 to Q-77; M-1 to M-76; M-1 to F-75; M-1 to P-74; M-1 to Q-73; M-1 to D-72; M-1 to K-71; M-1 to G-70; M-1 to D-69; M-1 to R-68; M-1 to Y-67; M-1 to L-66; M-1 to H-65; M-1 to V-64; M-1 to V-63; M-1 to S-62; M-1 to S-61; M-1 to F-60; M-1 to Q-59; M-1 to G-58; M-1 to R-57; M-1 to F-56; M-1 to F-55; M-1 to R-54; M-1 to V-53; M-1 to E-52; M-1 to M-51; M-1 to A-50; M-1 to E-49; M-1 to A-48; M-1 to N-47; M-1 to T-46; M-1 to K-45; M-1 to P-44; M-1 to S-43; M-1 to L-42; M-1 to F-41; M-1 to C-40; M-1 to S-39; M-1 to F-38; M-1 to A-37; M-1 to A-36; M-1 to D-35; M-1 to E-34; M-1 to G-33; M-1 to V-32; M-1 to L-31; M-1 to A-30; M-1 to Q-29; M-1 to V-28; M-1 to P-27; M-1 to K-26; M-1 to D-25; M-1 to P-24; M-1 to G-23; M-1 to F-22; M-1 to V-21; M-1 to Q-20; M-1 to W-19; M-1 to Q-18; M-1 to G-17; M-1 to S-16; M-1 to G-15; M-1 to L-14; M-1 to K-13; M-1 to L-12; M-1 to L-11; M-1 to S-10; M-1 to L-9; M-1 to V-8; M-1 to L-7; M-1 to S-6; of SEQ ID NO:37. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides.

Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In addition, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules having nucleotide sequences related to extensive portions of SEQ ID NO:19 which have been determined from the following related cDNA genes: HTTDB46R (SEQ ID NO:122), and HSIEA44R (SEQ ID NO:123).","A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is obtained from human small intestine, colon tumor, and human testes tumor cells and tissues. The polynucleotide of this invention was discovered in a human testes tumor cDNA library.","Based on the sequence similarity to the bovin butyrophilin precursor, translation product of this gene is expected to share at least some biological activities with B30.2-like domain containing proteins, and specifically butyrophilin proteins. Such activities are known in the art, some of which are described elsewhere herein. Specifically, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are also useful for modulating the differentiation of normal and malignant cells, modulating the proliferation and\/or differentiation of cancer and neoplastic cells, and regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may represent a diagnostic marker for breast diseases and\/or disorders, in addition to disorders of secretory organs and tissues (which include, testicular and gastrointestinal disorders, particularly those cells which serve secretory functions for seminal fluid or gastrointestinal hormones, and disorders of the mucosal membranes of such cells and tissues, etc.).","The full-length protein should be a secreted protein, based upon homology to the butyrophilin family of proteins. Therefore, it is secreted into milk, serum, urine, seminal fluid, or feces and thus the levels is assayable from patient samples. Assuming specific expression levels are reflective of the presence of breast disorders (i.e., breast cancer, breast dysfunction, etc.) this protein would provide a convenient diagnostic for early detection of such disorders","In addition, expression of this gene product may also be linked to the progression of breast diseases, and therefore may itself actually represent a therapeutic or therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human cancers and cellular transformation, particularly those of secretory cells and tissues. Polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention may also be involved in the pathogenesis of developmental abnormalities based upon its potential effects on proliferation and differentiation of cells and tissue cell types.","Due to the potential proliferating and differentiating activity of said polynucleotides and polypeptides, the invention is useful as a therapeutic agent in inducing tissue regeneration, for treating inflammatory conditions. Moreover, the invention is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in rapidly proliferating cells and tissue cell types, particularly in cancers. The invention, including agonists and\/or antagonists thereof, is useful in modulating the nutritional value of milk, its caloric content, its fat content, and may conceivably be useful in mediating the adaptation of breast secretory function as a delivery vehicle for therapeutics (i.e., transgenic breast secretory tissue for transferring therapeutically active proteins to infants).","Alternatively, the expression within cellular sources marked by proliferating cells indicates this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis, treatment, and\/or prevention of developmental diseases and disorders, including cancer, and other proliferative conditions. Representative uses are described in the \u201cHyperproliferative Disorders\u201d and \u201cRegeneration\u201d sections below and elsewhere herein. Briefly, developmental tissues rely on decisions involving cell differentiation and\/or apoptosis in pattern formation.","Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).","Alternatively, this gene product is involved in the pattern of cellular proliferation that accompanies early embryogenesis. Thus, aberrant expression of this gene product in tissues\u2014particularly adult tissues\u2014may correlate with patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, such as found in various cancers. Because of potential roles in proliferation and differentiation, this gene product may have applications in the adult for tissue regeneration and the treatment of cancers. It may also act as a morphogen to control cell and tissue type specification. Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are useful in treating, detecting, and\/or preventing said disorders and conditions, in addition to other types of degenerative conditions. Thus this protein may modulate apoptosis or tissue differentiation and is useful in the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of degenerative or proliferative conditions and diseases. The protein is useful in modulating the immune response to aberrant polypeptides, as may exist in proliferating and cancerous cells and tissues. The protein can also be used to gain new insight into the regulation of cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","This gene is expressed primarily in small intestine, colon tumor, and to a lesser extent in human testes tumor cells.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, gastrointestinal diseases and\/or disorders, in addition to lactation disorders, and tumors of the testes. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune and reproductive systems, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. immune, testicular, gastrointestinal, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g. lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 10","The translation product of this gene contains a serine protease motif and accordingly is believed to possess serine protease activity. Assays for determining such activity are well known in the art. Preferred polypeptides of this invention possess such activity.","Included in this invention as preferred domains are serine protease histidine active site domains, which were identified using the ProSite analysis tool (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). The catalytic activity of the serine proteases from the trypsin family is provided by a charge relay system involving an aspartic acid residue hydrogen-bonded to a histidine, which itself is hydrogen-bonded to a serine. The sequences in the vicinity of the active site serine and histidine residues are well conserved in this family of proteases [1]. Consensus pattern: [LIVM]-[ST]-A-[STAG]-H-C, H is the active site residue.","Preferred polypeptides of the invention comprise, or alternatively consist of, the following amino acid sequence: GTLVAEKHVLTAAHClHDGKTYVKGTQ (SEQ ID NO:124). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Further preferred are polypeptides comprising the serine protease histidine active site domain of the sequence referenced in Table XIV for this gene, and at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, or 75 additional contiguous amino acid residues of this referenced sequence. The additional contiguous amino acid residues is N-terminal or C-terminal to the serine protease histidine active site domain.","Alternatively, the additional contiguous amino acid residues is both N-terminal and C-terminal to the serine protease histidine active site domain, wherein the total N- and C-terminal contiguous amino acid residues equal the specified number. The above preferred polypeptide domain is characteristic of a signature specific to serine protease proteins. Based on the sequence similarity, the translation product of this gene is expected to share at least some biological activities with serine proteases. Such activities are known in the art, some of which are described elsewhere herein.","In another embodiment, polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of the open reading frame upstream of the predicted signal peptide are contemplated by the present invention.

In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of the corresponding protein.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of the protein set forth in  and\/or Table IX, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table IX can be used to determine regions of the protein which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table IX, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table IX). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table IX include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table IX, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence shown in , up to the aspartic acid residue at position number 370 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities such as ability to modulate the extracellular matrix, etc.) may still be retained. For example the ability to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in , up to the glycine residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-m1 of , where m1 is an integer from 6 to 375 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in .

Accordingly, polynucleotides related to this invention are useful as a marker in linkage analysis for chromosome 12.","This gene is expressed primarily in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and osteoblasts, and to a lesser extent in brain, heart, placental tissues, lung, and many other tissues. Moreover, the transcript is present in HUVEC, HUVEC+LPS, smooth muscle, fibroblasts; present in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, colon and weakly in PBLs.","Northern analysis indicates that this gene is expressed highest in HUVEC, HUVEC+LPS, smooth muscle, fibroblasts, present in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, colon and weakly in PBLs.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, disorders of vascularized tissues. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the vascular tissues, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. vascular, skeletal, developmental, neural, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, immune, hematopoietic, reproductive, gastrointestinal, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, seminal, fluid, amniotic fluid, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution in the vascularized endothelial cells indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of vascularized tissues, such as atherosclerosis, ataxia malabsortion, and hyperlipidemia. These and other factors often result in other cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, translation product of this gene is useful for the treatment of wounds, and may facilitate the wound healing process. Moreover, the protein is useful in the detection, treatment, and\/or prevention of a variety of vascular disorders and conditions, which include, but are not limited to miscrovascular disease, vascular leak syndrome, aneurysm, stroke, embolism, thrombosis, coronary artery disease, arteriosclerosis, and\/or atherosclerosis. Based upon the tissue distribution of this protein, antagonists directed against this protein is useful in blocking the activity of this protein. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene.","Also provided is a kit for detecting tumors in which expression of this protein occurs. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting these tumors in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene to a bodily fluid from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:20 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 1685 of SEQ ID NO:20, b is an integer of 15 to 1699, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:20, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 11","Translation products corresponding to this gene share sequence homology with Cytotoxic-Regulatory T-Cell Associated Molecule (CRTAM) protein, which is thought to be important in the regulation of celluar physiology, development, differentiation or function of various cell types, including haematopoietic cells and various T-cell progenitors. See for example, International Publication No. WO 96\/34102 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Moreover, translation products corresponding to this gene also share sequence homology with the thymocyte activation and developmental protein and the class-I MHC-restricted T cell associated molecule (See Genbank Accession Nos. gi|2665790, gb|AAB88491.1, gb|AAC80267.1, and gi|3930163; all information and references contained within these accessions are hereby incorporated herein by reference).

In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of the corresponding protein.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of the protein set forth in  and\/or Table X, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table X can be used to determine regions of the protein which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table X, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table X). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table X include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table X, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence shown in , up to the threonine residue at position number 359 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n1-364 of , where n1 is an integer from 2 to 359 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in  (which is identical to the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:39).

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides.

Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities such as ability to modulate the extracellular matrix, etc.) may still be retained. For example the ability to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in , up to the leucine residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-m1 of , where m1 is an integer from 6 to 364 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in .

Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In addition, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules having nucleotide sequences related to extensive portions of SEQ ID NO:21 which have been determined from the following related cDNA genes: HSQFJ92R (SEQ ID NO:139), HFLAB18F (SEQ ID NO:140), HAQBH82R (SEQ ID NO:141), HLHTM10R (SEQ ID NO:142), and HLHAL65R (SEQ ID NO:143).","This gene is expressed primarily in immune system related tissues such as ulcerative colitis, rejected kidney tissues, and to a lesser extent in thymus and bone marrow.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, immune and hematopoietic diseases and\/or disorders, particularly ulcerative colitis and rejected organs. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. transplanted kidney, immune, hematopoeitic, renal, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution primarily in immune cells and tissues, combined with the homology to the CRTAM, thymocyte activation and developmental protein, the class-I MHC-restricted T cell associated molecule protein, and the polivirus receptor, indicates that the protein products of this gene are useful for the regulation of celluar physiology, development, differentiation or function of various cell types, including haematopoietic cells and particularly T-cell progenitors. Representative uses are described in the \u201cImmune Activity\u201d and \u201cinfectious disease\u201d sections below, in Example 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, and 27, and elsewhere herein. The proteins can be used to develop products for the diagnosis and treatment of conditions associated with abnormal physiology or development, including abnormal proliferation, e.g. cancers, or degenerative conditions. The physiology or development of a cell can be modulated by contacting the cell with an agonist or antagonist (i.e. an anti-CRTAM-like peptide antibody). Further the CRTAM-like polypeptides of the present invention include treatment of ulcerative colitis, organ rejection and other immune system related disorders. Agonists or antagonists may treat or prevent such disorders as ulcerative colitis and rejected organs, such as kidney. Based upon the tissue distribution of this protein, antagonists directed against this protein is useful in blocking the activity of this protein. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene.","Also provided is a kit for detecting tumors in which expression of this protein occurs. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting these tumors in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene to a bodily fluid from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:21 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 1506 of SEQ ID NO:21, b is an integer of 15 to 1520, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:21, and where b is greater than or equal to a+14.","Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 12",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0409","num":"0408"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0410","num":"0409"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0411","num":"0410"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},"The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:40), which was determined by sequencing a cloned cDNA. The nucleotide sequence shown in  (SEQ ID NO:22) was obtained by sequencing a cloned cDNA (HPWCM76), which was deposited on Nov. 17, 1998 at the American Type Culture Collection, and given Accession Number 203484. The deposited gene is inserted in the pSport plasmid (LIFE TECHNOLOGIES\u2122, Rockville, Md.) using the SalI\/NotI restriction endonuclease cleavage sites.","The present invention is further directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:22 is intended DNA fragments at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt in length which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments 50-1500 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention, as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA or as shown in SEQ ID NO:22.

Representative examples of polynucleotide fragments of the invention include, for example, fragments that comprise, or alternatively, consist of, a sequence from about nucleotide 1 to about 50, from about 51 to about 100, from about 101 to about 150, from about 151 to about 200, from about 201 to about 250, from about 251 to about 300, from about 301 to about 350, from about 351 to about 400, from about 401 to about 450, from about 451 to about 500, and from about 501 to about 550, and from about 551 to about 600, from about 601 to about 650, from about 651 to about 700, from about 701 to about 750, from about 751 to about 800, from about 801 to about 807 of SEQ ID NO:22, or the complementary strand thereto, or the cDNA contained in the deposited gene. In this context \u201cabout\u201d includes the particularly recited ranges, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. In additional embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of the corresponding protein.","Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions (\u201calpha-regions\u201d), beta-sheet and beta-sheet forming regions (\u201cbeta-regions\u201d), turn and turn-forming regions (\u201cturn-regions\u201d), coil and coil-forming regions (\u201ccoil-regions\u201d), hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions and high antigenic index regions. The data representing the structural or functional attributes of the protein set forth in  and\/or Table XI, as described above, was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA*STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment, the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and XIV of Table XI can be used to determine regions of the protein which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII, IX, XIII, and\/or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.","Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in , but may, as shown in Table XI, be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA*STAR computer algorithm used to generate  (set on the original default parameters) was used to present the data in  in a tabular format (See Table XI). The tabular format of the data in  is used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region. The above-mentioned preferred regions set out in  and in Table XI include, but are not limited to, regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in . As set out in  and in Table XI, such preferred regions include Garnier-Robson alpha-regions, beta-regions, turn-regions, and coil-regions, Chou-Fasman alpha-regions, beta-regions, and turn-regions, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilic regions and Hopp-Woods hydrophobic regions, Eisenberg alpha- and beta-amphipathic regions, Karplus-Schulz flexible regions, Jameson-Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface-forming regions. Even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities, ability to multimerize, etc.) may still be retained. For example, the ability of shortened muteins to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted N-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequence shown in , up to the arginine residue at position number 61 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n1-66 of , where n1 is an integer from 2 to 61 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in  (which is identical to the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:40).

Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","Also as mentioned above, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other functional activities (e.g., biological activities such as ability to modulate the extracellular matrix, etc.) may still be retained. For example the ability to induce and\/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a mutein with a large number of deleted C-terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact, peptides composed of as few as six amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.","Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide shown in , up to the leucine residue at position number 6, and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular, the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1-m1 of , where m1 is an integer from 6 to 66 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in . Moreover, the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising, or alternatively consisting of, the amino acid sequence of C-terminal deletions of the polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO:40 include polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues: M-1 to E-65; M-1 to W-64; M-1 to P-63; M-1 to F-62; M-1 to R-61; M-1 to M-60; M-1 to S-59; M-1 to N-58; M-1 to C-57; M-1 to S-56; M-1 to F-55; M-1 to P-54; M-1 to D-53; M-1 to L-52; M-1 to I-51; M-1 to S-50; M-1 to C-49; M-1 to Q-48; M-1 to V-47; M-1 to S-46; M-1 to F-45; M-1 to C-44; M-1 to C-43; M-1 to C-42; M-1 to R-41; M-1 to S-40; M-1 to S-39; M-1 to P-38; M-1 to Y-37; M-1 to P-36; M-1 to L-35; M-1 to F-34; M-1 to F-33; M-1 to S-32; M-1 to N-31; M-1 to L-30; M-1 to L-29; M-1 to S-28; M-1 to F-27; M-1 to S-26; M-1 to T-25; M-1 to E-24; M-1 to G-23; M-1 to S-22; M-1 to I-21; M-1 to F-20; M-1 to S-19; M-1 to S-18; M-1 to F-17; M-1 to W-16; M-1 to S-15; M-1 to L-14; M-1 to A-13; M-1 to M-12; M-1 to C-11; M-1 to L-10; M-1 to L-9; M-1 to H-8; M-1 to K-7; M-1 to L-6; of SEQ ID NO:40. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention, as are antibodies that bind one or more of these polypeptides. Moreover, fragments and variants of these polypeptides (e.g., fragments as described herein, polypeptides at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to these polypeptides and polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotide which hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotide encoding these polypeptides, or the complement thereof) are encompassed by the invention. Antibodies that bind these fragments and variants of the invention are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these fragments and variants are also encompassed by the invention.","In addition, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules having nucleotide sequences related to extensive portions of SEQ ID NO:22 which have been determined from the following related cDNA genes: HPWCM76R (SEQ ID NO:147).","This gene is expressed primarily in prostate BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) tissue.","Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, including antibodies, are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, inflammation of the prostate, or related tissues. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the prostate, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels is routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g. prostate, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder.","The tissue distribution in prostate BPH tissue indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions which result in an enlargement of the prostate, or related tissues. Polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of conditions concerning proper testicular function (e.g. endocrine function, sperm maturation), as well as cancer. Therefore, this gene product is useful in the treatment of male infertility and\/or impotence. This gene product is also useful in assays designed to identify binding agents, as such agents (antagonists) are useful as male contraceptive agents. Similarly, the protein is believed to be useful in the treatment and\/or diagnosis of testicular cancer. The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that is expressed, particularly at low levels, in other tissues of the body. Therefore, this gene product is expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflammation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications. Based upon the tissue distribution of this protein, antagonists directed against this protein is useful in blocking the activity of this protein. Accordingly, preferred are antibodies which specifically bind a portion of the translation product of this gene.","Also provided is a kit for detecting tumors in which expression of this protein occurs. Such a kit comprises in one embodiment an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene bound to a solid support. Also provided is a method of detecting these tumors in an individual which comprises a step of contacting an antibody specific for the translation product of this gene to a bodily fluid from the individual, preferably serum, and ascertaining whether antibody binds to an antigen found in the bodily fluid. Preferably the antibody is bound to a solid support and the bodily fluid is serum. The above embodiments, as well as other treatments and diagnostic tests (kits and methods), are more particularly described elsewhere herein.","Shared homology to the FAP protein indicates that the protein product of this gene is useful in treating, detecting, and\/or preventing iron metabolism disorders, particularly those resulting in high oxidative states, tissue damage, athersclerosis, free radical damage, vascular disorders, iron binding protein dysfunction, nitric oxide synthase dysfunction or aberration, vasodilation disorders, and tissue edema. Based on the sequence similarity, the translation product of this gene is expected to share at least some biological activities with iron metabolism modulatory proteins. Such activities are known in the art, some of which are described elsewhere herein. Furthermore, the protein may also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions, in addition to its use as a nutritional supplement. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and\/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues.","Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:22 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a\u2212b, where a is any integer between 1 to 793 of SEQ ID NO:22, b is an integer of 15 to 807, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:22, and where b is greater than or equal to
