The device may output the second video content at the second zoom level.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","128","122","110","104","106","108","110","112","116","118","146","114","146","112","122","120","138","136","118","134","130","132","148"]},"In some examples, video content processor  may be in communication with a memory . Memory  may be adapted to store video content  and\/or an associated category . Video content processor  may be configured to send video content  to content output device . Video content  may be assigned to a category by a content author that stored video content  in memory . In some examples, video content processor  may be a web server configured to send video content  in the form of a web page. In these examples, category  may relate to an amount of content on a particular page as selected by the content author. In some examples, video content processor  may host a mobile device application or \u201capp\u201d store such as may be used by a mobile device like a mobile phone, or tablet computer. In these examples, video content  may be an output of the mobile device application and category  may relate to a type of application such as work productivity, games, social media, etc. In some examples, processor  may act as an application launcher when video content  is an application.","In an example, content output device  may be configured to receive a request from a user  for first video content . Content output device  may be configured to send request  over network  to video content processor . Video content processor  may be configured to send a query , based on request , to memory . In response to query , memory  may send video content  and the associated category  to video content processor . Video content processor  may be configured to send video content  and category  to content output device . For example, first video content  may be a web page or output of a mobile device application.","Processor  may be configured to receive a zoom selection  from user . Zoom selection  may indicate a desired zoom level for first video content . Zoom selection  may be, for example, based on a user performing a pinching motion on user interface . In an example, zoom selection  may assign a zoom level to video content associated with a particular category. Zoom level algorithm  may be adapted such that second video content subsequently received by content output device  with the same category as the first video content may be assigned the same zoom level as the first video content. In an example, zoom selection  may assign a zoom level to an identifier associated with the first video content. For example, the identifier may be \u201cXYZ app\u201d. Zoom level algorithm  may be adapted such that second video content subsequently received by content output device  with the same identifier may be assigned the same zoom level as the first video content.","Processor  of content output device  may be configured to control display  to output video content  at a zoom level assigned by zoom level algorithm . In an example, zoom level algorithm  may be adapted to assign a zoom level for particular video content to be output on output device  regardless of the particular category or the particular video content itself. These examples may occur prior to content output device  receiving zoom selection  or where categories and identifiers in received zoom selection  are not the same as categories or identifiers of the particular video content to be output. In some examples, depending on a size of display , the zoom level assigned by zoom level algorithm  may have a different value. For example, if content output device  is a 22 inch monitor, the zoom level may be smaller than if content output device  is a mobile phone with a 4.5 inch display.","Zoom level algorithm  may be adapted to assign a zoom level for video content associated with a particular category. For example, zoom selection  received from user  may include an indication of a desired zoom level for first video content associated with a particular category. Zoom level algorithm  may be adapted to assign the same zoom level for second received video content  associated with the same category as the first video content.","Zoom level algorithm  may be adapted to assign a zoom level for the particular first video content  identified by an identifier. For example, zoom selection  may include an indication of a desired zoom level for the particular first video content based on an identifier. Zoom level algorithm  may be adapted to assign the same zoom level for second received video content  with the same identifier as the first video content.","In an example, processor  may be configured to control display  to output video content  at a default device zoom level based on content output device . The system zoom level may be used, for example, the first time a user uses device  or the first time the particular content is output by device . Based on zoom selection , user  may override the default system zoom level.","After zoom selection , relating to a category or video content identifier, is received by output device  for first video content, processor  may be configured to store zoom selection  in a zoom table . In an example, zoom levels assigned for content output device, category, and video content identifier may be stored in zoom table . In examples where processor  receives a subsequent request  to display second video content, processor  may be configured to analyze table  to determine a zoom level for the second video content based on zoom level algorithm .","In an example, user  may assign a zoom level of 10% for first video content assigned to category JFK. In examples where user  makes a subsequent request to output second video content , processor  may be configured to determine a category associated with the second video content. If the category associated with the second video content is stored in zoom table , processor  may be configured to control display  to output the second video content at the stored zoom level. In a particular example, if category  relates to electronic books, once user  assigns a zoom level for the category electronic books in zoom selection , processor  may be configured to control display  to output subsequently requested electronic books at the same zoom level.","In examples when processor  is configured to receive request  for output of particular video content , processor  may be configured to request and received video content  and associated category  from video content processor . Processor  may be configured to analyze zoom table . If zoom table  includes a first zoom level assigned for the identifier of the particular video content, processor  may be configured to control display  to output the particular video content at the first zoom level. If zoom table  does not have a zoom level assigned for the identifier of the particular video content, processor  may be configured to analyze zoom table  to determine if a second zoom level is assigned for the category associated with the particular video content. If zoom table  has a second zoom level assigned for the category associated with the particular video content, then processor  may be configured to control display  to output the particular video content at the second zoom level. If zoom table  does not have a zoom level assigned for the category associated with the particular data, then processor  may be configured to control display  to display the particular video content at the device zoom level.","As mentioned above, category  may be assigned by a content author. For example, category  may be assigned as work productivity or a game in examples where video content  is a mobile device application. In examples where video content  is a web page, category  may be assigned as a \u201ccontent page\u201d, or \u201csub-site\u201d or using any other taxonomy desired by a content author. For example, a content author can be provided with guidelines as to how to assign a category based on particular video content. In the web page example, a \u201chome page\u201d category may be a web page corresponding to a particular URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and a \u201csub-site\u201d category may be a web page with limited content, as determined by the content author, and includes links to other web pages. A \u201ccontent\u201d page category may have significant content for reading, again as defined by the content author. The content author can define the categories to associate with each page of a web site, such as in meta-tags on the respective pages, and then user  can define the zoom level for each of those categories.","Zoom level algorithm  may be stored as part of an operating system of content output device . In these examples, zoom level algorithm  may provide kernel level calls to the operating system. Zoom level algorithm  may be stored on top of the operating system of output device  in a user library or application programming interface (API) library call.","Among other potential benefits, a system in accordance with the disclosure may be used to provide a user with a better experience viewing video content. For example, instead of repeatedly zooming in and zooming out of displayed content, the user can define a zoom level that the user desires for categories of content. As different categories may have different levels of text or graphical information, the user may define a zoom level that works better and is more customized for the particular user. The user need not be limited to a zoom level defined by a content author. Applications within each category may have similar levels of graphic and\/or text and may benefit from being output at the same zoom level. In examples where a system includes a mobile device, a system in accordance with the disclosure may optimize the ability view video content where zoom selections may be performed by a pinching motion of the user's fingers. The user need not necessarily adjust a zoom level every time the user launches a new application, re-launches an application, launches a web browser or starts a new application session.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","2","4","6","8","10","12","2"]},"At block S, a content output device may be configured to receive a first request for first video content.

Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure, in addition to those enumerated herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods, reagents, compounds compositions or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.","With respect to the use of substantially any plural and\/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and\/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and\/or application. The various singular\/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d","In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group.","As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as \u201cup to,\u201d \u201cat least,\u201d \u201cgreater than,\u201d \u201cless than,\u201d and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into subranges as discussed above. Finally, as will be understood by one skilled in the art, a range includes each individual member. Thus, for example, a group having 1-3 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, or 3 cells. Similarly, a group having 1-5 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 cells, and so forth.","While various aspects and embodiments have been disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
