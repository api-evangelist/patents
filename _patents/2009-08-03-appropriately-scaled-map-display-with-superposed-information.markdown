{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates to utilizing map displays to present information items that are associated with corresponding geographical locations. In particular, the disclosure relates to methods, apparatuses and systems wherein an appropriately scaled map display is provided along with indications of points thereon that are associated with the respective information items and that includes information content in addition to the location information.","With the proliferation of technology and travel in our lives, maps displayed on electronic displays are becoming a common tool in our lives, such as in connection with travel.","For example, the map application \u201cGoogle Map\u201d allows a user to specify locations of a travel itinerary, and in response to the entered locations, the application provides driving directions as well as a map display that includes the specified locations. Such map display also shows a graphical indication of the proposed route corresponding to the driving directions. Thus, the user can obtain a high level graphical view of the proposed route. An example of such a map display is shown in .","In addition, in the current era of mass consumption, map displays are commonly used to show consumers where they can acquire desired goods and\/or services. Such examples of map display technology are proposed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,379,811 and 7,373,246, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to those skilled therein as of the date of the invention described herein.","In addition, use of a geographical information system (GIS) for collecting location-associated information is becoming more common, such as in connection with surveys of land and other real estate, road repairs, fire and other disasters, etc. As such information is collected, location information, such as generated by a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, is associated with the collected information. Examples of such systems are proposed in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,539,411, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Further, such a system may be coupled to a digital camera which is configured such that pictures captured by the digital camera at a survey site can be uploaded to the GIS and can be associated with other data stored in the GIS in connection with the survey site, to establish a relation between pictures taken by the digital camera and the location information stored in the GIS. Examples of such systems are proposed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,506,644, 5,913,078, 6,160,964, 6,999,112, 7,145,597 and 7,242,791 and U.S. patent application Publications Nos. US 2002\/0191087 A1, US 2003\/0081126 A1, US 2003\/0185549 A1, US 2004\/0174434 A1 and US 2006\/0110154 A1, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to those skilled therein as of the date of the invention described herein.","While a map display is typically an integral component of a GIS system, the map display in a conventional GIS system typically has a set scale that is predetermined or preset (for example, based on stored user settings). However, such a map display based on a predetermined or preset scale inevitably leads the user to perform multiple iterations of zoom in, zoom out, pan, etc., in order to obtain the map view desired by the user.","In accordance with this disclosure, tools (in the form of systems, apparatuses and methods) can be provided that appropriately and automatically scale a map display according to extent of locations associated with respective selected information items. Such tools enable the map display to provide relevant information, when a plurality of items of interest associated with respective known locations are selected.","In an aspect of this disclosure, the selected items are pictures (that is, photographs, artist-generated sketches and renderings, other visual presentations, etc.) and for each specific picture associated with a corresponding geographical location, location information indicating such location is obtained and the picture is tagged with the location information. A scaling factor is determined based on an extent of the locations, as determined based on the location information of the specific pictures, and a map image is scaled according to the scaling factor.","In another aspect, thumbnails of respective pictures are overlaid on the map image, to indicate the locations associated with the respective pictures. For example, the thumbnails displayed on the map image may be reduced-scale images of the respective pictures. In addition, the thumbnails may be associated with hyperlinks to the respective pictures.","The various features and aspects may be included in any of various possible system configurations.","In one example, a terminal is provided with a map display device (for example, a display coupled with a user interface, such as a browser), a map retrieval part and a network communication part. Means is provided for receiving selection of a plurality of pictures (for example, a user interface, the network communication part, an application programming interface, that is, API, etc.). The selection of the pictures may be by user operation through a user interface, or may be an automated (software-implemented) process based on specification of a store or pool of pictures (and the extent determination is executed for all of the pictures in the store or pool that have associated location information). The terminal may have a picture storage device (for example, hard disk, removable storage medium, etc.) storing a plurality of pictures and storing for each specific picture, location information corresponding to a geographical location associated with the specific picture, and the automated process may be performed to, for example, all of the pictures on the medium, all of the pictures in a specific folder or subdirectory, selected pictures, etc. The map retrieval part determines an extent of the locations associated with the respective selected pictures, based on the location information of the selected pictures. A request from the map retrieval part is communicated by the network communication part through a network to a map data source (for example, a server and\/or a map database), to retrieve map data (corresponding to such extent) from the map source device.","In another example, a server apparatus is configured with a network communication part to transmit an application including a location determining part, an extent determining part and a scale determining part through a network to a terminal, in response to a request from the terminal. When the application executes on the terminal, the location determining part determines for each specific one of a plurality of pictures, location information corresponding to a geographical location associated with the specific picture, the extent determining part determines an extent of the locations of the specific pictures, and the scale determining part determines a scaling factor based on the extent determined by the extent determining part, and the application causes map data to be retrieved from a map database (the retrieved map data corresponding to the extent determined by the extent determining part) and causes the map image based on the retrieved map data to be displayed on a display of the terminal.","In another exemplary system configuration, the map source device (for example, server) transmits a map application through the network to a requesting device (for example, a terminal), and the map application executing on the terminal allows the terminal to obtain the map data retrieved by the map retrieval part through the network from a map database (for example, provided by the server, or separately network-connected, or independent from the server).","In another example, the terminal is configured with a network communication part (and perhaps other means) to communicate a request through the network to the map source device and\/or map database directly, without a server or middleware, and receive the map data from the map source device, in response to the request.","In another example, the apparatus for determining an appropriate map display is a standalone device including picture store, location determining part, extent determining part, scale determining part, map database and\/or other map source device (configured to store data for a map, receive a request for data based on the extent determined by the extent determining part, and output the requested map data), and display part. Such standalone device may nevertheless be configured with a network communication part to receive data updates for updating picture data, map data, other data, etc., as well as software or firmware updates, through a network.","In another aspect, any of the above-mentioned apparatuses may further be configured with an image capture device or picture forming device, such as a digital camera, to capture pictures or other images, and at the time that the specific picture or image is formed by the picture forming device or image capture device, the location determining part determines a geographical location of the picture forming device and the specific picture is tagged with the location information. The location information can be included in metadata of the specific picture to tag the specific picture with the location information. Additionally or alternatively, the location information is stamped on the specific picture to tag the specific picture with the location information.","There are many instances in an information processing environment where items of information are associated with corresponding geographical locations, and one can quickly grasp the geographical distribution of items through an appropriate map display. This disclosure provides tools for determining an appropriate map display for a group of selected items. Such tools may be a computer program product and\/or one or more computer programs stored in or on a program storage medium readable by a computer and embodying instructions executable by a computer or computer-like electronic device.","In describing preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the disclosure of this patent specification is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner. In addition, a detailed description of known functions and configurations will be omitted when it may obscure the inventive aspects of this disclosure.","Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views,  shows schematically an example of a system wherein pictures (for example, photographs) are taken by a digital camera, as an imaging device, and each picture is associated (and tagged) with location information (when available) indicating a geographical location at which the picture was taken. It should be appreciated that the digital camera can be replaced by another electronic device, such as a portable or handheld terminal, smartphone, and the like, having a camera or imaging function.","System A illustrated in  includes an apparatus A, a terminal A, a location determining device , map database or data store, and a network .","The apparatus A is indicated in  to be a digital camera, but can be replaced by another electronic device having a camera function, and as discussed further infra, is configured, (as in many electronic devices) to include a processing unit and memory (as well as other storage devices) such that many functionalities can be provided through appropriate programming. For example,  shows that the apparatus A includes a location determining part A, an extent determining part A and a scale determining part A which in combination allow an appropriately scaled map display to be provided.","The location determining part A in the example of  is configured to obtain for each specific picture, location information corresponding to a geographical location associated with the specific picture (although in some instances, location information is not available for that picture). Such location information may be received from, for example, the location determining device A which can be a global positioning system (GPS) receiver or another location determining device (such as using, for example, cellular, or other, triangulation techniques). On the other hand, the picture data in most instances in the system A includes the location information along with the image data. Further, the location information stored with the image data need not be the from the location determining device A, but rather can be user entered location data.","In the system A shown in , the location determining device A is shown to be external to the digital camera . However, it should be appreciated that a location determining device comprised by a GPS receiver on a chip or a board can be integrated in a conventional manner in the digital camera (such as shown in ). Since the know-how to include both a camera function and a GPS receiver in a portable device is now well-known in the art, a detailed discussion of such input\/output and communication is omitted in order to avoid masking the inventive aspects of this disclosure.","The extent determining part A is configured to determine an extent of the locations of the specific pictures, based on the location information of the specific pictures. The scale determining part A is configured to determine a scaling factor based on the extent of the locations determined by the extent determining part, and cause a map image to be scaled according to the scaling factor. Each of the location determining part, extent determining part and scale determining part can be a separate software part or a part of an integrated computer program (such as a plug-in, an application, etc.), and is discussed in more detail infra.","It should be appreciated that many other parts can be included in the apparatus A, that  merely shows an example, and that many variations are possible. For example, the apparatus A can be configured similarly to the apparatus shown in . Further, although  may be construed to suggest that the map display is provided on the terminal A, the apparatus A can be configured to provide a map display natively, assuming the apparatus A includes a display unit that makes a map display thereon of practical use to the user. In such instances, it would be preferable that the apparatus A include ample memory or storage to store map data.","Apparatus A shown in  includes CPU (central processing unit) , ROM (read only memory) A, SDRAM (synchronous dynamic random access memory) B, other memory or storage C, display , camera function unit , internal bus , that operate like similar components in the digital camera shown in  of commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,539,411, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","For example, the camera function unit  can operate essentially like the digital camera function unit shown in  of commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,539,411. Thus, the picture data for each picture captured by the apparatus A can include an Exif header portion in addition to the image data. The Exif header is a portion of the picture data that is typically used to store parameters that the camera used when capturing and storing the image data, such as aperture, compression, shutter speed, time captured, time stored, file size, display resolution, etc. Thus, the Exif header can store location information indicating, for example, the geographical location or coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude, x and y, etc.) at which the picture was captured. Such picture data, including the location information in the Exif header, can be appropriately stored by the camera function unit  in, for example, the SDRAM B.","Similarly, the digital camera A in the system A of  can store picture data, including the location information in the Exif header, when the picture is captured, and at a time when a map display is to be provided, the location determining part obtains, for each selected picture, location information for the selected picture from the Exif header of the picture data.","In addition, the apparatus A shown in  includes a communication part  that allows the apparatus A to conduct input\/output (such as a microphone, keypad, USB port, Bluetooth communication, etc.) or communicate through a network [for example, a conventional LAN (local area network), wireless LAN (WLAN), such as via WiFi communication, other wired or wireless network communication, such as WiMax, etc.] with an external device. How electronic devices can perform input\/output and can connect to and communicate over a network is well-known in the art and therefore in the interest of brevity and clarity, a detailed discussion of such input\/output and communication is omitted. Instead, the reader is referred to, for example, \u201cHow Computers Work\u201d, by Ron White, (Que Corporation 1999) and \u201cHow Networks Work\u201d, by Frank J. Derfler, Jr. and Les Freed (Que Corporation 2000), the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Further, a map function unit  is provided in the apparatus A shown in  and includes various parts that allow an appropriate map display to be provided on the display unit  of the apparatus A and\/or on another display unit (for example, on an external device). Such parts include a location determining part A, an extent determining part B and a scale determining part C (similar to the location determining part A, extent determining part A and scale determining part A, respectively), in addition to a map forming part D, a thumbnail generating part E and a user interface F.","The map forming part D is configured to retrieve map data (from a resident or external map database or data store, not shown) and supply the required signals to the display unit  and\/or external display unit in order to provide, in a conventional manner, a map display thereon. However, the scaling of the map display is different than the conventional map display. In conventional approaches, the scaling of the map display is based on a default scaling value or a preset value (by user, at factory, or otherwise). On the other hand, by operation of the location determining part, extent determining part, scale determining part and map forming part, the apparatus A causes the map display to be automatically and appropriately scaled according to the scaling factor determined by the scale determining part.","Another aspect different from the conventional map display is that the thumbnail generating part E is configured to convert, for each of the pictures, the picture to a corresponding thumbnail (that is, corresponding to a reduced-scale image of the picture), and by operation of the map forming part and thumbnail generating part, the thumbnails are overlaid on the map image to indicate the locations associated with the respective pictures.","Returning to the system shown in , when the apparatus A (via an input\/output or communication part) is connected to the terminal A, such as, for example, through a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port or another serial or parallel port of the terminal, or by wireless communication, such as utilizing Bluetooth protocol, the apparatus A makes pictures, a plug-in tool-set, etc., available to the terminal A. As mentioned supra, the plug-in tool-set can include many software parts, such as the location determining part, extent determining part and scale determining part, as well as other software parts. For example, upon connection of the apparatus A to the terminal A, the user can be provided with a user interface (such as a browser window) on the terminal by which the user can select any or all pictures that are then-stored in the apparatus A, for upload from the apparatus A to the terminal A.","In addition, as further discussed infra, after the pictures are selected, a map display can automatically be provided on the terminal A, by default (which the user can decline by appropriate setting), with indications of points on the map associated with respective ones of the pictures (such as by operation of a map forming part, e.g., D in , that can also be included in the plug-in tool-set). In the example of , the map data is maintained in a map database or data store external to the terminal A.","Further, the plug-in tool-set provided to the terminal A can also include a thumbnail generating part (e.g., E in ) which generates, for each selected picture, a thumbnail image based on the picture and the thumbnail can be superposed on the map (or shown as a pop-up when the cursor is controlled to hover over the corresponding point on the map).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1A"],"b":"15"},"In , computing device  includes a controller or central processing unit (CPU)  that communicates by way of internal bus  with a number of other components, including memory and\/or other storage device(s) , display , keyboard (and\/or keypad) , other input\/output (such as mouse, touchpad, serial or parallel ports, etc.)  and network interface .","The memory and\/or other storage device(s)  can provide storage for program and data, and may include a combination of assorted conventional storage devices such as buffers, registers and memories [for example, read-only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM), erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), static random access memory (SRAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), non-volatile random access memory (NOVRAM), etc.].","The network interface  provides a connection (for example, by way of an Ethernet connection or other network connection which supports any desired protocol such as, but not limited to, TCP\/IP, IPX, IPX\/SPX, NetBEUI, WiFi, WiMax, etc.) to a network (wired or wireless, such as any of an intranet, extranet, local area network, wide area network, or the like, or a combination thereof), in a conventional manner.","The controller  executing program code instructions (stored in memory  or other conventional storage devices) controls operations of the computing device , including providing various functionalities discussed herein (such as by a location determining part, an extent determining part, a scale determining part, a map forming part, a thumbnail generating part, etc.).","Further, pictures and map data can be stored in local storage device , or in an external or network-connected device (for example,  in , and  in ), and retrieved from such storage device, for processing by the document reading part.","Additional aspects or components of the computing device  are conventional (unless otherwise discussed herein), and in the interest of clarity and brevity are not discussed in detail herein.","As should be appreciated, the computing device  can be any electronic device having adequate processing resources, including but not limited to a personal, notebook, workstation or server computer, a kiosk, a PDA (personal digital assistant), a mobile or smart phone or handset, another information terminal, etc. The device is preferably configured to communicate with other devices through input\/output ports and\/or a network.","Thus, in the system A of , for example, the terminal A can retrieve map data through network  from a data store or database .","It should be appreciated that the system of  is exemplary, and that many variations are possible.","For example,  shows a system in which workstation B communicates with camera apparatus B which operates as a picture source. Like the example of , upon connection between the workstation B and the camera apparatus B, pictures, including image data along with location information (for example, obtained by location determining device B resident in the camera apparatus B), can be uploaded from the apparatus B to the workstation B. A plug-in tool set can optionally be provided to provide functionalities specific to the pictures. However, location determining part B, an extent determining part B and a scale determining part B (which have functionalities similar to location determining part A, an extent determining part A and a scale determining part A, respectively) are native to the workstation B, and are not communicated from the camera apparatus B to the workstation B.","The camera apparatus B can be configured similarly to apparatus B shown in . The apparatus B can include the thumbnail generating part E, like in the apparatus A shown in , but does not include the other parts of the map function unit in the apparatus A. However, other software parts and other functionalities may be included. For example, the apparatus B can include a location determining device  that operates along with the camera function unit  such that as each picture is captured, the image data generated by the camera function unit  for the picture is associated with location information generated by the location determining device  indicating the geographical location associated with the picture, and the combination of image data and location information is stored as picture data.","The workstation B can be configured as shown in . Computing apparatus B shown in  has many of the same components (CPU or controller , memory and other storage , display , keyboard , input\/output , network interface ) as computing device A shown in . On the other hand, the apparatus B includes in addition, a map function unit  comprising a location determining part A, an extent determining part B a scale determining part C, a map forming part D, a thumbnail generating part E and a user interface F (similar to the location determining part A, extent determining part B, scale determining part C, map forming part D, thumbnail generating part E and user interface F, respectively, of the map function unit  shown in ).","The workstation B shown in  may be configured to be application-specific and to include specific application software, although it may utilize a conventional or generally-available platform (for example, Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.) or a proprietary platform. In a specific example, the workstation B may be configured as a GIS (geographical information system) station. In such example, the workstation may be configured with enhanced (but conventional) graphics processing (or rendering) capabilities.","As shown in , the map data  may be stored external to the workstation, such as, for example, in an external hard drive or RAID (redundant array of independent disks) array. On the other hand, the workstation itself may be configured with enhanced internal storage capabilities.","In another example, workstation B in system C, as shown in , downloads pictures from a picture source  (such as a data store and\/or a server) through network  and retrieves map data through network  from a data store or database (or web application server) .","Many other embodiments are possible. For example, an application, including any combination of a location determining part, an extent determining part, a scale determining part, a map forming part, a thumbnail generating part, etc. can be supplied by an application server as software-as-a-service (SaaS) on demand to a requesting device, such as a terminal, connected to a network (such as shown in each of ). SaaS is currently a popular software delivery approach wherein enterprises and users obtain access, over the Internet, to applications and related services that would otherwise have to be located on their own personal or enterprise computers.","In the embodiment shown in , the terminal A (for example, configured as shown in ), upon request, receives from the application server (and\/or web server) D an application including in addition to other software parts, a location determining part D, an extent determining part D, a scale determining part D, a map forming part D, a thumbnail generating part D and a user interface D (similar to location determining part A, extent determining part B, scale determining part C, map forming part D, thumbnail generating part E and user interface F, respectively), and downloads pictures from a picture source (such as server)  through network  and retrieves map data through network  from a data store or database (or web application server) . For example, the user interface D may enable the user to select the picture source from which pictures are to be downloaded and\/or specific pictures to be downloaded from the picture source or to be processed after they have been downloaded. Further, the user interface D may enable the user to specify a specific map data store or database.","The application server D may also be a web server that can be accessed by a user utilizing a web browser (for example, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.). For example, the server D may provide a photo-sharing service and in connection therewith the user can download a photo-sharing application (including in addition to photo-sharing functionalities, any combination of a location determining part, an extent determining part, a scale determining part, a map forming part, a thumbnail generating part, etc.) from the server D. As another example, the server D may provide a GIS service and in connection therewith the user can download a GIS application including in addition to GIS-specific functionalities, any combination of a location determining part, an extent determining part, a scale determining part, a map forming part, a thumbnail generating part, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["40","11","11","41","42","43","44","45","46","49"]},"The server  may be a special-purpose device (such as including one or more application specific integrated circuits or an appropriate network of conventional component circuits) or it may be software-configured on a conventional personal computer or computer workstation with sufficient memory, processing and communication capabilities to operate as a server.","In server , controller , memory\/storage , display , keyboard , input\/output communications parts  and network interface  (like CPU or controller , memory and other storage , display , keyboard , input\/output  and network interface , respectively, in workstation B) are conventional.","The CPU or controller  executing program code instructions controls server operations, including an application function unit . The application function unit  includes in addition to other software parts, location determining part A, extent determining part B, scale determining part C, map forming part D, thumbnail generating part E and user interface F (which are similar in function to location determining part A, extent determining part B, scale determining part C, map forming part D, thumbnail generating part E and user interface F, respectively, in apparatus B shown in ). The various parts can be configured to be packaged as an application to be provided through a network to a requesting terminal. Such packaging and delivery of an application is conventional, and therefore is not discussed in detail herein.","In the system D shown in , the map data source  and the picture source  are accessed by the terminal A or by the application server D through the network . However, it should be appreciated that need not be network-connected devices and that the system need not be configured to require access to each through the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 1E"},"In another example (), application server D provides to terminal A an application that includes providing the relevant map data. The application server D may retrieve the relevant map data from a directly connected database or data store () or a network-connected storage device (). In any event, the application received from the application server D enables the terminal to request map data that is appropriate for selected pictures, receive such map data, and provide an appropriately scaled map display on a native (integrated or connected) display of the terminal. While it will be desirable in most instances to render the map display the map display at a time proximate to when the map data is received, the map forming part may include functionality to allow the user to specify that the received data should be saved for future rendering. Further, the terminal A having received the application may maintain a client-side map data store (not shown) and obtain periodically (or upon demand) data updates from the application server D or directly from the map data source .","While the terminal A in the systems shown in , for the purpose of discussion, is described as receiving the application from the application server D, it should be understood that the terminal A can be configured with a thin client, particular when the terminal A has limited processing and storage resources available. Accordingly, for example, as shown in , the map data store  and picture source  may be maintained on the server side. As is typically the case when a thin client is employed, processing is performed as much as possible on the server side and only the needed data is communicated to the client side.","A typical workflow, such as in the systems shown in , will now be discussed with reference to .","In the system A shown in , the digital camera can be used to capture pictures. A data dictionary (not shown) can be loaded into the camera from a workstation or other computing device, so that a user of the camera in the field can select workflow-related information from an on-screen menu (or other user interface) system. As may be apparent, the data dictionary loaded in the camera to cause the data entry screen shown in  to be displayed is specific to the insurance industry. In such context, records typically include information such as policy number, claim number, asset type, agent identification number (\u201cID #\u201d), etc. The list of such pre-set items can be extensive and in the example of , can be navigated by use of a vertical scroll bar. A selected item can be set by the user to a desired value by utilizing a drop-down list or by manual operation of a keypad on the camera. In addition, voice entry of information through a microphone on-board the camera can be attached as a memo.","When the camera is in operation (for example, powered on, in view mode or capture mode, etc.) and the location determining device is supplying location information, various information supplied by the location determining device can be displayed on-screen in real time. In the example of , a GPS card has been inserted in a CompactFlash slot of the camera, and real-time coordinates of the user's (i.e. camera's) position are displayed on-screen. The GPS receiver can supply coordinates in any of various coordinate systems, such as Lat\/Long (latitude\/longitude), UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator), MGRS (Military Grid Reference System), UPS (Universal Polar Stereographic), USNG (United States National Grid), Tokyo, etc. Additional information such as the number of satellites from which the GPS receiver has acquired signals and the number of satellites that are visible can also be displayed on-screen.","When a picture is captured utilizing the camera, user-entered work-flow information and the GPS coordinates at the time of capture are embedded in the picture data (for example in an EXIF header area) along with the captured image data. Thus, the picture is tagged with the location information. A notional representation of the picture data including the image data plus the metadata (that is, user-entered work-flow information and the GPS coordinates) is shown in .","When the camera communicates at a later time with a workstation running GIS software to upload the picture data, a plug-in tool set is communicated along with the picture data from the camera to the workstation. The tool set automatically converts a set of selected pictures to a geodatabase (or an ESRI shapefile when the workstation is running ESRI GIS software), and causes a map to be displayed, on a display unit of the workstation, with the selected pictures as points on the displayed map. When a user operates a pointing device of the workstation to move the cursor to hover over the point associated with one of the pictures, a thumbnail of the picture is superposed as a pop-up, as shown in . As shown in , the information from the data dictionary can be displayed along with the thumbnail. By clicking on the point or on the thumbnail, the picture is opened in a default picture viewer.","When the set of selected pictures is communicated to the workstation, an attribute table (as shown in ) is generated for the set of pictures. The attribute table information includes the information included in a listing of pictures (for example, ), as well as additional information specified by the data-dictionary.  shows an example wherein only the Longitude, Latitude coordinates, along with conventional picture file parameters (such as file name, size, type, date modified, date picture taken, dimensions) are maintained in the table. However, other data-dictionary items can be maintained in the attribute table as well.","The plug-in tool set can provided various options to the user, such as to select the data-dictionary items to be maintained in the attribute table (and thus accessible in the GIS). In addition, the options may include allowing the user to specify specific information items (for example, location, date and time picture taken, other data dictionary items, etc.) to be automatically stamped on the picture (original image or digital clone). Thus, pictures can be viewed, emailed, printed, etc., with superposed information representing, workflow, time, position, etc.","The listing of pictures, such as shown exemplarily in , allows the user to select pictures of interest, and the tool set may be configured to cause the map display to be generated based on the user selection of pictures. Such listing of pictures may be provided by the user interface on the camera apparatus, or by the user interface on the terminal or workstation. The tool set, by default, will cause the map display to be generated automatically based on all of the uploaded pictures, when the pictures are first uploaded. However, map generation functionality of the tool set can preferably be triggered by the user at a later time (for example, after the uploaded pictures have been stored, and even after the camera is no longer connected) through the user interface, such as by user selection of selected pictures.","A method for providing an appropriate map display, according to an exemplary embodiment of this disclosure, will now be discussed with reference to .","When selection of a set of information items, such as pictures, associated with locations, is received (step S), the extent of latitudes (for example, the mathematical difference between the smallest latitude and the largest latitude amongst the locations of the specific pictures) and extent of longitudes (for example, the mathematical difference between the smallest longitude and the largest longitude amongst the locations of the pictures) covered by the selected pictures are determined (step S). Such extent of latitudes and extent of longitudes are utilized to determine a scaling factor for the map display, and are utilized to determine the map data to be retrieved (step S). The map display is displayed with indications of the pictures and scaled according to the scaling factor (step S).","A process for determining the extent of latitudes, the extent of longitudes and an appropriate scaling factor will now be discussed in more detail with reference to . The locations of the selected pictures are considered in turn and a picture index (i) is initially set to 1 (step S). It is determined whether the first picture has associated location information (step S). If the picture does not have associated location information (step S, No), it is determined whether there is another picture (step S). If there is not another picture (step S, No), a flag is set indicating that no location information is provided (step S) and the process proceeds to step S (). If it is determined in step S (Yes) that there is another picture, the picture index i is incremented (step S) and the process returns to step S to consider whether the next picture has associated location information.","If it is determined in step S (Yes) that the picture under consideration has associated location information, each of the maximum x-value Xmax and the minimum x-value Xmin is set to the x-coordinate (or Longitude) of the location information of the picture under consideration, and each of the maximum y-value Ymax and the minimum y-value Ymin is set to the y-coordinate (or Latitude) of the picture (step S).","Next, it is determined whether there is another picture (step S). If there is another picture (step S, Yes), the picture index i is incremented (step S) and it is determined whether such next picture has associated location information (step S). If the picture does not have associated location information (step S, No), the process returns to step S to consider whether there is another picture to process.","On the other hand, if it is determined that the picture under consideration has associated location information (step S, Yes), the x-coordinate (or Longitude) of the location information of the picture under consideration [X(i)] is compared to the maximum x-value Xmax (step S) and the minimum x-value Xmin (step S). If the maximum x-value Xmax is less than the x-coordinate (or Longitude) X(i) [step S, Yes], the maximum x-value Xmax is changed to X(i) [step S]. If the minimum x-value Xmin is greater than X(i) [step S, Yes], the minimum x-value Xmin is changed to X(i) [step S]. Next, the y-coordinate (or Latitude) of the picture under consideration [Y(i)] is compared to the maximum y-value Ymax (step S) and the minimum y-value Ymin (step S). If the maximum y-value Ymax is less than the y-coordinate (or Latitude) Y(i) [step S, Yes], the maximum y-value Ymax is changed to Y(i) [step S]. If the minimum y-value Ymin is greater than Y(i) [step S, Yes], the minimum y-value Ymin is changed to Y(i) [step S]. Next, the process returns to step S to consider whether there is another picture to process.","When it is determined in step S (No) there is not another picture to process, the extent MaxLongitude of x-coordinates (or Longitudes) is set to the difference between the minimum x-value Xmin and the maximum x-value Xmax and the extent MaxLatitude of y-coordinates (or Latitudes) is set to the difference between the minimum y-value Ymin and the maximum y-value Ymax (step S). Next, the process proceeds to step S ().","In step S, it is determined whether (a) the extent MaxLongitude of x-coordinates (or Longitudes) is zero, or (b) the extent MaxLatitude of y-coordinates (or Latitudes) is zero, or (c) the no location information flag is set. If any of (a), (b) or (c) is true (step S, Yes), the scaling factor is set to a predefined value (step S).","If none of (a), (b) or (c) is true (step S, Yes), it is determined whether the ratio of actual width W of the display to the actual height H of the display is greater than the ratio of MaxLatitude to MaxLongitude (step S). If the ratio W\/H is greater than the ratio MaxLatitude\/MaxLongitude (step S, Yes), the scaling factor is set to the product MaxLongitude*(Z\/W), where Z is the actual length of the scale in the display (step S). If the ratio W\/H is not greater than the ratio MaxLatitude\/MaxLongitude (step S, No), the scaling factor is set to the product MaxLatitude*(Z\/H) [step S].",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6"],"b":["0327","0328","0327","0328"]},"The above specific embodiments are illustrative, and many variations can be introduced on these embodiments without departing from the spirit of the disclosure or from the scope of the appended claims.
