Existing homing array technology uses numerous narrowband and high-power longitudinal tonpilz resonators to form the aperture of an active transducer. Each tonpilz resonator consists of several active and inactive mechanical components that work together as a spring-mass, single degree-of-freedom system. Unfortunately, tonpilz resonators are expensive to fabricate and offer only a limited operational bandwidth above their first length mode resonance.","To address operational bandwidth limitations of tonpilz resonators, recent work has focused on constructing multi-resonance tonpilz elements that have significantly greater bandwidth than that of the original single-mode tonpilz resonators. However, the fixed-size radiation head inherent to tonpilz resonators prevent their use in a \u201cfrequency agile\u201d design in which array apertures can be varied in size.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a transducer array that can operate in a broadband frequency range over a wide field-of-view.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a broadband, wide field-of-view transducer array that is inexpensive to fabricate.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, a composite transducer array has a central portion thereof formed by a piezoelectric polymer composite panel with opposing first and second surfaces. A continuous electrode is coupled to the first surface and a plurality of electrode segments electrically isolated from one another are coupled to the second surface. Each electrode segment is shaped as an angular segment of a circular ring, while the plurality of electrode segments are arranged to define an array of concentric circular rings of electrode segments. Each electrode segment can by independently addressed so that the array's aperture can be varied in size.","Referring now to the drawings, simultaneous reference will be made to  where a composite transducer array is shown and referenced generally by numeral . More specifically,  is a plan view depicting the segmented electrode surface of the array and  is a side view depicting construction details of the array.","In , the segmented electrode surface of array  is defined by concentric circular rings of electrode segments . That is, each of electrode segments  is shaped as an angular segment (e.g., approximately 90\u00b0 in the illustrated embodiment) of a circular ring of such electrode segments. Electrode segments  are electrically isolated from one another by means of spaces or gaps  therebetween. The size of spaces  between adjacent ones of electrode segments  is determined by diffraction theory as would be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. By way of illustrative example, four of electrode segments  are used to define an outermost circular ring of electrode segments. However, more or fewer electrode segments can be used in a circular ring thereof without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Each electrode segment  has a radial width Wand an arc length L. Within a given circular ring of electrode segments, the radial width Wand\/or arc length Lcan be the same (as shown) or different for each electrode segment in the circular ring without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, in the outermost circular ring illustrated in , the radial width Wis the same for each electrode segment  and the arc length Lis the same for each electrode segment . Radial width and arc lengths can be increased or decreased with interior ones of the circular rings of electrode segments.","Construction of array  will now be explained with additional reference to . Electrode segments  are supported on a first major surface of a piezoelectric polymer composite panel . Details of a suitable composite panel  are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,255,761, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, composite panel  is constructed using spaced-apart piezoelectric (e.g., a ferroelectric material such as piezoceramic materials lead zirconate titanate or lead titanate) columns or rods  that span the thickness or height H of composite panel . Filling the spaces between rods  for the full height thereof is a viscoelastic material  such as a thermoplastic epoxy.","Each of electrode segments  can have a dedicated electrical lead coupled thereto. This can be accomplished by passing conductors (e.g., conductors  and  are illustrated in ) through a side of composite panel . More specifically, conductors  and  are routed through viscoelastic material  and electrically coupled to one of electrode segments . The second major surface of composite electrode panel  has a continuous electrode  coupled thereto. Typically, the height H of panel  is the same throughout so that planes defined by electrode segments  and continuous electrode  are parallel to one another.","Array  can also be shaped to conform to simple or complex contours if viscoelastic material  comprises a thermoplastic material such as thermoplastic epoxy. For example, as illustrated in , composite panel  has been shaped during heating thereof such that the planes defined by electrode segments  and continuous electrode  are curved in correspondence with one another.","The composite transducer array described herein can be used as part of an underwater array assembly such as assembly  illustrated in  where like reference numerals are used to describe elements of array  incorporated into assembly . A waterproof housing (e.g., a waterproof encapsulant)  has array  fitted and sealed therein such that electrode  is flush with and spans an opening  in housing . That is, the plane defined by continuous electrode  faces out of housing  while the plane defined by electrode segments  faces into housing . Abutting electrode segments  is an acoustic absorbing material  such as a particle-filled epoxy. Conductors  and  pass through both composite panel  (as described above) and acoustic absorbing material  before being coupled to appropriate signal electronics  that can be located within and\/or outside of housing  as illustrated.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. Broadband operation is achieved owing to the inherent broadband resonance of piezoelectric polymer composite panel  used to construct the transducer array of the present invention. The present invention also provides an improved spatial field-of-view since numerous elements may be formed by selectively applying electrodes over the array aperture to form elements having different (non-uniform) apertures. The invention teaches element apertures that can be varied in size by simply addressing electrode segments separately. High frequency responses are achieved using small sized electrode segments. The electrode segments can be combined for low frequency responses, or larger sized electrode segments could be used. The composite transducer array can be singly or doubly curved to any reasonable radii of curvature thereby providing a cost-effective means to realize truly conforming array apertures.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
