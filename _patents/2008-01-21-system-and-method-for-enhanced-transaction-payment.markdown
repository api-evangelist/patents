{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/897,843, filed on Jan. 29, 2007, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to telecommunications services. More particularly, the present invention relates to capabilities that enhance substantially the value and usefulness of various messaging paradigms including, inter alia, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), etc.","2. Background of the Invention","As the \u2018wireless revolution\u2019 continues to march forward the importance to a Mobile Subscriber (MS), for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD)\u2014for example a user of a Wireless Device (WD) such as, inter alia, a mobile telephone, a BlackBerry, etc. that is serviced by a Wireless Carrier (WC)\u2014of their WD grows substantially.","One consequence of such a growing importance is the resulting ubiquitous nature of WDs\u2014i.e., MSs carry them at almost all times and use them for an ever-increasing range of activities.","Within the universe of ever-increasing activities, one of the specific activities for which MSs would like to employ their WDs encompasses the facilitation, completion, etc. of the payment element of a transaction, purchase, etc.\u2014for example, a transaction within Mobile Commerce (M-Commerce, which, broadly speaking, encompasses the buying and selling of merchant-supplied products, goods, and services through WDs), a purchase in the checkout lane of a brick-and-mortar store, a purchase at a (fast-food or other) restaurant, etc.","Consequently the need exists for an infrastructure that allows MSs, through their WDs, to seamlessly participate in, support, facilitate, complete, etc., in new and creative ways, payments for transactions across the diverse range of transaction types (including, among other things, transactions that involve very small amounts of money all the way up to transactions that involve very large amounts of money).","The present invention provides such enhanced transaction payment capabilities and addresses, in new and innovatory ways, various of the (not insubstantial) challenges that are associated with same.","In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method for enhancing the security of a transaction payment in which a request message is received from a mobile subscriber, where the request message is associated with a payment portion of a transaction and includes a payment amount.","The amount of the transaction is extracted and, based thereon, as well as based on information previously supplied by the mobile subscriber, an authorization code is generated. The authorization code is then packaged in a response message and dispatched to the mobile subscriber","The request message (and the response message) may be any one of (a) a Short Message Service message, (b) a Multimedia Message Service message, and\/or (c) an IP Multimedia Subsystem message, and may further include one or more of (a) an account identifiers and\/or (b) a password.","In accordance with one feature of the present invention, the initial request may also initiate one or more of (a) one or more inquiries to the mobile subscriber, (b) a low or an empty balance replenishment operation, and\/or (c) mobile subscriber location awareness. The mobile subscriber location awareness may be derived from, e.g., one or more of (a) Location-Based Services and\/or (b) Global Positioning System.","In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the information that is previously supplied by the mobile subscriber is provided during a registration process, which may be web-based","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, when the mobile subscriber receives the authorization code, he\/she may then supply the code to a merchant with whom the mobile subscriber is transacting. The authorization code may so supplied via one or more of (a) manual means, (b) Bluetooth, (c) WiFi, (d) Near Field Communication, (e) Uniform Resource Locator, and\/or (f) Web cookie.","In still another aspect of the present invention, an approval code is generated, perhaps by request of the merchant, and returned to the merchant, who may, in turn, pass the approval code to the mobile subscriber.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method of conducting a commercial transaction including the steps of receiving a single, mobile subscriber-initiated, short message service (SMS) message, the SMS message including a payment amount for a commercial transaction, communicating with a billing interface to obtain an authorization code for the payment amount, sending a response SMS message to the mobile subscriber, the response SMS message including the authorization code, receiving the authorization code from a party to the commercial transaction other than the mobile subscriber (e.g., a merchant), and generating an approval code based on the authorization code, payment amount and at least one identifier, and supplying the approval code to the party to the commercial transaction other than the mobile subscriber (again, e.g., the merchant).","In this embodiment, the approval code may then be received from the mobile subscriber in an SMS message. In connection with supplying the approval code to the mobile subscriber, it may be desirable also to confirm at that time that the mobile subscriber is in a same location as the merchant. In this way, both the merchant and the mobile subscriber are confident that the commercial transaction is not fraudulent.","These and other features of the embodiments of the present invention, along with their attendant advantages, will be more fully appreciated upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the associated drawings.","It should be understood that these figures depict embodiments of the invention. Variations of these embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the teachings contained herein.","The present invention may leverage the capabilities of a centrally-located, full-featured MICV facility. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901 entitled \u201cINTERMEDIARY NETWORK SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING MESSAGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN WIRELESS NETWORKS,\u201d and its associated continuations, for a description of a MICV, a summary of various of the services\/functions\/etc. that are performed by a MICV, and a discussion of the numerous advantages that arise from same. The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 7,154,901, along with its associated continuations, is incorporated herein by reference.","As illustrated in  and reference numeral  a MICV  is disposed between, possibly inter alia, multiple WCs (WC\u2192WC) on one side and multiple SPs (SP\u2192SP) on the other side and thus \u2018bridges\u2019 all of the connected entities. A MICV  thus, as one simple example, may offer various routing, formatting, delivery, value-add, etc. capabilities that provide, possibly inter alia:","1) A WC \u2192 (and, by extension, all of the MSs \u2192\/\u2192\/\u2192 that are serviced by the WC \u2192) with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of SPs \u2192, and","2) A SP \u2192 with ubiquitous access to a broad universe of WCs \u2192 (and, by extension, to all of the MSs \u2192\/\u2192\/\u2192 that are serviced by the WCs \u2192).","A MICV  may have varying degrees of visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to the (MS\u2190\u2192MS, MS\u2190\u2192SP, etc.) messaging traffic:","1) A WC \u2192 may elect to route just their out-of-network messaging traffic to a MICV . Under this approach the MICV  would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to just the portion of the WC's \u2192 messaging traffic that was directed to the MICV  by the WC \u2192.","2) A WC \u2192 may elect to route all of their messaging traffic to a MICV . The MICV  may, possibly among other things, subsequently return to the WC \u2192 that portion of the messaging traffic that belongs to (i.e., that is destined for a MS \u2192\/\u2192\/\u2192 of) the WC \u2192. Under this approach the MICV  would have visibility (e.g., access, etc.) to all of the WC's \u2192 messaging traffic.","While the discussion below will include a MICV it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that other arrangements are equally applicable and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In the discussion below the present invention is described and illustrated as being offered by a SP. A SP may, possibly inter alia, be realized as a third-party (e.g., a service bureau), an element of a WC or a landline carrier, an element of a MICV, multiple entities working together, etc.","To help explain key aspects of the present invention consider the illustrative example that is depicted through  and the supporting narrative below.","As indicated in  and reference numeral  the (SMS\/MMS\/etc.) messaging traffic of numerous WCs (WC\u2192WC) is exchanged with a MICV  and the MICV  is connected with SP, a SP that offers, possibly inter alia, the present invention.","Within the framework that is illustrated by  SP may offer a registration process. During such a process a MS that is interested in using aspects of the present invention may identify herself and provide some range of information. A registration process may be tailored (e.g., the range of information gathered, the scope of access subsequently granted, etc.) to the class of user\u2014e.g., different types, categories, etc. of MSs may complete different registration processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304"],"sub":"x "},"MS  WD .

As set forth below, a given \u201cmessage\u201d sent between a MS  and a SP  may actually comprise a series of steps in which the message is received, forwarded and routed between different entities, including a WD  associated with a MS , a WC , a MICV , and a SP . Thus, unless otherwise indicated, it will be understood that reference to a particular message generally includes that particular message as conveyed at any stage between an origination source, such as a WD  of a MS , and an end receiver, such as a SP . As such, reference to a particular message generally includes a series of related communications between, for example, a MS  and a WC , the WC  and a MICV , and the MICV  and a SP . The series of related communications may, in general, contain substantially the same information, or information may be added or subtracted in different communications that nevertheless may be generally referred to as a same message. To aid in clarity, a particular message, whether undergoing changes or not, is referred to by different reference numbers at different stages between a source and an endpoint of the message.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as Mary  begins a registration process with SP. For example:","A) Mary  uses one of her PCs  to visit a WS  of SP to, possibly among other things, complete a service registration process (see \u2192).","B) SP's  WS  interacts with SP's  AS  to, possibly among other things, commit some or all of the information that Mary  provided to a data repository (e.g., a database), optionally complete a billing transaction, etc. (see ).","C) As appropriate and as required a BI  completes a billing transaction (see \u2192).","D) SP's  WS  responds appropriately (e.g., with the presentation of a confirmation message, etc.) (see \u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention. For example, the collected information may be reviewed, confirmed, etc. through one or more manual and\/or automatic mechanisms. For example, the registration process may be completed through any combination of one or more channels including, inter alia, the indicated WWW facility, wireless messaging (SMS, MMS, IMS, etc.), E-mail messages, Instant Messaging (IM) exchanges, conventional mail, telephone, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) facilities, etc.","During the registration process that was described above a range of information may be captured from a candidate user including, inter alia:","1) Identifying Information (e.g., general information about Mary). For example, possibly among other things, a unique identifier and a password, optionally a pseudonym or handle, name, age, sex, etc.","2) Contact Information. For example, possibly among other things, contact information (such as, possibly inter alia, landline and\/or wireless Telephone Numbers [TNs], E-mail addresses, IM addresses, physical addresses, etc.).","3) Billing Information. Different service billing models may be offered by SPincluding, possibly inter alia, free (e.g., possibly advertising-based), a fixed one-time charge, a recurring (e.g., per transaction, etc.) fixed charge, a recurring (e.g., per transaction, etc.) variable charge, etc. Different payment mechanisms may be supported by SPincluding, possibly among other things, credit or debit card information, authorization to place a charge on a MS's phone bill, etc.","4) Account Information. For example, possibly among other things, the particulars for one or more (internal to SP) accounts. The particulars might include, possibly inter alia, an account identifier, account spending\/funding\/etc. limits or thresholds, one or more funding sources (e.g., cash, one or more of the mechanisms that were identified in the above Billing Information, etc.), the particulars (including, possibly inter alia, timing, dollar amount, source[s], etc.) for periodic scheduled account replenishment or \u2018top up\u2019 actions, the particulars (including, possibly inter alia, occurrence frequency, size or dollar amount, etc.) for when additional or extra approval steps should be applied, etc.","5) Other Information. Additional, possibly optional, information.","The specific pieces of information that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other pieces of information (e.g., scheduled per-transaction or daily\/weekly\/etc. reporting that may be desired, etc.) are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","As noted above the information that Mary provided during the registration process may be preserved in a data repository (e.g., a database) and may optionally be organized as a MS Profile.","The content of Mary's profile may optionally be augmented by SP. For example, one or more internal or external sources of consumer, demographic, geographic, psychographic, corporate, etc. information may be leveraged to selectively enhance or augment elements of Mary's profile.","As noted above, a SP's BI may optionally complete one or more billing transactions. A billing transaction may take any number of forms and may involve different external entities (e.g., a WC's billing system, a carrier billing system service bureau, a credit or debit card clearinghouse, etc.). A billing transaction may include, inter alia:","1) The placement of a line item charge on the bill or statement that a MS receives from her WC. Exemplary mechanics and logistics associated with this approach are described in, for example, pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/837,695 entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BILLING AUGMENTATION.\u201d Other ways of completing or performing line item billing are easily implemented by those skilled in the art.","2) The charging of a credit card, the debiting of a debit card, etc.","3) The (electronic, etc.) transfer of funds.","4) The generation of an invoice, statement, etc.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP optionally coordinates, etc. with one or more external entities (such as, for example, one or more credit card clearinghouses, etc.) to, possibly among other things, secure access, arrange for funds, etc. (see \u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges (including, inter alia, updates to various of the information in a MS Profile in a SP's repository, etc.) are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP dispatches to Mary  one or more confirmation E-mail messages (see \u2192).","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges (including, inter alia, other types or forms of confirmation messages) are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","In  the exchanges that are collected under the designation Set  represent the activities that might take place as SP's  AS  dispatches one or more confirmation SMS, MMS, IMS, etc. messages to Mary's  WD  (see \u2192) and Mary  replies or responds to the message(s) (see \u2192). In the instant example the messages are shown traversing a MICV . SP may employ a Short Code (SC) or a regular TN as its source address (and to which it would ask users of its service to direct any reply messages). While the abbreviated length of a SC (e.g., five digits for a SC administered by Neustar under the Common Short Code [CSC] program) incrementally enhances the experience of a MS  (e.g., the MS  need remember and enter only a few digits as the destination address of a reply message) it also, by definition, constrains the universe of available SCs thereby causing each individual SC to be a limited or scarce resource and raising a number of SC\/CSC management, etc. issues. A description of a common (i.e., universal) short code environment may be found in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/742,764 entitled \u201cUNIVERSAL SHORT CODE ADMINISTRATION FACILITY.\u201d","The specific exchanges that were described above (as residing under the designation Set ) are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The Set , Set , Set , and Set  exchanges that were described above are illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that numerous other exchanges are easily possible and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention.","The registration information that was described above may subsequently be managed (e.g., existing information may be edited or removed, new information may be added, etc.) through any combination of one or more channels including, inter alia, a SP's WWW facility, wireless messaging (SMS, MMS, IMS, etc.), e-mail messages, IM exchanges, conventional mail, telephone, IVR facilities, etc.","To continue with the explanation of key aspects of the present invention . . . consider one possible use or incarnation of aspects of the present invention. In this simple illustrative use Mary, our hypothetical MS, completes a registration process (e.g., as described above), subsequently enters a store, completes her shopping in the store, and then enters a checkout lane where her purchases are rung.","The simple scenario that was just described is illustrative only and it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that numerous other alternative scenarios are easily possibly and indeed are fully within the scope of the present invention. For example, possibly inter alia:","1) Mary may complete a purchase within an M-Commerce environment.","2) Mary may order a meal at a (fast-food or other) restaurant.","3) Mary may purchase a ticket at a theater ticket window.","4) Mary may secure services for her automobile at a gas or filling station, at a repair or service facility, etc.","The simple scenario that was described above (i.e., Mary completes a registration process, subsequently enters a store, completes her shopping, and enters a checkout lane where her purchases are rung) may be examined further through the illustrative interactions that are depicted in  and reference numeral .
