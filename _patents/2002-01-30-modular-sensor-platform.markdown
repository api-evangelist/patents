Teams of small collaborating robotic agents, having advanced sensor and mobility characteristics, can be utilized to conduct tasks such as reconnaissance and surveillance, chemical and biological agent detection, logistics, and communications relay. These robotic agents can also be utilized to operate in hostile environments or adverse weather conditions outside of armed forces applications.","Present robotic agents are generally not designed to be used in harsh environments. Current robotic endeavors utilize state of the art components attached to the top of a base with component interfaces and connections (wires) exposed. Additionally, these components are permanently affixed to the base, or embedded into the system, requiring a great deal of time and effort to remove and replace in case of equipment malfunction or system upgrade.","The overall configuration of these robotic agents is not designed to be modular, thereby precluding the use of rapid change components due to replacement due to failure or task changes. Specifically, prior art robotic agents are not water resistant, thermally protected or protected from dust or dirt. Since these agents typically carry sensitive sensors and devices, their lack of protective elements limit their application.","The present invention overcomes the difficulties of known robotic agents by providing a system which allows the robotic agents unlimited applications in all types of weather and environmental conditions. Furthermore, the present invention provides multiple changes of modular components, thereby providing quick removal of inoperative or damaged parts, as well as allowing for customizing a basic agent for particular use.","It is, therefore, an objective of the present invention to provide a platform system that is quickly attached to vehicular device having a drive train and power supply, where the platform system provides remote data acquisition and transmission.","It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a system for rapid removal, reconfiguration and exchange of components that is easily manipulated and capable of housing a variety of components necessary for information gathering and transmission applications in a wide variety of environmental and weather conditions.","It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a platform system that is capable of being quickly opened so as to allow quick repair, removal, maintenance or upgrade of all apparatus and sensors, all components housed within the platform interior and track all wires connected to each of the apparatus, sensors and components.","It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a platform system that is capable of being opened in a second position to allow direct access to all portions of the robotic components.","It is also an objective of the present invention to provide removable side panels that allow an alternative means of accessing the interiorly housed components and wires as well as effectuating rapid removal of all apparatus, sensors, components and wires.","These and other objectives have led to the present invention discussed below.","The present invention is directed to a platform system that provides a new and unique manner for housing a plurality of apparatus and sensors storing their respective components and related hardware such that they are rapidly exchangeable, water resistant and capable of operating in a wide range of environmental and weather conditions.
