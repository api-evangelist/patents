{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\/DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","This invention relates broadly to IC circuits and in particular to radio frequency integrated circuits.","High performance microwave and radio frequency integrated circuits are of interest both for military and civilian applications. The ability to design custom integrated circuits and fabricate prototypes in a timely and cost effective manner is a prime concern. Low-power sensor networks have recently become very popular for applications such as logistics and home automations. Remote low-power radio frequency (RF) applications are becoming more prevalent and low power tends to mean short transmission range. This necessitates the need to develop custom RF enhancement chips to meet military and commercial needs that can't be met by commercial off the shelf (COTS) chips.","Low-power radio frequency (RF) transceivers have been used for low-cost, high volume commercial applications that do not always meet the needs of critical military systems. In low-power applications, a tradeoff between transmit range and battery life exists. A simple means of extending transmit range would be to add a custom integrated circuit (IC) between the transceiver and antenna. Using appropriate technologies, a tradeoff in size, efficiency, and performance is achievable.","By way of background, a high electron mobility transistor is referred to as an HEMT. Generally speaking, the two different materials used for the heterojunction in an HEMT must have the same lattice constant. A variation of this is a PHEMT, of pseudomorphic HEMT where an extremely thin layer of one of the materials stretches to fit the other material thin layer. GaAs PHEMTs make very good low noise amplifiers, high efficiency power amplifiers, and have very good RF switch characteristics. The blocks for the RFIC Booster chip take advantage of these high performance characteristics of GaAs to increase the output power, power efficiency, and noise figure.","By way of background, phase-shift keying (PSK) is a digital modulation scheme that conveys data by changing, or modulating, the phase of a reference signal (the carrier wave). Digital modulation schemes use distinct signals to represent digital data; while Phase-shift keying (PSK) uses phase shifts to represent a unique pattern of binary digits. Generally, each phase is encoded to represent a number of bits. Each pattern of bits represents a symbol that is represented by the particular phase. A demodulator designed specifically for the symbol-set used by the modulator, is used to determine the phase of the received signal and map it back to the original symbol or data. The capability of the receiver to compare the phase of the received signal to a reference signal is referred to as coherent PSK (CPSK). Similarly, instead of bit patterns being used to set the phase of the wave, the phase change can be utilized. The demodulator would then determine the change in the phase of the received signal rather than the phase itself; or the difference between successive phases (also referred to as differential phase-shift keying (DPSK).","In PSK, the chosen constellation points are usually positioned so as to be uniformly spaced around a circle for maximum phase-separation between adjacent points and the best immunity to corruption. Positioning within a circle provides transmission with the same energy and the moduli of the complex numbers they represent will be the same and so will the amplitudes needed for the cosine and sine waves. Two common examples are \u201cbinary phase-shift keying\u201d (BPSK) which uses two phases, and \u201cquadrature phase-shift keying\u201d (QPSK) which uses four phases, although any number of phases may be used. Since the data to be conveyed are usually binary, the PSK scheme is usually designed with the number of constellation points being a power of 2.","A preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a radio frequency integrated circuit for enhancing wireless communication and\/or sensing systems comprising a base comprising a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate; a binary phase shift keying modulator fabricated on the base; a power amplifier fabricated on the base and operatively associated with the binary phase shift keying modulator; the power amplifier having a first shunt operatively associated therewith; a transmit\/receive switch fabricated on the base, the transmit\/receive switch being operatively associated with the power amplifier and being alternately connectable to an antenna port adapted to be connected to an antenna; a low noise amplifier fabricated on the base; the low noise amplifier being alternately connectable to the antenna port, the low noise amplifier having a second shunt operatively associated therewith; the circuit operating in a transmit stage in which the power amplifier is connected to the antenna port and in a receive stage in which the low noise amplifier is connected to the antenna port; whereby in the receive stage the power amplifier is bypassed by the first shunt to reduce current consumption and substantially isolate the receive stage from the transmit stage; and in the transmit stage the low noise amplifier is bypassed by the second shunt to reduce current consumption and to substantially isolate the transmit stage from the receive stage. The preferred embodiments are designed to supplement commercial RFIC transceivers to enable improved power handling, standoff, noise-immunity, and size weight and power (SWAP) at the system level, using gallium arsenide (GaAs) technology to provide enhanced performance. Multiple variations were used to cover different frequencies and specifications for enhancing the GaAs RFIC Booster, including customizing the subcircuits of power amplifier, low noise amplifier, BPSK modulator, and a transmit\/receive switch to optimize the output power, noise figure, power added efficiency, insertion loss, and range performance of an overall low-power radio frequency system. The extended range and small form factor greatly increases the operators' risk of staying out of harm's way when retrieving data or performing maintenance for remote applications. The invention includes a method of making the integrated circuit comprising method of making an integrated circuit comprising providing a base comprising a gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate; fabricating a binary phase shift keying modulator on the base; fabricating a power amplifier on the base, the power amplifier being operatively associated with the binary phase shift keying modulator; the power amplifier having a first shunt operatively associated therewith; fabricating a transmit\/receive switch on the base, the transmit\/receive switch being operatively associated with the power amplifier and being alternately connectable to an antenna port adapted to be connected to an antenna; fabricating a low noise amplifier on the base; the low noise amplifier being alternately connectable to the antenna port, the low noise amplifier having a second shunt operatively associated therewith.","The embodiments of the invention provide a simplified design with the goal of being able to work with\/enhance the RFIC's from multiple vendors. Moreover, a significant objective of the described preferred embodiments is to minimize the amount of software or other changes on the part of a given vendor; essentially a \u201cdrop in\u201d technology (i.e., insertable into an existing system) geared towards optimizing the performance of existing RFIC's for use in high noise or extended range applications.","The invention can be used to enhance the performance of wireless RF systems using commercial parts. It could also be used as a standalone binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation system by adding the digital controller and an oscillator source using the RFIC booster chip as the front end of a transceiver.","Military and commercial applications using wireless data transmission are numerous and constantly growing in new directions. In low-power military applications, a tradeoff between transmit range and battery life exists. A simple means of extending transmit range would be to add the described custom integrated circuit (IC) between the transceiver and antenna. By way of example, the invention could be used to enhance the use of unattended ground sensor systems; allowing for the retrieval of sensor data from greater distances.","RFIC's are utilized in a variety of commercial products such as cell\/cordless phones, computers and other wireless\/networking applications. Because the described RF integrated circuit (IC) booster chip is intended to interface between the transceiver and antenna to increase range between nodes for low-power RF applications; the invention could provide benefit to a variety of commercial applications where the current performance is not able to meet a demand or challenge (e.g. high noise environments). Specific commercial applications could include: cellular communications, wireless networking devices, extended range RFID applications, etc.","A block diagram representation of a preferred embodiment booster chip is depicted in .  depicts an RFIC narrowband 450-MHz booster chip on a 4\u00d74 mm tile to enhance performance of a companion integrated circuit (IC) on a GaAs substrate. The transmit stage of the circuit consists of the BPSK modulator cascaded with a power amplifier and TR switch. The receive stage of the circuit consists of the TR switch cascaded with the LNA. The BPSK modulator is a novel component and typically exists off-chip. There are additional gate enable DC inputs to provide a higher level of isolation between the power amplifier and LNA stages than is currently available. These gate enable features are also novel to this invention and are denoted in  as \u201cLNAen\u201d and \u201cPAen\u201d, respectively. This will save power consumption and provide additional isolation between transmit and receive stages. This isolation could be essential for system level performance, and provides an additional 60 dB of isolation between transmit and receive beyond the 35-40 dB of isolation provided by the TR switch. This additional isolation could be provided in the other designs by providing switching supplies for the separate LNA and power amplifier supply inputs, but this would require significant board area compared to the simple gate enable inputs. The BPSK modulator has a negative DC OFF state of approximately 3.0 V and an ON state of 0.0 V to activate the A and B control pins. The TR switch has a positive DC reference of 2.5 V on the control inputs corresponding to ON and 0.0 V corresponding to OFF, which activate the transmit stage or the receive stage, respectively. The PA and LNA both have a +2.7 to +3.0 V supply voltage.","A more complete appreciation of the invention will be readily obtained by reference to the following Description of the Preferred Embodiments and the accompanying drawings in which like numerals in different figures represent the same structures or elements.

High noise environments require increased dynamic range and optimized power budget. Improved RF performance and optimal use of system resources is needed to function in critical applications.","Commercial companies have RFIC front-end chips that boost output power that are targeted for 2.4 GHz, but use a silicon based chip\/silicon processes. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is superior in performance to silicon in efficiency, noise figure, and switching speeds. In addition, at least one preferred embodiment includes an on-board BPSK modulator, uses a robust current mirror bias for varying battery supply voltages, and has gate enables that provide very high isolation between the transmit and receive paths. The present invention supplements commercial RFIC transceivers for improved power handling, standoff, noise immunity, and SWAP at the system level. The optional designs of the preferred embodiments emphasize circuits that take advantage of superior GaAs characteristics. This also provides a simple means to enhance the performance of existing COTS RFICs without modifying the existing programming and intellectual property (IP) investment of a given manufacturer. Using the concept of the present invention wireless sensors can operate remotely, for longer periods of time and deliver increased transmission range; as well as retrieve critical data from safer distances which may be a challenge in certain environments or applications.","While most RFIC's provide power output in the up to 10 mW range, the invention has shown it can provide up to 100 mW output; an order of magnitude improvement. Furthermore, a targeted goal of a 50% increase in power added efficiency (PAE) may be achieved using the invention. Efforts demonstrated potential optimizing of the IC performance characteristics for requirements such as battery voltage, output power, or noise figure (NF).","The preferred embodiments RFIC integrated circuits utilize the superior performance of GaAs technology, which provides better performance properties, and may be used for applications such as high-efficiency solar cells, laser diodes, and the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT; which is used in cell phones, communication systems, radars, etc.).","There also exists a desire was to keep the design footprint small with a goal of fitting in a 3\u00d73 mm QFN package and optimizing performance over a 20-25% bandwidth rather than a high octave or more expansive bandwidth. For output power, a goal of 50 to 100 mW of output power with close to 50% Power Added Efficiency was desired. For noise figure, a goal of 1 to 2 dB is desirable, far lower than the noise figure of a typical RFIC of 7 dB or worse. Block enhancement included incorporation of the BPSK modulator which can provide extremely high modulation rates due to the high switching speeds of GaAs PHEMTs. A designed \u201cgate enable\u201d transistor on each Emode PHEMT based amplifier was added to provide much greater isolation between the operation modes of the TR switch.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1D","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1E","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1F","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1G","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1H","FIG. 1I","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1K","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1L","FIG. 1A"],"b":["11","12","13","14","11","11","12","12","14","14","14","13","13"],"i":"b "},"In the embodiment illustrated in , in the transmit mode, the RF signal traverses the BPSK modulator, PA, and TRS. The resulting output signal has about 100 mW of output power. The goal of the PA design is to achieve a gain of 20 dB, an input match of at least \u221210 dB, and a PAE of at least 50%. The BPSK modulator should have a 180\u00b0 phase difference between the two modulation states, with minimal insertion loss, and an input and output match of \u221210 dB or better. In receive mode, the RF signal traverses the TRS and LNA, which is designed to amplify the incoming signal with minimal effect on the noise level. It is desired that the LNA should have a noise figure (NF) of less than 2 dB, a gain of 15 dB, and an input and output match of at least \u221210 dB.","In the PA design, there is always a tradeoff between the PAE and gain, and likewise there will be a similar tradeoff between the NF and gain for the LNA design. For the TRS, there is a tradeoff between layout area, insertion loss, isolation, and bandwidth. The goal of the following design is to optimize the performance between these tradeoffs while minimizing the power consumption and IC footprint.","The initial tests of the RFIC Booster designs were performed with a manual RF probe station and other RF measurement equipment, such as network analyzers, power meters, spectrum analyzers, and noise figure meters. S-parameters. RF power output. phase shift, noise figure. DC power consumption and power efficiency (PAE) were measured for the various designs and circuit blocks. Results were close to the original simulations and expectations with some minor differences. Some circuit enhancements could not easily be measured on the RF probe station because of the limited number of DC probes to feed the DC voltage to set the biases. These designs were later tested on a small PC board using Rogers 4003 dielectric after the die were assembled in RF QFN packages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["S11: input reflection coefficient of an impedance terminated output.","S21: forward transmission coefficient of an impedance terminated output.","S12: reverse transmission coefficient of an impedance terminated input.","S22: output reflection coefficient of an impedance terminated input."]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Table 1 gives the first test results for a DC bias of 2.7 V and 17 mA and table 2 gives the results for a DC bias of 3.0 V and 25 mA.

The gate enable also functions to virtually turn off the power supply consumption without requiring additional real estate and external circuitry for an additional voltage regulator. Included was a robust current mirror biased so that the amplifier circuits could operate over a range of battery voltages keeping the output power and power added efficiency (PAE) optimal over lower supply voltages. This feature also does not typically exist in COTS chips and is extremely important for remote, low-power applications. A schematic layout representation of the booster chip is depicted in , which depicts a full RFIC narrowband 450-MHz booster chip on a 4\u00d74 mm tile on a GaAs substrate. The transmit stage of the circuit consists of the BP SK modulator cascaded with a power amplifier and TR switch. The receive stage of the circuit consists of the TR switch cascaded with the LNA. The BPSK modulator typically exists off-chip. There are additional gate enable DC inputs to provide a higher level of isolation between the power amplifier and LNA stages than is currently available. These gate enable features are denoted in  as \u201cLNAen\u201d and \u201cPAen,\u201d respectively, and save power consumption and provide additional isolation between transmit and receive stages. This isolation could be essential for system level performance, and provides an additional 60 dB of isolation between transmit and receive beyond the 35-40 dB of isolation provided by the TR switch. Alternately, without departing from the scope of the invention, this additional isolation could be provided in the other designs by providing switching supplies for the separate LNA and power amplifier supply inputs, but this would require significant board area compared to the simple gate enable inputs. The BPSK modulator has a negative DC OFF state of approximately 3.0 V and an ON state of 0.0 V to activate the A and B control pins. The TR switch has a positive DC reference of 2.5 V on the control inputs corresponding to ON and 0.0 V corresponding to OFF, which activate the transmit stage or the receive stage, respectively. The PA and LNA both have a +2.7 to +3.0 V supply voltage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0123"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0125"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0127"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"Table 4 gives the numerical test results of the power amplifier in the QFN packaged for a DC bias of 2.7 V and 22 mA and of 3.0 V and 32 mA.

The performance in the package is comparable to the die measurements in most cases, or slightly worse due to additional losses in the package.","Generally speaking, commercial companies have chips that boost output power that are targeted for 2.4 GHz, but use silicon processes. GaAs is superior in performance to silicon in efficiency, noise figure, and switching speeds. In addition, the present design includes an on-board BPSK modulator, optionally uses a robust current mirror bias for varying battery supply voltages, and have optional gate enables that provide very high isolation between the transmit and receive paths. The preferred embodiments may include circuits that take advantage of superior GaAs characteristics. This circuitry provides a simple means to reduce power consumption to the power amplifier or low noise amplifier without having to utilize a separate external power supply.","The preferred embodiment GaAs design improves performance over the newer silicon based RFIC booster chips by enabling their use in environments or applications beyond the capabilities of COTS parts. The addition of the optional current mirror into the design provides longer operational life in remote operations and additional pins to increase the isolation between transmit and receive stages of the circuit for improved performance.","The invention may be used, for example, to enhance the performance of any wireless RF system using commercial parts. It could also be used as a standalone BPSK modulation system by adding a digital controller and an oscillator source with the RFIC booster chip as the front end of a transceiver. One substantial benefit is the fact that wireless sensors can operate remotely, for longer periods of time, and increased transmission range means critical data can be retrieved from safer differences.","Using the concepts of the present invention, there is high isolation between transmit and receive paths by the combination of TR switch isolation and an amplifier gate enable circuit. The addition of the current mirror allows stable current consumption even at decreasing DC voltage supplies.","The design in  is a 900-MHz booster chip on a 95\u00d765 mil die. A current mirror at the DC input limits variation of current consumption in the PA and LNA over for a wider range of supply voltages. For battery operated applications, this ensures chip operation even as the battery output degrades over time and usage. The BPSK modulator has a positive DC OFF state of approximately 3.0 V and an ON state of 0.0 V to activate the modulation state control pins. The TRS has a positive DC reference of 2.5 V on the control inputs corresponding to ON and 0.0 V corresponding to OFF, which activates the transmit and receive stages, respectively. The PA and LNA both have a 2.7 to 3.0 V supply voltage for optimal performance.","The gain of the transmit stage is expected to be about 14 dB since the PA is designed to 20 dB, and there is an insertion loss of \u22122 dB in the BPSK modulator, an attenuator of 3 dB between the two stages, and a loss of \u22121.0 dB in the TRS. The gain of the receive stage is expected to be about 14 dB after taking the insertion loss of the TRS into account. The two-port S-parameters of the transmit stage were simulated with each of the two BPSK modulation states activated individually, and the results are depicted in , which show the simulated versus measured results of the S-parameters for the transmit stage of the chip in both modulation states. Both states show fairly good agreement with the simulated results at 900 MHz with some discrepancy in the S21 measurement. State A has a measured S11 of \u221215.34 dB, which is better than a simulation of approximately \u221214.5 dB, but degrades from the \u221219.67 dB of the simulation. The input match of state B is \u221210.73 dB, which matches the simulation exactly, but also degrades from \u221212.13 dB.

Quad-flat-no-leads (QFN) packages are small, inexpensive plastic packages that minimize board space relative to the die size and are very popular for lower frequency RFICs. A die was designed for a 3\u00d73 mm QFN or a 4\u00d74 mm QFN. Modeling of the wire bond inductances at these ultra-high frequencies (UHF) indicated that the packaging should have minimal impact on the performance.","Generally, the performance was comparable to the probe station measurements. Typically, output power and PAE was only slightly degraded by additional package parasitics. NF measurements were typically better when tested at the package level because of the floating grounds in the probe tests. The NF of the design was 1.9 dB in the package, less than the 3 dB measured at the bare die level. Some features, such as the high isolation of the gate enables, were only testable at the package level because of the limited number of DC probes available during the characterization of the bare die. A simple test board with subminiature version A (SMA) connectors for the RF and wire leads for the DC connections was used to test the bare die assembled in the QFN packages.  is an illustration of an image of wire bonded RFIC booster chip on a 4\u00d74 mm QFN package. The QFN packages are not standard in terms of the I\/O pad placement and die pads, but at these sub 1-GHz frequencies, the package parasitics are negligible","The design, simulation, fabrication characterization, packaging, and testing of a custom GaAs RFIC chip is to enhance the range performance of low-power RF applications. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, four separate elements\u2014a BPSK modulator, a highly linear low-power PA with 20 dB gain, an LNA with a NF lower than 2 dB, and\/or a low insertion loss TRS\u2014may be included in a small form factor, where the footprint of the inductors and capacitors is was large in comparison to the overall footprint of the chip at lower frequencies. Overall, the power amplifier met the design goals by providing 50 mW of output power at 2.7 V coupled with a 50% PAE. It can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that IC performance characteristics for a particular set of system level requirements such as battery voltage, output power, or NF can be optimized without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Discrete Circuit Designs and Simulation Results","Several Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) were designed to enhance the performance of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RF Integrated Circuits (RFICs). These various U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) designs were fabricated at TriQuint Semiconductor with their Prototype Development Quickturn (PDQ) Option using their gallium arsenide (GaAs) 0.5 \u03bcm TQPED Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (PHEMT) process. The designs were tested with a Microwave Probe Station and then were packaged in Quad Flat No Lead (QFN) parts for additional testing at a board level. The packaged designs may be incorporated into actual TTL circuit boards for performance testing. Following is documentation of the packaging of these GaAs designs and the test results in those packages.","The following sections describe Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) Integrated Circuit Design for Radio Frequency Booster Chips at 450, 900, and 2400 MHz.","The RFIC booster chip may optionally incorporate four different elements: the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulator, the power amplifier (PA), the transmit\/receive (TR) switch, and the low-noise amplifier (LNA). In transmit mode, the RF signal traverses the BPSK modulator and PA. The resulting output signal has about 100 mW of output power. In receive mode, the RF signal traverses the LNA, which amplifies the incoming signal with minimal effect on the noise level. This, in turn, increases the power level of the received signal, making it easier to detect. The TR switch toggles the circuit from transmit and receive mode as necessary.","The goal of the PA design was to achieve a gain of 20 dB, an input match of at least \u221210 dB, and a power added efficiency (PAE) of at least 50%. Ideally, the BPSK modulator should have a 180\u00b0 phase difference between the two modulation states, with a minimal insertion loss, and an input and output match of at least \u221210 dB. Ideally, the LNA should have a noise figure (NF) of less than 2 dB, a gain of 15 dB, and an output match of at least \u221210 dB. Ideally, the TR switch should have a minimal insertion loss of less than 1 dB or better, a good isolation between the switch states of better than 30 dB, and the ability to operate with at least the expected 20-dBm signal level of the PA.","In the PA design, a tradeoff exists between the PAE and gain, and likewise there exists a similar tradeoff between NF and gain for the LNA design. For the TR switch, there is a tradeoff of layout area, insertion loss, isolation, and bandwidth. A goal of the following preferred embodiments was to optimize the performance between these tradeoffs while minimizing the power consumption and IC footprint.","Preliminary Single Chip RFIC Booster Designs","A preferred embodiment referred to as the Cascaded Narrowband BPSK Modulator and PA Design at 900 MHz with Broadband LNA (ARL01M900)() is a narrowband 900-MHz cascaded BPSK modulator and PA with a separate broadband LNA on a 3\u00d73 mm tile.

The gain of the transmit stage was expected to be 15 dB, since the PA is designed to 20 dB and there is a 2-dB insertion loss in the BPSK modulator with a 3-dB attenuator between the two circuits.","The two-port S-parameters of the cascaded BPSK and PA embodiment of  were simulated with each of the two BPSK modulation states activated individually, and the results are depicted in . At 900 MHz, we see a gain of 14.5 dB for both modulation states, an output match of approximately \u22129.5 and \u221210.5 dB for state A versus state B, and an input match of approximately \u221210.8 and \u221214.0 dB for state A versus state B. With the additional losses introduced by the BPSK modulator and additional attenuator, the PA provided a gain of about 19.5 dB, which is in line with the original design goals. The input and output matches of both states produced acceptable results.  shows the PAE and output power of the PA without the BPSK modulator to be 53.6% at a 20.1-dBm output power.","The two-port S-parameters of the broadband LNA were simulated, and the results are depicted in . From 400 MHz to 8 GHz, a gain ranging from approximately 17.5 to 6.0 dB was observed. The gain up to about 2 GHz stays within range of the design goals. There is much less variation in output match and input match over the frequency range. From 400 MHz to 8 GHz, an output match ranging from \u22129.0 to \u221211.5 dB, and an input match ranging from approximately \u22128.0 to \u221210.5 dB was observed.  shows the NF of the receive stage to be less than 2.0 from about 400 MHz to 3 GHz, which incorporates all of our frequency bands of interest. This broadband LNA met all of the design goals, but consumed more DC power than the narrowband designs.","Next will be described a preferred embodiment referred to as the BPSK Modulator, PA, Broadband LNA, and TR Switch at 900 MHz (ARL04M900) as depicted schematically in . An example of the layout of the design, a full RFIC 900-MHz booster chip, is illustrated in ; shown on a 3\u00d73 mm tile. The LNA is both broadband and higher in gain. The BPSK modulator has a negative DC OFF state of approximately \u22123.0 V and an ON state of 0.0 V to activate the A and B control pins. In this design, the TR switch also has a negative DC OFF state of approximately \u22123.0 V and an ON state of 0.0 V, which activate the transmit stage or the receive stage, respectively. The PA and LNA both have the same +2.7 V to +3.0 V supply voltage as in section 3.3.","The intent of this design is to compare the results of this smaller footprint to that of section describing the Narrowband BPSK Modulator, PA, Narrowband LNA and TR Switch at 900 MHz (ARL03M900\u2014), where the same elements and operating frequency are used, but the layout has a 4\u00d74 mm footprint. This circuit has been designed to have the similar values for gain, input match, output match, and NF as in the section describing the Narrowband BPSK Modulator, PA, Narrowband LNA and TR Switch at 900 MHz (ARL 03M900\u2014).","The two-port S-parameters of the transmit stage of the embodiment of  were simulated with each of the two BPSK modulation states activated individually, and the results are depicted in .

With the additional losses introduced by the BPSK modulator, attenuator, and TR switch, the PA provided a gain of about 20.6 dB, which exceeds the original design goals. After shrinking the footprint, the behavior of the transmit stage of the 3\u00d73 mm RFIC is similar to the RFIC design with the 4\u00d74 mm footprint at 900 MHz.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0159"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 30","FIGS. 31A-D","FIGS. 21A-C","FIG. 31","FIG. 31","FIGS. 31A-D"]},"Following an internal design review feedback was obtained as to how the designs could be changed to better fit the needs of the various intended applications. A change that was implemented in the following redesigns is that circuitry was added to ensure that all the DC biases for the BPSK modulator and TR switch were positive. For the BPSK modulator, the change to a positive control voltage was fairly simple in that the Dmode pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (PHEMT) switches were replaced with Emode PHEMT switches of the same size with minimal impact to the layout. There was a slight impact to the control input design to limit the input voltage to less than 1 V to prevent damage from high current to the Emode switches while maintaining control input levels of +2.5 to +5.0 V. A small diode and a simple resistor divider circuit is used to limit the input voltage with a small current penalty. The Dmode switches do not require this voltage\/gate current protection circuit and require zero current at DC for the control inputs. The initial positive input circuit design consumes about 1 mA for each control input and modification of the resistor divider circuit to reduce this current is within the scope of the present invention.","For the PHEMT switches in the TR switch, the Emode devices could not handle the relatively high RF power levels of the PA, expected to be around 20 dBm (100 mW). Dmode PHEMT switches had to be used for the TR switch, but the normal negative gate control voltages can be made positive by providing a positive reference voltage to set the ON voltage and by adding capacitors to isolate DC paths to ground the TR switch. Four isolation capacitors were required to make a positive control voltage for the TR switch, and these capacitors can be quite large, particularly at 450 MHz. The penalty in converting the TR switch to positive control was the addition of an extra input pad to establish the ON reference voltage, and the additional area of the DC isolation capacitors. There may be some additional insertion loss to the positive voltage TR switch over the negative control voltage version, particularly if the capacitors are not sufficiently large.","Also, a current mirror was added to some of the preferred embodiment designs to enable current consumption in the PA and LNA to remain relatively constant for a range of supply voltages. For the amplifier bias, the initial designs used a simple resistor divider to provide the DC gate bias voltage. The resistor divider approach makes the amplifier bias very sensitive to supply voltage, particularly for the lower bias current of the LNA amplifier. A current mirror uses a small PHEMT to set the gate bias voltage based on the current in the amplifier and is much less sensitive to supply voltage. This yields a useable amplifier over a much larger voltage range, designed to operate from 2.0-5.0 V. This makes the RFIC booster chip more robust as battery voltages degrade in use and also makes it more suitable for a larger variety of supply voltages and different applications.","Next will be described a preferred embodiment referred to as the Cascaded BPSK Modulator and PA Redesign with Current Mirror at 450 MHz (ARL08M450), schematically illustrated in .
