title: Carboxy isatin hydrazones and their esters as Shp2 inhibitors
abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) Shp2 is a non-receptor PTP that involved in cell signaling and regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Shp2 mediates activation of kinases that are involved in the pathogenesis of human carcinoma. A high throughput screen identified compounds that inhibit the PTP Shp2. Several compounds were identified that selectively inhibit Shp2 over Shp1 with low to sub-micromolar activity. Also disclosed are methods of inhibiting a protein tyrosine phosphatase in a cell and treating cancer through selective inhibition of Shp2.

CA118210 and CA077467, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to cancer therapy. More specifically, this invention comprises novel Shp2 inhibitors, a method to develop new Shp2 inhibitors, and a method of treating cancer using the inhibitors.","Tyrosyl phosphorylation regulates human cellular processes from cell differentiation and growth to apoptosis. The process of tyrosyl phosphorylation is regulated by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) and protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK). When this regulation is disrupted, diseases such as cancer can arise. (Mohi and Neel, The role of Shp2 (PTPN11) in cancer. Curr Opin Genet & Dev. 2007, 17, 23-30). Many studies in the last three decades have demonstrated the roles of various protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in human cancer (Blume-Jensen and Hunter, Oncogenic kinase signalling. Nature 2001; 411:355-65). PTK inhibitors such as imatinib and gefitinib are now well-recognized as targeted therapy drugs in cancer treatment (Deininger, et al., The development of imatinib as a therapeutic agent for chronic myeloid leukemia. Blood 2005; 105:2640-53; Mulloy, et al., Epidermal growth factor receptor mutants from human lung cancers exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and increased sensitivity to gefitinib. Cancer Res 2007; 67:2325-30). Though more research exists for PTKs, as the first PTK was synthesized 10 years earlier than the first PTP, recent discoveries have found that PTPs have a prominent role in tyrosyl phosphorylation. (Alonso, et al., Protein tyrosine phophatases in the human genome. Cell. 2004, 117, 699-711).","PTPs catalyze the reverse reaction of PTKs, however increasing evidence suggests that cell signaling and oncogenesis require coordinated action of both PTKs and PTPs. For instance, PTPs such as Shp2, PTP1B, Cdc25, and PRL-3 have been found to be positively involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression (Bentires-Alj, et al., Activating mutations of the noonan syndrome-associated SHP2\/PTPN11 gene in human solid tumors and adult acute myelogenous leukemia. Cancer Res 2004; 64:8816-20; Boutros, et al., CDC25 phosphatases in cancer cells: key players? Good targets? Nat Rev Cancer 2007; 7:495-507; Stephens B J, Han H, Gokhale V, Von Hoff D D. PRL phosphatases as potential molecular targets in cancer. Mol Cancer Ther 2005; 4:1653-61; Tonks and Muthuswamy, A brake becomes an accelerator: PTP1B-a new therapeutic target for breast cancer. Cancer Cell 2007; 11:214-6). Consequently, the search for PTP inhibitors as a new class of potential drugs for targeted cancer therapy has intensified in recent years (Jiang and Zhang, Targeting PTPs with small molecule inhibitors in cancer treatment. Cancer Metastasis Rev 2008; 27:263-72; Lawrence, et al., Inhibitors of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2) based on oxindole scaffolds. J Med Chem 2008; 51:4948-56; Hellmuth, et al., Specific inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 identified by high-throughput docking. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2008; 105:7275-80; Geronikaki, et al. 2-Thiazolylimino\/heteroarylimino-5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinones as new agents with SHP-2 inhibitory action. J Med Chem 2008; 51:5221-8; Johnston, et al., Cdc25B dualspecificity phosphatase inhibitors identified in a high-throughput screen of the NIH compound library. Assay Drug Dev Technol 2009; 7:250-65).","Shp2, encoded by the PTPN11 gene, is a non-receptor PTP containing two SH2 domains, a PTP domain, and a C-terminal region (Neel, et al., The \u2018Shp\u2019ing news: SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases in cell signaling. Trends Biochem Sci 2003; 28:284-93). It is part of the src homology domain (SH2) and necessary for embryonic development and growth factor, cytokine, and extra-cellular matrix signaling (Salmond and Alexander, SHP2 forecast for the immune system:fog gradually clearing. Trends Immunol 2006, 27, 154-60) and effect cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The N-SH2 domain in the wildtype Shp2 interacts with the PTP domain, resulting in autoinhibition of the Shp2 PTP activity. When the SH2 domains bind to specific phosphotyrosine docking sites in growth factor- or cytokine-stimulated cells, it relieves the autoinhibition and Shp2 is activated (Cunnick, et al., Phosphotyrosines 627 and 659 of Gab1 constitute a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) conferring binding and activation of SHP2. J Biol Chem 2001; 276:24380-7).","A well-recognized Shp2-regulated signaling pathway is the Ras-Erk1\/2 MAP pathway. For instance, Shp2 is positively involved in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation (Cunnick, et al., Phosphotyrosines 627 and 659 of Gab1 constitute a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) conferring inding and activation of SHP2. J Biol Chem 2001; 276:24380-7; Ren, et al., Roles of Gab1 and SHP2 in paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation and Src activation in response to epidermal growth factor. J Biol Chem 2004; 279:8497-505). Shp2 PTP activity is required for transformation of human glioblastoma cells by EGFRvIII (Zhan, et al., The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is required for EGFRvIII oncogenic transformation in human glioblastoma cells. Exp Cell Res 2009; 315:2343-57) and human mammary epithelial cells by ErbB2 (Zhou and Agazie, Molecular mechanism for SHP2 in promoting HER2-induced signaling and transformation. J Biol Chem 2009; 284:12226-34). In the last few years, mutations in the Shp2 gene PTPN11 have been identified in several types of leukemias and in some cases of solid tumors (Bentires-Alj, et al. Activating mutations of the noonan syndrome-associated SHP2\/PTPN11 gene in human solid tumors and adult acute myelogenous leukemia. Cancer Res 2004; 64:8816-20; Tartaglia and Gelb, Germ-line and somatic PTPN11 mutations in human disease. Eur J Med Genet 2005; 48:81-96; Mohi and Neel, The role of Shp2 (PTPN11) in cancer. Curr Opin Genet & Dev. 2007, 17, 23-30).","Mutations in the PTPN11 gene and Shp2 can cause Noonan syndrome, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and LEOPARD (lentigines, electrocardiogram abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonic valvular stenosis, abnormalities of genitalia, retardation of growth, and deafness). Within these diseases, Shp2 is uninhibited and interacts with the docking protein Gab family. This interaction activates a pathway leading to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The identification of Shp2's role in these diseases is very important for developing cancer therapy. Targeting and inhibiting Shp2 with small molecule inhibitors has become a major goal in developing a new cancer therapy. These mutations and other cancer-associated Shp2 mutants are predicted or have been demonstrated to be gain-of-function mutations (Bentires-Alj, et al. Activating mutations of the noonan syndrome-associated SHP2\/PTPN11 gene in human solid tumors and adult acute myelogenous leukemia. Cancer Res 2004; 64:8816-20; Ren, et al., Shp2E76K mutant confers cytokine-independent survival of TF-1 myeloid cells by up-regulating Bcl-XL. J Biol Chem 2007; 282:36463-73; Keilhack, et al., Diverse biochemical properties of Shp2 mutants. Implications for disease phenotypes. J Biol Chem 2005; 280:30984-93). Importantly, no loss-of-function Shp2 mutant has ever been found in human cancer.","Shp2 plays a positive role in the Ras-Erk1\/2 MAP kinase pathway, however several reports indicated that Shp2 is a negative regulator of interferon (IFN) signaling. Shp2 was able to dephosphorylate STAT1 in vitro, suggesting that STAT1 is a substrate of Shp2 PTP (Wu, et al., SHP-2 is a dualspecificity phosphatase involved in Stat1 dephosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine residues in nuclei. J Biol Chem 2002; 277:47572-80). Consistently, increased IFN-stimulated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking a functional Shp2 (Wu, et al., SHP-2 is a dualspecificity phosphatase involved in Stat1 dephosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine residues in nuclei. J Biol Chem 2002; 277:47572-80; You, et al., Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase functions as a negative regulator of the interferon-stimulated Jak\/STAT pathway. Mol Cell Biol 1999; 19:2416-24). The inhibitory effect of Shp2 on STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation may contribute to modulation of the antiviral effect of IFN (Baron and Davignon, Inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation by human CMV is mediated by SHP2. J Immunol 2008; 181:5530-6).","While PTPs have increasingly attracted attention as novel targets of cancer drug discovery, only a few selective PTP inhibitors have been characterized biologically. Among PTP inhibitors identified in recent years, many of them contain one or more negatively-charged functional groups (Jiang and Zhang, Targeting PTPs with small molecule inhibitors in cancer treatment. Cancer Metastasis Rev 2008; 27:263-72; Hellmuth, et al., Specific inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 identified by high-throughput docking. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2008; 105:7275-80; Bialy and Waldmann, Inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatases: next-generation drugs? Angew Chem Int Ed Engl 2005; 44:3814-39; Chen, et al., Discovery of a novel shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Mol Pharmacol 2006; 70:562-70). This property is reminiscent of PTP substrates since phosphotyrosine is negatively charged and negatively charged Asp and Glu residues are frequently present near tyrosine phosphorylation sites. While aryl sulfonic compounds have been found to exert cellular activities in some cases (Hellmuth, et al., Specific inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 identified by high-throughput docking. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2008; 105:7275-80; Zhan, et al. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is required for EGFRvIII oncogenic transformation in human glioblastoma cells. Exp Cell Res 2009; 315:2343-57; Chen, et al., Discovery of a novel shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Mol Pharmacol 2006; 70:562-70; Zhao, et al., Regulation of ACh receptor clustering by the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2. Dev Neurobiol 2007; 67:1789-801; Fuchikawa, et al. Protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is involved in Semaphorin 4D-induced axon repulsion. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2009; 385:6-10), compounds containing aryl phosphate or carboxylate groups often require modifications for cell permeation and\/or prodrug strategies for delivery into cells (Boutselis, e tal. Synthesis and cell-based activity of a potent and selective protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor prodrug. J Med Chem 2007; 50:856-64).","Currently, there are a few known inhibitors of Shp2. Two of these compounds are CDL 4340-0580 and NAT6-297775, seen in . (Noren-Muller A., et al.: Discovery of protein phosphatase inhibitor classes by biology-oriented synthesis. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2006, 103, 10606-11). Although these compounds have the ability to inhibit Shp2, they also inhibit tumor suppressor Shp1, which is not the cause of these malignancies. Ultimately, a Shp2 inhibitor should only affect Shp2 and not other important cellular processes.","Accordingly, there remains an unmet need for additional inhibitory compounds for the prevention and treatment of precancerous or cancerous lesions, particularly for lesions utilizing Shp2. The present invention further meets these important needs, and others, as will become apparent in the teachings that follow.","The development of a Shp2-specific inhibitor that does not cross-inhibit Shp1 is important for development of effective treatment modalities. Developing a Shp2-specific inhibitor is complicated by the similarity between Shp1 and Shp2, which share 60% overall sequence identity and approximately 75% similarity in their PTP domains. However, Shp1 and Shp2 catalytic domains have different substrate specificity (Tenev, T., et al., 1997, 272, 5966-73; O'Reilly, A., Neel, B., 1998, 18, 161-77) suggesting that the catalytic cleft is not identical. Furthermore, the surface electrostatic potential of the catalytic cleft is much more positive in human Shp2 than in human Shp1. (Yang, J., et al., 1998, 273, 28199-207). The PTP catalytic cleft consists of a base and four sides in the 3D structures (Hof P, et al. 1998, 92(4):441-450; Yang J, et al. 2003, 278(8):6516-6520). Although amino acid residues present at the base of Shp1 and Shp2 PTP catalytic clefts are identical, all four sides of the catalytic cleft contain one or more residues that are different between Shp1 and Shp2.","A previous study identified NSC-117199 as a lead compound of Shp2 inhibitor, and over 100 analogs synthesized (Lawrence, et al., Inhibitors of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2) based on oxindole scaffolds. J Med Chem 2008; 51:4948-56). Based on the high throughput screening, XW2-011B from HePTP screens, seen in , was synthesized, exhibiting an ICof 47.8 \u03bcM. Focused libraries based on these hits have been prepared and assessed for Shp2 inhibitory activity. As an initial step, building block molecules were synthesized. An indoline skeleton molecule was then constructed, which was used to couple with the individual building blocks to afford the target molecules. Additional target molecules were also produced by coupling different acid chlorides and isocyanates with the indoline core. Finally, a chemical probe was also synthesized as a subunit for potential small molecules to develop another biologically active, small molecule skeleton like the indoline.

In particular, the \u201csubjects\u201d of the present invention are organisms in need of diagnosis or treatment for a cancer or pre-cancer or lesion thereof.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the subject invention can be formulated according to known methods for preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions. Furthermore, as used herein, the phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d means any of the standard pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can include diluents, adjuvants, and vehicles, as well as implant carriers, and inert, non-toxic solid or liquid fillers, diluents, or encapsulating material that does not react with the active ingredients of the invention. Examples include, but are not limited to, phosphate buffered saline, physiological saline, water, and emulsions, such as oil\/water emulsions. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. Formulations are described in a number of sources that are well known and readily available to those skilled in the art. For example, (Martin E W [1995] Easton Pa., Mack Publishing Company, 19ed.) describes formulations which can be used in connection with the subject invention.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include, for example, aqueous sterile injection solutions, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and nonaqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the condition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powder, granules, tablets, etc. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of the subject invention can include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question. The pharmaceutical composition can be adapted for various forms of administration. Administration can be continuous or at distinct intervals as can be determined by a person skilled in the art.","The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations as are known in the art. A therapeutically effective amount of the compounds, or any combination thereof is that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The amount of Shp2 inhibitors, compounds described herein, or any combination thereof must be effective to achieve a response, including but not limited to total prevention of (e.g., protection against) and to improved survival rate or more rapid recovery, or improvement or elimination of symptoms associated with neoproliferative disease, including but not limited to, cancer and precancerous lesions, or other indicators as are selected as appropriate measures by those skilled in the art. In accordance with the present invention, a suitable single dose size is a dose that is capable of preventing or alleviating (reducing or eliminating) a symptom in a patient when administered one or more times over a suitable time period. One of skill in the art can readily determine appropriate single dose sizes for systemic administration based on the size of a mammal and the route of administration. An effective amount can be administered in one or more doses. In the case of cancer, the effective amount of the drug or composition may: (i) reduce the number of cancer cells; (ii) reduce tumor size; (iii) inhibit, retard, slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (iv) inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; (v) inhibit tumor growth; (vi) prevent or delay occurrence and\/or recurrence of tumor; and\/or (vii) relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer.","All reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) or H NMR. Some products, which could not be purified by simply washing, were purified by Flashmaster chromatography. All compounds were confirmed by H and C NMR, and Mass Spectra collected where available. After the purity and structure were confirmed, samples were tested for ICby DiFMUP assay, seen in Table 1, appended.","Computer docking was performed with the X-ray crystal structure of human Shp2 (PDB identification code: 2SHP) (Hof, et al., Crystal structure of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Cell 1998; 92:441-50) using the GLIDE (Grid-Based Ligand Docking from Energetics software available from Schr\u00f6dinger, L.L.C.) program similar to that reported (Chen, et al., Discovery of a novel shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Mol Pharmacol 2006; 70:562-70). The Jorgensen OPLS-2001 force field was applied in the GLIDE program. The optimal binding geometry was obtained by utilization of Monte Carlo sampling techniques coupled with energy minimization.","An anti-His-tag antibody (Qiagen) was immobilized on a CM5 Sensor Chip for Biacore T100 using a protocol similar to that described (Muller, et al., Tandem immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography\/immunoaffinity purification of His-tagged proteins\u2014evaluation of two anti-His-tag monoclonal antibodies. Anal Biochem 1998; 259:54-61). His-tagged Shp2 (amino acids 1-525) was captured on this antibody surface for each cycle of compound or running buffer injection. SPI-112 meglumine salt was diluted in the running buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.01% TritonX-100, 3% DMSO) to yield final inhibitor concentrations of 10.2, 3.3, 1.1, 0.37, and 0.12 \u03bcM. Duplicate independent kinetics experiments were carried out in a manner similar to that used by Nordin and colleagues (Nordin, et al., Kinetic studies of small molecule interactions with protein kinases using biosensor technology. Anal Biochem 2005; 340:359-68). Kinetics analysis was performed using BIA evaluation software (GE Lifesciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) fitting Langmuir (1:1) binding. Local Rcalculations were used for our model fitting due to variation between cycles in theoretical Rvalues. Baseline RU drift over time in each experiment was corrected to improve the fitting (Joss L, et al., Interpreting kinetic rate constants from optical biosensor data recorded on a decaying surface. Anal Biochem 1998; 261:203-10).","The kinetic constant and rates of association and dissociation were from the average of two experiments.","MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and HT-29 colon cancer cells were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)\/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and RPMI 1640\/10% FBS, respectively. TF-1\/Shp2E76K and TF-1\/V cells were established by infection of TF-1 cells with a retrovirus encoding a Flag-tagged Shp2E76K mutant or the control virus as reported previously (Ren, et al., Shp2E76K mutant confers cytokine-independent survival of TF-1 myeloid cells by up-regulating Bcl-XL. J Biol Chem 2007; 282:36463-73). Flp-In-T-Rex-293 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) containing a doxycycline (dox)-inducible Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N chimera (Chen, et al., Discovery of a novel shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Mol Pharmacol 2006; 70:562-70) was used.","In vitro Shp2 PTP activity inhibition assay for determination of ICwas performed with a recombinant GST-Shp2 PTP domain protein using 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP, Invitrogen) as the substrate similar to that described previously (Chen, et al., Discovery of a novel shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Mol Pharmacol 2006; 70:562-70). Curve fitting and ICwere obtained using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software).","Enzyme kinetics analysis was performed with a non-fusion Shp2 PTP protein in which the GST fragment had been removed by PreScission protease and using DiFMUP as the substrate. Reaction was carried out in duplicate at room temperature in black, half-area 96-well plates. Each reaction mixture (75 \u03bcl) contained 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% Triton-X100, 18.7-280 \u03bcM DiFMUP, 3% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, vehicle) or SPI-112 (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 \u03bcM), and 0.16 \u03bcM Shp2 PTP protein. Reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme. Fluorescent signal was measured at 5 and 10 min with a Wallac 1420 VictorMultilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer; Waltham, Mass.) at excitation\/emission wavelengths of 355 nm\/460 nm. Fluorescent signal was converted to the amount of product (nmole) using reference curve generated with 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferone (DiFMU, Invitrogen). Data obtained at the 5 min time point was used in the kinetics analysis. This is because >5% of substrate had been converted to the fluorescent DiFMU product at the later time point in some reaction wells and thus the steady state enzyme kinetics could no longer be ensured.

JF035, JF039, and JF038 have a fluorine at the ortho, meta, or para positions, respectively. The ICdata for these compounds are used to provide a comparison of the effect that fluorine has on the phenyl ring in different positions. JF040 is an analog that contains a trifluoromethyl group in the ortho position.","Chemical Synthesis of SPI-112 and SPI-112Me","SPI-112, seen in , was synthesized based on a hit (NSC-117199) from the NCI Diversity Set-1 in our lead optimization effort (Lawrence, et al., Inhibitors of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2) based on oxindole scaffolds. J Med Chem 2008; 51:4948-56). In SPR binding assay, SPI-112 displayed a 1:1 stoichiometric binding kinetics to Shp2 with a kinetic constant (K) of 1.30+0.14 \u03bcM and the association and dissociation rates of K=2.24\u00d710\/Ms and K=0.029\/s, seen in . However, SPI-112 and other NSC-117199 analogs had no detectable activity in cell-based Shp2 inhibition assays, suggesting that they are not cell permeable. This is likely due to the presence of a negatively charged carboxylic acid on these Shp2 inhibitors.","SPI-112 [(Z)-3-(2-(5-(N-(4-fluorobenzyl)sulfamoyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)hydrazinyl)benzoic acid] and SPI-112Me [(Z)-3-(2-(5-(N-(4-fluorobenzyl)sulfamoyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene) hydrazinyl)benzoic acid methyl ester] were synthesized using procedure similar to that described previously (Lawrence, et al., Inhibitors of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2) based on oxindole scaffolds. J Med Chem 2008; 51:4948-56). Several libraries of hydrazones were prepared by combining a 5-substituted isatin with commercially available hydrazines; the sulfonyl and carboxyl groups were elaborated with a further set of amines to provide sulfonamides and amides, as described in Wu, et al. (PCT\/US2009\/042305; 2009). The novel oxindole hydrazone sulfonamide library was developed using commercially available building blocks as shown in FIG. 5 of Wu, et al. (PCT\/US2009\/042305; 2009). The oxindolesulfonyl chloride was obtained from commercially available isatin-5-sulfonic acid according to a literature reported procedure. (Lee, D., et al., 2001, 44, 2015-2026). Isatin-5-sulfonyl chloride was coupled to a series of requisite amines to obtain the sulfonamide library. The hydrazone library was obtained by microwave assisted coupling of the crude sulfonamide library with an appropriate set of hydrazines in moderate yields.","To circumvent the cell permeation issue, a methyl ester analog of SPI-112 was prepared (SPI-112Me) to shield the negative charge of the carboxylic acid group of SPI-112, seen in . The methyl ester analog hydrolyzes to the corresponding carboxylic acid by cellular esterases upon entry into cells similar to other methyl ester prodrugs (Streiber, et al., Methyl esters of N-(dicyclohexyl)acetyl-piperidine-4-(benzylidene-4-carboxylic acids) as drugs and prodrugs: a new strategy for dual inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase type 1 and type 2.

Oncogene 1995; 10:1763-79).","The methyl ester 1 (SPI-112Me), seen in , was prepared using the procedure similar to that described earlier (Lawrence, et al., Inhibitors of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shpt) based on oxindole scaffolds. J Med Chem 2008; 51:4948-56).","2,3-Dioxoindoline-5-sulfonyl chloride 2 was generated using the procedure described by Lee et al. (Lee, et al. Potent and selective nonpeptide inhibitors of caspases 3 and 7. J Med Chem 2001; 44:2015-26) from isatin-5-sulfonic acid sodium salt dihydrate (Aldrich) (4.25 g) gave 2 (7.14 g, 40%). 2,3-Dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-5-sulfonic acid 4-fluorobenzylamide 3. Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (6.03 mL, 34.9 mmol) and 4-fluorobenzylamine (2.80 g, 22.35 mmol) were added to a solution of the sulfonyl chloride 2 (4.25 g, 17.25 mmol) in anhydrous THF (120 mL) at 0\u00b0 C. under inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred overnight. The resulting mixture was poured into water (100 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3\u00d750 mL). The combined extracts were dried (NaSO) and evaporated to provide 3 (7.14 g) as a yellow-orange solid. This crude product was used without further purification.","The sulfonamide 3 was prepared from the sulfonyl chloride 2 and used without purification. When the reaction of 3 was performed on a small scale (0.5 g), the product carboxylic acid was isolated as a single geometric isomer (previously assigned as the Z-isomer). Attempts to prepare the reaction at larger scales in the microwave reactor led to significant contamination of the product with the E-isomer).","(Z)-3-(2-(5-(N-(4-Fluorobenzyl)sulfamoyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)hydrazinyl)benzoic acid 4 was then generated using a mixture of crude 3 (0.5 g) and 3-hydrazinobenzoic acid (0.23 g, 1.5 mmol) in ethanol (5.0 mL) were heated in a microwave reactor (Biotage Initiator) for 10 minutes at 100\u00b0 C. The yellow solid that formed was isolated by filtration on a sintered funnel to provide the product (0.44 g). Under these optimized reaction conditions, approximately 3% of the E isomer was observed by H NMR. The process was repeated 3 times with the same amounts (exceeding the indicated amounts led to product contaminated with 10% of the E isomer), as seen in . The combined yield of 4 was 1.77 g (78% from 2). The analytical data of 4 (H NMR, C NMR, LC-MS) agrees with that previously reported (Lawrence, et al., Inhibitors of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2) based on oxindole scaffolds. J Med Chem 2008; 51:4948-56)","(Z)-3-(2-(5-(N-(4-Fluorobenzyl)sulfamoyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)hydrazinyl)benzoic acid methyl ester 1. Thionyl chloride (0.3 mL) was carefully added, dropwise and at 0\u00b0 C., to a mixture of 4 (120 mg, 0.25 mmol) and methanol (1.5 mL) in a microwave tube (CEM, 5 mL size) equipped with a stirring bar. After the addition was completed, the tube was capped and heated in a CEM Discover microwave (MaxPower mode; run time: 5 minutes; hold time: 30 minutes; max pressure: 300 psi; stirring: on) at 85\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The crude product which precipitated was collected by filtration (sintered funnel) and washed with methanol (2.0 mL). (NB: metallic spatulas or other metallic tools should be avoided until all the thionyl chloride has been removed). The process was repeated 8 times and the products combined and re-dissolved in 100 mL THF. Removal of THF under vacuum afforded the ester 1 (922 mg, 85%) as a yellow solid; HPLC purity: 99.0% (C18 column; 20% water in MeOH, flow rate 1.0 mL\/min, t=4.6 min). Esterification of the acid 4 gave the methyl ester 1 that was 99.0% pure as measured by HPLC. The analytical data of 1 (H NMR, C NMR, LC-MS) agrees with that previously reported Lawrence, et al., Inhibitors of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2) based on oxindole scaffolds. J Med Chem 2008; 51:4948-56), as seen in .","In vitro Shp2 PTP inhibition assay showed that, while SPI-112 potently inhibited Shp2 PTP (IC: 1.0 \u03bcM) as reported previously (Lawrence, et al., Inhibitors of Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (Shp2) based on oxindole scaffolds. J Med Chem 2008; 51:4948-56), the methyl ester analog did not inhibit Shp2 PTP (IC>100 \u03bcM), seen in . Computer modeling, shown in , suggested that SPI-112 binds to the catalytic pocket. The phenyl carboxylic acid points inwards mimicking a phosphotyrosine residue, forming hydrogen bonds with Gly-464 and Arg-465 of the P-loop, and this suggests that it is essential for binding and consequently the inhibitory activity. In agreement with the computer model, enzyme kinetic data obtained with SPI-112 were best fitted with the competitive inhibition model (K: 0.8 \u03bcM; seen in ), suggesting that SPI-112 interacts with the catalytic site of Shp2.","SPI-112 and SPI-112Me emitted concentration-dependent fluorescent signal under a Wallac 2100 EnVision multilable plate reader (PerkinElmer) at excitation\/emission wavelengths of 485 nm\/535 nm. This property provided a means for us to assess the cellular uptake of SPI-112 and SPI-112Me. TF-1\/Shp2cells were incubated with SPI-112 and SPI-112Me at different concentrations and then measured the fluorescent signal in cell culture, cell-free medium, and the cell pellets. When TF-1\/Shp2cells were incubated with SPI-112, essentially all fluorescent signal remained in the cell-free supernatants and only trace amount of fluorescent signal was associated with the cell pellets, see in . In contrast, when TF-1\/Shp2cells were incubated with SPI-112Me, with a substantial amount (21-36%) of fluorescent signal detected in the cells, seen in ). These results suggest that SPI-112Me, but not SPI-112, is able to enter cells.","Shp2 is activated by EGF in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. To test if SPI-112Me and SPI-112 are able to inhibit EGF-stimulated Shp2 in the cells, serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells were pre-treated with or without SPI-112Me or SPI-112 and then stimulated with EGF. Shp2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate supernatants and its PTP activity was determined. Shp2 from EGF-stimulated cells had 2.6-fold higher PTP activity, seen in  and (B). SPI-112Me (20 \u03bcM) pretreatment significantly reduced the EGF-stimulated Shp2 PTP activity by 77% (p=0.003), seen in . In contrast, SPI-112 did not affect the EGF-stimulated Shp2 PTP activity, seen in . Paxillin is a physiological substrate of Shp2 (Hellmuth, et al., Specific inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 identified by high-throughput docking. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2008; 105:7275-80; Ren, et al., Roles of Gab1 and SHP2 in paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation and Src activation in response to epidermal growth factor. J Biol Chem 2004; 279:8497-505; Manes, et al., Concerted activity of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and focal adhesion kinase in regulation of cell motility. Mol Cell Biol 1999; 19:3125-35; Vadlamudi, et al., Differential regulation of components of the focal adhesion complex by heregulin: role of phosphatase SHP-2. J Cell Physiol 2002; 190:189-99). It was previously demonstrated that Shp2 dephosphorylates paxillin in EGF-stimulated MDA-MB-468 cells (Ren Y, Meng S, Mei L, Zhao Z J, Jove R, Wu J. Roles of Gab1 and SHP2 in paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation and Src activation in response to epidermal growth factor. J Biol Chem 2004; 279:8497-505). Inhibition of EGF-stimulated paxillin dephosphorylation is an established surrogate marker of Shp2 inhibition (Hellmuth, et al., Specific inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 identified by high-throughput docking. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2008; 105:7275-80; Chen, et al., Discovery of a novel Shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Mol Pharmacol 2006; 70:562-70). Paxillin became dephosphorylated in EGF-stimulated cells, as seen in . Pretreatment of MDA-MB-468 cells with SPI-112Me prevented EGF-induced paxillin tyrosine dephosphorylation. Shp2 is known to mediate EGF-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation. To determine if SPI-112Me is able to inhibit EGF-stimulated Erk1\/2 activation, MDA-MB-468 cells were pre-treated with SPI-112Me at various concentrations (0-20 \u03bcM) and then stimulated with EGF. Erk1\/2 activation was assessed by immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates with an antibody against the active, dual phosphorylated form of Erk1\/2. Inhibition of EGF-stimulated pErk1\/2 signal was observed at 10 \u03bcM SPI-112Me in this assay, seen in . Shp2 is involved in EGF-stimulated MDA-MB-468 cell migration. EGF-stimulated MDA-MB-468 cell migration was measured by the Transwell cell migration assay in the presence or absence of SPI-112Me, as seen in . EGF-increased MDA-MB-468 cell migration 2.5-fold, while EGF-stimulated MDA-MB-468 cell migration was reduced 62% by 12.5 \u03bcM SPI-112Me and was completed blocked in the presence of 25 \u03bcM SPI-112Me. These data indicate that SPI-112Me may inhibit Shp2 PTP activity in the EGF-stimulated MDA-MB-468 cells.","To test the effects of SPI-112Me on Erk1\/2 activation, SPI-112Me was introduced into a Gab1-Shp2 chimera. It was previously shown that expression of a fusion protein consisting of the Gab1 PH domain and an N\u2014SH2 domain deletion mutant of Shp2 (Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N) caused constitutive Erk1\/2 activation (Chen, et al., Discovery of a novel shp2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Mol Pharmacol 2006; 70:562-70; Cunnick, et al., Regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway by SHP2. J Biol Chem 2002; 277:9498-504). The Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N-induced Erk1\/2 activation bypasses the up-stream growth factor receptor signaling steps. HEK293 cells containing dox-inducible Gab1PHShp2\u0394N were generated using Flp-In-T-Rex-293 cells (Dox-G1S2). Dox-G1S2 cells which did not receive dox treatment did not express Flag-tagged Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N, and showed a low basal level of pErk1\/2, as shown in  and (B). Incubation of cells with dox induced Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N expression and activation of Erk1\/2, whereas dox had no effect on Erk1\/2 activation in the parental Flp-In-T-Rex-293 cells. Inhibition of Gab1PH-Shp2\u0394N-induced Erk1\/2 activation was observed in the presence of 10-25 \u03bcM SPI-112Me, seen in .","SPI-112Me was introduced into leukemia-associated Shp2TF-1 Cells. The gain-of-function Shp2E76K mutant has constitutively active PTP activity and is able to transform the cytokine-dependent TF-1 myeloid cells into cytokine-independence by upregulation of Bcl-XL through the Erk1\/2 pathway (Ren, et al., Shp2E76K mutant confers cytokine-independent survival of TF-1 myeloid cells by up-regulating Bcl-XL. J Biol Chem 2007; 282:36463-73). To assess if Shp2PTP activity was inhibited in SPI-112Me-treated TF-1\/Shp2cells, TF-1\/Shp2cells were incubated in GMCSF-free medium in the presence of different concentrations of SPI-112Me or a high concentration of SPI-112 (negative control). The Flag-tagged Shp2was immunoprecipitated and the PTP activity was measured. Whereas there was no decrease in the Shp2PTP activity in SPI-112-treated TF-1\/Shp2cells, lower Shp2PTP activity was detected in SPI-112Me-treated TF-1\/Shp2cells, seen in . Shp2activates Erk1\/2 and up-regulates Bcl-XL in TF-1 cells to confer cytokine-independent cell survival. Consistently, immunoblotting analyses of cell lysates showed that SPI-112Me reduced the amounts of pErk1\/2 and Bcl-XL in TF-1\/Shp2E76K cells in a concentration-dependent manner, seen in  and (B).","To determine if SPI-112Me and SPI-112 affect Shp2-dependent cell growth, TF-1\/Shp2cells were cultured in GM-CSF-free medium in the presence of various concentrations of SPI-112Me or SPI-112 for 4 days and relative viable cell number was measured. SPI-112Me caused a concentration-dependent decrease in viable cells, seen in . A 50% decrease in viable TF-1\/Shp2cells was observed at 10 \u03bcM SPI-112Me in this assay. In contrast, SPI-112 did not affect TF-1\/Shp2cells, which is consistent with the notion that SPI-112 is not cell permeable.","The decrease in viable cell number could be due to inhibition of cell survival, cell proliferation, or both. An initial testing indicated that SPI-112Me-treated cells were fluorogenic under the laser light of flow cytometer, interfering with flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis. Therefore, a microscopic EB\/AO staining assay (Ribble, et al., A simple technique for quantifying apoptosis in 96-well plates. BMC Biotechnol 2005; 5:12) was employed to examine apoptosis of SPI-112Me-treated TF-1\/Shp2cells.  and (B) illustrate the nuclear morphology of EB\/AO staining cells. As shown in , in the absence of SPI-112Me, there was an average of 4.2% of apoptotic cells. In the presence of 12.5 and 25 \u03bcM SPI-112Me, 9.3% and 18.8% of apoptotic cells were observed. Thus, SPI-112Me is able to inhibit Shp2-dependent survival of TF-1\/Shp2cells.","It was reported that STAT1 is a Shpt substrate (Wu, et al., SHP-2 is a dualspecificity phosphatase involved in Stat1 dephosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine residues in nuclei. J Biol Chem 2002; 277:47572-80) and increased IFN-stimulated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Shp2 knockout mice (You, et al., Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase functions as a negative regulator of the interferon-stimulated Jak\/STAT pathway. Mol Cell Biol 1999; 19:2416-24). STAT1 from HT-29 cells treated with or without IFN-\u03b3 was immunoprecipitated. As shown in  and (B), STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced by IFN-\u03b3 in HT-29 cells. Incubation of STAT1 isolated from IFN-\u03b3-treated cells with GST-Shp2 PTP protein in vitro resulted in concentration-dependent STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation, supporting the notion that pSTAT1 is a Shp2 PTP substrate, as seen in . It was reasoned that if SPI-112Me inhibits Shp2 PTP in the cells, it would enhance the IFN-\u03b3-stimulated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Indeed, comparison of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in HT-29 cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 alone or with a combination of IFN-\u03b3 and SPI-112Me showed increased amount of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 in cells treated with both IFN-\u03b3 and SPI-112Me, seen in . This results show that SPI-112Me was able to enhance the ability of IFN-\u03b3 to stimulate STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation.","To determine if SPI-112Me could enhance the STAT1-mediated transcription activity in response to a sub-saturated concentration of IFN-\u03b3, HT-29 cells were transfected with pISRE-Luc and n-gal plasmids, stimulated with 50 U\/ml IFN-\u03b3 in the presence or absence of SPI-112Me. IFN-\u03b3 alone activated the ISRE luciferase activity by 26%, which was further increased to 54% and 98% in the presence of 10 and 25 \u03bcM SPI-112Me, as seen in . It was reported that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) is a STAT1 target gene (Chin, et al., Cell growth arrest and induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 WAF1\/CIP1 mediated by STAT1. Science 1996; 272:719-22). As shown in , stimulation of HT-29 cells with IFN-\u03b3 increased p21 expression and higher levels of p21 were detected in HT-29 cells treated with both IFN-\u03b3 and SPI-112Me. To determine if SPI-112Me could enhance the anti-proliferative activity of IFN-\u03b3, HT-29 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 U\/ml IFN-\u03b3, 0-12.5 \u03bcM SPI-112Me, or combination of both agents for 4 days. Relative number of viable cells was measured and analyzed as fraction of inhibition, seen in . IFN-\u03b3 alone had a fraction of inhibition of 0.18. Similar to a previous report using a different Shp2 inhibitor, HT-29 cell growth was sensitive to inhibition of the Shp2 inhibitor. The fraction of inhibition caused by 6.25 and 12.5 \u03bcM SPI-112Me were 0.32 and 0.71, respectively. In the presence of both IFN-\u03b3 (100 U\/ml) and SPI-112Me (6.25 and 12.5 \u03bcM), the fraction of inhibition increased to 0.57 and 0.84, respectively. Thus, IFN-\u03b3 and SPI-112Me displayed a synergistic effect on inhibition of HT-29 cell growth.","Though SPI-112 is among the most potent in vitro Shp2 inhibitors derived from NSC-117199, its lack of activity in intake cells precluded its use in biological studies. Conversly, the methyl ester prodrug described herein enhances the cellular uptake of SPI-112. In vitro Shp2 PTP inhibition assay indicated that SPI-112Me had very weak Shp2 PTP inhibitor activity (IC>100 \u03bcM). This is consistent with the computer docking data, which suggests that the carboxylic acid group is involved in the binding of SPI-112 to the Shp2 PTP catalytic site. Thus, neutralization of the negative charge of the carboxylic acid with the methyl group is predicted to hinder the inhibitory activity.","Variations of the SPI-112Me compound were generated and tested to determine the effect of changing functional groups and moieties on the base compound. A meglumine salt-based variant, SPI-112-MEG, was generated as seen in . An Shp2 PTP inhibition assay was performed in vitro, comparing SPI-112 against SPI-112-MEG, with ICof 2.6 \u03bcM for SPI-112, and 2.8 \u03bcM for SPI-112-MEG, as seen in . SPI-112-MEG therefore provides the benefits of SPI-112Me's cellular uptake with the activity of SPI-112.","Several lines of evidence showed that Shp2 PTP activity and function were inhibited in cells treated with SPI-112Me, indicating that SPI-112Me is a cell-active Shp2 PTP inhibitor. These include 1) inhibition of EGF-stimulated Shp2 PTP activity, paxillin dephosphorylation, Erk1\/2 activation, and migration; 2) inhibition of Erk1\/2 activation induced by an intracellular Gab1-Shp2 chimera; 3) inhibition of PTP activity of the leukemia-associated Shp2mutant, Shp2-dependent Bcl-XL expression and cell survival; and 4) enhancement of IFN-\u03b3-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT1-mediated transcription activity, and anti-proliferation activity. Together with the SPI-112Me fluorescent uptake experiment, these data indicate that SPI-112Me is able to enter cells and suggest that SPI-112Me is converted to the potent Shp2 inhibitor SPI-112 in the cells.","Shp2 mutants such as Shp2are linked to several types of leukemias, particularly the deadly JMML. A transformation property of JMML cells is cytokine-independent growth. However, whether a Shp2 PTP inhibitor is sufficient to block Shp2 mutant-induced transformed phenotype in hematopoietic cells was not known. Although several reports have shown that the aryl sulfonic Shp2 inhibitor NSC-87877 that was previously identified is able to exert Shp2 inhibition activity in epithelial and neuronal cells (Zhan, et al., The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is required for EGFRvIII oncogenic transformation in human glioblastoma cells.

Dev Neurobiol 2007; 67:1789-801; Fuchikawa, et al., Protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is involved in Semaphorin 4D-induced axon repulsion. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2009; 385:6-10), it has no apparent activity in hematopoietic cells due to suspected poor uptake in hematopoietic cells. SPI-112Me represents the first cell-active Shp2 PTP inhibitor to display effectiveness of suppressing the PTP activity of a leukemia-associated Shp2 mutant and the Shp2 mutant-mediated cytokine-independence activity in hematopoietic cells.","While mutant Shp2 has been demonstrated as an oncogene in hematopoietic progenitor cells, it is not yet known whether mutant Shp2 is an oncogene in carcinomas. Shp2 mutations occur infrequently in carcinomas. Therefore, even if a gain-of-function Shp2 mutant can induce carcinomas, it is an uncommon event. However, the wildtype Shp2 is activated by oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases such as ErbB and Met and is positively involved in their signaling. It will be very important to evaluate if Shp2 is required for the initiation and maintenance of malignant phenotypes induced by these oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases and thus functions as a non-oncogene addiction gene (Luo, et al., Principles of cancer therapy: oncogene and nononcogene addiction. Cell 2009; 136:823-37) in carcinomas. The availability of SPI-112Me and other suitable Shp2 inhibitors should facilitate the evaluation of the role of Shp2 in carcinomas and the suitability of using a PTP inhibitor for cancer therapy.","It is demonstrate here that SPI-112Me can enhance IFN-\u03b3 signaling. This interesting finding not only provides a line of evidence that SPI-112Me is hitting the intended target (Shp2) in cancer cells but also reinforces the notion that SPI-112Me does not non-specifically impair the cellular signaling machinery or cell functions. This is because a global impairment of cellular functionality would likely prevent an increase in transcription activity. IFNs are noted for their anti-viral and anti-tumor activities but the use of high doses of IFNs is limited by toxicity. The development of SPI-112Me and other novel Shp2 inhibitors should facilitate the exploration of enhancing the anti-viral and anti-tumor efficacies of these biological agents at lower doses with a chemical inhibitor.","In the preceding specification, all documents, acts, or information disclosed does not constitute an admission that the document, act, or information of any combination thereof was publicly available, known to the public, part of the general knowledge in the art, or was known to be relevant to solve any problem at the time of priority.","The disclosures of all publications cited above are expressly incorporated herein by reference, each in its entirety, to the same extent as if each were incorporated by reference individually.","While there has been described and illustrated specific embodiments of a protein inhibitor, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that variations and modifications are possible without deviating from the broad spirit and principle of the present invention.
