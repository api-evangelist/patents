comprising at least one nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and, optionally, at least one nitric oxide enhancing compound and\/or at least one therapeutic agent. The invention also provides methods for (a) treating conditions resulting from excessive water and\/or electrolyte retention; (b) treating cardiovascular diseases; (c) treating renovascular diseases; (d) treating diabetes; (e) treating diseases resulting from oxidative stress; (f) treating endothelial dysfunctions; (g) treating diseases caused by endothelial dysfunctions; (h) treating cirrhosis; (j) treating pre-eclampsia; (k) treating osteoporosis; (l) treating nephropathy; (m) treating peripheral vascular diseases; (n) treating portal hypertension; (o) treating central nervous system disorders; (p) treating metabolic syndrome; (q) treating sexual dysfunctions; and (r) hyperlipidemia. The nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compounds comprise at least one nitric oxide enhancing group linked to the diuretic compound through one or more sites such as carbon, oxygen and\/or nitrogen via a bond or moiety that cannot be hydrolyzed.","The decline in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the United States over the past three decades has been the result of significant advances in research on cardiovascular disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. The incidence and prevalence of myocardial infarction and death from myocardial infarction, as well as that from cerebrovascular accident, have decreased significantly over this period largely owing to advances in prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of these very common diseases.","The compounds administered for the treatment of diuresis, cardiovascular diseases, and diseases resulting from oxidative and\/or endothelial dysfunctions often result in toxic, chronic and\/or debilitating side effects. Cardiovascular compounds such as ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blockers, antithrombotic and vasodilator compounds or anti-hyperlipidemic compounds, show, for example, respiratory toxicity resulting in asthma and\/or bronchitis. Hence there is a need in the art for compounds that have improved efficacy, lower toxicity and that can be used at low dosages. The invention is directed to these, as well as other, important ends.","The invention provides novel nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, comprising at least one nitric oxide enhancing group selected from an \u2014ONO group, an \u2014SNO group, an \u2014NNO group, an \u2014ONOgroup, an \u2014SNOgroup, an \u2014NNOgroup, an \u2014(NO-).M group, a heterocyclic nitric oxide donor group and a nitroxide group; where the nitric oxide enhancing group is directly or indirectly linked to the diuretic compound through one or more sites such as carbon, oxygen and\/or nitrogen via a bond or moiety that cannot be hydrolyzed. The heterocyclic nitric oxide donors are preferably furoxans, sydnonimines, oxatriazole-5-ones and\/or oxatriazole-5-imines. The nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compounds are not pro-drugs of the parent diuretic compound. The invention also provides compositions comprising the novel compounds described herein in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The invention is also based on the discovery that administering at least one diuretic compound comprising at least one nitric oxide enhancing group selected from an \u2014ONO group, an \u2014SNO group, an \u2014NNO group, an \u2014ONOgroup, an \u2014SNOgroup, an \u2014NNOgroup, an \u2014(NO-).M group, a heterocyclic nitric oxide donor group and a nitroxide group; wherein the nitric oxide enhancing group is directly or indirectly linked to the diuretic compound through one or more sites such as carbon, oxygen and\/or nitrogen via a bond or moiety that cannot be hydrolyzed, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and, optionally, at least one nitric oxide enhancing compound improves the properties of the diuretic compound. Nitric oxide enhancing compounds include, for example, S-nitrosothiols, nitrites, nitrates, N-oxo-N-nitrosamines, furoxans, sydnonimines, SPM 3672, SPM 4757, SPM 5185, SPM 5186 and analogues thereof, substrates of the various isozymes of nitric oxide synthase, and nitroxides. Thus, another embodiment of the invention provides compositions comprising at least one nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compound and at least one nitric oxide enhancing compound. The invention also provides for such compositions in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The invention provides compositions comprising at least one nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compound, and, optionally, at least one nitric oxide enhancing compound and\/or at least one therapeutic agent, including, but not limited to, aldosterone antagonists, alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists, angiotensin II antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antidiabetic compounds, anti-hyperlipidemic compounds, antioxidants, antithrombotic and vasodilator compounds, \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists, calcium channel blockers, digitalis, diuretics, endothelin antagonists, hydralazine compounds, Hreceptor antagonists, neutral endopeptidase inhibitors, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory compounds (NSAIDs), phosphodiesterase inhibitors, potassium channel blockers, platelet reducing agents, proton pump inhibitors, renin inhibitors, selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, and combinations of two or more thereof.

Such compositions can also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.","Suppositories for vaginal or rectal administration of the compounds and compositions of the invention can be prepared by mixing the compounds or compositions with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols which are solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature, such that they will melt in the rectum and release the drug.","Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing agents, wetting agents and\/or suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be used are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Sterile fixed oils are also conventionally used as a solvent or suspending medium.","The compositions of this invention can further include conventional excipients, i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral application which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, for example, water, salt solutions, alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, surfactants, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, petroethral fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and the like.

For sustained release administration, microparticle dosage forms comprising pure, crystalline, therapeutic agents. The therapeutic dosage forms of this aspect of the invention may be of any configuration suitable for sustained release.","Nanoparticle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms are preferably biodegradable and, optionally, bind to the vascular smooth muscle cells and enter those cells, primarily by endocytosis. The biodegradation of the nanoparticles occurs over time (e.g., 30 to 120 days; or 10 to 21 days) in prelysosomic vesicles and lysosomes. Larger microparticle therapeutic dosage forms of the invention release the therapeutic agents for subsequent target cell uptake with only a few of the smaller microparticles entering the cell by phagocytosis. A practitioner in the art will appreciate that the precise mechanism by which a target cell assimilates and metabolizes a dosage form of the invention depends on the morphology, physiology and metabolic processes of those cells. The size of the particle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms is also important with respect to the mode of cellular assimilation. For example, the smaller nanoparticles can flow with the interstitial fluid between cells and penetrate the infused tissue. The larger microparticles tend to be more easily trapped interstitially in the infused primary tissue, and thus are useful to deliver anti-proliferative therapeutic agents.","Particular sustained release dosage forms of the invention comprise biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles. More particularly, biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles are formed of a polymer containing matrix that biodegrades by random, nonenzymatic, hydrolytic scissioning to release therapeutic agent, thereby forming pores within the particulate structure.","In a particular embodiment, the compositions of the invention are orally administered as a sustained release tablet or a sustained release capsule. For example, the sustained release formulations can comprise an effective amount of at least one nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and, optionally at least one nitric oxide donor, or the sustained release formulations can comprise an effective amount of at least one nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one nitric oxide donor, and, optionally at least one therapeutic agent","The compounds and compositions of the invention can be formulated as pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms.
