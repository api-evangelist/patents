title: Flexible payload module with inflatable grippers
abstract: A module for a payload that utilizes individual grippers in which each fill to a conical shape from an interior wall of the module toward a payload in the module. The shape of the grippers provides a holding strength on and lateral stability for the payload. The angle of the conical shape transfers the axial force of the payload into a tensional load on the gripper where it has comparatively greater strength. The conical shape of each gripper allows for more complete capture of a payload in that the grippers fill voids around the payload. Since there are more contact points with the grippers and the payload, the contact force required for an adequate capture can be spread out.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a payload module capable of storing payloads of various shapes. The payload module utilizes a flexible material that can conform to the shape of the payload by being inflated for a gripping action on the payload.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","As a result of evolving missions and the limitations of space on naval vessels, a need exists to transport special equipment (such as motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, jet skis, rafts, boats, etc.) using payload modules.","Presently, payload modules transport special equipment includes handling gear that is specifically designed for the equipment to be transported. Since the types of equipment or payload items may vary extensively, it is necessary to provide a flexible payload module that could be used for many items as opposed to being designed specifically for just one.","In the Ono reference (U.S. Pat. No. 4,155,453), an inflatable grip container is provided. As shown with the example camera in  of the reference, the container (buoyant case ) is a broad inflatable bag that would be limited to the extending sections of the camera (or alternate payload). Since the contour of the camera is not fully covered, compartments (item ) exist in which the camera (or alternate payload) is not securable.","In the Kieselewski reference (U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,231), a pneumatic device for holding articles in containers is provided. The container (item ) has a mat (item ) disposed therein. A plurality of individual inflatable members (item ) are positioned with the mat. The members are inflated until an article placed in the container is in contact with a pressure applying surface (item ). Similar to the inflatable bag of the Ono reference, the pressure applying surface is limited to the extending sections of a payload placed in the container. Since the contour of the payload is not fully covered, compartments would exist in which the payload is not securable.","As a result, a need exists for an improved payload system or module that utilizes individual grippers in which the inflatable or fillable grippers provide a holding strength on and lateral stability for the payload. The flexible payload module should be able to hold and provide stability for payload items of varying sizes.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a payload module that utilizes individual grippers in which the grippers provide a holding strength on and lateral stability for the payload.","It is therefore a further object of the present invention to provide a flexible payload module that could be used for payload items of varying sizes.","In order to attain the objects described, there is provided a payload module that utilizes numerous inflatable fingers or grippers that are preferably conical in shape. The conical shape is unique as it allows for the contact area of the gripper to increase and decrease with the size of the payload. This change in contact area can be accomplished without having to change the pressure inside each gripper.","The conical shape of the grippers also provides an axial holding strength of the payload thereby providing a greater securing force to the payload. If a payload moves perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the gripper, the conical shape provides for lateral stability. Specifically as an individual gripper is displaced to one side, the gripper deflects and places the material of the gripper in tension. The angle of the conical shape transfers the axial payload force into a tensional load on the gripper where it has the greatest strength.","The number of grippers along with the conical shape of each gripper allow for more complete capture of a payload in that the grippers can fill voids around the payload item. Since there are more contact points with the grippers and the payload, the contact force required for an adequate capture can be spread out.","Each of the grippers is capable of using seawater as the inflation fluid as well as consideration to a mixture of fluids or the use of different fluids in various chambers. The mixing of fluids allows for non-linear loadings such as in a non-exclusive use in which a gripper could utilize a very soft (less dense) fluid like air at its tip and a denser fluid like water at its base, or vice versa.","The grippers are made from elastomeric materials such as rubber, or non-elastomeric materials such as Kevlar. The elastomeric material provides for greater flexibility and the non-elastomeric material provides for greater strength.","Referring now to  there is shown a cross-sectional view of a payload module  as the present invention. In the figure, the payload module  generally comprises a plurality of conical grippers  (shown non-filled or deflated), a winch assembly  and a pair of submersible pumps , .","As depicted in the figure and the plan view of , the payload module  includes an interior cylindrical wall  with several rows of the grippers . Each gripper  is made of a watertight material that can be inflated or filled and deflated with pressurized water.","The conical shape of the grippers  allows the grippers to collapse within themselves as they are deflated. Because the conical shape gets progressively smaller in diameter from its base to its inner center, the gripper  will flatten when deflated. When made of rubber, the grippers  are flexible enough to be collapsed from a smooth shape into the flattened shape such that they occupy very little volume when deflated. For tougher materials, such as Kevlar, to collapse into flattened shape, the grippers can have a bellows shape as shown in . The flattened profile of each gripper  takes up a minimal amount of space, thereby providing a maximum amount of space for a given payload.","As shown in , the grippers  are conical in shape so that they can expand towards a longitudinal axis  of the payload module  and a positioned payload  (shown in ) without interfering with one another.","As shown in the figures, the payload module  is contained inside a watertight and high pressure-resistant container . The container  protects the payload module  and its contents from extreme depth pressures and pressure fluctuations if the container is used with a submarine or as part of other submersibles (not shown). As such, the interior of the payload module  remains at a steady pressure. Because the container  is watertight, the payload module  may be filled with air to keep it contents dry.","Each of the pumps  and  is used to transfer seawater from the interior  of the payload module  or the ambient ocean environment into the inflatable grippers . For space considerations, the pumps  and  are located at the closed end of the container . In operation, the pumps  and  draws seawater from inside or outside the payload module  and transfer it behind the grippers  by the use of an annular water flow passage  formed between the container  and the wall  of the payload module or the grippers  are filled through a network of piping. From the annular passage , the seawater or alternate fluid fills the individual grippers .","As shown in , individual tubing  with associated control valves  can be used to control the inflation of specific grippers . Inflation of specific grippers  allows access to certain areas in the interior  or can protect certain parts of the payload  from damage by the grippers  or can protect the grippers themselves. The pumps ,  can be used to deflate the grippers , if a reversible pump is used; otherwise, the two submersible pumps (or one if cross-connected) are used to inflate and deflate the grippers.","The grippers  can be inflated within a wet or dry interior of the payload module . If the interior  is wet, the grippers  can be filled by the pumps ,  from a supply of seawater from the interior. If the interior of the payload module  is dry, the grippers  can be filled by the pumps ,  from water within the annular passage  and\/or outside of the container  by use of external connection  with control valve  (shown in  but also adaptable for the payload module of ).","Once the grippers  are inflated, the pumps  and  can then be used to empty remaining seawater from the container  by use of the external connection . In this way, the grippers  remain filled with seawater while the contents of the container  can remain dry. To achieve this, a muzzle hatch  (shown partially due to space restrictions) on the container  must be closed or the submarine must be surfaced before the process to pump the interior of the payload module  can begin. If surfaced, the muzzle hatch  would remain open so air could flow in as seawater was being pumped out. If submerged, the muzzle hatch  must be closed and air must be pumped in as the seawater is being pumped out.","The discharge pressure of the pumps  and  controls the grip force of the grippers . As the pressure is increased; the grip force increases. The pressure supplied to the grippers  should correspond to the weight and strength of the payload  being contained in order to prevent accidental damage to the payload.","The grippers  are made from a flexible material, such as a fabric, that is waterproof, puncture-resistant, tear-resistant and sufficiently strong to withstand the inflation pressure and a small portion of the weight of the payload . The flexible material is preferably Kevlar for more tear resistance or elastomeric rubber for more flexibility. For each gripper , the grippers are preferably fastened to the inner wall  (by means known to those skilled in the art) over individual apertures in the inner wall.","The winch  is used to assist with loading and unloading of the payload  of the payload module . The cable of the winch  shall be long enough to reach well outside the payload module. Since most payload items are buoyant in nature, the winch  is needed to pull the payload  down into the payload module . The winch  may also be used to control the rate of ascent as a particular payload item is allowed to float out.","The main advantage of the payload module  is that it provides a flexible means of carrying almost anything inside a submarine or submersible vehicle. The fluid nature of seawater in combination with the flexible material of each gripper , allows the grippers to match the shape of the payload  where the grippers make contact. Because all the grippers  are interconnected by the fluid action of the seawater, the grippers conform to the shape of the payload  as a group. Therefore, individually then cumulatively as a group, the grippers  flow around and conform to the shape of the payload .","Regardless of the shape or size of the payload , the pumps  and  can continue pumping until all the grippers  are either engaged with the payload or completely inflated. If no payload is present, the pumps  and  would operate for the longest period because it must fully inflate all of the grippers  (unless flow is controlled to individual grippers as depicted in ). Once the desired pressure is reached, the grippers  will be either fully engaged or fully inflated. The pumps  and  can then be controlled to shut off automatically.","The payload module  is depth independent. The hydrostatic depth pressure is balanced across the suction and discharge sides of the submersible pumps , . Since seawater is incompressible, the hydrostatic depth pressure is constantly sensed across the fabric of the gripper . From there it is transferred to the discharge side of the submersible pumps , . Therefore, the payload module  can operate equally well at any depth.","By controlling the shut-off pressure on the submersible pumps  and , the grip strength of the grippers  can also be controlled. As the shut-off pressure is increased, so is the grip force. If the payload  is heavy and strong, a heavy grip force can be applied. If however, the payload  is light and fragile, a light grip force can be applied. This is simply controlled by controlling the pressure supplied by the pumps  and .","Because the grippers  are made from a flexible material, a uniform pressure force is applied to the payload . Doing so greatly increases the holding strength of the grippers  and greatly reduces the chance of damaging the payload . If the same grip force was concentrated at a point or a small area, the payload  could be damaged. The uniform pressure distribution of the system therefore minimizes any risk of damaging the payload .","The flexible payload module  can be used to store the payload  dry or wet. In both cases, the grippers  are filled with seawater, but the interior  itself can be wet or dry. If a dry bay is desired, after the payload  is loaded wet, the seawater is pumped out once the grippers  are inflated.","If the payload  must be loaded dry, the submarine is surfaced and the payload module  is emptied of seawater. Seawater is then supplied from external sources to the external connection  to inflate the grippers . In this way, the payload  only comes in contact with the dry side of the grippers .","The flexible payload module  provides for shock protection since none of the grippers  are rigid; therefore, shock loads are easily absorbed. Each inflatable gripper  only opposes another gripper when they are inflated. If the payload  shifts and moves from its balanced center position during a shock event, seawater is simply transferred from one gripper  to another gripper. Once the shock event ends, the grippers  redistribute the seawater within them until the entire system is returned to a balanced condition with the payload  centered again in the interior .","The gripper  are preferably conical when filled; however, they can be any shape. The grippers  must merely be watertight such that they can be inflated and deflated with water or other fluids. The grippers  can also be used with air instead of water, only requiring compressors to replace the pumps  and .","In an alternate configuration, shown in , the gripper  can also be inflated using a mixture of seawater and air or a mixture of any other fluid. For this configuration, the gripper  is compartmented to provide for non-linear stiffness. In the non-exclusive configuration of the gripper  of the figure, an air compartment  is adjacent to a seawater compartment  in the gripper. The air compartment  is preferably pre-filled prior to the addition of the payload  to the module  by a connection .","During use of the bi-furcated configuration of air and fluid, the tip of the gripper  can be soft and the base can be comparatively stiffer. The soft portion would be a benefit when in contact with a delicate payload and the stiffer portion would be a benefit for a large and robust payload.","The pumps  and  do not have to be submersible. The pumps can be located separately inside the submarine pressure hull. The pumps  and  must merely be able to pump seawater into and out of the individual grippers , and into and out of the interior  of the payload module .","In yet another configuration shown in , an inner cylindrical skirt  can be positioned on the inner cylindrical wall  to provide a smooth surface for loading and unloading. Without the inner skirt , the payload  may get hung up on the protruding grippers . Apertures  are placed in the inner skirt  that are equal in diameter and in-line with the grippers . When deflated, the grippers  are contained within the inner skirt . When inflated, the grippers  expand and pass through the inner skirt . The inner skirt  provides a cavity or well that is large enough to contain a deflated gripper. This configuration creates a smooth surface for the payload  to slide past when the payload is being loaded and unloaded.","Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
