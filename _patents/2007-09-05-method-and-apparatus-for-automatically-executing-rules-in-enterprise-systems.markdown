Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to enterprise computing systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for automatically executing rules in enterprise computing systems.","2. Related Art","Many organizations use enterprise systems to manage and store large amounts of data. These enterprise systems typically use different types of policy, workflow, subscription, and\/or preference frameworks to aid in the process of administering and accessing the enterprise system. However, these frameworks are typically add-on services and are fraught with problems.","These frameworks commonly make the following assumptions: policies are used to centralize the business rules; preferences maintain the various settings, which for example declare choices, desires, course of actions, or customizations; subscriptions are contractual equivalents of preferences expressed as conditions and actions upon interesting events; and preference profiles are collections of preferences that are associated with certain states of a user's presence in the system, including the user's activity, status, mood, etc. Unfortunately, there presently exists no common way to interrelate these different frameworks in a way that is standardized across all elements of an enterprise system.","One embodiment of the present invention provides an enterprise system that automatically executes a rule associated with an event. During operation, the system receives an event object at the enterprise system. Next, the system creates an intermediate event object based on the event object, wherein the intermediate object is an invocation context for the rule. The system also filters a set of rules with the intermediate event object to obtain a subset of rules. The system then selects a rule that is associated with the event from the subset of rules. Finally, the system executes the rule.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the intermediate event object comprises an identifier for an environment associated with the event or rule, wherein the environment specifies entities associated with the event or rule.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the system creates the intermediate event object by retrieving data from the event object. Next, the system stores the data in the intermediate event object. The system also retrieves additional data from entities associated with the event object. Next, the system stores the additional data in the intermediate event object. The system then associates the entity identifiers (EIDs) of the entities associated with the additional retrieved data. Next, the system determines an effective Access Control List (ACL) from the EIDs associated with the additional retrieved data. Finally, the system authorizes access to the data stored in the intermediate event object using the associated effective ACL.","In some embodiments of the present invention, filtering the set of rules involves performing a pattern matching operation on the set of rules, wherein the pattern matching operation matches indexed predicates associated with the set of rules to data associated with the intermediate event object.","In some embodiments of the present invention, selecting the rule from the subset of rules involves evaluating rule conditions associated with each rule based on indexed predicates and sparse predicates over data associated with the intermediate event object.","In some embodiments of the present invention, after filtering the set of rules, the system determines a user context which facilitates selecting a rule from the subset of rules.","In some embodiments of the present invention, determining the user context involves: receiving the user context with the set of rules; and storing the user context with the set of rules.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the rule specifies: a set of indexed predicates required to invoke the rule; a set of sparse predicates required to invoke the rule; and a set of actions which are performed when the rule executes.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the set of actions can involve: notifying an actor which has a subscription associated with the event about the occurrence of the event, wherein the actor is an entity which can perform actions upon other entities, and wherein an entity is an object; notifying a user about the occurrence of the event; invoking any action on the enterprise system or any operation on any entity; invoking a second rule; resolving conflicts between preference settings, wherein the preference settings can be associated with multiple actors; combining multiple local preferences to derive global preferences for a shared workspace; switching between preference profiles; tagging the entity; categorizing the entity; selecting the sensitivity for the entity; enabling roles; disabling roles; granting privileges; and revoking privileges.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a second rule can extend the rule.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a policy can extend: a policy schema which specifies attributes associated with the rule; and a policy template which specifies how to perform data collection for data associated with the attributes.","Table 1 illustrates a \u201cRuleDefinition\u201d method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 2 illustrates a \u201cLoad Subscriptions\u201d method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 3 illustrates a subscription object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 4 illustrates an event object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 5 illustrates a \u201cDeclare Attribute Set\u201d method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 5B illustrates an \u201cAssign Attribute Set\u201d method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 6 illustrates a \u201cRule Manager\u2014Create Rule Class\u201d Application Programming Interface (API) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 7 illustrates a Policy Observers object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 8 illustrates an entity schema in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 9 illustrates an Attribute Definition object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 10 illustrates the enumeration of the type of the properties in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 11 illustrates an Attribute object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 12 illustrates a Property Value in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 13 illustrates a Template object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 14 illustrates a Basic Template object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 15 illustrates an Attribute Template in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 16 illustrates a Container object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 17 illustrates a Template Configuration object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 18 illustrates a Preference Profile object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 19 illustrates a PreferenceSetSchema object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 20 illustrates a PreferenceSetTemplate object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 21 illustrates a PreferenceSet object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 22 illustrates a PreferenceProperty object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 23 illustrates a PolicySchema object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 24 illustrates a PolicyTemplate object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 25 illustrates a Policy object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 26 illustrates a RuleDefinition object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 27 illustrates a Rule object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 28 illustrates a RuleConditionDefinition object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 29 illustrates a RuleActionDefinition object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 30 illustrates a SubscriptionSchema object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 31 illustrates a SubscriptionTemplate object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 32 illustrates a Subscription object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 33 illustrates a SubscriptionRuleDefinition object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 34 illustrates a SubscriptionConditionDefinition object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 35 illustrates a SubscriptionActionDefinition object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","Table 36 illustrates a SubscriptionRule object in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.","The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.","The data structures and code described in this detailed description are typically stored on a computer-readable storage medium, which may be any device or medium that can store code and\/or data for use by a computer system. This includes, but is not limited to, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, magnetic and optical storage devices such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact discs), DVDs (digital versatile discs or digital video discs), or other media capable of storing computer readable media now known or later developed.","Overview","One embodiment of the present invention provides an enterprise system that automatically executes a policy associated with an event. This enterprise system combines policies, such as container level administrative policies, user subscriptions, and container and user preferences to define automated business processes.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the event can be an occurrence of any action in the enterprise system, an operation on an entity associated with the enterprise system, or a timer-related alarm event.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the entity can be any object that can be uniquely identified by an entity identifier (EID).","In one embodiment of the present invention, the entity can be any object.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the policy can be any set of actions that governs the life cycle of an entity. In this embodiment, a rule-based application or workflow can represent the policy.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the policy can perform administrative actions. In this embodiment, the policy can be attached to a container (or a folder) to govern the lifecycles of entities associated with the container.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the container can include additional entities. In this embodiment, the container can contain additional containers.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a subscription is a policy which is associated with a user and an entity. In this embodiment, the subscription can be configured to react to or to notify a user of an event on an entity.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a rule-based application associated with the enterprise system implements the policy. The policy can include: simple actions; workflow actions; and complex actions, which are combinations of simple and workflow actions.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the rule-based application is associated with a user who created the policy or subscription and a user who owns the policy or subscription. Note that the creator and owner of policy or subscription need not be the same user.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the rule-based application is associated with a user context at the time of creation of the policy or subscription for use as a runtime context for executing rule conditions and rule actions which are associated with the policy or subscription.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the user or administrator can activate one or more principals (which can also be delegated principals) and\/or enable one or more roles at the time of deployment of the policy or at the time of subscription. In this embodiment, the activated principals and enabled roles can be part of the user context which is associated with the policy or subscription. Furthermore, the enterprise system can use the active principals and enabled roles to facilitate authorizing execution of conditions and actions which are associated with the policy or the subscription.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the policy can extend or derive from one or more policy templates. These templates specify user interaction aspects, such as forms and menus, which the administrator or the user can use to provide values for required attributes associated with the policy.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the policy templates can specify how to perform data collection from additional sources, such as enterprise, workspace, environment, preferences, user context, databases, and third-party applications.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a policy template can extend one or more policy schemas. These policy schemas specify definitions for the rules associated with the policy and for attributes associated with the policy.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the policy can extend one or more policy schemas.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the administrator or the user can design rules associated with the policy using Boolean expressions. In this embodiment, the Boolean expressions contain bind variables represented by attribute definitions. These variables can be bound at deployment or subscription time.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the administrator or the user can specify predefined rule definitions or rule templates for the policy schema and policy template.","In one embodiment of the present invention, users can create subscriptions in a declarative form, i.e. without using Boolean expressions, from which the rules are generated. This embodiment enables novice users to create subscriptions.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the administrator or the user can bind a policy template to a container which is associated with a scope. This enables a policy template of a lower scope to extend a policy template of a higher scope. Note that a scope can represent a logical region in the enterprise system.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a policy template associated with a given container can be final, i.e. not extendable.","In one embodiment of the present invention, if a policy template is bound to a container, the enterprise system requires policies which are associated with the container to be derived from the policy template. Note that the policies which are associated with the container govern the lifecycle of entities associated with the container. Furthermore, note that the container can include: a logical region of the enterprise system; a workspace; an organization, wherein an organization is a container of workspaces and sub-organizations; a folder; an application; a set of files; and any other data that can be associated with the container.","In one embodiment of the present invention, two policy templates based on the same policy schema are compatible policy templates. In this embodiment, a policy template in a sub-container can extend compatible policy templates (superior) in a parent containers hierarchy chain. Furthermore, in this embodiment, the sub-container policy template (inferior) can include more constraints than the superior policy templates.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the administrator or the user can add to the policy template rules that extend rules associated with a policy template of a higher scope. This can involve joining predicates (Boolean expressions) by conjunction with predicates associated with the policy template of the higher scope. Note that using a conjunction operation ensures that the predicates from the policy template constrain conditions of the policy template of the higher scope without contradicting conditions of the policy template of the higher scope.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system stores predicates associated with the policy template of the higher scope with the policy template of the lower scope. This embodiment prevents changes to the policy template of the higher scope from affecting the policy template of the lower scope.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system references predicates associated with the policy template of the higher scope with the policy template of the lower scope without storing the predicates associated with the policy template of the higher scope with the policy template of the lower scope. This embodiment ensures that dependent policy templates remain consistent with the policy template that the dependent policy templates extend.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can parameterize bind variables which are bound to constants at deployment time or at runtime.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a preference profile can be associated with the container. This enables the policy creator to bind variables of a target scope or a higher scope to constants from preference sets associated with the target scope at the time the enterprise system deploys the policy. Note that these preferences can include: a quota for storage use, a quota for notification messages, a presence of a particular user, group, or resource, delivery and device preferences, preferred time zones and locales of a user, access to an organization or a workspace, and any other preference that can be bound to the variables of the target scope.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system enables a user to attach a policy or subscription to an entity. Note that a container can be an entity. In this embodiment, the policy or subscription can include or generate rules. In one embodiment, the subscription rules can be added to the rules of the policy that is associated with the subscription.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the subscription can include attributes to customize the condition and action components which the enterprise system evaluates when executing the subscription.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can bind user preferences to bind variables associated with the subscription.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the policy schema, the subscription schema, and a preference schema (which specifies preference attributes associated with a container or user) can use attribute definitions to define the parameters that they require. In this embodiment, first class attribute definitions can be associated with each of these schemas. For example, a user can define and use the attribute definition \u201cpreferred part of the day for meetings\u201d across all schemas associated with the container or user. The \u201cpreferred part of the day for meetings\u201d attribute can be set up in the user's preference set. When the policy or subscription schemas include the attribute definition for \u201cpreferred part of the day for meetings,\u201d the templates associated with these schemas can prescribe to use the attribute from the user's preference as a binding to the variables for the user's policy or subscription.","In one embodiment of the present invention, policies or subscriptions can influence the creation and usage of user preferences. For example, as part of a user's notification preferences, the user can specify a list of delivery channels in order of preference. Suppose that the user's first preferred delivery channel is push mail. At runtime, when the enterprise system retrieves the user's preferred delivery channel from the user's notification preference, the enterprise system can invoke the notification preference policy which can dynamically adjust the notification delivery channel. In one scenario, the preference policy can recommend the user's second preferred delivery channel when the user has exceeded the user's push mail quota for the day","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can associate multiple policies with an entity. In this embodiment, when an event associated with the entity occurs, the enterprise system automatically notifies and executes the multiple policies.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a source entity that generates the event can automatically invoke a policy associated with the event.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the source entity that generates the event can alert a third-party component about the occurrence of the event. In this embodiment, the third-party component invokes the policy associated with the event.","In one embodiment of the present invention, policies associated with a container affect lifecycles of: workspaces, folders, documents, discussion forums, conferences, messages, calendars, tasks, and journals which are associated with the container, as well as presences that the users can create, share, coordinate, and communicate with each other.","In one embodiment of the present invention, policies can affect how users detect each other's presence or receive urgent messages via pervasive devices.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can use policies for record management, message control, user\/device\/application provisioning, notification, and any other process that the enterprise system can perform.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can implement policies using: forward-chaining systems, such as Rete (systems based on the Rete algorithm) and rule-based production systems; backward chaining systems, such as prolog or datalog based systems; database rules management systems; and expression filter based systems.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system associates entities, such as folders, artifacts, messages, and users with unique entity identifiers (EIDs).","In one embodiment of the present invention, the system associates an access control list (ACL) with each entity. This ACL can include permission grants or denies, for example \u201cGrant READ to User-A\u201d and \u201cDeny READ to User-B.\u201d","In one embodiment of the present invention, an event object includes a list of EIDs for entities associated with the event object. In this embodiment, the event object does not include the states of the entities, but can only include the EIDs of the entities to access the states of the entities.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the system creates an intermediate event object based on the original event object. The intermediate event object is the invocation contexts for the policy and subscription rules. The intermediate event object contains the states of any relevant entities that are associated with the original event, the environment of the event (such as user context, session, scope, etc), and the policy or subscription to be applied to the event. The enterprise system constructs the intermediate event by using the system actor's user context to: load the relevant entities; retrieve and compute the states from the relevant entities; store the states of the entities in the intermediate event; associate each state entry in the intermediate event by the unique entity identifiers (EIDs) of one or more source entities that are used to compute the state entry; and use the associated EIDs to determine the effective Access Control List (ACL) for authorization of the policy or subscription owner's user context to access any state entry in the intermediate event.","Performance and scalability improvements can be realized by pre-computing the states of the entities under the system actor context and placing the states in the intermediate event (invocation context). This process yields performance improvements by eliminating the overheads of repeatedly loading the same entity under each of the policy or subscription owner's user contexts, which otherwise is necessary to perform proper authorization. This process also achieves the same level of security by letting the rule conditions and rule actions in the user policies or subscriptions to access a pre-computed state entry in the intermediate event only if the policy or subscription owner's user context has READ privileges for all entities associated with the state entry. If the state entry is computed from the states of one or more entities, this process yields additional performance improvements by eliminating the overheads of repeating the same computations under each of the policy or subscription owner's user contexts.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system enforces access control when executing rules (both the predicate or condition and action components) associated with a policy or a subscription based on the privileges of the user context associated with the policy or subscription.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can save a user context used at the time of policy deployment or subscription with the policy or the subscription for use as the runtime context when executing the rule conditions and actions. In this embodiment, if the user or administrator has activated a principal (which can also be a delegated principal) and enabled a number of roles at the deployment or subscription time, the enterprise system can include the active principal and enabled roles as part of the user context saved in the policy or subscription. Note that the user context is important because: 1) structured query language SQL data manipulation language DML statements included with condition predicates and action callback procedures can involve access control, and 2) invocation of the system APIs from the codes included with condition predicates and action callback procedures can involve access control.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system separates the rule condition expression into two partial conditions. The first part includes only indexed predicates, and the second part includes only sparse predicates. One skilled in the art can understand the concepts of indexed predicates and sparse predicates as used in the Oracle Database 10g Expression Filters and described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,127,467, to inventors, Aravind Yalamanchi, Dieter Gawlick, and Jagannathan Srinivasan, entitled \u201cManaging expressions in a database system.\u201d","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system establishes a system actor's user context which is associated with a system actor. In this embodiment, during a bulk filtering phase, the enterprise system executes the indexed predicates and the included DML statements (excluding the sparse predicates during bulk filtering phase) under the system actor's user context to use the privileges of the system actor.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system performs statistical analysis of the indexed predicates to estimate the expected number of rules per composite index. If the expected number of rules is larger than a threshold, the enterprise system will evaluate the sparse predicates with the indexed predicates under the system actor's user context, as part of the bulk filtering phase, to select a smaller percentage of the matching rules. This way the system avoids frequent context switching for owner's user contexts for a large set of matching rules.","In one embodiment of the present invention, after the enterprise system executes indexed predicates, (by default or by determination from the expected number of rules) if the number of matching rules in the filtered result set is larger than a threshold, the system executes the sparse predicates (excluding the indexed predicates) of the matching rules under the same system actor's user context, as part of the bulk filtering phase, to select a smaller percentage of the matching rules. This way the system has robustness to adapt to the cases where the estimation of the expected number of rules per composite index, based on the last time of analysis, becomes stale due to changes in the rules or number of rules. Moreover, the system avoids frequent context switching for owner's user contexts for a large set of matching rules.","In one embodiment of the present invention, after the enterprise system applies the bulk filtering and activates a subset of policies or subscriptions, the enterprise system reevaluates the rule condition expressions comprised of both the indexed predicates and sparse predicates under the policy or subscriber owner's user context. This embodiment enables the enterprise system to maintain security without decreasing the speed of filtering a large number of the policies and subscriptions.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the following characteristics of this process may be observed: during the bulk filtering phase for each of the events, a large number of policies and subscriptions can be processed by evaluating each indexed predicate at most one time under the same system actor's user context; by not evaluating the sparse predicates whose truth-values can depend on the user contexts, the method yields additional performance and scalability improvements; the bulk filtering activates a significantly small percentage of the user policies and subscriptions; the system evaluates each of the activated policies and subscriptions under the corresponding policy or subscriber owner's user contexts; the system evaluates the sparse predicates only under the policy or subscriber owner's user context; and the system evaluates the indexed predicates again under the policy or subscriber owner's user context because some indexed predicates may evaluate to true in system actor's user context but may evaluate to false in the policy or subscriber owner's user contexts.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system enables users to collaborate while being subject to administrative policies. In this embodiment, by selecting policies and subscriptions, administrators can specify a plan of actions to govern the lifecycles of objects in a container.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can use policy to manage preferences at runtime and to resolve conflicts among preference settings.","In one embodiment of the present invention, preferences can supply parameters for policies at runtime.","In one embodiment of the present invention, policies can mediate access of preferences. The enterprise system can combine several local preferences into a policy to derive global preferences. For example, for a shared workspace, the enterprise system can find the correlation among the preferences of conference participants to derive the global preference.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can use policies to switch between profiles of preferences, i.e. there may be more than one instance of each type of preference, such as EmailPreference, PresencePreference, NotificationPreference, ConferencePreference, etc. In this embodiment, the policies can mix the preferences for different profiles, such as vacation profile, lazy profile, eager profile, escalated profile, etc.","In one embodiment of the present invention, policies can be reactive. For example, a policy can adjust preference profiles based on a user's calendar entry, task list entry, presence, and activities.","In one embodiment of the present invention, actors, such as users, workspaces, and communities can specify their own language preferences. For example, an administrator can specify a policy that selects the language from the preferences of Workspace, User, Community, and System in order of precedence.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can use policy to dynamically enable\/disable Roles (and principals) of a session to enforce the principle of least privileges and separation of duties. For example, the enterprise system can use a policy to map biometric credentials to a set of Roles to be enabled.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can use policy to dynamically provision users and guard the assignment of privileges to these users. For example, the enterprise system can use a policy to limit the granting of privileges by a role-based access control (RBAC) scheme and completely prevent the discretionary and delegation based privileges for a user.","In one embodiment of the present invention, policy objects can be artifacts in a collaboration system that enable policy authors to collaborate for the development of policies within the scope and under the control of additional policies the enterprise system has deployed and activated on the scope. For example, a record management policy may undergo a management approval workflow policy for update and deployment. In this case, policy can apply in a self-referential way using a version control mechanism associated with the artifact to differentiate the working version and the edited version.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can insert subscriptions' rules into the rules associated with policies. In this embodiment, the subscriptions can be rule-based user instructions.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can customize subscription templates for individual workspaces to enable\/disable the extent of the subscriptions. For example, a project manager may allow\/disallow pattern matching with the contents of certain artifacts in the user subscriptions.","Enterprise Computing Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","110","112","120","121","130","150","160","170","180"]},"Clients - can include any node on a network including computational capability and including a mechanism for communicating across the network.","Similarly, servers - can generally include any node on a network including a mechanism for servicing requests from a client for computational and\/or data storage resources.","Users  and  can include: an individual; a group of individuals; an organization; a group of organizations; a computing system; a group of computing systems; or any other entity that can interact with computing environment .","Network  can include any type of wired or wireless communication channel capable of coupling together computing nodes.

This method can specify conditions, actions, events, and functions to construct rules associated with a policy. Note that a complex policy may employ multiple rule definitions. In one embodiment of the present invention, rule actions can start a long running workflow, which is a more complex plan of temporal sequences of processes in contrast to singular actions.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the RuleDefinition can include two different levels of knowledge bases. One level is composed of long term memory components called rule bases, and the other level is composed of short term memory components called fact bases. For rule-based systems, the users can define the rules as \u201cIF (RuleCondition) THEN <RuleAction>\u201d constructs. In this embodiment, the enterprise system can use a pattern matching system such as a rete network or a database expression filter to evaluate the condition.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the rule definitions of the rule-based system can comprise the long-term memory components of the rule-based system.

The first \u201cif\u201d clause illustrated in Table 1 defines the rule condition, which declares the subscription fact, event fact, and invokes the EvaluateIndexedPredicates function to perform pattern matching between the subscription fact and event fact. In this example, the function EvaluateIndexedPredicates can evaluate the partial rule condition object of the Subscription comprised only of the indexed predicates. The rule action illustrated in Table 1 includes the ActivateUserContext operation and another IF . . . THEN . . . clause. The ActivateUserContext operation activates the subscription owner's user context stored with the subscription. The function EvaluateCondition can evaluate the rule condition object of the Subscription comprised of both indexed predicates and sparse predicates. If the subscription matches the event properties, the DoAction function can invoke the rule action object of the Subscription. With each function, the Event object is passed to the callback classes of the condition and action objects. In this embodiment, the enterprise system performs the pattern matching part of the rule definition in the system actor's user context, which is associated with the system actor. Furthermore, at the beginning of the action, the enterprise system activates the end user's user context from the subscription time, and the enterprise system performs the conditions and actions under proper access control associated with the end user. This provides a scaleable and secure framework.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the enterprise system can use the RuleDefinition of Table 1 to support any number of rules that a user specifies.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the fact base can include facts, such as user subscriptions. Furthermore, the fact base is associated with a short term memory component because the enterprise system can assert and retract facts dynamically. Note that this does not imply that subscriptions are transient objects. For example, when a user disables a subscription, the enterprise system retracts corresponding subscription facts from the fact base. However, the subscription objects are persistent objects, and therefore, the enterprise system can assert the subscription facts back into the fact base in response to the occurrence of an event.","Table 2 illustrates a Load Subscriptions method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
