A strong electromagnetic wave is also emitted from flat panel displays such as a plasma display panel and a liquid crystal television among significantly increasing digital household electrical appliances, and its influence on the human health is also concerned. People observe the images of such displays within a distance relatively close to these displays and for long time in some cases. By doing so, an electromagnetic interference film suppressing these electromagnetic waves is required and the development thereof has been intensively investigated.","In electromagnetic interference films known at present, various methods for suppressing these electromagnetic waves are adopted. For example, a method, in which copper foil is bonded to a polyester film, a regular mesh shape is patterned by photolithography, and etching is performed in such a way that the copper foil becomes a network configuration to prepare a conductive film in which a conductive portion is made from copper and has a network structure, is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-210988 (page 1, claims etc.).","As another method, a method of fabricating a conductive film by printing a composition containing a nucleic agent for plating such as palladium on a film such as polyester in a regular form of network by a printing method and further by applying nonelectrolytic copper plating to a layer consisting of the composition in the form of network is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-185184 (page 1, claims etc,).","As further method, a method of fabricating a conductive film by bonding a knit of metal fiber woven in length and width onto a polyester film or the like is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-119672 (page 1, claims etc.).","Further, a conductive body in the form of network which is obtained by initiating micro-cracks in the random form of network and by filling the micro-cracks with a conductive material is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-228057 (page 1, claims etc.), a transparent conductive film provided with a layer in which metal fine particles coagulate in the random form of network is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-71976 (page 1, claims etc.), transparent conductive film provided with a layer containing silver colloidal particles is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-60416 (page 1, claims etc.), and a transparent conductive layer having a fine network structure using silver is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10-312715 (page 1, claims etc.).","However, there are the following problems in the prior art described above.","A method for etching copper foil is an excellent method for attaining a highly precise network structure, but it is generally low in yields in the steps of bonding copper foil, photolithography, and etching and consequently the yield of a final product becomes low. Further, since a hazardous waste fluid is produced in the etching step, safety and environmental precautions are required. Further, when the copper foil is used as a material, there is also a problem that much of the copper foil is eluted through etching to generate a waste fluid and therefore an amount of a material to be recovered is large.","A method of producing a conductive film by a nonelectrolytic plating process has a feature that an amount of metal waste fluid to be treated is small since metal is used for only required portion. But, since it is difficult to form a pattern of more fine line in the step of printing a mesh form, which is a first step, it is consequently difficult to obtain a conductive film having a conductive portion of a fine line.","A method of bonding metal fiber is a very simple method and readily attains the effect of shielding an electromagnetic wave, but it has a problem that it is difficult to make the network of a conductive portion fine.","The other large problem in technologies described above is a moir\u00e9 phenomenon occurring when the conductive film is used as an electromagnetic interference film at the surface of a display. The moir\u00e9 phenomenon is a phenomenon of a fleck pattern in stripe form generated when patterns in which dots or lines are geometrically regularly distributed are superimposed. As for the flat panel display, a moir\u00e9 in stripe form tends to arise on a screen. This moir\u00e9 phenomenon arises by an interaction between the pattern of display devices of respective RGB colors of a display main body and the regular configuration of the network of the electromagnetic interference film placed in front of the display main body. These are arrayed regularly to each other, and particularly the display device cannot be changed from a regular configuration to an irregular configuration.","It could be helpful to provide an excellent conductive film which is easy to produce and hardly causes a moir\u00e9 phenomenon when it is applied to flat panel displays as an electromagnetic interference film.","We thus provide:","(1) A conductive film in which a conductive portion of a random network structure is present on at least one surface of a base film, a line width of the conductive portion composing the network structure is 30 \u03bcm or less, an area of portions where the conductive portion is not present is 50% or more with respect to an area of the conductive film, and an average of ratios of a major axis length to a minor axis length of an area surrounded by the network of the conductive portion, in which the base film is exposed, is larger than 1 and is equal to or less than 3.5.","(2) The conductive film according to the above (1), wherein the conductive portion of a random network structure is obtained by the steps of applying a solution for forming a conductive portion to the base film and drying the solution.","(3) The conductive film according to any one of the above, wherein the conductive portion contains a conductive polymer and\/or a conductive particle.","(4) The conductive film according to any one of the above, wherein the conductive portion of the conductive film includes a layer containing a conductive polymer and\/or a conductive particle, and a metal layer provided on the layer.","(5) The conductive film according to any one of the above, wherein the prime constituent of metal to form the metal layer is copper.","(6) The conductive film according to any one of the above, wherein the conductive film is an electromagnetic interference film.","It is now possible to provide a conductive film having transparency and a high level of electrical conductivity as well as less moir\u00e9, and further it is possible to provide an excellent electromagnetic interference film hardly causing a moir\u00e9 phenomenon when a metal layer is provided on its conductive portion. This conductive film is very useful for flat panel displays such as a plasma display panel and a liquid crystal television.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"b":"2"},"Our conductive film is a conductive film in which a conductive portion of a random network structure is present on at least one surface of a base film, a line width of the conductive portion composing the network structure is 30 \u03bcm or less, an area of portions where the conductive portion is not present is 50% or more with respect to an area of the conductive film, and an average of ratios of a major axis length to a minor axis length of an area surrounded by the network of the conductive portion, in which the base film is exposed, is larger than 1 and is equal to or less than 3.5.","The base film is preferably a film composed of a resin. Preferably, the resin is further a thermoplastic resin. The thermoplastic resin film collectively refers to films which are melted or softened by heating. The thermoplastic resin film is not particularly limited, and typical examples of thermoplastic resin films to be used may include polyester films; polyolefin films such as polypropylene films and polyethylene films; polylactic acid films; polycarbonate films; acrylic films such as polymethyl methacrylate films and polystyrene films;","polyamide films such as nylon; polyvinyl chloride films; polyurethane films; fluorine-based films; and polyphenylene sulfide films.","A resin composing the base film may be homopolymers or copolymers. Among them, polyester films, polypropylene films, polyamide films, and the like are preferable from the viewpoint of mechanical properties, the dimensional stability, the transparency, and the like, and furthermore, polyester films are preferable from the viewpoint of the mechanical strength, the general versatility, and the like.","These films may contain various additives, e.g., antioxidants, heat stabilizers, weathering stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbers, organic lubricants, pigments, dyes, organic or inorganic fine particles, fillers, antistatic agents and crystal nucleating agents, to the extent that the characteristic properties are not deteriorated.","The thickness of the base film is not specifically limited, and is appropriately selected in accordance with the applications and the kinds of the conductive film. Preferably, the thickness is usually 10 to 500 \u03bcm, more preferably is 38 to 250 \u03bcm, and most preferably is 75 to 150 \u03bcm from the viewpoint of the mechanical strength, handleability, and the like.","The example in which a polyester film is used as a base film of the conductive film will be described below.","A polyester composing a polyester film refers to polymers in which ester bonding is a primary bonding chain in a main chain. As the polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, polyproylene terephthalate, ethylene-2,6-naphthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polypropylene-2,6-naphthalate, polyethylene-\u03b1,\u03b2-bis (2-chlorophenoxy)ethane-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylate, and the like are exemplified, and polyesters including at least one constituent selected from the group consisting of the above-mentioned polymers as a primary constituent can be preferably used.","These constituents may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds. Most of all, it is particularly preferable to use polyethylene terephthalate, considering collectively all the factors, e.g., quality and economy, involved. When the conductive film is used for the case where there is a step of performing intensive heat treatment or tending to produce shrinkage stress, polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate having excellent heat resistance and stiffness is also suitably used. Other dicarboxylic acid components and\/or idol components may be copolymerized as a part of two polyesters exemplified here, preferably at 20 mole percent or less. Also, hydroxyl carboxylic acid components may be copolymerized.","It is suitable for performing the disclosure that the intrinsic viscosity (measured in o-chlorophenol at 25\u00b0 C.) of the above-described polyester is preferably within the range of 0.4 to 1.2 dl\/g, and more preferably within the range of 0.5 to 0.8 dl\/g.","Preferably, the polyester film of a base material is biaxially oriented. In general, the biaxially oriented polyester film refers to a polyester film which is prepared by stretching an unstretched polyester sheet or film preferably by about 2.5 to 5 times in each of a longitudinal direction and a width direction, respectively, and then processing the film with a heat treatment to complete crystalline orientation. This film exhibits a wide-angle X-ray diffraction pattern attributed to biaxial orientation.","A polyester film to be a base film may be a composite film prepared by coextrusion. On the other hand, the resulting films may also be bonded to each other by various methods to be used.","Next, the conductive portion of a random network structure, which is present on at least one surface of the base film, will be described.","The random network structure is observed as a structure in such a random state that a shape and a size of an area surrounded by the conductive portion, in which the conductive portion is not present, are irregular when the conductive film is observed with a scanning electron microscope (hereinafter, abbreviated as \u201cSEM\u201d). Therefore, the shape of the conductive portion is observed as a shape in an irregular state.","A SEM observation image of the conductive layer formed on a base film of the conductive film is shown in .  shows an example of a SEM observation image of a conductive portion consisting of a conductive portion of a random network structure and a base film. It can be said that this configuration is similar to the surface of a muskmelon. Straight lines in the lower right-hand corner of the drawings are scales, and for example in , the length of the straight line in the lower right-hand corner represents 10 \u03bcm.","A width of the conductive portion needs to be 30 \u03bcm or less. A line width of the conductive portion may be constant or may vary, and for example, in , the conductive portion is observed as a mesh having line widths varying from about 0.3 \u03bcm to about 1 \u03bcm. This width is usually at least 0.2 \u03bcm, and 0.5 to 25 \u03bcm, and preferably 1 to 20 \u03bcm. When the width of the conductive portion is too small, electrical conductivity is hardly exhibited, and on the other hand, when it is too large, a total light transmittance is apt to decrease in the case of using the conductive film as an electromagnetic interference film and the conductive film is readily observed.","It is preferable that at least a part of the conductive portion of the network structure is continuous. When the conductive portion is not continuous, this can be distinguished through from that the electrical conductivity of the surface is not exhibited.","In the conductive film, it is necessary that an area of portions where the conductive portion is not present is 50% or more with respect to an area of the conductive film, and this area is preferably 60% or more, and more preferably 70% or more particularly from the viewpoint of transparency.","When the percentage of this area is low, it is not desirable since a total light transmittance is lowered in the case of using the conductive film as an electromagnetic interference film. On the other hand, an upper limit of the percentage of this area may be less than 100%, but it becomes 90% or less in actual production and use.","The electrical conductivity of the surface of the conductive film is not particularly limited as long as an electromagnetic interference function can be attained, but, for example, it is preferably 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less, more preferably 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less, and most preferably 1 \u03a9\/\u25a1 or less. Further, the electrical conductivity to be used is preferably 0.1 \u03a9\/\u25a1 or less in the case of shielding an electromagnetic wave emitted from a PDP television, and the like.","A higher transmittance of the conductive film is preferable, and it is preferably 55% or more, and more preferably 60% or more.","Further, a ratio of a major axis length to a minor axis length of an area (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201copen area\u201d) surrounded by the network of the conductive portion, in which the base film is exposed, is important. The major axis length and the minor axis length are determined by following procedure using .","The longest location of an open area surrounded by a watched conductive portion  is defined as a major axis A. The length of this location is taken as a major axis length. Assuming two straight lines (B, B) in parallel with the defined major axis, the two straight lines are placed so that they circumscribe the open area and a distance between them becomes maximum, and a distance C between these straight lines is taken as a minor axis length.","The average ratios of the major axis length to the minor axis length needs to be larger than 1 and be equal to or less than 3.5. When the ratio is 1, a problem that the regularity of the network portion is enhanced and a moir\u00e9 phenomenon tends to occur. When, the ratio is larger than 3.5, there is a problem that anisotropy in images occurs particularly when the conductive film is used in front of an optical illuminant device such as a PDP television. A preferable ratio of the major axis length to the minor axis length is 1.2 or more, and furthermore 1.5 or more for a lower value, and 3 or less, further 2.5 or less, and furthermore 1.8 or less for an upper value.","The conductive portion of the conductive film can be obtained by applying a coating solution containing either a material containing a conductive component or a material to have electrical conductivity through a subsequent operation onto the surface of the film, and drying the coating solution. For example, in a manufacturing step of biaxially stretching a polyester film successively in which a step of stretching in a longitudinal direction and a step of stretching in a width direction are performed, a method in which the coating solution is applied onto the surface of the film and dried between step of stretching in a longitudinal direction and the step of stretching in a width direction and then the dried film is further stretched and heat-treated, that is, the so-called in-line coating method can be used. In the step of stretching a film in a width direction, a layer applied with the coating solution produces cracks through stretching and a conductive portion of the random network structure can be obtained.","As a component contained in the coating solution, a conductive polymer and\/or a conductive particle is preferable. As the conductive polymer, polythiophene, polyaniline, polypyrrole, and derivatives thereof can be used, and as the conductive particle, particles of indium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, silver, gold, copper, platinum, nickel, zinc and the like can be used.","In particular, with respect to polythiophene which is a conductive polymer, the development of a coating solution in which water is used as a medium is advanced by the recent research and development, and this coating solution can also be suitably employed in our disclosure. As a coating solution, furthermore preferably, a solution containing a mixture of polythiophene and\/or a polythiophene derivative and polyanion (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201cpolythiophene-polyanion mixture\u201d) can be used.","The above-mentioned polythiophene-polyanion mixture can be obtained by the step of obtaining a polymer having the following repeat structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"22.86mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07626128-20091201-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"22.78mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US07626128-20091201-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","2 "]},"As a material to give the conductive portion, polythiophene and\/or a polythiophene derivative having a structural formula represented by the second repeat structure is preferably used. For example, a preferable compound is represented by the second repeat structure, where n=1 (a methylene group), n=2 (an ethylene group), or n=3 (a trimethylene group). Among them, a compound including an ethylene group in which n=2, that is, poly-3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene, is particularly preferable.","Further, examples of the polythiophene and\/or the polythiophene derivative include compounds having a structure in which substituents are bonded at positions 3 and 4 of a thiophene ring and, furthermore, a compound in which oxygen atoms are bonded to carbon atoms at positions 3 and 4 as described above. With respect to compounds in which hydrogen atoms or carbon atoms are directly bonded to the above-described carbon atoms, water may not be readily used as a medium of the coating solution.","Next, a polyanion compound suitably used for the polythiophene-polyanion mixture will be described.","The polyanion compound is an acid polymer which can be a free acid, and is a polymer having a carboxylic acid, a polymer having a sulfonic acid, or the like. Examples of polymers having a carboxylic acid include polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, and polymaleic acid. Examples of polymers having a sulfonic acid include polystyrenesulfonic acid, and polyvinylsulfonic acid. In particular, the polystyrenesulfonic acid is most preferable from the viewpoint of the electrical conductivity of a conductive portion to be obtained. Here, a part of functional groups to give free acids may be in the form of neutralized salts.","When these polyanion compounds are added during the step of polymerizing for obtaining polythiophene and\/or a polythiophene derivative described above, inherently water-insoluble polythiophene-based compounds are readily dispersed in water or readily dissolved in water. Further, it is believed that the function as an acid serves the function as a dopant of the polythiophene-based compound and also serves an effect of improving the electrical conductivity.","As the polyanion compound described above, copolymers formed by copolymerization of other copolymerizable monomers, e.g., acrylates, methacrylates, and styrene, can also be used.","The molecular weights of the polyanion compounds such as a carboxylic acid-containing polymer and a sulfonic acid-containing polymer are not specifically limited, but, the weight average molecular weight thereof is preferably 1,000 to 1,000,000, and more preferably 5,000 to 150,000 from the viewpoint of the stability of the coating solution and the conductive portion. A part of anions may be neutralized by or may form salts with alkali metals such as lithium, sodium and the like, alkaline earth metals such as calcium and the like, and ammonium ion, to the extent that the characteristic properties of our disclosure are not impaired.","In the polythiophene-polyanion mixture, it is preferable from the viewpoint of the electrical conductivity that the polyanion is allowed to excessively present with respect to the total amount of the polythiophene and the polythiophene derivative on a weight of solid basis. Preferably, the polyanion is more than 1 part by weight and is equal to or less than 5 parts by weight with respect to 1 part by weight of the total of the polythiophene and the polythiophene derivative, and more preferably is more than 1 part by weight and is equal to or less than 3 parts by weight. In addition, the polythiophene-polyanion mixture can be produced by methods described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-6324, European Patent No. 602713, U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,472, and the like, although methods other than them may be adopted.","For example, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene is prepared using an alkali metal salt of 3,4-dihydroxythiophene-2,5-dicarboxyester as a starting material. Thereafter, potassium peroxodisulfate, iron sulfate, and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene prepared in advance are introduced into and reacted with a polystyrenesulfonic acid aqueous solution, so that a composition can be prepared, in which a polyanion such as polystyrenesulfonic acid forms a complex with a polythiophene such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene).","As a water-based coating solution containing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrenesulfonic acid, a product sold by H.C. Starck Ltd. (German) under the trade name \u201cBaytron\u201d P, or the like can be employed.","By containing a resin such as a polyester resin, an urethane resin, an acrylic resin or an epoxy cross-linking agent other than the above-mentioned polythiophene-polyanion mixture in the polythiophene-polyanion mixture in the coating solution, the random network structure can be formed effectively. For example, when only the polythiophene-polyanion mixture is used as a solute, the polythiophene has few follow-up properties to stretching of the base material, and therefore the occurrence of cracks becomes marked, and the conductive portion tends to be independent and the network structure is hardly formed as a conductive portion. Naturally, the electrical conductivity of the film is hardly exhibited. On the other hand, when large amounts of these resins are added, the network structure is not formed. By adjusting the content of the polythiophene-polyanion mixture in the solute in the coating solution usually to 8 to 50 percent by weight, preferably to 10 to 50 percent by weight, and more preferably to 12 to 25 percent by weight, and on the other hand, by adjusting the content of the resin other than the polythiophene-polyanion mixture usually to 50 to 92 percent by weight, preferably to 50 to 90 percent by weight, and more preferably to 75 to 88 percent by weight, the random network structure is formed effectively.","Examples of preferable polyester resins contained in the coating solution include polymers or copolymers formed by using acid components selected from terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, sebacic acid, and 5-sodium sulfoisophthalic acid and\/or diol components selected from ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, and neopentyl glycol. In the case where the water resistance is required, copolymers in which trimellitic acid is used as a copolymer component in place of 5-sodium sulfoisophthalic acid may also be suitably used.","Preferably, the glass transition temperature (hereinafter, abbreviated as \u201cTg\u201d) of the polyester resin is 0\u00b0 C. to 130\u00b0 C., and more preferably is 10\u00b0 C. to 85\u00b0 C. If the Tg is lower than 0\u00b0 C., for example, a blocking phenomenon may occur, in which in winding up a conductive film provided with a conductive portion, the conductive portion is adhered to the base film when the conductive portion is provided on only the one side of the film and conductive portions are mutually adhered when the conductive portion is provided on both sides of the film. When the Tg is extremely high, it is undesirable since the stability and the dispersibility in water of the resin may become poor. An amount of the polyester resin to be added is preferably 10 to 50 percent by weight in the solute of the coating solution, and more preferably 17 to 34 percent by weight.","Further, as an epoxy-based cross-linking agent suitably added to the coating solution, for example, agents of sorbitol polyglycidyl ether-based, polyglycerol polyglycidylether-based, diglycerol polyglycidyl ether-based, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether-based, or the like may be used. Examples of suitable cross-linking agents may include an epoxy compound \u201cDENACOL\u201d (EX-611, EX-614, EX-614B, EX-512, EX-521, EX-421, EX-313, EX-810, EX-830, EX-850, etc.) produced by Nagase ChemteX Corporation, diepoxy and polyepoxy-based compounds (SR-EG, SR-8EG, SR-GLG, etc.) produced by SAKAMOTO YAKUHIN KOGYO CO., LTD., an epoxy cross-linking agent \u201cEPICLON\u201d EM-85-75W or CR-5L produced by DAINIPPON INK AND CHEMICALS, INCORPORATED. Among them, water-soluble cross-linking agents are preferable. An amount of the epoxy-based cross-linking agent to be added is preferably 25 to 75 percent by weight, and more preferably 30 to 60 percent by weight in the solute of the coating solution.","Furthermore, various additives such as antioxidants, heat stabilizers, weathering stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbers, organic lubricants, pigments, dyes, organic or inorganic fine particles, fillers, nucleating agents and the like may also be blended in the solute of the coating solution within the range of not detracting the effects of our disclosure.","As the method for coating the base film with the coating solution, for example, a reverse coating method, a spray coating method, a bar coating method, a gravure coating method, a rod coating method, and a die coating method can be used.","The thickness of the conductive portion prepared from this coating solution is not particularly limited, but preferably, it is usually in a range of 0.01 to 5 \u03bcm, and more preferably in a range of 0.02 to 2 \u03bcm. If the thickness of the conductive portion is too small, the electrical conductivity may become poor.","As a further preferable method for providing the conductive portion, a method in which the coating solution is applied during the step of manufacturing a polyester film and is stretched together with the base film is most suitable. For example, the film provided with the conductive portion can be prepared by the step (in-line coating method) in which a melt-extruded polyester film before crystalline orientation is done is stretched by about 2.5 to 5 times in a longitudinal direction, and a coating solution is continuously applied to the resulting monoaxially oriented film, and the film coated with the coating solution is dried while being passed through a stepwise-heated zone and stretched by about 2.5 to 5 times in a width direction, and furthermore, the resulting film is continuously led to a heating zone at 150\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C., and crystalline orientation is completed. The coating solution used in this case is preferably a water-based coating solution from the viewpoints of environmental pollution and an explosion-protective property.","It is preferable that before the coating solution is applied, the surface of a base film is subjected to a corona discharge treatment and the like so that the wetting tension of the base film surface is preferably at least 47 mN\/m, and more preferably at least 50 mN\/m because the adhesion of the conductive portion to the base film can be improved. Naturally, a method of subjecting the monoaxially oriented film to a treatment for improving the wetting tension may be employed. Further, it is also preferable that a small amount of organic solvent such as isopropyl alcohol, butyl cellosolve, or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone is contained in the coating solution and, thereby, the wettability and the adhesion to the base film are improved.","Next, the method for manufacturing a conductive film will be described in further detail with reference to the example in which polyethylene terephthalate (hereafter abbreviated as \u201cPET\u201d) is used as the base film, although not limited to this.","The method for manufacturing a conductive film will be described with reference to further specific example.","PET pellets having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.5 to 0.8 dl\/g are vacuum-dried and then are supplied to an extruder. The pellets are melted at 260\u00b0 C. to 300\u00b0 C., and are extruded from a T-die into the form of a sheet. The resulting sheet is wound around a mirror-finished casting drum having a surface temperature of 10\u00b0 C. to 60\u00b0 C. by the use of an electrostatic casting method, followed by cooling and solidifying, so that an unstretched PET film is prepared. This unstretched film is stretched by 2.5 to 5 times in a longitudinal direction (film traveling direction) between rolls heated to 70\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C. At least one surface of this film is subjected to a corona discharge treatment so that the wetting tension of the surface is at least 47 mN\/m, and the water-based coating solution that becomes a conductive portion is applied to the treated surface. This coated film is grasped with clips, and is led to a hot-air zone heated to 70\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C. to be dried. The film is further stretched by 2.5 to 5 times in a width direction, and subsequently, is led to a heat treatment zone at 160\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. A heat treatment is performed for 1 to 30 seconds, so that crystalline orientation is completed. A treatment for relaxation of 1 to 10 percent in a width direction or a longitudinal direction may be performed as required during this heat treatment step.","It becomes possible to use this film as a electromagnetic interference film used in flat panel displays such as a plasma display panel and a liquid crystal television by providing a metal layer such as a copper layer on the network structure prepared from the above-mentioned coating solution to form a conductive portion consisting of a layer composed of a coating solution and a metal layer.","There is, for example, a method for applying electrolytic copper plating directly to a conductive film having a conductive portion prepared from the above-mentioned coating solution. Further, there is a method in which a nucleic agent for nonelectrolytic plating such as palladium is deposited on the conductive film having a conductive portion prepared from the above-mentioned coating solution, and then nonelectrolytic nickel plating or nonelectrolytic copper plating is applied. Further, there is another method in which a method for applying electrolytic copper plating onto the layer obtained by the above-mentioned nonelectrolytic plating is exemplified, a catalyst for nonelectrolytic plating, for example, metal fine particles such as a copper fine particle, a palladium fine particle and a silver fine particle, is mixed in the coating solution for forming a conductive portion in advance, and thereafter a conductive portion of the network structure is formed on a base film and nonelectrolytic plating is applied directly to the resulting conductive film to obtain a metal layer. Particularly, the method described last is useful because number of processes is small.","A size of the metal fine particle which can be used at this time is not particularly limited, but a number average particle diameter of 0.001 to 1 \u03bcm is preferable. When the number average particle diameter of the metal fine particles exceeds this range, the metal layer may be hardly formed in the form of a network. Preferably, the number average particle diameter of the metal fine particles is 0.001 to 0.5 \u03bcm, and more preferably 0.002 to 0.1 \u03bcm. A particle diameter of the metal fine particle contained in a metal fine particle layer may be large or small and may be irregular or uniform. Metal used for the metal fine particle is not particularly limited and platinum, gold, silver, copper, nickel, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, bismuth, cobalt, iron, aluminum, zinc, and tin can be used, but particularly, palladium, silver, and copper, which become a catalyst of nonelectrolytic plating, can be suitably used. In addition, these metal may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.","Examples of methods of preparing metal fine particles include a chemical method in which a metal ion is reduced in a liquid layer to form a metal atom and the metal atom is grown to a nanoparticle through a atomic cluster, a technique in which a bulk metals is vaporized in an inert gas to form metal fine particles and these metal fine particles is collected with a cold trap, and a physical method in which a metal thin film obtained by vacuum deposition on a polymer thin film is heated to break the metal thin film and nanoparticles of broken metal is dispersed in a polymer in a solid state.","[Methods for Measuring Characteristic Properties and Method for Evaluating Effects]","Methods for measuring characteristic properties and methods for evaluating effects are as described below.","(1) Thickness of Conductive Portion","A sample, for example, a cross section of a laminated polyester film, was cut out into a extremely thin slice, and this slice was observed and photographed with a TEM (transmission electron microscope) using a method of an extremely thin slice stained by ruthenic acid (RuO) or osmic acid (OsO), or double-stained by both of RuOand OsO. The thickness was determined from the cross-sectional photograph","Observation Method\n\n","(2) Observation Surface","The surface of a film was observed with a scanning electron microscope (S-2100A type Hitachi Scanning Electron Microscope, manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.), and a ratio of a major axis length to a minor axis length of an area (open area) surrounded by the network of the conductive portion, in which the base film was exposed, a configuration of the network structure, and a width of the network structure were observed. Further, in the above observation, a magnification of the observation image was adjusted in such a way that the number of open areas was 10 or more. The ratio of a major axis length to a minor axis length was determined by measuring all of open areas in a region observed and averaging the measurements. However, the open area, a part of which was out of a field of view and the shape of which could not be identified in the region, was excluded from calculation of this ratio.","(3) Area Ratio of Portion Where a Conductive Portion Does Not Exist","In the images observed in the above paragraph (2), areas of the network structure were marked with black color and the respective areas were separated into a white portion (area other than the network structure) and a black portion (area of the network structure) by an image analyzer, and an aperture ratio (%) was calculated according to the following equation.\n\nArea ratio of portion where a conductive portion does not exist (%)=area of white portion\/(area of white portion+area of black portion)\u00d7100\n","(4) Electrical Conductivity","The electrical conductivity was measured based on the surface resistivity. A sample was left standing for 24 hours at normal conditions (23\u00b0 C., relative humidity 65 percent) and, in that atmosphere, the surface resistivity was measured with LORESTA-EP (manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Model: MCP-T360) according to JIS K 7194. Measuring unit is \u03a9\/\u25a1. This apparatus can measure in a range of 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 or less. On the other hand, when a measuring range is 1\u00d710\u03a9\/\u25a1 or more, after the application of an applied voltage of 100 V for 10 seconds, the surface resistivity was measured with a digital super-high resistance\/microammeter R8340A (manufactured by ADVANTEST CORPORATION). The unit is \u03a9\/\u25a1.","(5) Transparency","The transparency was evaluated by the haze and the total light transmittance. A film was left standing for 2 hours at normal conditions (23\u00b0 C., relative humidity 65 percent), and then the haze and the total light transmittance were measured with a fully automatic direct-reading Haze Computer \u201cHGM-2DP\u201d manufactured by SUGA TEST INSTRUMENTS Co., Ltd. An average value of 3 measurements was taken as the haze value and the total light transmittance of the sample. In addition, the film was placed in such a way that light enters from the surface on which the conductive portion was provided to be measured.","(6) Number Average Particle Diameter of Metal Fine Particle","A solution in which metal fine particles are dispersed was applied onto a copper mesh and this mesh was observed with a transmission electron microscope (H-7100FA, manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.) to determine a number average particle diameter of metal fine particles. Particle diameters of 100 metal fine particles were measured and an average thereof was taken as a number average particle diameter.","(7) Anti-moir\u00e9 phenomenon","The conductive film of our disclosure or the electromagnetic interference film was held just anterior to a flat panel display screen on which a image is displayed in such a way that the screen and the film are in parallel with each other, and a substrate was rotated by 360\u00b0 angle while maintaining a state in which the screen and the film surface are in parallel with each other, and the occurrence of the moir\u00e9 phenomenon during this rotation was visually checked to evaluate the anti-a moir\u00e9 phenomenon. The evaluations were performed using a liquid crystal display \u201cE152FPb\u201d manufactured by Dell Inc. as a flat pane display.","First, the following coating solution for forming a conductive portion was prepared.","\u201cCoating Solution for Forming a Conductive Portion\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["Coating solution A1:\n        \n        ","Coating solution B1:\n        \n        ","Acid components"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0111"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"terephthalic acid","60 mole percent"]},{"entry":[{},"isophthalic acid","30 mole percent"]},{"entry":[{},"5-sodium sulfoisophthalic acid","10 mole percent"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0007-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0008","list-style":"none"},"li":"Diol components"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0113"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"ethylene glycol","95 mole percent\u2002"]},{"entry":[{},"diethylene glycol","3 mole percent"]},{"entry":[{},"polyethylene glycol","2 mole percent"]},{"entry":[{},"(molecular weight 600)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":"Coating solution C1:\n        \n        "}}}},"A mixture prepared by mixing the above-described coating solution A1 and coating solution C1 at a ratio of coating solution A1\/coating solution C1=16\/50 on a weight of solid basis was aged at room temperature for 5 days (abbreviated to as an aged coating solution 1).
