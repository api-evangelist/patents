{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLES","Example 1","Example 2","Example 3"],"p":["The present invention relates to nonwoven materials produced from continuous tow bands, and to apparatuses, systems, and methods related thereto.","Nonwoven material is a term of art that refers to a manufactured sheet, batting, webbing, or fabric that is held together by various methods. Those methods include, for example, fusion of fibers (e.g., thermal, ultrasonic, pressure, and the like), bonding of fibers (e.g., resins, solvents, adhesives, and the like), and mechanical entangling (e.g., needle-punching, hydroentangling, and the like). The term is sometimes used broadly to cover other structures such as those held together by interlacing of yarns (stitch bonding) or those made from perforated or porous films. The term excludes woven, knitted, and tufted structures, paper, and felts made by wet milling processes.","Nonwoven materials can be produced from carding processes that convert bales of staple fibers into mats that are needlepunched or hydroentangled to produce the nonwoven materials. Staple fibers are finite in length (approximately 7 centimeters in length) that during carding are spread into a uniform web. In the final steps of carding, a resin bonding treatment is typically included to enhance the robustness of the final nonwoven material, e.g., making the nonwoven material durable to washing.","During the carding process, staple fibers which are shorter may not be able to be carded by the carding apparatus and drop to the floor thereby creating waste. In some instances, recycling of the shorter stable fibers is performed to minimize waste.","Further, during the carding process, stable fibers may become airborne thereby increasing mechanical problems and health risk. Airborne fibers may collect in the equipment leading to increased maintenance and possible downtime. Further, airborne fibers pose inhalation and dermal irritation risks to workers.","Because of the significant investment in capital equipment for carding and health issues associated with processing bales of staple fiber, the production of nonwoven materials from tow bands has been of interest to one skilled in the art. As used herein, the terms \u201ccontinuous tow band\u201d and \u201ctow band\u201d may be used interchangeably to refer to a collection of continuous (e.g., indefinite or extreme length) fiber filaments without defined twist usually held together with a crimp and\/or tackifier. It should be noted that tow bands may be of any cross-sectional shapes including, but not limited to, circular, substantially circular, ovular, substantially ovular, rectangular, substantially rectangular, planar, and substantially planar.","Producing nonwoven materials from continuous tow bands potentially increases the production speed of nonwoven materials in two ways. First, tow bands can be processed on the order of 650 meters per minute while bales of staple fibers can be run at a max speed of about 400 meters per minute. Second, bales of tow bands have more material than bales of staple fibers, which reduces the frequency of switch bales relative to the production volume of nonwoven materials. However, tow bands are typically produced with maximum widths of about 15 cm to about 60 cm depending on the composition of the tow band filaments. As some nonwoven materials need to be produced with widths of meters, the use of tow bands for the production of nonwovens has been limited.","Apparatuses to bring together tow bands to produce nonwoven materials similar in width to nonwoven material produced by carding would be of benefit to one skilled in the art for a plurality of reasons.","The present invention relates to nonwoven materials produced from continuous tow bands, and to apparatuses, systems, and methods related thereto.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method that comprises producing a bulked web from a plurality of processed tow bands; and forming a nonwoven material from the bulked web.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides a system that comprises a plurality of tow band processing lines; and a master air jet in communication with the tow band processing lines to receive a plurality of processed tow bands from the tow band processing lines to form a bulked web.","In other embodiments, the present invention provides a method that comprises processing a plurality of tow bands along at least one tow band processing line to form a plurality of processed tow bands; and combining the plurality of processed tow bands using a master air jet to form a bulked web.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method that comprises forming a plurality of processed tow bands along a plurality of tow band processing lines; combining the plurality of processed tow bands to form a bulked web with a master air jet; transporting the bulked web to a nonwoven manufacturing line; and producing a nonwoven material from the bulked web.","In still other embodiments, the present invention provides a nonwoven material that comprises a needleloomed bulked web comprising a plurality of entangled tow bands.","In other embodiments, the present invention provides a nonwoven material that comprises a hydroentangled bulked web comprising a plurality of entangled tow bands.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides a master air jet that comprises an inlet opening to a central passageway, the inlet opening having a width of about 5 cm to about 10 m and a height of about 0.5 cm to about 5 cm; an air jet capable of forming a Venturi in central passageway; a forming chamber along the central passageway disposed after the air jet; an accumulation chamber formed by at least two perforated plates and at least two side plates, the accumulation chamber being disposed along the central passageway after the forming chamber; and an outlet opening to the central passageway, the outlet opening having a width of about 5 cm to about 10 m and a height of about 2 mm to about 500 mm.","The features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the description of the preferred embodiments that follows.","The present invention relates to nonwoven materials produced from continuous tow bands, and to apparatuses, systems, and methods related thereto.","The systems described herein enable the production of nonwoven materials from continuous tow bands. In some embodiments, the systems are capable of combining tow bands to ultimately produce nonwoven materials with widths many times the width of an individual tow band, e.g., 25 times the width of an individual tow band. The systems advantageously may require less capital investment in equipment, in most cases less than half the investment of traditional carding systems, and may be integrated with other processes and equipment for downstream nonwoven processing (e.g., hydroentanglement or needlelooming). Additionally, the systems of the present invention may, in some embodiments, be configured to produce nonwoven materials with layered or complex compositions at the point of integration of the mat, which in carding processes are produced by combining nonwoven materials as opposed to while the nonwoven materials are being produced.","Utilizing tow bands may also be advantageous in the processing speed and efficiency, in that, bales of tow bands are often more densely packed than staple fiber bales thereby yielding more nonwoven material per bale using tow band bales. Additionally, tow band processing is faster than staple fiber processing. Together, these increase both speed and efficiency of manufacturing nonwoven materials. Further, the utilization of continuous tow bands may provide advantages by reducing waste, reducing processing steps (e.g., eliminating resin bonding), reducing the risk of mechanical problems, and reducing health risks to workers all of which are typically associated with the production of nonwoven materials using carding.","In some embodiments, the systems of the present invention for producing bulked webs from tow bands may comprise at least one tow band processing line operably connected to at least one master air jet to receive processed tow bands from the tow band processing lines, nonlimiting examples of which are illustrated in . In some embodiments, the systems of the present invention for producing bulked webs from tow bands may comprise at least one tow band processing line and at least one master air jet, nonlimiting examples of which are illustrated in . In some embodiments, a system may have six or more tow band processing lines and two or more master air jets (in parallel and\/or in series).","One skilled in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will recognize the apparatuses or machinery capable for properly transporting the continuous tow bands, processed tow bands, and bulked webs to, between, and\/or from the tow band processing lines, the master air jet, and any additional processing areas or lines (e.g., collection areas, additive application areas, nonwoven manufacturing lines, product manufacturing lines, and the like). By way of nonlimiting examples, suitable apparatuses and\/or machinery may include guides, rollers, reels, gears, conveyors, transfer belts, vacuums, air jets, and the like, any hybrid thereof, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, systems may include a conveyor for transporting a bulked web to nonwoven manufacturing lines.","Master air jets generally use an air jet to create a Venturi that moves processed tow bands through the master air jet apparatus. The Venturi may further act to entangle filaments of adjacent processed tow bands as they pass through the master air jet. In some embodiments, the master air jet of the present invention may be configured to received a plurality of processed tow bands. In some embodiments, the master air jet of the present invention may be configured to produce bulked webs produced from tow bands where the bulked webs have calipers and\/or complex cross-sectional make-ups not previously realized. In some embodiments, the increased caliper and\/or possibility of complex cross-sectional make-ups of the bulked webs of the present invention may enable the production of nonwoven materials not previous realized when produced from tow bands.","Referring now to , nonlimiting examples of master air jets of the present invention and components thereof, master air jet  may include housing  that generally is formed by a pair of side plates , top plate , and bottom plate . It should be noted that side, top, and bottom to modify the plates are used for simplicity in describing the master air jet and should not be taken to be limiting as to the relation of the master air jet to the plane of the ground. The pair of side plates  may be operably attached to the top plate  and bottom plate  with bolts at sizing guides .","At one end, master air jet  includes inlet opening . As best seen as an example in , inlet opening  may have a generally rectangular configuration that corresponds generally to the shape of the continuous tow band which is received in inlet opening . Housing  also includes outlet opening  which, as best seen in , may also have a rectangular configuration that corresponds to the desired shape of the processed tow band leaving master air jet .","Air jet  may be formed adjacent the inlet end of housing  and may include a source of compressed air (or other fluid in some embodiments) and a conventional control valve for regulating the flow of compressed air from the compressed air source to air manifold  through which the compressed air is delivered to jet orifices . Jet orifices  may form a conventional jet of air for moving the continuous tow band through central passageway  in housing  as will be explained in greater detail herein. As best seen in , passageway  has a gradually increasing cross-sectional area in the direction of movement of the continuous tow band so as to provide forming chamber  downstream of air jet . Forming chamber  may also preferably have a generally rectangular configuration that corresponds to the rectangular shape of the processed tow bands.","Accumulating chamber  may be located adjacent the outlet end of housing  and downstream of forming chamber  and may have a vertical dimension which is greater than outlet opening  of forming chamber . Accumulating chamber  may also be preferably formed with a rectangular configuration to permit the continuous tow band to pass into accumulating chamber  from forming chamber  to accumulate within accumulating chamber . Ultimately the processed tow bands may be withdrawn from housing  through outlet opening  at different flow rates yielding a bulked web.","As best seen in , a pair of perforated plates , each having a large number of perforations  therein, may be disposed in accumulating chamber  and in side plates  between forming chamber  and accumulating chamber . Perforated plates  may be fixed in place to top plate  and bottom plate  by a plurality of bolts  that maintain perforated plates  in fixed positions to form accumulating chamber .","The size of forming chamber  and accumulating chamber  may be involved in determining the caliper of the bulked web produced from master air jet . Sizing guides  along side plates  allow for increasing or decreasing the size of forming chamber . It should be noted that the configuration of sizing guides  along side plates  may allow for changing the size of forming chamber  by different amounts by angling top plate  relative to bottom plate . Varying the shape and\/or positions of perforated plates  the size of accumulating chamber  may be varied.","Similarly, the size of inlet opening  and outlet opening  may be adjusted using sizing guides  along side plates  or varying the position and\/or shape of perforated plates . Variable sizing of inlet opening  may advantageously allow for receiving higher caliper processed tow bands into master air jet . Also variable sizing of outlet opening  may advantageously allow for producing higher caliper bulked webs.","Side plates  may also have a plurality of perforations  located generally at a position where the carrier air leaves forming chamber  and enters accumulating chamber , whereby some of the carrier air can be discharged through perforations .","In the operation of master air jet , compressed air flows to air jet  at a flow rate controlled by the control valve, and the jet of air formed by orifices  may move the continuous tow band through forming chamber . As the processed tow band moves through forming chamber  by the carrier air, the carrier air may at least partially bulk the processed tow band so that it gradually increases in cross-sectional area in conformity with the gradually increasing cross-sectional area of forming chamber . When the processed tow band exits forming chamber  and enters accumulating chamber , the processed tow band bulks even further to correspond to the vertical distance between the upstream ends of perforated plates  (see ).","While some of the carrier air may be discharged through perforations  in side plates , a substantial portion of the carrier air moves the processed tow band through the spacing between perforated plates  and passes outwardly through perforations  in perforated plates . In so doing, the air passing outwardly through perforations  urges the processed tow band into frictional engagement with the facing inner surfaces of perforated plates . This frictional engagement creates a braking action on the processed tow band which should retard the movement of the processed tow band through accumulating chamber  and causes the tow to accumulate in accumulating chamber  at a density greater than the processed tow band had in forming chamber , after which the bulked and densified processed tow band exits the accumulating chamber  as a bulked web through the outlet opening  at different flow rates.","The flow rate of the carrier air may determine the retarding or braking action applied to the continuous tow band as it passes between perforated plates . If the flow rate of the carrier air is increased, the carrier air passing outwardly through perforations  in perforated plates  will urge the processed tow band into engagement with perforated plates  with a greater force, and may thereby increase the retarding or braking action that is applied to the processed tow band. Conversely, if the flow rate of the carrier air is decreased, there will be a smaller braking action applied to the processed tow band. Therefore, virtually infinite regulation of the braking action may be obtained by the simple expedient of operating the control valve to provide a flow of carrier air that provides the desired braking action imposed on the processed tow band, and thereby should control the density and caliper of the bulked web as it leaves housing .","In some embodiments, master air jets of the present invention may having hinged side plates. Hinged side plates may advantageously allow for physically pulling processed tow bands through the master air jet then closing the hinged side plates with the air jets operating so as to create the Venturi that then operates to transport the processed tow bands through the master air jet. By way of nonlimiting example, the ability to physically start the movement of the processed tow bands through the master air jet may be needed with high denier and high denier per filament processed tow bands.","Referring now to , nonlimiting examples of a master air jet of the present invention and components thereof, master air jet  may have a pair of hinged side plates having side plate top half  and side plate bottom half , and side plate hinge . Housing  may be generally formed by top plate  operably attached to side plate top half  and bottom plate  operably attached to side plate bottom half . It should be noted that side, top, and bottom to modify the plates (or components thereof) are used for simplicity in describing the master air jet and should not be taken to be limiting as to the relation of the master air jet to the plane of the ground.","The side plates may have side plate guides  operably attached to either side plate top half  and side plate bottom half  (not shown) to ensure proper alignment when the side plates are closed. To keep the side plate halves  and  closed during operation, at least one side plate guide  may be capable of operably attaching to both side plate halves  and . As shown in , one side plate guide  is attached to side plate top half  and has a hole that lines up with a threaded hole in side plate bottom half  allowing for a bolt to secure side plate halves  and  in the closed position.","One skilled in the art should recognize the plurality of modification to hinged side plates that achieve the same function of the master air jet, e.g., side plate halves with grooves rather than side plate guides to ensure proper alignment. Further, one skilled in the art should recognize that during operation a processed tow band passing through the master air jet may snag on some imperfections (e.g., burs or gaps) in the side plates, especially at high air jet speeds. Snagging has the potential to adversely affect the edges of the bulked webs produced and, in some cases, cause inoperability of the master air jet.","In some embodiments, master air jets of the present invention may have a sizeable outlet opening. Referring now to , a nonlimiting example of a master air jet of the present invention and components thereof, master air jet  may include housing  that generally is formed by a pair of side plates having side plate top half  and side plate bottom half  with side plate hinge ; top plate  operably attached to side plate top half , and bottom plate  (not shown) operably attached to side plate bottom half . Accumulating chamber  (not shown) is formed by a pair of perforated plates  fixed in place to top plate  and bottom plate  by hinges  that allow for sizing outlet  by fixing perforated plates  into position by securing perforated plate sizing rods  in outlet sizing guides  with nut .","One skilled in the art should recognize the plurality of modification to hinged perforated plates that achieve the same function of the master air jet, e.g., vertical screws to adjust the location of the perforated plates and consequently the size of the outlet opening on the fly. One skilled in the art should recognize the modifications should maintain the intended purpose of the perforated plates, i.e., provide a brake for the processed tow bands passing therethrough so as to create the bulk of the subsequent bulked web.","In some embodiments, master air jets of the present invention may have any combination of the features including, but not limited to, adjustable side plates, hinged side plates, a sizeable inlet opening, and a sizeable outlet opening. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a master air jet that comprises an inlet opening to a central passageway, the inlet opening having a width of about 5 cm to about 10 m and a height of about 0.5 cm to about 5 cm; an air jet capable of forming a Venturi in a central passageway; a forming chamber along the central passageway disposed after the air jet; an accumulation chamber formed by at least two perforated plates and at least two side plates, the accumulation chamber being disposed along the central passageway after the forming chamber; and an outlet opening to the central passageway, the outlet opening having a width of about 5 cm to about 10 m and a height of about 2 mm to about 500 mm. In some embodiments said master air jet may have a sizeable inlet opening and\/or a sizeable outlet opening.","In some embodiments, master air jets of the present invention may be configured with an inlet opening having dimensions of width ranging from a lower limit of about 5 cm, 10 cm, 25 cm, or 50 cm to an upper limit of about 10 m, 5 m, 1 m (100 cm), or 50 cm, and wherein the inlet opening width may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween. In some embodiments, master air jets of the present invention may be configured with an inlet opening having dimensions of height ranging from a lower limit of about 0.5 cm, 1 cm, 2 cm, or 3 cm to and upper limit of about 5 cm, 4 cm, or 3 cm, and wherein the inlet opening height may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.","In some embodiments, master air jets of the present invention may be configured with an outlet opening having dimensions of width ranging from a lower limit of about 5 cm, 10 cm, 25 cm, or 50 cm to an upper limit of about 10 m, 5 m, 1 m (100 cm), or 50 cm, and wherein the outlet opening width may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween. In some embodiments, master air jets of the present invention may be configured with an outlet opening having dimensions of height ranging from a lower limit of about 2 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 25 mm, or 50 mm to an upper limit of about 500 mm, 250 mm, 200 mm, 150 mm, 100 mm, or 50 mm, and wherein the outlet opening height may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.","In some embodiments of the present invention, two or more master air jets may be in series. Because master air jets produce bulked webs with increased caliper, the dimensions of the inlet of the second (or greater) master air jet in a series should be appropriately sized. It should be noted that the Venturi in the master air jet may create some tension on the processed tow bands (or bulked webs for embodiments with master air jets in series). As such, the caliper of the processed tow bands (or bulked webs) may be less entering the master air jet than the caliper of the processed tow bands (or bulked webs) leaving the tow band processing lines (or a previous master air jet). Further, to control the proper transfer from one master air jet to another, one skilled in the art should recognize the potential apparatuses and\/or machinery that may assist with ensuring the second (or greater) master air jet does not create too much tension on the bulked web so as to hinder the proper operation of the previous master air jet. By way of a nonlimiting example, tension rollers may be used for proper transfer between master air jets.","Some embodiments may involve producing bulked webs from continuous tow bands. In some embodiments, producing bulked webs from continuous tow bands may comprise processing at least one continuous tow band to form processed tow bands and forming a bulked web from the processed tow band(s). In some embodiments, producing bulked webs from continuous tow bands may comprise processing a plurality of tow bands to form processed tow bands and combining the processed tow bands into a bulked web. As used herein, the term \u201ccontinuous tow band\u201d refers to a collection of continuous (e.g., indefinite or extreme length) fiber filaments without defined twist usually held together with a crimp and\/or tackifier. As used herein, the term \u201cbulking,\u201d and derivatives thereof, refers to increasing caliper without substantial spreading laterally. As used herein, the term \u201ccaliper\u201d refers to thickness. As used herein, the term \u201cprocessed tow bands,\u201d and derivatives thereof, refers to a tow band that has been processed along a tow band processing line. As used herein, the term \u201cbulked web\u201d refers to the product of entangled filaments from the master air jet.","In some embodiments, processing continuous tow bands may occur along tow band processing lines. In some embodiments, tow band processing lines may include apparatuses and\/or machinery to spread tow bands, uncrimp tow bands, open tow bands, bulk tow bands, apply additives to tow bands, or any combination thereof. One skilled in the art should understand the apparatuses and\/or machinery needed to spread tow bands, uncrimp tow bands, bulk tow bands, apply additives to tow bands, or any combination thereof. Nonlimiting examples of suitable apparatuses and\/or machinery may include spreaders, tension rollers, guide rollers, air bulking jets, sprayers, steamers, and the like, or any combination thereof. Examples of air bulking jets are described in more detail herein and can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,253,431 and 6,543,106, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","In some embodiments, systems of the present invention may include multiple (at least two) tow band processing lines. In some embodiments, systems may include a number of tow band processing lines ranging from a lower limit of about 2, 3, 5, or 10 to an upper limit of about 100, 50, 40, 30, or 20, and wherein the number of tow band processing lines may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.","In some embodiments, a tow band processing line may process one or more continuous tow bands. By way of nonlimiting example, in some embodiments of the present invention, as illustrated in , one continuous tow band may be processed along a tow band processing line including at least spreaders and tension rollers. The processed tow band from the processing line may be received by a master air jet and formed into a bulked web. By way of nonlimiting example, in some embodiments of the present invention, as illustrated in , some embodiments may involve processing four continuous tow bands along two tow band processing lines (two continuous tow bands per processing line) each including at least spreaders and tension rollers. The processed tow bands produced therefrom may be received by a master air jet in a stacked configuration to produce a bulked web having a cross-sectional make-up substantially similar to the composition and relative orientation of the process tow band as introduced into the master air jet. By way of another nonlimiting example of the present invention, as illustrated in , some embodiments may involve processing eight continuous tow bands along three tow band processing lines (three continuous tow bands along two tow processing lines and two continuous tow bands along a third tow band processing line). Two of the tow band processing lines may include spreaders and tension rollers, while the third tow band processing line may include spreaders, tension rollers, and an air forming jet. The processed tow bands produced therefrom may be received by a master air jet in a stacked configuration to produce a bulked web having a cross-sectional make-up substantially similar to the composition and relative orientation of the process tow band as introduced into the master air jet.","It should be noted that in  processed tow bands from multiple continuous tow bands are depicted as a single processed tow band. However, in some embodiments, processing a plurality of continuous tow bands along a single tow band processing line may yield a single processed tow band comprising the plurality of continuous tow bands having been processed or a plurality of processed tow bands comprising one or some subset of the continuous tow bands having been processed. By way of nonlimiting example, a system of the present invention may comprise a tow band processing line capable of receiving at least two continuous tow bands and producing a single processed tow band. By way of another nonlimiting example, a system of the present invention may comprise a tow band processing line capable of receiving at least two continuous tow bands and producing the same number of processed tow bands. By way of yet another nonlimiting example, a system of the present invention may comprise a tow band processing line capable of receiving at least three continuous tow bands and producing two processed tow bands.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a continuous tow band may comprise more than one type of filament as characterized by, inter alia, composition, cross-sectional shape, denier per filament, any other suitable characteristic, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, tow band processing lines for use in conjunction with the present invention may process more than one of the same type of tow bands. In some embodiments, tow band processing lines for use in conjunction with the present invention may process more than one tow band as characterized by, inter alia, filament composition, filament cross-sectional shape, denier per filament, total denier, any other suitable characteristic, or any combination thereof.","Examples of suitable continuous tow bands for use in conjunction with the present invention may include, but not be limited to, continuous tow bands that include carbon filaments, activated carbon filaments, natural fibers, synthetic filaments, bicomponent fibers, or any combination thereof.

As used herein, the term \u201cmulti-lobe\u201d refers to a cross-sectional shape having a point (not necessarily in the center of the cross-section) from which at least two lobes extend (not necessarily evenly spaced or evenly sized).","It should be noted that when \u201cabout\u201d is provided below in reference to a number in a numerical list, the term \u201cabout\u201d modifies each number of the numerical list. It should be noted that in some numerical listings of ranges, some lower limits listed may be greater than some upper limits listed. One skilled in the art will recognize that the selected subset will require the selection of an upper limit in excess of the selected lower limit.","In some embodiments, continuous tow bands for use in conjunction with the present invention may have a denier per filament (dpf) ranging from a lower limit of about 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 12, 15, or 16 to an upper limit of about 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 12, 10, 7, or 5, and wherein the denier per filament may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.

In some embodiments, continuous tow bands and\/or processed tow bands for use in conjunction with the present invention may have a width ranging from a lower limit of about 1, 2, 4, or 3 cm to an upper limit of about 75, 50, 25, or 10 cm, and wherein the width may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.","In some embodiments of the present invention, processed tow bands may have a caliper of about 2 mm or greater. In some embodiments of the present invention, processed tow bands may have a caliper ranging from a lower limit of about 2 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm, or 10 mm to an upper limit of about 100 mm, 50 mm, 25 mm, or 10 mm, and wherein the caliper of the processed tow bands may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.","Some embodiments of the present invention may involve combining processed tow bands using a master air jet.

In no way should the following examples be read to limit, or to define, the scope of the invention.","To combine two tow bands, a system was used that included a tow band processing line having three tow spreaders, a master air jet for receiving the tow bands from the tow band processing line, hand-held guidery between the first and second tow spreaders of the tow band processing line, and hand-held guidery between the tow band processing line and master air jet. Two tow bands were spread on the tow band processing lines then introduced in a stacked configuration into the master air jet. One tow band was colored while the other tow band was white. The produced bulked web produced has intermingling at the interface of the two tow bands and has sidedness with one side being substantially the colored tow band and the other side being substantially the white tow band. This example demonstrates the cross-sectional make-up of the bulked web is substantially the same as the composition and positional relationship of the processed tow bands as introduced into the master air jet.","A polyester tow band having 280,000 total denier, 2.25 dpf, 44 crimps\/10 cm, and a 4 inch width, shown in  was run along a tow band processing line having 3 spreaders and a delivery roll and into a master air jet. The master air jet had an inlet width of 250 mm, air pressure of 60 psig, inlet height of 10 mm, and outlet height of 39 mm. The bulked polyester tow band as introduced into the master air jet had substantially the same width, approximately 10 inches, as the bulked web exiting the master air jet, as shown in , and C, respectively. The produced bulked web had a caliper of about 4.5 cm as shown in . It should be noted that the caliper of the resultant consolidated web was greater than the outlet height of the master air jet.","A section of 3,000,000 tow band was extracted yielding about a 200,000 total denier tow band. A lyocell tow band having a 24-inch substantially circular cross-section (as compared to the rectangular cross-section of Example 2) with a total denier of about 350,000, 3 dpf filaments, and 30 crimps\/10 cm, shown after spreading in , was processed through the same procedure as Example 2 to produce a bulked web having a caliper of about 5.5 cm as shown in . It should be noted that similar to Example 2 the caliper of the resultant consolidated web was greater than the outlet height of the master air jet.","Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein.
