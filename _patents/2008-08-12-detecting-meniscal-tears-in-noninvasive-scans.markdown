title: Detecting meniscal tears in non-invasive scans
abstract: Techniques for automatically detecting meniscus include receiving pixels from a scanning device directed to a knee of a subject. Also received is a region of interest that includes pixels that correspond to at least a portion of a meniscus of the knee. Without human intervention, a meniscus extraction threshold is determined based on pixel intensities in the region of interest. A meniscus object portion of the scan data is further determined without human intervention based on the meniscus extraction threshold and a geometrical constraint. Other techniques for automatically detecting meniscal tears includes receiving a meniscus object portion of scan data from a scanning device and receiving threshold data that indicates a meniscus extraction threshold. Without human intervention, a propensity for meniscal tears is determined based on the threshold data and the meniscus object portion of the scan data.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to interpreting non-invasive scans of a knee of a subject to determine properties of a meniscus of the knee, and, in particular, to determining one or more properties of the meniscus, such as tears, without human intervention.","2. Description of the Related Art","The meniscus is an important part of the knee support mechanism. It includes 2 large C-shaped (medial side) and O-shaped (lateral side) structures and acts as a cushion between the femur and the tibia. Although the meniscus is highly tolerant to axial forces, it is susceptible to rotational forces, which may result in meniscal tearing. If a tear originating in the periphery of the meniscus is left untreated, it propagates easily and may affect the mechanical integrity of the entire knee joint. Knee-related injuries, including meniscal tears, are common in both young athletes and the aging population, requiring accurate diagnosis and, when appropriate, surgical intervention. Despite the frequency of such injuries, few published studies have focused on means to enhance and refine detection of meniscal tears. (See for example, Y Hata, S Kobashi, S Tokimoto, M Ishikawa, H Ishikawa, \u201cComputer-aided diagnosis system of meniscal tears with T1- and T2-weighted MR images based on fuzzy inference,\u201d Lect Notes , vol. 2206, pp 55-58, 2001).","The meniscus is a soft tissue feature with low contrast in imagery from many scanning devices, such as X-rays and X-ray computer tomography (CT) scans. The superior soft-tissue contrast and spatial resolution provided by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging enables radiologists to characterize and differentiate pathologic from normal soft tissue, including meniscus tissue. MR imaging offers significant and specific help in the diagnosis of internal derangements of the knee, including meniscal tears. A normal meniscus appears as uniform, low-signal triangles or polygons on certain slices of MR imaging. However, when the meniscus is torn, the normal low-signal appearance is disrupted. A meniscal tear, then, can be detected if the normal shape of the meniscus is disrupted by an abnormal signal or if part of the meniscus is missing. Challenges in diagnoses of meniscal pathology include differentiation of tears, which indicate a need for surgery, from internal degenerative change, which would obviate the need for surgery.","With proper techniques and experienced skills, confidence in detection of meniscal tears by a skilled radiologist can be quite high. However, for radiologists without musculoskeletal training, diagnosis of meniscal tears can be challenging. Even for highly experienced radiologists, the effort to explore multiple images from the MR scans and identify views of the meniscus with sufficient area and detail to detect tears is tedious and time consuming and can lead to errors of omission if a salient scan slice is skipped.","In a first set of embodiments, a method for automatically detecting meniscus in non-invasive scans includes receiving scan data from a scanning device, in which the scan data is directed to a knee of a subject. Data that indicates a region of interest within the scan data is also received. The region of interest includes scan elements that correspond to at least a portion of a meniscus of the knee of the subject. Without human intervention, a meniscus extraction threshold is determined based on scan element intensities in the region of interest. A meniscus object portion of the scan data is further determined without human intervention based on the meniscus extraction threshold and a geometrical constraint.","In some of these embodiments, receiving the data that indicates the region of interest includes determining the region of interest within the scan data without human intervention based on historical usage of the scanning device.","In some of the first set of embodiments, determining the meniscus extraction threshold includes determining a single average intensity of all the scan elements in the region of interest, and determining the meniscus extraction threshold as a numeric factor of the average intensity.","In a second set of embodiments, a method for automatically detecting meniscal tears in non-invasive scans includes receiving a meniscus object portion of scan data from a scanning device and receiving threshold data that indicates an intensity threshold used to define the meniscus object portion of the scan data. Without human intervention, a propensity for meniscal tears is determined based on the threshold data and the meniscus object portion of the scan data.","In some of the embodiments of the second set, receiving the meniscus object portion of the scan data includes determining the meniscus object portion from the scan data without human intervention.","In some of the embodiments of the second set, determining the propensity for meniscal tears includes determining a breakability measure based on a largest breaking fraction of a plurality of fractions of the particular intensity used to define the meniscus object portion. A threshold based on a breaking fraction divides the meniscus object portion into multiple distinct portions.","In some of the embodiments of the second set, determining the propensity for meniscal tears includes determining a degeneracy measure. The degeneracy measure is based on decrease in area of the meniscus object portion that is within a threshold, when the threshold is equal to a fraction of the particular intensity used to define the meniscus object portion. The decrease in area is determined for multiple fractions of the particular intensity.","In some of the embodiments of the second set, determining the propensity for meniscal tears includes determining if a property in the meniscus object portion of the scan data is similar to properties in historical scan data for which a tear occurred. If so, then it is determined that the scan data indicates a tear in a meniscus of the knee of the subject.","In various other embodiments, an apparatus, or logic encoded in one or more tangible media, or instructions encoded on one or more computer-readable media is configured to perform one or more steps of the above methods.","A method and apparatus are described for detecting meniscus tissue or tears therein, or both. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Some embodiments of the invention are described below in the context of current MR imagery used by radiologists to detect meniscal tears. In this kind of imagery, the meniscus tissue is represented by the lowest intensities inside the outer surface of the subject and pixel sizes are about 0.3125 millimeters (mm, 1 mm=10meters) across. However, the invention is not limited to this context. In other embodiments, other scanning devices that also differentiate meniscus tissue from cartilage tissue and that also show varying intensity within meniscus tissue, no matter the range of intensities, are used with larger or smaller pixel sizes, including future MR scanners, CT-scanners, multispectral CT scanners, ultrasound scanners, positron emission tomography (PET), and other appropriate medical imagining devices known by one of ordinary skill in the art at the time an embodiment is implemented.","1.

For purposes of illustration a living body is depicted as subject , but is not part of the system . In the illustrated embodiment, the subject  is depicted in a supine position with feet closest to the viewer and pointing up, and head on the far side. The view of  is in a plane perpendicular to a long axis of the subject , which is called herein an axial plane. Positions in the subject  closer to the subject bottom  are said to be inferior; while positions closer to the subject top  are said to be superior. Positions in the subject  closer to the subject front  are said to be anterior; while positions closer to the subject back  are said to be posterior. A medial plane, perpendicular to the axial plane, divides the left half of the subject from the right half and is a symmetry axis of approximate reflected symmetry. A coronal plane  is perpendicular to both the axial plane and the medial plane . A front view direction of the coronal plane is the coronal view direction . A sagittal plane  is parallel to the medial plane . A side of a knee closer to the medial plane is called the medial side, and the opposite side of the knee is the lateral side. The meniscus in each knee of the subject  includes a large C-shaped medial meniscus and large O-shaped lateral meniscus.","In the illustrated embodiment, system  includes a scanning device, scanner , such as a full dose X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, a multi-spectral CT scanner, or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. In some embodiments, the scanner  is used at two or more different times. The scanner  is configured to produce scanned images, such that each image represents a cross section of the living body at one of multiple cross sectional (transverse) slices, often approximately parallel to the axial plane, and often initially arranged along the axial direction of the subject.","In system , the scanner is controlled by one or more devices, such as one or more networked computers, represented by controller . Data from the scanner  is received at a controller  and stored on a storage device as scan data . Computer systems and storage devices, as in controller , are described in more detail in a later section.","In various embodiments, a meniscal tear process  operates on controller  to determine a boundary between scan elements of scan data which are inside and outside a meniscus and process the scan elements inside the boundary to determine a propensity for tears.","Although system  is depicted with a particular number of scanners , controllers  and scan data  for purposes of illustration, in other embodiments more scanners, controllers or scan data constitute an imaging system for determining properties of meniscus tissue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["110","110","102","104","110","112","190","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["120","102","104","106","120","122","190","122"]},"The terms scan elements, pixels and voxels are used interchangeably herein to represent either 2D scan elements (pixels) or 3D scan elements (voxels), or both, depending on the context.

For example, scan data is received from scanner . In an illustrated embodiment, the scan data is received from a current MR scanner, but it is specifically anticipated that in other embodiments scan data is received from later generation MR imagers or other scanning devices. In the illustrated embodiments, scan data was received for subjects scanned using either Siemens Avanto 1.5-T MR or a Siemens Esprit 1.5-T scanner. An 8-channel extremity coil was used. Sagittal T1-weighted sequences (TR=580-800 ms, TE=10-20 ms) and a 512\u00d7512 were used. Meniscal tears can be diagnosed on both T1 and proton density MR images from this equipment.","Any method may be used to receive this data. For example, in various embodiments, the data is retrieved from a local file or database, or is sent from a different node on the network, either in response to a query or unsolicited, or the data is received using some combination of these methods.","In step , a region of interest (ROI) in the scan data is determined without human intervention based on historical use of scanning device. The region of interest is a subset of the scan data that includes scan elements that correspond to meniscus tissue and the vicinity thereof. In some embodiment, the ROI is determined by a human analyst and step  is replaced with a different step for receiving data that indicates the ROI. In some embodiments other parameters are also determined or received in this step, such as meniscus size and shape ranges and tear threshold scores, described in more detail below. Any method may be used to receive the ROI data or the historical data that indicates a ROI or other parameters. For example, in various embodiments, the data is included as a default value in software instructions, is received as manual input from an analyst or technician on the local or a remote node, is retrieved from a local file or database, or is sent from a different node on the network, either in response to a query or unsolicited, or the data is received using some combination of these methods. A particular embodiment of step  is described in more detail in a following section, with reference to , ,  and .","In step , an intensity threshold, called a meniscus extraction threshold that distinguishes the scan elements that correspond to the meniscus from surrounding tissue, is determined automatically, without human intervention, based on the region of interest. For current MR scan data in which the meniscus is represented by scan elements with the lowest intensities, the threshold is an upper threshold. In other scanning devices in which the meniscus tissue is represented by scan elements with the highest intensities, the threshold is a lower threshold. In still other embodiments, in which the meniscus tissue is represented by scan elements with intermediate intensities, the threshold is a matched pair of upper and lower thresholds. In the illustrated embodiment, the meniscus extraction threshold is adaptively determined for each set of scan data to allow for observed differences in thresholds among different devices and operators. A particular embodiment of step  is described in more detail in a following section, with reference to . In some embodiments, a human analyst determines the meniscus extraction threshold of the scan data, and step  is omitted.","It is noted here that many scan elements that do not represent meniscus tissue are also indicated by the threshold, and so in the illustrated embodiments, meniscus-like objects are defined. The meniscus extraction threshold determined in step , according to these embodiments, produces the maximum number of meniscus-like objects, when summed over all slices that span the ROI. As used herein, an object is a contiguous set of scan elements with intensities within the threshold (below an upper threshold, or above a lower threshold, or between a lower threshold and upper threshold of a matched pair). A meniscus-like object is an object that satisfies geometrical constraints for meniscus, such as falling within a particular size range or shape range or both. An embodiment of step  defining meniscus-like objects is described in more detail below with reference to .","In step , a meniscus object portion of the scan data is determined automatically, without human intervention, based on the meniscus intensity threshold. In embodiments in which the meniscus extraction threshold was determined based on the number of meniscus-like objects, these objects were already determined. In the illustrated embodiment, the meniscus object portion of the scan data includes not just the scan elements of the meniscus-like object but all scan elements in a minimum convex mask that encompasses the meniscus-like object.

In some embodiments, a score proportional to propensity for tears is determined. In some embodiments, a tear\/no-tear decision is made during step  for each of one or more divisions of the meniscus (e.g., medial\/lateral\/anterior\/posterior). As used herein a propensity for tears is indicated by any data that visualizes, summarizes or measures bright, non-cartilage pixels in a meniscus object portion of scan data, including gray scale images, color images, binary images, scores, weighted scores, combined scores, and tear\/no tear decisions, as described in more detail below.

Determining Region of Interest (ROI)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","230"]},"In step , a size of an area of interest (AOI) is selected that is useful for detecting the meniscus in one slice of the scan data of the type received in step . For example, based on experience with sagittal slices where the meniscus is prominent (see, e.g.,  described below) a historically useful area is about three centimeters (cm, 1 cm=10meters) vertically by five and a half centimeters horizontally, which is sufficient to encompass the knee joint where the meniscus is found. For current MR scanners, with pixel size of 0.3125 mm, an appropriate AOI is 100 rows by 180 columns of pixels, for an area of 3.125 cm by 5.625 cm (see, e.g., AOI  in ).","In step , an initial set of sagittal slices with historically prominent views of the meniscus is selected. Analysis of tears by a human analyst is historically performed using sagittal slices where the meniscus is clearly seen with sufficient area to detect tears. The inventors determined that the locations of meniscal tissue relative to the imaged volume tend to be stable when a uniform acquisition protocol is utilized, as is currently standard procedure. The inventors have determined that most useful sagittal slices are those that depict portions of the subject's knee from about 20% to about 35% of the distance across the knee from either the lateral or medial side. Thus, in an illustrated embodiment, the initial set of sagittal slices are located from about 20 percent to about 35 percent of a distance between an outside pair of sagittal planes that are each tangent to a different outer surface of the knee of the subject. This distance corresponds to about 20% to about 35% of the total number N of sagittal slices that span the knee.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","1","26","1","6","410","7","10","420","11","17","430","26","18","21","440","22","26","450","7","10","18","21"]},"In step , a mean image is determined for the sagittal slices in the initial set. Each mean scan element in the mean image is based on an average of intensity values in corresponding scan elements in the initial set of sagittal slices of the scan data. This relationship is indicated by Equation 1.\n\n()=mean()}\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nWhere i is an index that indicates a row of a pixel and j is an index that indicates a column of a pixel and k is an index that indicates a sagittal slice, 1\u2266k\u2266N where the pixel is located. Iis the 2-D image of the kth slice. Sinitial indicates k values for the initial set (e.g., 7-10 and 18-21) of sagittal slices, and \u03b5 indicates values that are elements of the following set. M is the resulting mean image. Thus the operation indicated by Equation 1 is performed on a pixel by pixel basis only for the slices that are in the initial set of sagittal slices. Note that I, and therefore M, is in general larger than the size of the AOI received in step , because the purpose of M is to determine where to center an AOI of the size received in step .\n","In step , a band of extreme intensity is determined in the mean image to center an AOI. For example, for scan data in which the meniscus is a minimum in intensity, as in current MR scan data, the extreme is a minimum. In other embodiments, the meniscus is associated with a maximum intensity, and the extreme is a maximum. As used herein, an extreme intensity is a minimum intensity or a maximum intensity. In some embodiments a meniscus is not associated with an extreme intensity, and steps  and  are omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","510","502","504","504"]},"The trace  shows how average\/total pixel intensity in a row varies with row. A minimum  occurs at rows near the vertical center of the meniscus. Thus a row near the minimum  is selected as a center row of an AOI having the historical size (e.g., 100 rows by 180 columns).","In some embodiments, to reduce the effects of noisy data, or for computational efficiency, the mean image M is divided into a number Nof bands W(ij) (1<n<N) that have small height relative to the AOI row size, and the average (or total) intensity is determined for each band of rows. In an illustrated embodiment the band height is 16 rows. Since the band height (e.g., 16 rows) is small compared to the AOI row size (e.g., 100 rows), an AOI centered on the center row of a band is still likely to encompass the meniscus and tissues in the immediate vicinity of the meniscus.  is a diagram  that illustrates properties of bands of the average image M .

The band with minimum  is designated herein as Wand the selection of n* is given by Equation 2\n\n*=arg[min{mean()}]\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere min indicates the operation of selecting the minimum value over the following set of values, and arg indicates the operation of selecting the argument (or sequence number) corresponding to the member of the set selected by the min operation.\n","In step , an area of interest (AOI) is centered on an extreme row, such as a center row of a band of extreme intensity. The subset of the images Iin the area of interest centered on the minimum row, or band W, is indicated as I.","In some embodiments, the scan elements included in a volume of interest (VOI) are simply the Ifor k\u03b5Sinitial.

The slices in the final set show small deviations in the AOI from the template. Any method may be used to measure the deviation from the template. In an illustrated embodiment, a mean square error (MSE) is used as the measure of deviation.

Meniscal Extraction","Meniscal extraction is a process that separates menisci from other structures of the knee after the ROIs have been defined. MR images acquired from different medical centers and vendors may have significant variations in intensities, and it is advantageous to make the meniscus extraction adaptive to such intensity variations. In an illustrated embodiment, the threshold for the meniscal extraction is adjusted and estimated automatically for each case, as indicated by step  in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["600","600","240","250","600","300"]},"In step , an average intensity, \u03bc, is determined in the ROI. For example, \u03bc is determined using Equation 5b.\n\n\u03bc=(final*)\u03a3\u03a3\u03a3()\u2003\u2003(5b)\n\nwhere Nfinal is the number of slices in the final set of sagittal slices, Ni is the number of rows in the AOI (e.g., 100) and Nj is the number of columns in the AOI (e.g., 180).\n","During step  a next candidate threshold \u03c4(m=1, N\u03c4, where N\u03c4 is the number of candidate thresholds to be tried) is also determined based on \u03bc. For example, for scan data in which the meniscus is a minimum, the candidate threshold is an upper threshold that is a fraction less than one of \u03bc. For scan data in which the meniscus is a maximum, the candidate threshold is a lower threshold that is a numeric factor of \u03bc that may be less than, equal to or greater than one times \u03bc. For scan data in which the meniscus is a middle intensity, the candidate threshold is a matched pair of lower and upper candidate thresholds that are each a numeric factor of \u03bc. In an illustrated embodiment, the next candidate threshold is a first upper threshold \u03c4equal to 0.2*\u03bc.","In step , the pixels within the candidate threshold are determined. For example, a binary image is generated from the AOI in each slice of the final set, in which each pixel with an intensity within the candidate threshold is given one of two binary values (e.g., 1) and each pixel outside the candidate threshold is given a different one of the two binary values (e.g., 0). A pixel intensity is within a threshold, as used herein, if the intensity is less than or equal to an upper threshold, greater than or equal to a lower threshold, or in a range of a matched pair of upper and lower thresholds, inclusive.","During step  objects are also determined in each image of the final set of slices. As used herein, an object is a contiguous set of scan elements within the candidate threshold.  through  are image portions that depict scan elements associated with an object based on a particular threshold value, according to an embodiment.  depicts an object , in which dark pixels are pixels with an intensity within a threshold intensity, e.g., below an upper threshold \u03c4.","As stated above, not all objects are meniscus-like objects. A meniscus-like object is an object that satisfies geometrical constraints for meniscus, such as falling within a particular size range or shape range or both. In various other embodiments other geometrical constraints are included, such as depth, as determined by a number of adjacent slices in which the object appears.","In step , objects that fall within a meniscus-like size range are determined. Any method may be used to determine a meniscus-like size range. In an illustrated embodiment, a meniscus-like size range is an area between about 5 mm(about 50 pixels) and about 80 mm(about 800 pixels) on one sagittal slice. Objects with smaller areas are considered noise and objects with larger areas are considered to be non-meniscus structures. The values of the size range are received by the process, e.g., during step  while receiving historical information, using any method known in the art. It is assumed for purposes of illustration that object  falls within the meniscus-like size range.","In step , objects that fall within a meniscus-like shape range are determined. Any method may be used to determine a meniscus-like shape range. In an illustrated embodiment, a meniscus-like size range is a range of aspect ratios, where an aspect ratio is a ratio of a major axis length divided by a minor axis length. The major axis is the longest dimension of the object, and the minor axis is the longest dimension perpendicular to the major axis. In some embodiments, the aspect ratio is approximated by the ratio of the major axis and minor axis of a bounding box. The bounding box is the rectangle in row\/column space that extends from the smallest to largest row number and smallest to largest column number of scan elements in the object. When the object's major axis is aligned with a row or column, the aspect ratio of the bounding box is the same as the aspect ratio of object. When not, the bounding box aspect ratio is more compact (closer to one).  shows an object bounding box  for object , and a box major axis  and minor axis . Since object  has a major axis that is about parallel to the image rows, the aspect ratio of the bounding box  is about the same as the aspect ratio of the object .","In some embodiments, the major and minor axis length determinations are made simpler by first forming a convex mask for the object. In such embodiments, method  includes step  to form a convex mask from each remaining object that satisfies meniscus-like size and shape constraints. A convex mask is a minimum convex shape that encompasses all pixels in the object. A convex mask is one in which every line segment connecting points in the mask is entirely within the mask.  depicts a convex mask  for object . Any method known in the art may be used to form a convex mask of the object.  also depicts a major axis  and minor axis  of the convex mask. These axis lengths are substantively equal to the major and minor axes of the original object .","It is noted here that in a later step, cartilage tissue is to be distinguished from meniscus. This is easily done with a cartilage lower threshold, e.g., 0.8*\u03bc. The convex mask may include pixels that represent cartilage tissue, but such pixels can be removed using the cartilage threshold.  depicts a revised mask  with cartilage removed by removing pixels  with intensity above 0.8*\u03bc.

From historical data, the inventors determined that most tears occur in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus, followed in frequency by tears in the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus. Tears in the anterior quadrants of both medial and lateral menisci are more rare. Using a training set of 10 historical cases, 5 positive (tears) and 5 negative (no tears), the different tear threshold scores of Table 1 were determined for four meniscus quadrants. Thus in step , a particular one of the anatomical quadrants of the meniscus is selected for scoring meniscal tear propensity. In some embodiments, the meniscus score is not divided in quadrants and step  is omitted or replaced with a different set of anatomical divisions of the meniscus (e.g., anterior and posterior only, or more than four divisions of the meniscus).","In step , a breakability measure is determined based on largest breaking fraction of multiple fractions of the meniscus threshold intensity \u03c4*.

The continuity of meniscal tears from one slice to the next is taken into account while calculating the average breakability and solidity scores for each slice. The inter-slice continuity of a positive decision (tear happens) is an important consideration in calling for a tear in the final decision. Tears that run through multiple slices have higher chances of being true tears than the tears seen only on a single slice.

Performance","The performance of the illustrated embodiment was determined in a study that was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant and approved by an Institutional Review Board. A pre-existing report and image repository in the inventors' institution was retrospectively searched for the keywords meniscal tear, horn, knee, and arthroscopy in individuals of all ages and both sexes who underwent MR imaging between October 2003 and July 2006. The resulting group of 910 cases was divided into those with positive and negative meniscal tear results based on MR findings. For those with positive tear findings in MR data, arthroscopic results were sought in the medical record to determine a false positive rate. All MR examinations were performed before scheduled surgery. Those with negative reports were reviewed by an experienced radiologist. Through this process, 17 cases of meniscal tears and 23 cases without meniscal tears were identified (19 males, ages 15-61 y; 21 females, ages 30-73 y). This set was used to evaluate the system . In addition, a group of 5 positive and 5 negative cases were identified from the 910 cases and used as training dataset in the CAD development phase to determine tear threshold scores in Table 2.","To evaluate the performance of the illustrated CAD system, 2 board-certified radiologists were asked to perform diagnosis by reading the image series for each of 40 subjects and to render diagnostic decisions on the presence or absence of tears in the 4 meniscus quadrants. Table 3 shows their detection results and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity scores. Sensitivity is true positive detections divided by a sum of true positives and false positives, as determined by a gold standard (e.g., surgical intervention). Specificity is true negative detections divided by a sum of true negatives and false positives, as determined by a gold standard.","The CAD system and the 2 radiologists were found to have the same sensitivity in detection of medial posterior tears, the most common meniscal injuries. The CAD system performed as well or slightly worse than radiologists in lateral posterior tear detection. The average sensitivities (weighted by the number of samples) of the CAD system and radiologist 1 and 2 were 83.87%, 74.19%, and 80.65%, respectively. This shows good sensitivity of the CAD system.","A significant number of negative samples were seen for each region. The average specificities (weighted by the number of samples) of the CAD system, radiologist 1, and 2 are 75.78%, 78.91%, and 85.16%. This shows good specificity of the CAD system The specificity value of CAD is within expectations because most CAD applications are designed and trained to put more cost (penalty) on missing the abnormality, a false negative, than issuing false positives.","The unsupervised meniscus extraction and tear detection demonstrated in the CAD system implements a series of custom-designed extraction and threshold techniques that are shown in a small-sample study to be closely correlated with radiologists' identification of meniscus objects and associated tears. By incorporating anatomical knowledge into the basic design of image processing techniques in this CAD system, resulting overall performance in sensitivity was close to that of radiologists. Improvements in specificity are anticipated. The development of this CAD approach shows promise for increasing radiologist productivity and confidence, improving patient outcomes, and applying more sophisticated CAD algorithms to orthopedic imaging tasks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0144"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"287pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Results of CAD system and radiologist findings for each of meniscal section"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"No. of",{},{},"No. of",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"detections","No. of",{},"rejections","No. w\/o"]},{"entry":["Section","Detector","(TP)","tears","Sensitivity %","(TN)","tears","Specificity %"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Medial","CAD","2","3","67","31","37","84"]},{"entry":["Anterior","Rad1","2",{},"67","33",{},"89"]},{"entry":[{},"Rad2","1",{},"33","34",{},"92"]},{"entry":["Medial","CAD","15","16","94","17","24","71"]},{"entry":["Posterior","Rad1","15",{},"94","15",{},"63"]},{"entry":[{},"Rad2","15",{},"94","20",{},"83"]},{"entry":["Lateral","CAD","3","4","75","25","36","70"]},{"entry":["Anterior","Rad1","1",{},"25","29",{},"81"]},{"entry":[{},"Rad2","2",{},"50","29",{},"81"]},{"entry":["Lateral","CAD","6","8","75","24","32","75"]},{"entry":["Posterior","Rad1","5",{},"63","24",{},"75"]},{"entry":[{},"Rad2","7",{},"88","26",{},"81"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0142","num":"0145"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1300","1300","1310","1300","1310","1310","1302","1310","1302","1310","1310","1302"]},"Computer system  also includes a memory  coupled to bus .

Signals include man-made variations in amplitude, frequency, phase, polarization or other physical properties of carrier waves. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data.","The term computer-readable medium is used herein to refer to any medium that participates in providing information to processor , including instructions for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media include, for example, dynamic memory . Transmission media include, for example, coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic cables, and waves that travel through space without wires or cables, such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves, including radio, optical and infrared waves.","Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, a magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a compact disk ROM (CD-ROM), a digital video disk (DVD) or any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, or any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), a FLASH-EPROM, or any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Network link  typically provides information communication through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer  or to equipment  operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP equipment  in turn provides data communication services through the public, world-wide packet-switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet . A computer called a server  connected to the Internet provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example, server  provides information representing video data for presentation at display .","The invention is related to the use of computer system  for implementing the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in memory . Such instructions, also called software and program code, may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory  causes processor  to perform the method steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hardware, such as application specific integrated circuit , may be used in place of or in combination with software to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software.","The signals transmitted over network link  and other networks through communications interface , carry information to and from computer system . Computer system  can send and receive information, including program code, through the networks ,  among others, through network link  and communications interface . In an example using the Internet , a server  transmits program code for a particular application, requested by a message sent from computer , through Internet , ISP equipment , local network  and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, or may be stored in storage device  or other non-volatile storage for later execution, or both. In this manner, computer system  may obtain application program code in the form of a signal on a carrier wave.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor  for execution. For example, instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra-red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra-red a carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface  receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus  carries the information to memory  from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory  may optionally be stored on storage device , either before or after execution by the processor .","8.
