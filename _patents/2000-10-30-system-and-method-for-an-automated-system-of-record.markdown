title: System and method for an automated system of record
abstract: An automated system of record creates and administers a sponsored community for participants. Participants use an automated negotiations engine for iterative, multivariate negotiations that stores each set of terms at each iteration to form a system of record. The automated negotiations engine can also be used to propose and negotiate specifications, prototypes and implementations of other systems. An active contract feature informs the results of such negotiations, by incorporating predefined templates to track activity related to the concluded negotiation. The system implements a higher level of security by validating activities against the originally negotiated terms. A contract authority assigns a unique identifier to each transaction to track activities against the transaction for analysis and reporting. A multiple repository enables users to maintain the non-repudiation data for transactions in which they participate at user designated locations. Participants can also use process mining to measure the effectiveness of processes.

Technical Field","This invention relates generally to systems for storing and manipulating data regarding important information and more particularly for creating an automated system of record.","2. Background","Business entities have tried for years to adapt computers and networks for use in sophisticated intercompany negotiations for commercial purchase and sales transactions, but with results that usually fall far short of expectations. Early mainframe computer attempts, for example, usually involved one corporation's allowing its existing suppliers and quantity buyers to connect to its internal private, proprietary network, using specially written locally developed application programs and private, proprietary network connections. These private systems were usually extremely costly to develop and maintain (often costing in the multi-millions of dollars) and very often did not meet all the needs and changing requirements of the participating businesses. Since many corporations had different internal networks and computer systems, considerable effort went into working around incompatibilities. Additionally, these systems had to be based on already existing, close relationships between buyers and sellers and usually were also based on previously negotiated agreements. Thus, the systems did not help in searching for information about new buyers and sellers, nor with the evaluation or negotiation processes, nor with the documenting of those processes from the beginning. They were not interactive, but typically batch processing systems, and usually accepted alphanumeric text only, not the inclusion of graphics or sound files. They usually addressed ongoing relationships previously worked out manually, for which extremely expensive custom systems were developed at buyers' or vendors sites.","Most business (and many other) negotiation processes are usually multivariate. That is, a business negotiation deals with many variable items, such as price, quantity, quality, shippers, insurance, warranty, schedules, returns and so on. The above solutions typically did not automate multivariate negotiations in any way, since they had to be built on agreements whose terms had all been previously negotiated.","With the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web (Web), the exchange of information amongst companies was greatly enhanced, with the use of Web technologies. However, even with chat rooms, bulletin boards, and forum websites most of this data and information exchange is simply that\u2014not a multivariate negotiations process nor an online, electronic commerce process.","While some of the Web devices, such as chat rooms and bulletin boards are interactive, each essentially allows two or more people to have conversations over the Internet, in the same way they might speak over the telephone or several might speak over an old-fashioned party line telephone. While the chat room or bulletin board may store these conversations, no other action takes place as a result of the process. Consequently, privacy and security questions aside, these are not effective devices to use to negotiate a number of variable terms, reach agreement on each and document the results. Just as telephone conversations about negotiations can be recorded on tape, but do not produce a contract document on paper, online chat or bulletin board discussions about negotiations cannot easily be used to make a contract on the network, even if they are archived.","Extranet Web technology has been developed to enable a corporation to \u201ctalk to\u201d (but not negotiate multiple variables in iterative bargaining with) its suppliers and buyers over the Internet as though the other companies were part of the corporation's internal \u201cintranet.\u201d This information exchange is done by using client\/server technology, Web browsers, and hypertext technology used in the Internet, on an internal basis, as the first step towards creating intranets and then, through them, extranets.","In typical intranet client\/server technology, one computer acts as a Web server computer to perform complex tasks, while other, smaller computers or terminals are \u201cclients\u201d that communicate with the Web server. In typical client\/server intranets the client requests data and performance of tasks from the Web server computer. A Web server program runs on the Web server computer to provide Web server functions. The communications between these intranet clients and Web servers is in Hypertext, or HyperText Markup Language (HTML)\u2014the \u201clanguage\u201d of the Internet's World Wide Web.","Usually, for intranets, at the Web server site, one or more people would create documents in hypertext format and make them available at the Web server. In many companies, employees have personal computers or terminals at their desks connected to the internal network. In an \u201cintranet\u201d these employees would use a Web browser on their terminals to see what hypertext documents are available at the internal corporate Web server site.","While this has been an advance for internal communications over a private network, it does not usually provide any interactive, iterative, multivariate negotiations capabilities and it requires personnel familiar with HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to create hypertext links in documents to create and maintain the \u201cinternal\u201d Web pages. If a more interactive approach is desired, an Information Technology (IT) specialist in some form of scripting, such as CGI, or PERL is needed who can create forms documents and procedures to allow users to ask for information from the Web server. Again, this is custom programming at the user's site, and still does not provide multivariate negotiations or commerce capabilities.","Corporations that share information internally can also use workgroup software such as IBM's LOTUS NOTES\u2122 software on the internal network. However, this, too, requires special programming and scripting for the unique needs of the organization, and normally does not address multivariate negotiations, even on an internal basis.","Since extranets simply extend a company's intranet to include selected other companies, the extranet concept usually does not provide any negotiations capabilities, either, much less electronic commerce capabilities.","To date, most attempts at adapting Internet technology to negotiations and commerce, even in small measure, have been focused on solving the problem from inside a corporation's systems going out and with the emphasis on the seller, not the buyer. Consequently, Intranet\/Extranet options usually do not provide electronic commerce, only more sophisticated information distribution and sharing.","For corporations that sell at retail, one technique for selling goods over the Internet  is shown in (Prior Art). This scheme uses the concept of a hosting \u201cmall\u201d  Website that enables buyers to browse through stores  (individual participating selling corporate Websites or aggregated catalog systems) and use a \u201cshopping cart\u201d  feature for selecting items to purchase. Participating sellers in a mall  create their own Websites which list items for sale and prices. The mall usually provides the shopping cart technique for the buyer to use to select items to buy. Such Internet  sales techniques also use security systems for transmitting payments by credit card and or CYBERCASH\u2122 payment methods (not shown). Most of these mall Website are significantly limited in the interaction, if any, they allow between buyers and sellers. A few allow limited price negotiations between buyers and sellers, but none allow iterative, multivariate negotiation and bargaining for both price and terms, such as availability, shipping, carrier, payment methods, risk of loss, etc.","Similarly, for non-retail business buyers and sellers, the mall concept above has limited value, since it usually does not connote much about the integrity or capability of the participating businesses, nor provide all of the various payment options a business might want to use. Most of the present Internet and World Wide Web systems for commerce are directed to consumer purchases of retail items in small quantities, not to business to business transactions or consumer transactions negotiating for goods and services in large quantities on national or international terms.","The companies that do provide more of a business to business focus over the Internet usually do so by offering special enterprise application server software , as shown in (Prior Art) for installation inside an enterprise's private corporate network. These programs fit into a category of software called front-office applications or application servers\u2014so called because they sit close to the user end inside an enterprise and are customized to interface with the back-office applications  inside the enterprise, which include commercial products from software suppliers as well as custom developed applications that handle internal business functions such as inventory tracking, financials, human resources and supplies, and similar Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.","As seen in (Prior Art), three separate corporations , and are shown using the services of an enterprise commerce site provider . Each corporate site  has a firewall , , and . Firewalls are a combination of hardware and software designed to prevent unwanted intrusion into a private corporate network by unauthorized personnel. A firewall usually puts a specially programmed computer system between its internal network and the Internet. It also prevents the company's internal computer users from gaining direct access to the Internet, since the access to the Internet provided by the firewall computer is usually indirect and performed by software programs known as proxy servers.","Note that, as shown in (Prior Art), in a typical implementation of an enterprise commerce site provider , the enterprise commerce site provider  breaks through the firewalls -of each of its customers. Normally this is done in such a way as to provide secure access. Occasionally, if the commerce site provider  allows its customers to be linked for certain transactions over the Internet , over a common external link  to the Internet, internal security may be comprised, if the customer's firewall is configured incorrectly and the Internet transmission results in a breach.","Still in (Prior Art), note that the typical enterprise commerce site provider  must have each customer  install the provider's application server software , on an application server computer inside the corporation's private network . Thus, in order to have access to the commerce site, corporation would have an individual working at a desktop computer , for example, connect to the corporation's internal Web server computer(s) over internal private network . The corporate employee thus accesses the enterprise commerce site provider  through his or her corporation's Web server computer , running the enterprise commerce site provider 's application server software . From the Web server , application server software , possibly running on its own application server computer communicates through the firewall with enterprise commerce site provider , and ultimately, through that site to other corporate subscribers to the enterprise commerce site provider,  usually over a private leased network . The corporation's internal network  links the desktop computers  with not only the internal application server , but also to the internal corporate back-office internal computers .","Many, if not most, of the implementations of the enterprise commerce systems shown in FIG. B(Prior Art) may also require the corporation to install a special database application server , to run special database application software along with the application server software . Thus, if the corporation already has a Web server computer , and the corresponding software , it still has to purchase at least the application server software , possibly an additional computer to act as the application server computer , and possibly yet another combination of database server computer and database server software , in order to use the enterprise commerce provider 's system.","Because application server products and , and possibly additional database server hardware and software as seen in (Prior Art), have to be installed inside each participating corporation, customized to that corporation's internal back office systems , and backed by appropriate internal training support, it can cost in the several hundred thousands or millions of US dollars to purchase and install the systems and train internal people on their use. While a few of these applications connect buyers and sellers over the Internet, usually both the sellers and the buyers must also install and customize the application server software inside their internal networks  another reason why these systems are so expensive, difficult to implement and costly to maintain. The traditional approach has been to design systems that will interface with the corporation's own internal computers and systems. Since these vary from one company to another, this is another reason why the application server software can be costly, as extensive modifications to it may be necessary to interface with each customer corporation's own systems.","Payment options in an enterprise application server approach may be a little broader than those in a mall, in that they include not only credit cards (for those following the US banking systems) or CYBERCASH\u2122 payments, but also procurement cards or specially agreed upon and custom programmed electronic authorization methods that allow a buyer to order items from a seller. However, for both enterprise application server and the mall Website approaches, payment processing, especially by credit card, is complicated.","In order to process a credit card transaction, a number of communications need to occur between selling Website and the bank\/credit card processor. If the bank\/credit card processor accepts \u201cinternational\u201d payments, any currency translations are done in separate steps, not online or in real time. That is, they are usually done on a special processing basis, rather than part of an online transaction, if they can be done at all in some countries. A general overview of the steps required for credit card handling is shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Enterprise server\/mall Website","Bank\/credit card processor"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1. transport the credit card","2. verify the card is legitimate and the"]},{"entry":["information securely to","amount exists; send authorization to"]},{"entry":["processor or bank over a","online merchant over the private"]},{"entry":["private network;","network;"]},{"entry":["3. post the item details back","4. transport item details to card issuer"]},{"entry":["to the bank\/credit card","for debit to the holder's account over"]},{"entry":["processor over the","private network"]},{"entry":["private network;","5. make necessary currency translation"]},{"entry":[{},"(usually offline)"]},{"entry":[{},"6. credit the merchant account"]},{"entry":[{},"7. deduct significant fees, usually a"]},{"entry":[{},"percentage or more per transaction from"]},{"entry":[{},"the merchant account;"]},{"entry":[{},"8. archive details."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Credit cards are issued to buyers relatively easily, but merchant identifiers (merchant ID's), which allow the merchant to accept and process the cards are not as easy to obtain, especially for online transactions, and online merchants are usually charged premium processing fees to authorize online processing and the handling of international transactions.","Procurement cards or other custom programmed electronic authorization methods that allow a buyer to order items from a seller are usually more expensive in that they usually require special negotiations and some custom programming. Any time custom programming is required, along with local installation and training at the corporation's site, costs go up significantly.","Because of this expense, enterprise application server systems, such as those provided by CONNECTINC.COM and TRADE'EX.COM are designed to work with existing relationships between buyers and sellers, in which the detailed terms have already been negotiated for ongoing purchases and to prevent \u201cwild card purchasing\u201d inside the organization. These are usually referred to as maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or administrative purchasing. Generally, administrative purchasing only represents about 20% of a company's purchasing efforts. Within this administrative level of purchasing, procurement cards and specially constructed payment methods are used more for the low value transactions. More important MRO transactions are usually paid for by company checks or wire transfers. Most of a corporation's purchasing efforts, nearly 80% in many cases, are directed to production purchasing, which is usually not addressed by the above types of enterprise systems.","In marketing literature, for example, TRADE'EX states that its TRADE'EX procurement system is specifically designed to be an MRO system which \u201cfrees buyers to concentrate on more important tasks such as vendor selection and contract negotiation.\u201d That is, it does not handle production purchasing and negotiations.","Production purchasing is normally defined as the purchasing of components, subassemblies or parts that a company assembles and repackages into its own products. If a company manufactures automobiles, for example, production purchasing for it includes the purchasing done for all the components of its automobiles\u2014tires, batteries, electrical systems, seats, engine parts, raw materials for frames, etc. For an auto manufacturer, MRO or administrative purchasing would handle such lower priority items as office supplies, office furniture, etc., or established longstanding items such as stock tires for automobiles for which all the terms had previously been negotiated without the benefit of automation.","Production purchasing includes the selection of new vendors, the evaluation of them and their products, conducting contract negotiations and so on. It is also of strategic importance to a business because it has a very direct impact on manufacturing and product costs, and sales prices. Thus, while the enterprise application server products do tend to reduce the internal transaction costs and time associated with MRO or administrative purchasing, they are usually affecting the smallest part of the purchasing effort, leaving the bulk of the endeavor, and often the most strategically important part to existing manual methods.","Credit cards are essentially ways to pay cash in advance for goods and services, and thus, would not be suitable for production purchasing either, where delivery, payment, and inspection schedules are usually negotiated to occur over time. Thus, in a production purchasing agreement, a buyer may only to agree to pay the seller in installments, after the seller has shipped a monthly quantity and the buyer has had a chance to inspect and accept them. Once the buyer has accepted a shipment, the seller would usually like the fastest payment possible. Even if credit card payments could be made after the fact, they are usually not handled online for international transactions.","In addition, obtaining real time card authorization for international transactions online is a major undertaking, because online card processing and bank to bank connectivity does not exist on the Internet in many countries. Also, transactions denominated in most non-G7 currencies are not likely to be processed in real time online because the international banking system is not capable of doing real time, online, Internet currency transactions. Consumers who travel and use credit cards to make payments in other countries, and other currencies, may think these transactions are being handled online, but they are not. Most of the currency exchange processing is done by the connecting banks offline, and most of it that is done electronically is done on private bank and interbank networks.","Many of the major credit card issuers also do not allow a merchant to use its merchant identifier (ID) to process transactions on behalf of related entities. This is a significant problem for mall operators, in particular. To add a new store to the mall, the mall Website operator must ask the store to get its own merchant ID, offline. It can take weeks to get a merchant ID, but without one, the seller in the mall cannot accept any online transactions at all.","For international processing there are other payment methods available, but these are usually done manually or offline. For example, wire transfers allow bank-to-bank payments for international transactions in any tradable currency. However, these are done over private bank networks and usually between companies which have already established a purchasing relationship\u2014i.e. for MRO or administrative purchasing. Wire transfers are used more often in international trade than company checks, because the processing time for a wire transfer is faster than check processing and the fees charged by the banks are often lower. The participating banks usually handle the currency conversion as part of the process. Again, however, this usually requires some fairly sophisticated interbanking networks in the applicable countries.","Letters of credit (L\/C) are another payment vehicle used for international transactions, once they have been negotiated. It usually takes 6 weeks or longer to negotiate one. Negotiations take so long because the issuing bank (the buyer's bank) assumes the total credit risk by agreeing absolutely to pay the seller so long as the transaction documents match the terms of the letter of credit itself. Most disputes about the payment of letters of credit have to do with discrepancies in the L\/C terms, including such simple things as typographical errors. As seen in (Prior Art) heretofore, letters of credit were negotiated primarily by telephone calls and facsimile exchanges between a buyer P and a bank P which can easily result in both substantive and typographical errors. Banks which process the letters of credit, often use a private network known as the SWIFT system, which provides 128 bit encryption for data sent between points on the SWIFT network. The United States Department of Commerce continues to regulate encryption controls required by US laws, and limits this full level of encryption to US and Canadian banks. Other systems are allowed to use 56 bit encryption outside the US and Canada.","Another form of payment often used by business for production purchasing is known as documentary collection. It is midway between a letter of credit and a wire transfer. With this method, the issuing bank does not assume the absolute credit risk and obligation to pay. It only agrees to assist the transaction as a sort of \u201chonest broker.\u201d Consequently, the bank fees are lower. However, this method is normally used between parties that have already established a course of dealing, but want a structured payment vehicle processed through their respective banks.","Still another payment method often used in business transactions is the purchase order (PO) issued against a previously agreed upon master purchase agreement. Some of the MRO or administrative systems which go beyond credit card payments, enable a buyer and seller to use the terms of a previously negotiated master purchase agreement as a governing document for each purchase order issued. In this approach, a purchase order represents a buyer company's obligation to pay according to the master agreement, and the seller has to accept the risk that the buyer will actually pay the purchase order per the originally negotiated payment terms. As with letters of credit, this form of payment usually involves the transmission of facsimiles and telephone calls between the businesses\u2014an error\u2014prone process.","For purchase orders, as with letters of credit, and similar techniques, one of the difficulties for businesses is known as the \u201cbattle of the forms.\u201d If a buyer issues a purchase order, or ships goods against a letter of credit with different or additional terms stated or implied, in many jurisdictions it is not clear which contract terms will govern the transaction. Frequently forms get lost, or the exact order and dates of transmission and receipt are not known, or the contents are rendered unreadable by carbon copies or facsimile machines. There is usually no simple, reliable way to track all the steps involved in the transaction. Thus, transactions may be repudiated by buyers or sellers because the paperwork is incomplete or erroneous.","While some attempts have been made to address repudiation arising from terms sent fraudulently by other than the authorized buyer or seller, these attempts typically focus on obtaining some form of electronic signature or certificate of authenticity to avoid some of the difficulties. However these do not clear up unreadable terms or track down all the terms negotiation steps.","As mentioned above, some existing MRO systems provide MRO application server software at both the seller's and buyer's sites, which is installed and customized at those sites, to the internal systems used by each\u2014the cost of such installation and customization is usually high.","In addition to the cost of the internal software installation and customization, enterprise MRO electronic commerce products usually do little or nothing to help a seller find new buyers (or the buyer find better, more cost efficient suppliers) or simplify the initial purchase and multivariate contract negotiation process. Most buyers want to be able to evaluate new suppliers readily. The negotiation of a major purchasing agreement with a new vendor for a new product may take anywhere from 6-12 months or more, if done manually. Since the existing enterprise application server products tend to focus on integrating with existing internal administrative\/MRO corporate systems, very little, if anything is done by them to simplify the launching or negotiation of new buyer\/seller relationships.","In many corporations, the selection of a new supplier for production purchases usually involves the creation of a team from purchasing, engineering, and manufacturing to evaluate all potential sellers. The team usually flies to potential vendor sites to evaluate capabilities and production facilities, obtain samples, and then return home to evaluate the samples.","For new product developments, the ability to evaluate actual samples as part of the buyer's new product may be critical to the buyer corporation's overall development strategy and product timetable, and thus, the bottom line. A mass storage device manufacturer that is developing a faster, cheaper, higher capacity disk drive, may need to find high capability read\/write heads. Read\/write heads with the characteristics needed by the mass storage device manufacturer may not be available from anyone on the market yet. However, the manufacturer probably knows several firms that make high quality read\/write heads for existing devices. If these firms have new heads under development, they would usually be willing to provide evaluation samples to such a manufacturer. The manufacturer needs the samples to verify that the new disks it is building will work reliably and at full speed with the heads being developed by the other firm. If these tests can be performed and the results are good, the manufacturer knows it is likely to be able to meet a new product shipment date of x, with a price of y. If samples cannot be obtained and evaluated, the manufacturer's product development cycle may slip by months or years, thus costing potential millions in lost revenues and market shares.","Once a short list of vendors with acceptable samples has been qualified, the team would be represented by the purchasing buyer who negotiates with the different representatives from the vendor short list. When the buyer has selected a seller to buy from, it may still take 6 to 12 months or more to negotiate prices, sales terms, quantities, inspection and replacement terms, availability dates, shipping costs, carrier, risk of loss and insurance, payment options, etc. Most of these terms are critical for production purchasing. The cost of reaching agreement on all terms can come to thousands or tens of thousands of dollars worth of labor, travel, and other expenses normally associated with the typical production purchase negotiation, in addition to the delays caused to the buyer's development and production cycles.","As another example, if an automobile manufacturer plans to build x thousand new cars and trucks each month on its production line, it needs to be sure that the firm(s) from which it purchases the new types of batteries needed for new models can deliver the required quantity each month, on time, with excellent quality and reasonable prices. The auto maker could lose millions in sales if its assembly line is stopped because of part shortages. Thus, while price is important in production purchase negotiations, it is only one small part of an overall set of purchase term variables that are strategically important to the auto maker and its cost of goods sold. If the seller uses unreliable shippers and carriers or does not know how to import or export its goods to the manufacturer's assembly plants, the best price on the market will be worth very little to a manufacturer which has to halt production because of missed schedules, shipments, or quantities.","Obtaining samples from vendors known to the production buyer is significant in itself, as seen above. However, in today's international trade, the overwhelming majority of potential buyers and sellers are not aware of each other's existence. Yet international trade is increasing by double digit numbers each year, so an obvious need exists for more capability. Many countries are taking advantage of the \u201cleapfrog\u201d effect by using the Internet and the latest in information technology (IT) to build instant infrastructures for competing in international commerce. Some countries and trade regions have set up inspection services for potential outside buyers, so that a buyer can obtain an independent assessment of a particular vendor's production facilities from such services. This saves some time and travel expense. However, it still does not provide a buying team with samples for evaluation. With current Internet commerce systems there is no effective way to order such samples. By the time terms and conditions for a sample order have been negotiated manually at such distances, the samples are not likely to be relevant any longer to the buyer company's development goals.","At the same time, most sellers of such products may need time to ramp up their production (especially for new or improved products) in order to meet quantity terms and dates, and they may need to incur additional costs if they have to change shippers to meet the buyer's needs. A seller does not want to have its goods rejected arbitrarily as defective or damaged if this is not the case. So inspection, return and refund policies need to be negotiated. All of these terms are usually variable and may frequently interrelate. If a seller's shipping costs go up\u2014so might its prices. If a buyer is unable to meet its quantity goals because too many of the seller's goods are defective, the buyer's internal costs go up, and the buyer may have to buy from another source.","Production purchasing negotiations such as these are usually done by telephone, on-site visits, faxes and other non-automated means of conducting a negotiation today. This work is labor intensive, and if travel is involved, expenses climb. If the transaction is an international one between two countries with different currencies, customs, and trade practices, it can take even longer and cost more to conduct the negotiations.","In today's global markets, while international sourcing is becoming more and more important, it is expensive for a buyer team to travel to sites in another country to evaluate them, buy samples for engineering evaluation at home, and to conduct the negotiation through occasional visits between buyer and seller. While most use facsimile machines or computer fax modems to submit drafts of agreements back and forth, face to face negotiations may be needed more frequently for international negotiations, because business practices in the two countries may differ significantly and errors or misreadings caused by poor fax reproductions may further complicate the process.","In other words, application server approaches do not offer any real solutions to the production purchasing, non-retail, problems.","Returning now for a moment to (Prior Art), as mentioned above, Websites such as retail malls  or standalone Websites are used by some corporations which sell at retail. While many tools exist to allow companies to design Websites, there are not as many that allow a company to design one for automatic integration into a Website in a mall or with online catalogs. Since most companies want to maintain control over the appearance of their corporate and brand names, those mall or catalog sites that do provide Web tools for their business subscribers, usually do not provide complete common interfaces or templates for the companies to use, nor do they integrate the sites with multiple features and services. Instead, they usually only provide access to a shopping cart  feature and a secure credit card  payment feature with a catalog product and price list that is searchable. Some may also provide manual help to the seller in listing its Website in relevant search engines used on the Internet. Normally, however, it is the seller's responsibility to do so. In either case, the registration with search engines is usually done manually. Some may also require the seller to arrange for payment processing separately, offline. As mentioned before, obtaining a merchant ID can take weeks, thus limiting what the seller can do online until then.","Presently, on the Internet, search engines such as Compaq Corporation's ALTAVISTA\u2122, Yahoo corporation's YAHOO\u2122 and so on, have different schedules for accepting and adding new sites to their search lists. It can take anywhere from 4-8 weeks or more for a site to be registered with each search engine. Many Internet search engines also add entries to their lists by \u201cspidering\u201d around the Internet to gather all Website addresses. Depending on the search engine, spidering may take much longer or not be as complete as a user requested registration. For example, ALTAVISTA's Website states:\n\n","As can be seen, the costs to a seller to establish a Website can be significant both in time and money. IDC Corporation reported in 1997 that the average cost of creating a fully enabled domestic US business to business electronic commerce standalone, single, retail Website for a large Fortune 1000 business was approximately $600,000.00 (Six Hundred Thousand USD.)","BUSINESS MARKETING MAGAZINE\u2122, published by ADVERTISING AGE\u2122, reported in 1998 that median prices for creating a single Website averaged as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Company\/Website Size","Average Cost"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Small","$44,500"]},{"entry":[{},"Medium","$99,750"]},{"entry":[{},"Large","$302,975"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":" To add electronic commerce to the site,"},{"entry":"costs averaged as follows:"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Small","$25,000 (online ordering by fax but"]},{"entry":[{},{},"no transaction or payment processing)"]},{"entry":[{},"Medium","$33,000 (online ordering with credit"]},{"entry":[{},{},"card processing)"]},{"entry":[{},"Large","$78,000 (database searches, online"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ordering, credit card processing)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Creating a single Website can take anywhere from 1-8 weeks to 6-8 months or more. Creating one that is able to handle simple electronic commerce transactions may take even longer as merchant accounts for credit cards need to be obtained, integrating CYBERCASH\u2122 or similar realtime payment methods must be provided for, search engine registrations need to be requested and so on.","As noted above, generally accepted electronic methodologies for handling international commerce online other than on a simple credit card or CYBERCASH\u2122 payment basis for retail sales do not exist. Many countries do not have bank procedures in place to accept international credit card transactions in real time. In such countries, trying to adjust the current banking systems may well be impossible and completely new systems would be needed.","Thus, most existing electronic commerce sites are designed to work with existing proprietary banking networks such as the United States VISA\u2122 and MC MASTERCARD\u2122 real-time card authorization and processing interbanking systems. As noted above, these are known as SWIFT-compatible private networks which use 128 key encryption for security. This often limits a buyer or seller's market potential unnecessarily. Since many countries do not have banking systems comparable to the SWIFT interbanking system, payments in such countries may only be made by manually negotiated letters of credit and so on. It can take from 4-6 weeks simply to negotiate the terms of a letter of credit, when using the same manual techniques of phone calls and fax machines. In a global economy, when manufacturers in one country may want to source parts and components from the Pacific rim, sell them in the United States, Europe or South America, or Pacific Rim, a system that does not address the complexities of international purchasing is very limiting.","Similarly, the companies that provide Web hosting for a mall  on the Internet as shown in (Prior Art) usually address only retail sales of consumer articles, with little or no control over the individual businesses that subscribe as sellers or the consumers who browse as buyers. In many business transactions, buyers want to know that the sellers meet some minimum standards and requirements and sellers want to know that fraudulent or inappropriate requests will not be tolerated.","Most World Wide Web mall or commerce sites do not offer this kind of site integrity for their business transactions, since most of them are directed primarily to retail sales in which a consumer can usually rely on consumer protection laws and some credit card \u201cinsurance\u201d practices, for protection from the unscrupulous.","The few enterprise electronic commerce providers that go beyond the mall concept do so with the addition of a governor or administrator feature which coordinates with the enterprise application servers. The governor sets up and administers the rules for the site and can act as a broker. This usually entails a customized, specially programmed matching of participating companies' computer systems to coordinate authorization and payment approval so orders flow between firms. However, this technology can cost millions and it can take as much as two years to program the computers and set up the necessary processes and equipment at all the participating company sites. Most of the components for doing this are sold by major computer hardware and software vendors who also sell application server software, hardware, and consulting services to install the \u201cfront-end\u201d application server at the participating business's site. Thus, while the Internet may be used to connect the companies participating, most of the work is done by the application server software installed on private, proprietary networks at the various company sites, and the Internet serves as a simple external telecommunications link.","Another complication of some of the seller-centric and enterprise application server products designed for commerce is that they may only work with certain forms of electronic data interchange (EDI) technology, which is 7 to 10 times more costly to use than other methods. Existing EDI technologies use private networks and charge per call and by the bit of information transmitted. Depending on the approach used attempting to change such systems to use other forms of data interchange can be very costly, because of the number of installed software application servers at the participating company sites which must be radically changed. Because of the expense associated with most EDI technologies, only about 2% of companies worldwide attempting to do business over a network use them.","Existing business to business enterprise application software servers tend to have more of a sellers' focus, and, as mentioned above, they tend not to focus on a buyer's need for finding and evaluating new sellers, nor for negotiating and bargaining with the new suppliers. Similarly, most of the mall Websites which focus on retail sales are seller-centric. That is, they focus on letting a seller list its wares and prices, and decide how much to disclose about itself and its products and only allow the buyer to select from listed items and prices. Little or no seller marketing, product, terms or service evaluation information is available to the buyer. As mentioned before, a buyer on a mall Website is usually not permitted to negotiate anything, simply to select from prices and payment options provided by the seller. Buyers using the enterprise application server software products cannot use them to negotiate new production purchases, but simply to process maintenance, repair or operation (MRO) orders against existing, already negotiated agreements.","Even with the seller-centric focus, most companies that provide a mall or enterprise application server business to business site offering, do not help with the marketing or promotion of the participating sellers' brands. Thus, the value of these services for the participants are often limited by the power of each company's individual brand. If the seller participants have products that are not well-recognized by brand name, an electronic commerce mall or business to business enterprise application server software service usually does not provide much added visibility or market reach. A few sites have attempted to address this by organizing along vertical market segments, such as malls devoted to the steel industry, but this alone does not provide that much additional visibility, primarily because it does not address some of the basic needs a buyer has for multivariate negotiations.","The production purchasing buyer needs to be able to collect information about sellers, and it would help to know that some entity has screened them and monitors them for adherence to some known set of standards and reputability. Additionally, production buyers today usually have to travel to a seller's physical location to get sample products. If the buyer is in the US and the seller is in Malaysia, this might costs thousands of dollars in airfares and travel expenses, just to get samples. Most existing products and services do not help with these tasks. As noted above, samples of newly engineered component parts may be critical for the buyer company's completion of its product. New systems being built by a computer maker may need power supplies or heat dissipation systems that are also new and unproven. The engineers developing the new computer systems need to be able to test their prototypes with sample, new component parts to know the whole system will work. None of the existing methods of buying over the Internet address this kind of need. Most systems are not designed from the buyer's viewpoint.","One system does attempt to address a few things from a buyer's viewpoint. This is the Priceline.com system which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,207 -, issued Aug. 11, 1998, to Walker et al., assigned to Walker Asset Management Limited. This is essentially an online bidding process in which a buyer specifies the price it desires to pay for an object, such as an airplane reservation or a car. The bid is submitted over the Internet to a central site which analyzes a database of sellers of that type of item to find one or more selling the object at close to the bid price. These matches or near-matches are presented to the buyer, who can then select from them and place a conditional purchase offer. If the seller accepts, the sale is made. A buyer can initiate another round of bidding if there is no good result from the initial one. While this system has benefits for certain types of purchases, usually of completed, commodity items, it does not address the needs of production buyers outlined above. It does not provide iterative bargaining between the buyer and seller on all aspects of a multivariate transaction; nor does it connote much, if anything about the participating sellers. It is similar to other auction sites on the World Wide Web which allow you to submit bids to a seller or auctioneer, but do not provide the opportunity to bargain interactively with the seller on all the terms. A bid submission process is quite different from a price and terms negotiation process. Bid submission systems are usually designed to assist a seller in disposing of excess inventory. Hence, some malls and enterprise server applications provide limited electronic commerce, but none provide true multivariate negotiation ability.","Finally, both the mall concept and the enterprise server concepts use databases for storing and indexing product and price lists and catalogs, along with final orders. However, since very little is offered in the way of iterative bargaining, other than a simple order\/confirmation process, little or nothing is known, and consequently stored about the negotiation process on a step by step basis. Again, any information that is collected is likely to be of interest primarily to the seller, not the buyer, since most of the systems in existence are focused on the seller.","Once a complex agreement has been negotiated, printed in hard copy, and signed, it usually goes into a file system and in frequent cases virtually disappears. Six months or a year after signing, the parties to the agreement may have re-organized their companies or promoted the people involved in the original negotiation, so that new people are assigned to administer the agreement and carry on the relationship. Often times, the new individuals do not follow the agreement completely and sometimes it even gets lost in the transitions that so many companies undergo today. Thus many of the benefits that were obtained through long and hard negotiations may be lost over time.","Similarly, relying primarily on a hard copy paper trail to manually validate orders placed against an agreement is error prone. If the agreement is lost or only infrequently referred to, validation begins to erode, and correspondingly, so does the likelihood that all the benefits will be obtained. For example, additional discounts for timely order placement may be lost if the successors are not aware of the discounts.","To attempt to maintain file copies of the agreement in several different departments within a company also leaves room for error with present techniques. While the legal department may have the official copies, marketing, purchasing, engineering and manufacturing may not be as rigorous at filing and may be working from copies of the next to the last draft, or may lose copies of formal amendments.","For many companies it is important that a major agreement be available and understood by several departments. Using the example of discounts for early order placement and lack of reorders and corrections, it may be important for engineering, purchasing and manufacturing to coordinate their efforts to take advantage of this. For the design of a new product, engineering is usually responsible for determining the exact kind of components to order, while marketing, purchasing and manufacturing may need to cooperate to plan a schedule for ordering in quantities over time. While there are some systems that allow an engineering design to be turned into a parts list, there are no systems that allow an agreement to be used to inform the whole process.","Similarly, a major agreement usually involves at least two entities. Short of costly, time consuming options such as litigation or mediation, there is little available today that such entities can use to manage the agreement and the ensuing relationship it creates between them. While there are some automated systems that allow one company to place orders against a manually negotiated agreement, these systems do nothing but that. Many companies do not want to extend such a system further into their internal networks for fear of disclosing sensitive material such as pricing information, customer lists, or new technical developments.","In many industries, developments in the legal system such as the Uniform Commercial Code and IncoTerms, coupled with experience in the industry, make it easier to develop model \u201cStandard Agreements\u201d that companies can use as a starting point for negotiation. For the most part, however, the only way these have been used is as the basis for word processing text.","The problems associated with complex commercial negotiations are similar to those found in complex design, development and production environments. In fact, many design, development and manufacturing processes require a significant amount of negotiation.","A customer, such as a computer manufacturer, may want to include a scanner product made by a scanner manufacturer as an integral part of its new computer system. After completing the scanner vendor selection and contract negotiations process, the customer typically still faces a number of iterative negotiations with the maker of the selected scanner subsystem\u2014however, these may have to do with the design, the development and even the manufacturing of the subsystem. For example, the computer manufacturer may want the scanner vendor to develop custom driver software for each of the three operating systems the computer manufacturer uses, and may want special features in each. The scanner vendor may be unexpectedly limited in resources and time, thus requiring that the computer maker make some selection and priority decisions. Each party may have to go back and forth numerous times with requirements documents, design documents and development timetables until a good result is achieved at each stage of the development process.","Presently, there are custom development tools developed for internal use by a supplier in specific industries, such as rapid prototyping systems for Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) integrated circuit chip makers, but no systems that address the ongoing negotiations between customers and suppliers that actually take place in complex design, development and production processes.","As companies and legal entities operate in the present economy, it becomes increasingly important for them to identify their respective core competencies and separate them from other processes that are done internally but may not be essential for the business. For example, a computer manufacturer may have hardware design and engineering as its core competency. Logistics management for shipping and receiving may not be a core competency, yet it may still be done internally. At present there are few analytical tools a company can use to examine its internal processes to see which are most effective and which need improvement or need to be subcontracted out. There are some consultants who will study such processes manually, and some decision support tools available, as well as the beginning of a concept called collaborative forecasting and replenishing which attempts to allow two companies to compare their respective processes. However, there is presently no automated infrastructure that can be used by consultants or systems to do this.","It is an object of this invention to provide a system for of record for iterative, multivariate negotiations.","These and other objects are achieved by an automated system of record which is established by a sponsor to create and administer a sponsored community for participants such as customers and suppliers. The invention allows participants to use an automated negotiations engine for iterative, multivariate negotiations which stores each set of terms proposed at each iteration to form the basis of the system of record. The present invention also allows the automated negotiations engine to be used to propose and negotiate specifications, prototypes and implementations of other systems. The active contract feature of the present invention informs the results of such negotiations, including doing so by incorporating predefined templates, so that activity related to the concluded negotiation can be tracked in other systems. This, in turn, enables the system to implement a higher level of security by validating activities against the originally negotiated terms. The contract authority of the invention assigns a unique identifier to each negotiated transaction and enables the participants to use that number to track all activities against the transaction for analysis and reporting purposes. A multiple repository feature enables users to maintain the non-repudiation data for transactions in which they participate at one or more locations they designate. With the automated system of record created by the invention, the participants can also use the process mining features of the invention to measure the effectiveness of internal and external processes.","In , a block diagram of the present invention shows a multivariate negotiations engine system  communicating over telecommunications link to the Internet . A community sponsor  is shown also communicating over a telecommunications link to the Internet . Participants  in this community are shown at -. For commercial implementations each participant is either a buyer or a seller (or in some cases, both) in the community. Participants  connect to community sponsor , through the Internet  and multivariate negotiations engine system . Multivariate negotiations engine system  contains all the software needed to create sponsored communities, communicate with sponsors, and with all participants and store the results. Each sponsor or participant only needs a standard Internet browser such as those commonly available from Netscape Corporation or Microsoft Corporation, among others, and a commonly available desktop computer or other terminal, workstation, or computer to activate the browser over any commonly available link to the Internet. Typically, these browsers are distributed free of charge by their suppliers.","Multivariate negotiations engine system  can be used for other types of sponsored communities where interactive, iterative negotiations of a number of interrelated, variable items amongst the participants over the Internet is desired.","For example, manufacturers in the computer industry might want to agree on a set of multi-part, multi-tiered industry standards for a new computer bus. A computer industry association or a standards association might be the community sponsor, and the computer and peripheral manufacturers might be the participants who need to iteratively negotiate with each other and\/or the standards body to agree upon the standards. The sponsoring standards body establishes the community, proposes initial standards, sets the rules for negotiations, encourages and monitors negotiations, and concludes with a finally agreed upon set of standards, with each step of each negotiation that occurred along the way archived. Since no additional hardware or software needs to be installed at the sponsor's site or at those of any of the participants, the present invention provides a much more economical and speedy way to negotiate complex, multivariate items such as complex standards specifications.","Additionally, while one form of sponsored community addresses corporate buyers and sellers engaged in production purchasing, other commerce communities could be implemented. For example, stock or commodity trading over the Internet might be conducted using the present invention. A sponsor, such as a traditional stock exchange or a newer type of securities body could establish the standards for accepting stockbrokers into the community. Such standards might include compliance with applicable securities regulations and so on. The sponsor can monitor and regulate actual iterative multivariate negotiations such as options, puts, calls, at the market or not at the market, etc., for buying and selling of commodities or securities electronically over the Internet. Or a trade show organizer might sponsor a community for allocating and iteratively negotiating accommodations, placement, footage, signage, facilities, etc., amongst vendors and suppliers at the show site.","Participants in a community can also ask the sponsor to appoint a moderator for their negotiations, if stumbling blocks arise. The moderator can monitor the negotiations and suggest next steps at any time in the process to one or several of the participants.","Many other types of communities can be created with the present invention. For example, governmental agencies might sponsor trade commerce communities for regional trade development efforts. International organizations might sponsor a community to assist countries in negotiating complex treaties.","Commonly available video conferencing and other multi-media techniques can be added to multivariate negotiations engine system . For these embodiments, it is possible that both sponsors and participants would have to add hardware or software for the multi-media features at their sites, if such features are not already present. illustrates the use of commonly available videoconferencing equipment such as a camera positioned at the top of a monitor connected to a simple desktop computer. With existing videoconferencing products, an image I of a participant at another site is displayed on the monitor at the same time the Web browser interface W to multivariate negotiations engine system  displays a list of the terms being negotiated. Those skilled in the art appreciate that most existing videoconferencing products also include voice communications as well. Thus, the negotiating participants can see and hear each other and the complex, multiple variables they are negotiating at the same time. Multivariate negotiations engine system  can archive the multimedia sessions as video and audio files to be stored with the text.","The present invention allows the creation of one or more sponsored communities of any number of types for conducting iterative negotiations over a network. As seen in , the network used is the present-day Internet with TCP-IP protocols and formats, but those skilled in the art will appreciate that it could also be implemented on any future open network(s) which might replace or supplement the Internet, or it could be implemented inside current, private networks within a corporation, if desired.","Turning now to , a logical diagram of several different sponsored communities is shown. Sponsored community CA might be a community of farm equipment buyers and sellers, while sponsored community CC might be a community of stockbrokers CCand traders CC. Sponsored community CB might include computer manufacturers CBand peripheral makers CBin a standards community CB. Existing enterprise electronic commerce systems would require each member of such a community to install special Webserver, application server and database server software at each sponsor site, and at all or some participant sites in a community such as sponsored community CC. The present invention, however only requires that each sponsor, and participant in a community have a standard Web browser (not shown here), and a connection to the Internet . All of the processing software and hardware needed to handle transactions for each community CA-CC shown here is provided at the multivariate negotiations engine system 's site.","The above aspect of the present invention is particularly important in business to business negotiations. Use of the Internet architecture helps both sponsors and participants keep their separate brand identifications through their individual URLs and Websites, and the use of http addressing and protocols enables near-instantaneous pulling of text and object files in response to any queries, whether in the same country or around the world.","Now in , in many cases, sponsor  database  will be perceived by the participants and any visitors to the site, as the general site database for the sponsored community. In this capacity, the present invention includes site services such as collecting data on the number of visitors to the site, their demographics, and maintaining similar server logs and analysis of the site traffic.","Now turning to , the present invention can be viewed as a series of interrelated processes as shown here. For a commercial community, there are seller processes, sponsor processes and buyer processes. Remote authoring , is a seller process which enables a registered seller in the community to create a seller Website within the community on which to include the seller's marketing and product information, along with pricing, terms, service offerings and so on. Information generated or created in this remote authoring process  is automatically integrated with the community databases and listings. Promotion and brand identifying actions (such as registering the Web page with search engines) are taken automatically on behalf of the seller as well.","Still in , a seller, once registered and having completed remote Web authoring, can immediately evaluate orders  and other inquiries and respond to them. The present invention alerts sellers (and buyers) that a pending offer or counteroffer has been submitted, so that they may return to the system to negotiate or resume negotiations. Finally, another seller process is order activity  which allows the seller to follow the activity by e-mail or browser or similar means, and request data downloads or activity reports on transaction data.","The sponsor processes of include maintaining databases, registering community and seller domain names, and submitting Web uniform resource locators (URLs) to multiple search engines so that both the community Website and each seller Website within it can be found by search engines such as Compaq's ALTAVISTA\u2122 among others. Sponsor  also monitors activity, collects fees, establishes standards or rules (or both) for the community, and promotes successes. Once a deal is concluded it is archived , by multivariate negotiations engine  on behalf of seller. The present invention also allows the collection and analysis of direct e-mail demographic information, such as company name, title and location. This data helps the present invention screen out frivolous or fraudulent inquirers. For example, a high school student attempting to propose an order might be intercepted when the present invention determines that no company name or title has been provided and no other authorization for such a request has been provided for.","Buyer processes shown in include search and evaluate processes , which enable a prospective buyer to find companies and their products in the community and investigate their prices, terms and service offerings. If a buyer is interested in opening negotiations with a particular seller, the propose orders processes can be based on catalog prices or desired price and other terms, special orders for samples or small quantities, proposed payment vehicles, and can include information about the buyer. A buyer in this community can use order activity processes  to determine an order's status in the system, etc. Note that access to relevant information by each type of community member (sponsor, buyer, seller) is protected by password security and access levels.","Turning now to participant functions  are outlined. In a commerce community, the participants might be grouped as sellers and buyers . Seller participant functions include automatically integrated remote Web authoring - and processing and administration -. In remote Web authoring -, the present invention allows a seller registering with the sponsored community, to automatically create a seller's Website within the community, on completion of registration. The seller selects from several Website format templates provided by the present invention and as the seller \u201cfills in the blanks\u201d in a selected template, the information is automatically integrated with the rest of the system, so that orders can be processed and accepted immediately and more efficient registration with search engines is automatically initiated. A seller's processing and administrative steps - includes such tasks as uploading product catalogs, customizing the Website from time to time, and similar processing.","Still in , participant functions for buyer participants could be as simple as proposals -. A buyer might either propose negotiations of order terms based on a seller's catalog and price lists or send out a request for proposal (RFP) to all or some of the seller's in the community, or send out a request for a quote (RFQ) to all or some of the sellers in a community, asking sellers to respond with the best, most comprehensive terms each seller can offer. The present invention also provides prospective buyers with the ability to make e-mail inquiries through the system, which are logged by the system.","Next, in , network functions  of the present invention are shown. As mentioned above, most of the functions of multivariate negotiations engine  are actually implemented as part of Webserver software . As data is sent to and from the Internet  by Webserver W, Webserver software interprets the TCP-IP protocol and transfers the contents to multivariate negotiations engine 's Webserver and dynamic HTML functions -. In one embodiment, these functions cause dynamic HTML text to be created to implement and communicate with the other functions of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that Java, Java scripting, XML, or any of a number of other languages could also be used for such communications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0155"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"m","b":["211","211","02","211"]},"Another external function  of the present invention shown in , is the ability to incorporate application programming interfaces (API's) -. Since the present invention is designed from the \u201coutside looking in\u201d (from the network looking into the enterprise) as it were, the data from transactions completed using it might have to be transferred manually to internal seller and buyer system formats without API - functions. With API - functions, the data that is stored internally by the present invention, can be reformatted by an API designed for a particular seller or buyer's internal systems. For example, if a seller has accepted all the terms of an open buying agreement against which a buyer has now placed an order, the seller might use an API - to \u201ctranslate\u201d that data into a format the seller's internal ERP systems can accept for order processing. For many participants and sponsors, standard APIs - can be created to interface with standard internal ERP systems, such as ORACLE or SAP Corporations' databases and so on. For other participants and sponsors, custom API's may need to be created to interface the present invention with their existing internal systems. In all cases, however, no API's are required to enable sponsors and participants to use the services provided by multivariate negotiations engine .","Now turning to , database functions  are shown. First, database functions  are able to communicate with all other functions and services of the present invention and vice-versa. For example, as a remote Web authoring - request is handled by participant functions , Webserver software fields the request and communicates it through IP firewall to database functions , asking the database server software managing database functions  to process the request and return the appropriate information. The database server software performs searches, analysis, and any computations needed to hand back the correct data. Webserver software formats the returned data, and through conventional common gateway interface scripting techniques, creates dynamic HTML (or XML or Java or Java-compatible, etc.) text for ultimate display. This formatted data, in turn, is transmitted to the appropriate sponsor or participants' browsers over the Internet.","Unique id's feature - is used to insure the proper data is found and transmitted. That is, the present invention associates unique identifiers (id's) with each sponsor, participant, and type of data or transaction. Since database functions  are integrated directly with the other functions of the invention, faster processing and updating of the database is enabled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0159"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":["o ","f","s","f","b","f","s","f ","f","b","f"],"b":["225","06","08","1","08","1","06","08","1","06","06","08","1","225"]},"Turning to , multivariate negotiations engine system 's site contains all the software, hardware and database functions to create and support complete operations of communities. As seen there, the multivariate negotiations engine system 's Website has a Webserver containing standard Webserver software. In one embodiment the public domain Apache Webserver software is used, but those skilled in the art will appreciate that any of a number of other Webserver software products could be used, such as that provided by Microsoft Corporation's Internet Information Server (IIS) product or Netscape Corporation's Fasttrack or Enterprise Server products or any of several of UNIX\u2122 Operating system server software products available from many vendors.","Still in , Webserver enables communications in the TCP-IP format, to be received from the Internet  and forwarded into multivariate negotiations engine system 's site, which is here shown including server farm . Data in these communications is transferred through IP firewall . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that IP firewalls, that is, firewalls such as those supplied by RAPTOR\u2122 IP firewalls from Axent Technology Corporation, SOLSTICE 1\u2122 and SOLSTICE 2\u2122 IP firewalls from Sun Microsystems, Inc., and PIX\u2122 Firewalls  and  from Cisco Systems, Inc. among others, are capable of screening the incoming and outgoing information at all the levels of the TCP-IP OSI 7-layer model. Thus they provide greater security than simpler router or proxy server firewall approaches. Webserver , also transmits out to Internet , when transmissions are sent out from multivariate negotiations engine system 's site. Thus, the data about negotiations and transactions in a community is kept safe behind IP firewall at multivariate negotiations engine system 's site. Data is kept secure by IP firewall and communications over the Internet  are kept secure by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryptions.","Returning to , all the components of multivariate negotiations engine system  are installed at a site separate from any sponsor  or participant  sites. This eliminates the need for any installation of software at a sponsor  or participant 's site or the need for any customizing of software at those sites, thus greatly reducing the associated installation, customizing and training costs that either the sponsor or the participants or both might have incurred with other systems.","As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, if a sponsor or a participant wishes to have some of the applicable system software installed locally, this can also be done. A sponsor , for example, may have already spent half a million dollars or more creating its own Website and would prefer to operate the community from there. This can be accomplished with the present invention by installing the invention's core libraries on the sponsor's Webserver just as it is installed at multivariate negotiations engine system 's site. A sponsor desiring such local installation would usually require a firewall and database server locally, too, dedicated to the community. Once these are in place the present invention can be installed at the sponsor's site in the same way it is installed at multivariate negotiations engine system 's site. Depending on the configuration desired by the sponsor for the local site, additional customization may be required.","While the ability to operate the community from a sponsor's existing local Website is thus available, it is likely to be more costly to install than simply using the services provided at multivariate negotiations engine system 's site.","Similarly, a seller may wish to use a Website it has previously created at great expense. Multivariate negotiations engine system  enables this by providing a customizable scripting language as shown in , and described in more detail below. Using this language, multivariate negotiations engine system  helps a seller create a Website which is, in effect, a mirror of the seller's original Website. A seller might choose to place its product catalog there and have the rest of its Website remain external to multivariate negotiations engine system 's site. Thus, the existing seller external Website retains its existing domain name and URL, is linked to by the present invention as described above, and requests to see the product catalog are linked back to multivariate negotiations engine system 's site where the product catalog is kept.","A more detailed view of multivariate negotiations engine system 's site is shown in . As seen there, the Website  includes Webserver hardware , IP firewall , server farm  and database server hardware . As shown in , most of the functions needed to implement the present invention are implemented outside IP firewall as part of the Webserver software used with Webserver hardware . In this embodiment, the database server software  and the data  are the only items behind IP firewall . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that all of multivariate negotiations engine system 's functions could also be placed behind a firewall if virtual private networks (VPN) or tunneling or similar techniques known in the art used for implementation.","Still in , the principal functions of the present invention operate as part of Webserver software executing in Webserver hardware . Multivariate negotiations engine  is the central function, with sponsor functions , participant functions , external functions  and network functions  working in cooperation with it. All of these, in turn, communicate through the IP firewall , to database functions , operating with database server system , to maintain database(s) . Security of sponsor and participants' communications is provided at the Webserver level through secured socket layer (SSL) encryption schemes offered by most Webserver software products, while an additional layer of security is provided by restricting access to database server computers , where databases  resides, by use of IP firewall . Thus, the present invention enables the collection and storing of negotiations and results data in a highly secure hosting environment over a public network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0168"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"i ","b":["212","212","02","08","04","02","02","04","08","212","02","212"]},"For simple order processing, the seller may be designated the deciding entity by default. For an RFP, the buyer might be designated the deciding entity. In non-commercial communities, such as standards communities or treaty negotiation communities, a sponsor  may wish to designate multiple deciding entities for each issue under consideration. In such an implementation, a sponsor  will usually want to establish more detailed rules for the ordering and processing of proposals.","Still in , the next step - is a statement of multiple terms by one of the negotiating participants. The terms could be formatted in any of a number of ways, such as pre-formatted forms, open field boxes, text areas, and so on. [See , for example] At step -, the proposed terms are evaluated by the other participant. If the other participant is also the deciding entity and the terms are accepted, the last set of terms proposed is stored and processing proceeds to step -, closure.","However, if the terms are not accepted, multivariate negotiations engine  stores this set of proposed terms at step - and processing loops back up to step -, where terms are proposed again, usually with some variations from the previous set proposed. This iterative process continues between steps - and - until the deciding entity accepts the terms and closure is reached at step -. Multivariate negotiations engine  keeps track of each set of changes and can display them so that the changes proposed at each step of the negotiations are clearly and accurately recorded.","Still in , once closure is reached at step -, multivariate negotiations engine  checks to see if a concluding document is desired. For most transactions in most communities, some form of final document (such as contract document  above) is desired to reflect the participants' agreement. However, it is possible that the participants may only wish to reach closure and that they will rely on the recorded rounds of negotiation to memorialize the terms they agreed on. If a concluding document is requested, it is created and noted as complete at step -. Whether or not a concluding document is requested, the system automatically displays the changes so they can be easily seen and the present invention also checks to see whether a state change is needed at step -. If a state change is needed it is initiated at step -. Depending on the community, the participants, and the transactions involved, state changes could be as simple as payment authorizations sent electronically or as complex as multi-step processes desired by the participants.","Also as mentioned above, API functions can be used to integrate the present invention with a seller's or buyer's internal ERP systems, if desired.","While some users of the present invention may want to install parts of it locally, it is another advantage of the present invention that it can also be used for a \u201cone-time\u201d or \u201cnearly instantaneous\u201d community negotiation. Turning briefly to , if the sponsor of community CB is a standards body, it could create a community Website for the negotiation of a particular standard, enlist participants, and encourage and monitor the negotiations without anyone having to buy or install additional local hardware or software. When the negotiation is complete and the concluding agreed upon standards document can be made available to all concerned, the community could be \u201cdismantled\u201d and the participants could disband without wasting any hardware or software installations and expenses. In other words, the present invention could be operated as a one-time service for a fee, as well as an ongoing systems. In either case, the costs of the system's fees are likely to be dwarfed by the costs the users would otherwise have incurred if they had to create their own Websites and mechanisms.","With reference now to , the steps of multivariate negotiations engine  are shown. While a sponsor , is desirable, multivariate negotiations engine  can operate with only a deciding entity DE and another initiating entity OE. If this is a commerce community, deciding entity DE is usually the seller and the other initiating entity OE is usually the buyer. However, even in this situation, other designations are possible. For example, if the buyer is sending out a request for proposal to which sellers must reply and negotiate, then the buyer may be the deciding entity and the seller(s) the other negotiating entity. For many master agreements or open to buy agreements, both negotiating partes may be deciding negotiating entities.","In any case, as described in more detail below, one of the entities initiates a negotiation process and the participants negotiate terms iteratively, back and forth through multivariate negotiations engine  until the deciding entity accepts and closure  is reached. In a commercial community, closure  usually results in a contract document  and probably some state changes  associated with activating production, shipments, payments, order handling and so on.","To operate, multivariate negotiations engine  shown in , need involve only two entities, one with decision-making authority and one to propose different or additional terms, with the goal of their actions being closure on a final set of terms. Multivariate negotiations engine  can also help participants check out market conditions through inquiries and proposals where closure  may not result in any contract document  but only in an accurate assessment of market conditions. For example, when there is rumored to be a shortage of goods of a certain type, a buyer may want to know whether it can purchase such a product in high quantities at a reasonable price from any seller. If not, then the buyer may believe the shortage does, in fact, exist.","Returning now to , it can be seen that as few as two participants can use the iterative multivariate negotiation features of the present invention. At least one must be designated or identified as the deciding entity DE. Both can propose terms back and forth (see ) until closure  is reached.","Now referring to , a typical proposal form for a buyer is shown. As seen here, the buyer identifies himself, his title, his company, and the company's location at lines -. At lines - information about the buyer's designated freight forwarder is given. At line , document presentation terms are specified, as well as at line , ,  and so on, the detailed terms of the buyer's preferences for shipment. Note that at box , buyer's comments, the buyer has said \u201cI want a 20% discount.\u201d Open text box  can be used by the buyer to type in or cut and paste in from another document any additional terms the buyer would like to see. This might include warranty and indemnity terms favorable to the buyer, provisions for acts of God, and so on. If purchase orders of bulk order terms are being negotiated they can be included here. Letter of Credit (L\/C) or other internationally standard payment vehicle terms such as wire transfer, documentary collection are being proposed, the negotiation can be structured around them.","Once the buyer has sent its proposal, the seller is alerted by the system by email (as seen in ) that a proposal is available on the system for review and negotiation. In one embodiment, the email notification includes links to multivariate negotiations engine system 's site. Once the seller (using its browser) becomes aware from the e-mail that a proposal is available it jumps immediately, using the link mentioned above in the email, to view a browser screen such as that shown in , which shows a proposed order with payment by letter of credit from the above buyer. According to the present invention, the seller must still use its user id and password for such viewing, thus preserving security of the data. In this approach, the email notification does not contain any sensitive or confidential data. It serves simply as a notifier. Note that email notices of the present invention do not contain any confidential information. Confidential data is transmitted securely to the browser through SSL techniques. Access to the data is by user name and password.","All participants in a negotiation are continually notified by e-mail as the negotiations progress. In this embodiment, the participants are required to enter their e-mail addresses in order to use the present invention. When participants log into their protected areas in the system's databases , they are also presented with information regarding the latest developments, if any, which have occurred in their respective negotiations.","One of the paradoxes of international trade now is that as today's global economy expands exponentially the number of potential buyers and sellers, it becomes correspondingly difficult for them to find each other and negotiate agreements. The present invention addresses this in a number of ways. First, a sponsored community increases the visibility of member companies which are sellers. The methods described below in connection with functions to promote visibility for the sponsored community and its members significantly increase the likelihood that a buyer, searching for a new supplier over the Internet will find members of such sponsored communities and that they will be more likely to meet the buyer's needs. For example, trade development communities can be established using the present invention, including as sellers only those that meet the qualifications outlined by the sponsor. This simplifies a prospective buyer's search and evaluation task significantly. The sample order quantity purchasing features (also described in more detail below) of the present invention, significantly reduce the time it takes for a buyer to qualify a new supplier or seller anywhere in the world.","As mentioned above, most companies would prefer not to pay for volume goods with credit cards, since that it the equivalent of paying cash in advance. When that is coupled with the difficulties encountered by those attempting to pay for merchandise online, especially in countries that do not handle credit card transactions, it can be seen that the sample ordering and multiple payment vehicle features of the present invention also contribute to improved international transaction processing. This is especially true for buyers and sellers that are new to each other.","With reference now to , an overview block diagram illustrating the international transaction processing features of the present invention is shown. As seen there, multivariate negotiations engine system  is connected over an international network IN, such as the Internet . Those skilled in the art appreciate it could also be a proprietary network or virtual private network, if desired. For international processing, sponsored community CC might be a community of sellers of electronic components located in Pacific rim countries. Prospective buyers can be located anywhere in the world, such as Russia, Europe, Africa, South America, North America, and so on.","Since, as mentioned above, credit card online payment vehicles are difficult or impossible to implement in some countries, the present invention enables the use of several internationally accepted payment methods and automates the negotiation of them, along with the negotiation of the overall agreement. The payment vehicle most commonly used when the buyer and the seller are complete strangers to each other is the letter of credit (L\/C).","In a proposed letter of credit, such as that shown in , the buyer's bank assumes the full credit risk, and is absolutely obligated to pay the seller, provided the seller ships goods in a way that conforms in every detail to the terms of the letter of credit. Minor errors such as typographical or facsimile reproduction blurring of a document are one of the most frequent causes for letter of credit payment disputes between buyers and sellers.","The present invention enables, as part of the negotiations process, the negotiation of the terms of a letter of credit as seen in FIG. . The letter of credit shown there, if accepted by the deciding entity DE as part of the negotiations, can be transmitted over a SWIFT compatible network to the advising bank, for immediate implementation. Thus, if the participants are unwilling to pay using credit cards or CYBERCASH\u2122 payment methods, (which are essentially cash payments in advance) a seller can still activate a Website automatically and take volume orders if it is willing to negotiate letters of credit, wire transfers, documentary collection procedures or to accept a buyer's purchase order.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0188"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0189","num":"0189"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["100","104"]},"In a flow diagram of the initial part of remote Web authoring - is shown. In this diagram, it is assumed that a seller is registering for the first time with a sponsored commerce community. Other types of communities might vary this processing. First, at step , the seller chooses from one or more templates provided by multivariate negotiations engine system , based on the level of cost and functionality the seller desires. Sample website pages constructed from such templates by a hypothetical company named Exports, Inc., are shown in to ","Next, at step  in the seller provides basic information as prompted by the system through a setup screen such as that shown in FIGS. ---. Portions of the demographic information collected there, along with other data collected later is automatically formatted along with the META tags and Meta Keywords for automatic submission to search engines. At step  in , the system presents the community's standard license agreement and terms to the seller. If the seller agrees to the terms at decision block , processing continues. If the seller does not agree, the seller may proceed to block  to negotiate with sponsor or elect not to participate.","Still in , if the seller has agreed to the sponsor's terms for participation at step  payment terms are executed if the sponsor requires online payment. Any of a number of payment options provided by the system can be used. If payment has not been settled, as determined at block , the seller and sponsor can negotiate some more, or the seller may again elect not to participate at block . If the seller chooses not to participate, remote Web authoring - stops. If payment has been settled, the sponsor provides instructions at step  to the seller for proceeding to the creation and customization of the Website.","Turning now to , processing steps for the customization of the seller's Website in the community are shown. At step , the seller logs into this part of multivariate negotiations engine system  using the username and passwords it selected when entering demographic data in the previous registration steps. At step , the seller, having already selected a general template for a Website, selects a customization item from those that are specific to its template. At step , the seller is presented with instructions and suggestions as it customizes features using an online form such as that shown in FIGS. ---. Sellers with a small inventory of goods can simply create a product catalog online using the web authoring features of the present invention.","Sellers with existing digital versions of their product catalogs or inventory tracking systems are able to integrate them with the present invention using application programming interfaces (APIs), file transfer protocols (FTP), or extensible markup language (XML), which latter method is in the final stages of becoming a standard language for the Web.","At any time in this process, the seller can preview the Website to see what it looks like so far. At decision block  the system checks to see if the seller has completed customizing. If it has, the system enables the seller for active status and online commerce at step . If customization is not complete, processing continues from step .","With reference now to , a diagram of the sponsor functions  is shown. Generally speaking, a sponsor  builds a community and establishes its rules -. In one embodiment, a sponsor  can create the community Website from templates available from multivariate negotiation system 's site. In other embodiments, a sponsor may have already invested millions of dollars in the creation of its own database(s) and Website, and simply wants to have the community enabled from there, using applications programming interfaces (API's) or the new XML language when it is standardized. The present invention permits either or both methods of creating or enabling a community Website.","As seen in , the rules or standards for the community can be as comprehensive or as simple as the sponsor  desires. For a commercial site, for example, sponsor  may want to require all sellers to be compliant with a particular standards organization's applicable quality standards, such as the International Standards Organization (ISO), shown as R here. Additionally, sponsor  may want to insure that all fees due to sponsor from sellers are paid in full and kept up to date\u2014rule R. As another example, a sponsor for a regional trade development community may want to insure that each seller is able to handle importing and exporting of goods\u2014rule R, meets some specified minimum performance capabilities such as rule R, just-in-time capability or rule R, bar code processing, or rule R, ability to handle specified payment methods.","As seen in , the sponsor functions - are also involved in the remote Web authoring functions -. At step , after sponsor determines the seller is in good standing, sponsor register's seller's company name, products and other data with the community's internal search engine. Next, at step , sponsor registers the seller's name with Internic, the corporation established for assigning domain names and URLs. At step , sponsor automatically submits seller's name and data to major external search engines on the Internet. At step , the sponsor completes the integration of the new seller into the community, enables it for active status, includes it at the top of the list of any vendor databases and allows the seller's Website access to the online community's functions.","Returning to , another principal sponsor function is promoting visibility -. In this capacity, a sponsor  may submit its own Website and URL's to a number of Internet search engines and submit each selling participants' Websites and URL's to such search engines as soon as the seller is registered and has created a Website. A typical sponsor's promote visibility functions - formats the URL's and domain names (as provided by the system registration forms which are automatically integrated into the system) into the META Tags and Meta Keywords or similar formats and submission schedules most likely to speed up registration with the search engines. For example, the ALTAVISTA\u2122 search engine Web site states that:\n\n","Since, as noted above, it may take the ALTAVISTA\u2122 search engine and others, as many as three months or more to index a site on a purely random basis, submissions such as this can significantly improve the visibility of the new seller Websites from the outset. Automating submissions to them further speeds up this process. In addition, aggregating all of the submissions under the sponsor community hierarchy is likely to generate exponentially more traffic as it takes advantage of the Internet's architecture and search engine indexing capabilities. Traffic, such as inquiries by potential buyers against any of the keywords submitted for the community site will come into the community environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0201","num":"0202"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["1","213","04","08"]},"Next, at step k, promote visibility function - checks to see if it is time to submit the data to a selected search engine n. As noted above, some search engines accept submissions only on a weekly basis, at specified times. If search engine n is not accepting data at this time promote visibility function - proceeds to step k to wait the specified interval. If it is the right time to submit visibility data to search engine n, promote visibility function - does so at step k. At step k a check is made to see if any more submissions should be made to search engines. If there are several more to process, promote visibility function - finds the address of the next search engine, which now becomes search engine n, and returns to decision block k. If it has been determined at step k that submissions have been made to all search engines, promote visibility function - returns at step k. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these submission steps can be scheduled to repeat on a regular basis until all of the visibility data for a new participant registrant has been submitted to all the search engines. The present invention also schedules updating submissions on a regular basis to insure most search engines place community sites near the top of their index lists.","Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that other promote visibility functions  might be implemented for participants. For example, advertisements could be uploaded from a participant's local computer systems for inclusion in the participant's Website in the community, if allowed by the rules of the community. Such advertisements could be forwarded or submitted to related sites as another promote visibility function , if allowed by the community rules.","Still other promotional activities for the community can be performed by the sponsor's promote visibility functions -. For example, many sponsors may want to create links to and from other Websites to direct more \u201ctraffic\u201d to the sponsor's Website, and either directly or indirectly all the seller's Websites within. This is useful when sellers or sponsors or both already have established brand name identities and traffic patterns through their own individual traditional and Web-based brand recognition marketing efforts.","Referring again to , it can be seen at step - of the multivariate negotiations engine 's processing, that each \u201cround\u201d or step of negotiations is stored and archived by the present invention. This is of special benefit to any participants negotiating a binding agreement who may later disagree as to the exact intent or content of the final terms. This archival processing allows either side or the sponsor or moderator (using the appropriate usernames and passwords) to view the steps leading up to the final document. The likelihood of potential disputes arising over what has been historically referred to as the \u201cbattle of the forms\u201d can be greatly reduced, or even eliminated using this archival feature. These non-repudiation features of the present invention are likely to significantly reduce the incidence of \u201cinadvertent lapses of memory\u201d, since \u201cmemory\u201d can easily be refreshed from the archives. This, coupled with other security and validation features of the present invention mentioned above, provides a more complete non-repudiation system than is presently available.","That is, the present invention provides authentication by validating the identity of the participants through user names and passwords; maintains confidentiality by using SSL encryption and decryption to ensure that confidential information is not intercepted during transmission; provides security of the data stored at multivariate negotiation engine system 's site through use of IP firewall ; and by virtue of the archival features, provides documentary non-repudiation by ensuring that transactions, as they are negotiated and committed are fully documented. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that existing security techniques such as public key encryption (PKI) systems, certificates of authentication, among others can also be used to enhance the integrity of the documentary archives.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0207","num":"0208"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 28"],"b":["1","1","2","2"]},"In this example, the seller accepts buyer terms BT and this is reflected in the final deal terms FD. If, at some later time, the seller demands payment from the buyer at a time when the buyer is unable to send money out of the country because of government action, these non-repudiation features make it clear that the seller had agree to excuse performance in that circumstance. Thus, the seller cannot say \u201cI was positive we had eliminated two of your requested terms for inclusion as acts of God, and since our copy of the final terms has been destroyed, and you cannot find yours, I demand you pay.\u201d The present invention significantly increases the likelihood of preventing such not uncommon occurrences as disputes arising from lost or misplaced copies of documents.","For production purchasers, sample orders can be placed at the outset of vendor selection processes by a production buyer. If the sponsor desires to include this feature in the community, it will make arrangements with each seller for the payment for the samples. In order to enable a seller to \u201cgo live\u201d immediately upon the creation of the seller's Website, a sponsor might authorize payments for such sample purchases through the Sponsor's own merchant id or similar arrangements for online payment processing. This eliminates the need for the seller to wait several weeks for a merchant Id in order to accept credit card payments for small value transactions such as sample orders.","Often a seller's ability to accept sample orders in specified quantities upon agreed upon payment terms will be one of the rules of the community. Once a buyer has placed an order for sample quantities, the system automatically sends a notification to that effect to the seller, as seen in FIG. . The seller, having previously agreed to accept sample orders is now obligated to ship the quantity of the items as specified by the buyer. In a typical implementation of this feature, the seller's normal shipping and handling terms apply. If the sponsor and sellers agree to accept payment for samples by credit card or procurement card, the sponsor can process the payments online using its own accounts, and then remit the proceeds from the payments, less its fees for handling, to the seller by wire transfer or other standard payment methods.","Referring briefly to (Prior Art), it can be seen that the prior methods of ordering sample quantities were heavily labor intensive. A person P, from the prospective buyer organization would look through a hard copy product catalog, place an order by facsimile or telephone, and possibly fly to the seller's factory, where face to face negotiations might occur with seller's representative P. Buyer P might also have to negotiate by fax and telephone a letter of credit with its bank representative P, before all price, payment, and other terms are completed so that payment can be arranged to occur upon shipment of the sample quantities. As noted in the background section above, this traditional approach is usually lengthy, costly and labor-intensive.","Referring now to , the present invention enables a prospective buyer to electronically search a sponsored community site at step SO for sellers of goods meeting buyers needs. As mentioned under international transaction processing, above, this ability to find new, possibly pre-qualified suppliers over the internet is a significant advantage for production buyers.","At step SO, the sponsored community displays to the buyer the sellers with goods meeting the needs. At step SO the buyer can link to the sites of the sellers listed in the display, and either send email inquiries to them (step SO), or directly order sample quantities from them (step SO) or evaluate them at step SO. If the buyer likes the samples and wishes to negotiate terms for placing an order in volume, it can proceed to Steps SO through SO to do so.","As mentioned above, this ability to order and receive sample quantities quickly has special benefit for production buyers looking for goods to use in new developments. If samples of such goods can be brought in and tested by the engineering developers, significant improvements are possible in getting new products ready for market.","Turning now to , databases  as they might be logically depicted for a commercial sponsored community CC are shown. In this view, sponsor database DB includes not only sponsor-specific information, but pointers to: a database of registered seller participants , an administrative database DBa, perhaps a larger database of potential vendors DBb, as well as a buyer participants database , and a rules database DBc.","Still in , there are usually logical interrelationships amongst the various databases in a community, as well. For example, seller participant S has its products database S. Seller participant S in this example has just been linked to buyer participant , because of a contract document  the participants have just completed negotiating through the system. This, in turn, enables buyer participant  to include seller participant S in buyer participant's qualified, online vendor list maintained by the present invention in database . In production purchasing, once a seller has achieved the status of inclusion in the buying company's qualified vendor list (QVL), it usually makes it easier to have future negotiations between the two companies. The present invention not only allows the QVL list to be maintained online, it can also automatically add a seller to it if a major agreement such as the type designated by buyer has been completed between the two of them through the system. Similarly, the buyer in the above example is likely to be entered in several of the seller's databases.","A typical sponsor 's administrative database DBa, in , includes such things as templates, procedures, and charges for registering new sellers, procedures for recognizing and assigning passwords to buyers, procedures for automatic renewal, details of each sellers required banking information, and so on. Sponsor 's vendor database DBb, might be a listing of all the potential vendors in this general market. For example, if the general market for which sponsored community CC was created is the market for power supplies for electronic equipment, then all the makers of power supplies might be included in a brief listing in this database. As a manufacturer of power supplies for this market registers with the sponsor , agreeing to meet all the conditions specified for inclusion by sponsor , it is automatically placed, by multivariate negotiations engine system , at the top of a list of vendors in vendor database DBb. Thus, when potential buyers are browsing through the community Website CC, they will find the registered sellers at the top of vendor database list DBb, with others listed in lower priority order.","Typical sponsor vendor database Dbb includes text, images, sound files, etc. When information from one or more of these databases is called for, the present invention pulls such associated files and graphics for display to the requestor. Typical sponsor  databases  also include demographic data about registered sellers, such as company name, title, and locations. If certificates of authenticity, customer identification numbers, or electronic signatures such as those conventionally used for non-repudiation purposes are collected, they can also be stored in a sponsor database . Consequently, the services available from a typical sponsor  using the present invention, can make production purchasing more efficient for a buyer and provide direct access to potential buyers for all registered sellers.","As seen in and , database  of the present invention is automatically integrated with the functions of the multivariate negotiations engine system . As HTML text is received, requests and data are extracted from it (as described in more detail below) into dynamic HTML for storage in database  in the appropriate \u201cfolders\u201d for the respective members.","With reference now to , it can be seen that database functions  communicate directly with webserver through IP firewall in the present invention. The traditional approach to addressing database concerns over the Internet usually involve a webserver, an application server software product, and a database software server product. As can be seen in , this embodiment of the present invention does not use an application server software product. Instead the functionality that is needed to receive and transmit information to and from a participant , over a communications path through webserver of multivariate negotiations engine system  is accomplished by using common gateway interface (CGI) programming such as perl, C++ and Java. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other scripting and programming languages could be used as well.","As seen in , CGI programming is used between participant 's browser software at the participant's site, to handle communications between participant  and multivariate negotiations engine system 's webserver . CGI programming is used to dynamically create Web pages based upon the participant's request.","In the embodiment shown in , communications between webserver and database functions  are conducted directly also using languages Java, perl and C++, without the use of an intervening application server software product. Most of the functions of an applications server product are thus programmed directly either into webserver or database functions  using web-based programming techniques. This approach tends to save both space and time and has the advantage of simplifying the operations at both ends, since functions can be streamlined. In particular, reporting can be more flexible than if a standard application server software program were interposed between webserver and database functions . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that more traditional application server software products could still be used, if desired, as could other languages or scripting languages.","For example, and still in , if a buyer participant  wishes to place a proposed order, the browser encrypts it at the browser's secure socket layer and webserver decrypts the proposed order upon receipt at multivariate negotiations engine 's site. Webserver next analyzes the proposed order to understand it and formats into a request sent to database functions . In addition to basic read and write functions, database functions  shown in , include operations such as search, analyze, compare, report, sort and relate (between databases.) Formatting can be as simple as \u201cuser=username\u201d etc. A request such as \u201cfind user=username, return catalog\u201d might be sent through IP firewall ","Using object-oriented techniques, the database is ordered more compactly to provide faster search capabilities. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that traditional flat file and relational or other database structures could be used as well.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0225","num":"0226"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b","b":["579","02","4"]},"Now turning to , a complete automated system of record CP of the present invention is shown. In the embodiment shown, sponsor  has, as described above, created the basic sponsored community and rules that will be used as part of the automated system of record CP. However, the deciding entity DE of two participants could also serve as a sponsor  if desired. Contract authority CP assigns a unique identifier CPNN to each major negotiation and its ensuing activities. In the embodiments shown, this identifier is used to identify all the items associated with a major negotiation. To initiate a major new negotiation, sponsor  uses dynamic contract CP of the present invention to transform the business rules of the sponsored community into the active templates CP of the present invention. Automated negotiations engine  is used to negotiate from the active templates CP, in addition to any other user-supplied context. For the users who wish to maintain the data contained by automated system of record CP at one or more sites other than the central site, multiple repositories CP can be used to accomplish this, as will be seen in more detail below. With the use of dynamic contract CP and active templates CP, automated negotiations engine  can also be used more readily to negotiate other types of \u201ccontracts\u201d, such as specifications, or even to automate the negotiation of some or all of the development of a new product, as will be described in more detail below.

Either of these buyers  may send information through contract central switch CPCS to reach either sellers  or additional application servers APP and ERP.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0229","num":"0230"},"figref":["FIGS. 35 and 36","FIG. 37"],"b":["02","02","225","12","12","00"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0230","num":"0231"},"figref":"FIG. 38","b":["50","52","54","56","58","02","02","10"]},"Turning now to , a flow diagram for sponsor 's interaction with automated system of record CP is shown. At step CP, sponsor  establishes rules for the sponsored community, using techniques described above. Next, at step CP, sponsor  obtains a unique identifier CPNN from contract authority CP of the present invention. In the embodiments shown, contract authority CP typically manages blocks of unique identifiers, which are each generated in such a way that they insure that number will never be generated again. So, for example, contract authority CP could start with a block of numbers, and then as new blocks of numbers are generated they are compared with previous blocks to insure there is no duplication.","Still in , once a unique identifier CPNN has been obtained, sponsor , at step CP associates its contract active templates CP with that number for acceptance by the participants. At step CP, sponsor  asks the participants who are going to be involved in the negotiation associated with unique identifier CPNN if they wish to submit any other active templates CP. Turning briefly to , an excerpt from a contracts active template CPis shown, having predefined fields in specified formats for such items as item number, price, quantities needed for discount to apply, the discount, Ship schedule, Incoterms and so on. Active templates CP are designed either by sponsors or participants or both to represent data being negotiated in such a way that certain fields can be used automatically by other programs such as logistics tracking programs, bill of materials programs, ERP systems and so on. Typically, this requires that the field be specified and formatted in such a way that the programs that will use it can either read the information directly from a record or sub record in the active template CP or can accept the information in that format when supplied with it as an input parameter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0233","num":"0234"},"figref":"FIG. 41","b":"08","i":"b "},"Next, in , a buyer participant's use of the automated system of record CP is shown in part. As mentioned above, while commercial applications between buyers and sellers are used for illustration purposes, and the term contract is used to refer to a finally agreed upon set of terms, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention could be used for non-commercial applications, as well.","Still in , at step CP, the buyer sets and sends its specifications for a product to be developed and associated with the unique identifier that will govern a contract to be negotiated, in this example, the agreement will be a major agreement governing both the development as well as the purchase of that product. At step CP, the buyer agrees to use the contract active template CP supplied by sponsor . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that sponsors  may be good sources of such templates where contractual issues being negotiated within sponsor 's industry are often very similar from deal to deal. At step CP, the buyer submits any development active templates CP it may have. Examples of such will be given in more detail below.","Still in , at step CP, buyer submits order templates, and at step CP logistics templates it would like to use for these areas. Participants can use remote web authoring - to submit active templates CP to dynamic contract CP, which integrates them within automated system of record CP. Then at step CP, buyer proceeds to contract negotiations, using automated negotiations engine  of the present invention.","Now referring to , steps a typical seller might take are shown. At step CP, the seller uses automated negotiations engine to receive the specifications from the buyer. At CP, the seller agrees, through automated negotiations engine  to use the contract active template CP supplied by sponsor  and, at step CP to use the development active template CP supplied by buyer. Alternatively, seller could use automated negotiations engine  to negotiate the terms of an active template CP. Still in the example of , at steps CP and CP, the seller accepts buyers order and logistic templates, respectively. At step CP, the seller proceeds to negotiations if it has not already done so.","With reference now to , a flow diagram of post contract activities using the present invention is shown. At step CP, once contract negotiations are completed, the contract active template CP will be used to automatically inform buyers (or seller's or both) ERP systems, such as those provided by SAP, Oracle, Inc. Or Peoplesoft, Inc., among others, of the details of the contract which are relevant to it, such as items, price, quantity, shipping instructions. In the example of , the buyer at step CP initiates its order tracking systems, and logistical tracking systems, even though development and shipping have not even started yet. Next, at step CP, the buyer and seller can perform technical negotiations using the active templates CP supplied by buyer for its product requirements and automated negotiations engine . When final agreement has been reached on the technical negotiations seller, at step CP starts development. If the active templates CP allow, buyer can, at step CP track the developments as well. Finally, at step CP, seller ships the product in production quantities, which usually activates order tracking and which continue to execute at step CP on an on-going basis. At some point, at step CP, either buyer or seller may want to use process mining CP (described in more detail below) to determine whether its respective processes are as efficient and effective as desired.","For tracking processes between companies or entities, the flow diagram of  illustrates how the present invention can be used. At step CP during a negotiation, the buyer asks seller to cooperate in such an endeavor, and at step CP, seller agrees. Next at CP, buyer requests notification be sent to seller through automated system of record CP by its own internal purchasing department, and at step CP, internal purchasing agrees to do so. At step CP, buyer requests that seller send a notification through automated system of record CP when the order is received by seller and at step CP, seller agrees to do this, too. Similarly, at steps CP, CP,CP, CP, buyer and seller agree to exchange notifications through automated system of record CP. At step CP, buyer requests that its internal receiving department also participate in sending notices, which is agree to at step CP. Finally, at step CP, which may be some time in the future, buyer starts processing orders.","Now turning to , process mining CP of the present invention is shown. At step CP, an alert is received to initiate process mining CP. An alert can come from any of a number of sources, such as a request by a buyer, a seller or a sponsor. At step CP, the alert containing the requested unique identifier CPNN associated with the major negotiation whose processes are to be mined, is validated by contract authority CP's security CP against the contract identifier CPNN maintained by contract authority CP in database . Security CP also checks, at step CP, to see if other information supplied with the request matches the information associated with unique identifier CPNN in database . If it does not, an error notice is provided. If all matches, control flows to process mining CP at step CP, which stores the validated request information in database , and proceeds at step CP to measure the time, revenue, and inventory changes between event dates specified in the request. As seen from , events such as these can be tracked using database  of automated system of record CP, using the notices provided by the procedures set up in FIG. . Thus, if process mining CP is used to analyze logistics within seller's internal systems, it might turn out that when seller uses its own fleet of trucks for delivery, deliveries are 1 to 3 days late, on average, while deliveries made by a delivery company are never more than 1 day late. Thus, at step CP, process mining CP can evaluate the time and revenue consequences of this for profits for this product. Similarly, process mining CP might, at step CP propose contract changes as simple as a change of shipper. If the changes are acceptable to the parties, process mining CP can amend the contract with the agreed upon changes, using automated negotiations engine  at step CP.","With reference now to , use of automated negotiations engine  for iterative, multivariate technical negotiations is shown. In the example here, a buyer manufacturer that normally produces its own equipment using programmable logic computers to operate a lathe, wants to subcontract the work to a consulting engineering company. At step CP, the manufacturer indicates to the consulting engineering company that it wants to program the lathe. At step CP, the manufacturer uses dynamic contract CP to present high level programming options to consulting engineer. At step CP, consulting engineer enters the parameters into its PLC program, which, at step CP demonstrates output that would result. At step CP, the consulting engineer refines the parameters, reruns the system at step CP. At step CP, the engineer uses the final PLC settings, and at step CP, the PLC program, if it has an assessment capability assesses the cost to create the product using those parameters. At step CP the engineer approves those charges, at step CP the PLC system is deployed, at step CP all the relevant systems known to automated system of record CP are notified of the context. Finally, at step CP, the finished PLC application is available for further use.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other technical negotiations can be automated in whole or in part, as well. For example, Autodesk's AutoCAD\u2122 software allows users to generate mechanical computer aided design drawings which include part numbers, from which a bill of materials is produced. Agile Corporation's Agile Product Definition Server can take the bill of materials parts information from AutoCAD\u2122 and publish and manage it for sourcing parts. Similar systems are provided for VLSI CAD designs by such companies as Windchill and Mentor Systems.","With reference now to , the multiple repository functions CP of the present invention are diagrammed in flowchart format. As mentioned earlier, the data created by use of automated negotiations engine  and automated system of record CP can be stored at one central location, such as sponsor 's site. Using the multiple repository functions CP, a participant can request that automated system of record  also maintain a copy of the items relevant to that participant in a local repository.  shows the steps used to manage this. At step CP, multiple repository function CP receives an update to primary database . At step CP, it looks to the contract terms to determine which local repositories need to be updated. At step CP, for each system to be updated, the transaction is written to an output list for delivery and at step CP, each local system receives the transaction and applies it. To maintain transactional integrity when updating two or more systems with the same transaction, products such as BEA corporations TUXEDO\u2122 product, or IBM Corporation's Transarc Encina product or Microsoft's Transaction Server or MTS\u2122 product can be used In the embodiments shown, the TUXEDO product is used.","Still in , at step CP, it can be seen that the original system is where the contract or agreement lives and at step C, other systems use this transaction to inform their local processes, e.g. pass parameters to an ERP system, for example. Now turning to , a flow diagram of security CP is shown. At step CP, when an agreement is negotiated using automated system of record CP and automated negotiations engine , the contract documents are created with security extensions, such as access control lists, privileges lists, etc. which all parties agree to accept. At step CP, contract authority CP assigns a unique identifier CPNN to associate with all related documents and terms. At step CP one party agrees to accept a contract template which indicates security baselines. At Step CP, the other party accepts them, too. If they do not accept or wish to add or modify the templates, they can do so at steps C and CP respectively. At step CP agreement is reached and at step CP, the initial contract documents are loaded into a contract router CPR (if the router configuration is used) and automated system of record CP is started using these documents as the inputs to automated negotiations engine . From then on, at step CP permitted transactions are processed and at step CP invalid transactions are recorded and logged.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the embodiments described above are illustrative only, and that other systems in the spirit of the teachings herein fall within the scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","Overview","System","Iterative Multivariate Negotiations","International Transaction Processing","Remote Web Authoring","Sponsored Community","Non-repudiation","Sample Ordering","Integrated Database","System of Record"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"d "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"e "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"f "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"g "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"h "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"i "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"j "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"k "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 1L"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"m "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"n "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 1","i":"o "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0108"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0109"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0110"},"figref":"FIGS. 10-1","b":["10","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIGS. 11","i":["a","a"],"b":["1","11","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 11b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0115"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0116","num":"0116"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0117"},"figref":"FIG. 15","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIGS. 15","i":["c","c"],"b":["1","15","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIGS. 18-23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0122"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0123"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0124","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0127"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0129"},"figref":"FIGS. 31","i":["a ","d "],"b":"31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0130"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIGS. 33-37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0132"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0133","num":"0133"},"figref":"FIG. 39"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0134"},"figref":"FIGS. 40 and 41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0135","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0136","num":"0136"},"figref":"FIGS. 43-51"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
