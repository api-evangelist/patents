title: Device location detection
abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are disclosed for improving location awareness of a device. A device position can be determined (e.g., via GPS or some location service), and this position can be used to identify a user-experience that may be in an area around the device, such as within a desired position threshold. A near-field radio system beacon that is associated with the user-experience can be activated in order to identify a distance of the device from the beacon. The beacon can use a near-field radio system ID associated with the device to identify the device, and determine a distance to the device. When a user moves the device to within a threshold distance from the beacon, the user-experience can be activated on the device, such that the user may interact with the user-experience (e.g., to hear a description of artwork as the user navigates through a museum).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["As computing devices have become more portable, mobile computing has become more interactive with a user's surroundings. For example, a mapping application can run on the user's mobile computing device (e.g., smartphone) that allows the user to identify their approximate location. Further, points of interest, retails establishments, entertainment venues, and more, can be indicated on the mapping application, for example, which can be searched for, and\/or identified as the user moves through an area. Typically, mobile devices use global positioning systems (GPS), which utilize satellite triangulation, or some sort of signal triangulation (e.g., mobile phone signal) to identify the approximate location of the user. This location information can be used by various applications on the user's device, such as to provide appropriate and relevant local information, identify the user's location for social networking, and more.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Current global positioning systems (GPS) and\/or other location identification services used on mobile devices may not provide needed fidelity for some user-experience, such as applications running on the mobile device. For example, the GPS systems can have an error range of thirty to fifty feet, which may not provide needed fidelity when the user-experience needs the user to be immediately proximate to a specific location. Further, while the GPS can provide an approximate position of the user relative to a mapped point, a distance from the user to a particular object may not meet granularity requirements to properly interact, such as with an ATM, or console attached to a monitor.","Additionally, GPS-type location tracking lose reliability when the device is inside a building or under cover. Even in optimal conditions, a GPS may not be able tell that the user is inside a building, standing in front of a painting on the wall of the third floor lobby. Further, even if it could, the location cannot be verified by a 3rd party. For example, GPS locations (and others) can be spoofed, thereby providing an incorrect location of the device. Applications may be used that create false coordinates, and\/or grid sectors, to be provided to a requesting application. Typically, the provided GPS coordinates are all that is used to identify the user's location, for example, and they are not verified by a third party.","Accordingly, one or more techniques and\/or systems are disclosed that utilize a combination at least two device locating sources. For example, a position can initially be determined by GPS coordinates for the device, and verified using a near-field radio system signal, such as Bluetooth. It will be appreciated that near-field and\/or the like as used herein is not mean to be overly limiting. For example, use of near-field and\/or the like is not meant to exclude rfid, wi-fi, very close proximity, short range-low power and\/or the like, but is instead intended to comprise implementations such as these (and others) as well. Moreover, while Bluetooth is mentioned as an example herein, other near-field, rfid, wi-fi, very close proximity, short range-low power, etc. implementations (e.g., that are suitable to provide a more accurate, precise, exacting, etc. device location\/verification) are envisioned as well. The combined location awareness provided herein can help determine an actual position of the user's mobile computing device relative to specific physical locations. As an example, a location of a user-experience (e.g., where the user can interact with their surroundings using their mobile device, such as navigating through a museum to experience descriptions of different artistic displays) can have a Bluetooth radio beacon that can be used to determine a position of a device relative to the beacon with a greater degree of granularity than merely GPS (and\/or other techniques) alone. Further, in this example, the user's device may not need to perform pairing operations with the beacon, but merely transmit a signal for a distance to be identified.","In one embodiment for improving location awareness of a device, a position of the device in a location positioning system, such as a GPS, is identified. Using the position of the device, a user-experience can be identified for the device within a desired threshold (e.g., an area around the device). A near-field radio system beacon (e.g., Bluetooth beacon) that is associated with the user-experience can be activated in order to identify a distance of the device from the beacon. The beacon can use a near-field radio system ID associated with the device to identify the device, for example, and determine signal strength. Upon determining that the device is within a threshold distance from the beacon, such as when the user moves the device toward the beacon and is close enough, the user-experience (e.g., application) can be activated on the device. It will be appreciated that, in one example, the radio system ID may comprise an ID of the device, and may be tied more to a protocol associated with the device than to a radio system of the device.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A method may be devised that provides for determining a position of a user's device when in proximity to desired locations, for example, that comprises one or more user experiences, such as mobile device applications that are interactive with the user's current environment. For example, while a global positioning system (GPS) enabled mobile device can approximate a location of the user's device, the GPS may not be able to provide enough fidelity to determine when the user is proximate to a desired location, such as an interactive kiosk, particularly when the user is located inside a building. Techniques, described herein, may provide for using two locating technologies to improve the location awareness of the device, particularly when proximate to a desired location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104"]},"At , a user-experience is identified within a desired threshold of the position. For example, the user-experience can comprise the user interacting with one or more devices in proximity to the user, using their mobile device, such as a smartphone. As an illustrative example, while traveling around a city the user may approach a proximity of a museum comprising interactive kiosks. In this illustrative example, when the GPS locator in the user's mobile device indicates the user's position is within the desired threshold (e.g., near to the museum building) of the museum user-experience, the (availability of the) museum user-experience can be identified for the user (e.g., indicated on their mobile device, such as in a mapping service application).","At , a near-field radio system beacon associated with the user-experience can be activated to identify a distance of the device from the beacon, using a near-field radio system ID for the device. For example, a near-field radio system can comprise a Bluetooth system, which uses radio transmissions for securely exchanging data over relatively short distances. It will be appreciated that the techniques described herein are not merely limited to Bluetooth, and may comprise any radio system, such as wifi, RFID, wireless device communications (e.g., cordless telephones, console controllers), near-field communications, etc.","In one embodiment, the user-experience may comprise one or more beacons that transmit and receive near-field radio system signals, and can be used to detect a distance of device by detecting signal strength, for example. As an example, the user device may comprise near-field radio system communication component (e.g., a Bluetooth transmitter\/receiver) that uses a near-field radio system ID particular to the device. In this example, when the device's near-field radio system communication component is activated, the beacon can attempt to detect the signal from the device. Further, in this example, a strength of the signal can indicate a distance between the device and the beacon (e.g., a weaker signal can indicate a greater distance).","At  in the exemplary method , upon determining that the device is within a distance threshold from the beacon, the user-experience is activated on the device. For example, the user-experience can comprise an application (e.g., web-based application) that runs, at least partially, on the user's device, such as in a browser or some application with a network link (e.g., over the Internet) to a remote server comprising an application portion of the experience. As an illustrative example, the beacon can detect that the user is standing in front of (or next to) an interactive kiosk for the museum. In this illustrative example, an experience web-app can be activated on the user's mobile device (e.g., provided that such experiences are enabled and\/or authorized on the device) that allows the user to interact with the kiosk and\/or display(s) associated with the kiosk, such as to identify detailed information, perform tasks, navigate controls, etc.","Having activated the user-experience on the device, the exemplary method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202"]},"In one embodiment, the registration of the user experience may comprise registering the user-experience with an experience service, for example, that provides location information to mapping and\/or location services used by mobile devices. For example, a retail location may comprise one or more kiosks that can interact with the user's device, and the retail location may register with the experience service as a user-experience for their location. In this example, the experience service may provide the location and user-experience information to a mapping or location service, which can indicate the registered user experience for the location, such as on a mobile map on the device.","At  in the example embodiment , a near-field radio transmitter receiver, such as a Bluetooth enabled device, can be enabled in the user's device. For example, mobile devices commonly comprise Bluetooth capability, which can be enabled or disabled in the device (e.g., switched on or off). In this embodiment, the Bluetooth capability can be enabled, such that the device may be detected by another Bluetooth enabled device. For example, the shortwave radio transmissions sent out by the Bluetooth component in the user's device may be detected by another Bluetooth enabled device. In one embodiment, the user may be asked to activate the near-field radio system in their device after they associate their device with the user experience, as discussed below.","At , a location positioning system, such as a global positioning system (GPS), can be enabled in the user's device. For example, many mobile computing devices comprise GPS components that allow for identifying an approximate position of the device on Earth, using satellites. Other location positioning systems may comprise phone signal triangulation, Internet Protocol (IP) address location identification, and\/or other signal triangulation technologies (e.g., Wifi, Wimax, etc.). In this embodiment, for example, in order for the position of the user's device to be identified, the positioning system in the device needs to be enabled (e.g., turn on the GPS, or other location service for the device).","At , a near-field radio system beacon can be activated to identify devices in its vicinity. In this embodiment, the beacon's near-field radio system can comprise technology compatible with that found in the user's device, such that the two devices can send and receive near-field radio transmissions between each other. For example, the beacon can comprise a Bluetooth beacon that sends, receives, and detects Bluetooth transmissions to\/from other Bluetooth enabled devices, such as the user's device.","As an example, a museum-based user-experience can comprise a plurality of Bluetooth beacons, respectively comprising interactive kiosks that enhance a visitor's museum experience. In this example, the museum beacons may all be activated to identify devices. In another embodiment, one or more selected beacons may be activated, such as to indicate a starting point for a visitor.","At  in the example embodiment , the user with their mobile device enters an area comprising the user-experience. For example, the user may be looking for an ATM to use, such as by searching with their mobile device, and the user may enter within a desired range from the ATM. As another example, the user may be traveling and entering into and out of areas that comprise user experiences (e.g., museums, shops, points of interest), which can be indicated on their mobile device as they enter an area comprising the user-experience. In one embodiment, when the user's device enters an area comprising the user-experience, the user experience can be identified on the user's device, for example, if registered with an experience service that provides information for a device mapping application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},"In one embodiment, the position may be determined by a location key global position representation. For example, a map of the earth may be divided into quadrants or grid squares (or some other grid shape), which can respectively be assigned a location key. Further, when the map is zoomed into, the zoomed in version of the map can also be divided into quadrants or grid squares, which can respectively be assigned locations keys (e.g., which may be subsets of the higher location key for a larger quadrant). In this embodiment, for example, a position of the device can be assigned a location key (e.g., a quadrant key), which is representative of a quadrant or grid square zoomed to sufficient granularity to accommodate the experience area (e.g., five hundred square feet).","At  in the example embodiment , the device can provide the estimated position to an experience service. As an illustrative example,  is a component diagram of an example environment  where one or more techniques described herein may be implemented. In the example environment , the device  can transmit  the position estimated by the device  (e.g., using GPS, and\/or a location key) to an experience service , over a network , such as the Internet (e.g., or some other network connection between the device and the experience service). For example, the experience service may utilize a remote server, where information about user-experiences can be stored. In this example, the user-experience information can comprise location information for the user-experience (e.g., a position, and\/or a desired threshold area for the experience).","Returning to , at , the experience service can identify a user-experience within a desired threshold of the position, and return information to the device for the identified user-experience. In one embodiment, information can be returned to the device for the identified user-experience, where the user-experience information is identified from a user-experience registered with a user-experience service for an area comprising the position.","For example, as illustrated by , the experience service  may comprise a plurality of registered user-experiences, and the one or more user-experiences that can be found within a threshold area around the position of the device can be returned  to the device . In one embodiment, the threshold may vary depending on a zoom level of the mapping service display, for example, growing larger as a map is zoomed out. In another embodiment, the threshold may be set by a provider of the user-experience , by the experience service, and\/or by the mapping application on the user's device.","Returning to , in one embodiment, the information returned to the device, at , may comprise a list of one or more user-experiences available for the identified position of the device. At , the device can register for the user-experience by providing a near-field radio system identification for the device, such as via Bluetooth. For example, a Bluetooth protocol ID for the device can be provided. That is, while the description herein may, at times, indicate that a near-field radio system Bluetooth device ID and\/or the like is provided, it is understood that Bluetooth may be more indicative of a protocol, and thus the ID that is provided for the device may, in one example, relate more to a protocol than a radio system. In any event, the device is able to be identified in some manner such that a user experience can potentially be had thereon. In one embodiment, the device may request to interact with the user-experience, for example, by selecting one of the one or more user-experiences returned by the experience service for the position. In this embodiment, a response request can be sent to the device to provide its near-field radio system ID, for example, to complete the device's registration for the user-experience.","As an illustrative example, in , the device  may receive  the list of user-experiences available near its location from the experience service , and select one with which to interact. For example, a user may be looking for an ATM to use near their location, and the experience service can provide a list of ATMs within the threshold for the device's position. The user can select their desired ATM with which to register using the device  (e.g., selecting an icon UI on the mapping application on their device).","In one embodiment, for example, the user may register to use the ATM by sending  the device's Bluetooth ID (or other near-field radio ID) to a proximity service , over the network . In another embodiment, for example, the user may send a request (e.g., either to the experience service or proximity service) to register for the ATM, and may receive a response to send their Bluetooth ID to complete the registration for the ATM user-experience.","In another example, the user may be in a location that comprises a plurality of console-type devices (e.g., console games, media provider consoles, etc.) distributed around the location (e.g., in different rooms of a house, hotel, convention, etc.), where the respective devices are linked to a monitor (e.g., television). In this example, the experience service  may provide a list of consoles in the area, and the user can select their desired console, such as one that has desired content or linked to particular monitor, and send their device's Bluetooth ID to the proximity service .","Returning to , at , the device's near-field radio ID, such as the Bluetooth ID, can be provided to the beacon for the user-experience. As described above in , the near-field beacon can be activated for the user experience. Further, as illustrated in , the proximity service  can communicate  with a beacon  for the user-experience to provide the Bluetooth ID provided for the user's device . In one embodiment, activating the beacon can comprise sending the near-field radio system ID for the device to the beacon. For example, the beacon  may not be activated until a near-field radio system ID is sent to the beacon , thereby activating it to find the device  comprising the ID. In another example, the beacon may be activated and may attempt to connect with the device. That is, the beacon may be activated and the device may merely be in a sleep, idle, listening, etc. mode, for example. When the device receives or \u201chears\u201d a signal or request from the beacon, the device can then (wake-up and) transmit a response back to the beacon comprising the ID of the device. That is, rather than the device being more of the initiating component as may, at times, be provided herein, the device can (at least initially) be more passive with the beacon being more of an initiation component (e.g., initiating communications, dialog, etc. between the device and the beacon). In another example, the subsequent (higher fidelity) device location determination can be activated based upon a relative distance between a GPS position of the device and a GPS position of a beacon. For example, both the device and a beacon may be equipped with GPS and the respective GPS determined locations of the device and beacon can be can be examined to determine whether to activate, trigger, turn-on, etc. the secondary (e.g., Bluetooth) determination of the distance between the device and the beacon (e.g., to ultimately determine whether to activate one or more user experiences on the device). For example, the subsequent (e.g., Bluetooth) distance determination\/verification may be warranted if there is sufficient overlap between the respective GPS determined locations of the device and the beacon (e.g., indicating that the user may potentially be \u201cwithin range\u201d of one or more available user experiences).","In one embodiment, an application can be activated for the user-experience that guides the user of the device to a desired distance from the beacon. For example, the museum that utilizes one or more beacons as interactive kiosks for the user-experience may use a first kiosk where the user can begin a tour of the museum. In this embodiment, for example, a mapping application on the user's device may employ an icon on the map, and\/or directions, to guide the user to the first kiosk.","In one embodiment, a beacon locating application can be activated on the device, such as when activating the near-field radio system beacon, that directs the user of the device to the distance threshold from the beacon. For example, in , when the proximity service  sends  the near-field radio ID of the device to activate the beacon , the proximity service  may communicate  with the user-experience provider  to activate the beacon locating application on the user's device, such as over the network . For example, the user may be linked to the experience provider , such as by previously downloading an application to their device  in order to utilize the user-experience. In this embodiment, for example, the application downloaded to the device  can be activated to help the user find the beacon .","Returning to , at , the beacon activated with the device's ID can search for the device. For example, the near-field radio system typically has a limited range of detection\/communication (e.g., up to three-hundred feet). In this example, the range of the near-field radio system can overlap the approximate error of the location position system, such that an up to eighty foot error of the GPS is overlapped by the up to three-hundred foot range of the Bluetooth. Further, as described above, an application on the device can help the user move toward the beacon, for example, to improve detection potential.","At , the beacon can detect the device, such as by detecting a signal sent from the near-field radio component in the device broadcasting its ID, and a distance between the device and the beacon can be identified and reported. In one embodiment, identifying the distance of the device from the beacon can comprise measuring a time of response from a sending of a ping from the beacon to the device. For example, upon detection of the device ID, the beacon can ping the device and measure a response time. In another embodiment, identifying the distance of the device from the beacon can comprise measuring a signal strength of the near-field radio system from the device. For example, the strength of the radio transmission from the device can be determined by the beacon to identify a distance.","As an illustrative example, in , the beacon  can detect the signal  from the user's device , and the distance between the device and beacon can be reported back  to the proximity service . In this example, the proximity service  can report the distance to the user-experience provider , which it turn may update the application running on the user's device  that is directing the user toward the beacon .","Returning to , at , when the distance between the device and the beacon meets a desired distance threshold, the user-experience can be activated on the user's device. In one embodiment, the distance threshold may be set according to the user-experience. For example, in a museum, store, or kiosk user-experience, the user may need to be within approximately five feet of the kiosk in order to appreciate the experience provided (e.g., an interactive display, a viewing area, an audio area, products, information, etc.). As another example, when using an ATM or similar dispensing device the user may wish to be closer in order to receive their money, and\/or for security purposes. As another example, when using a console-type device linked to a monitor, the user may merely need to be within viewing distance of the monitor (e.g., ten to twenty feet) to employ to the user experience.","Further, as an illustrative example, the activation of the user-experience may comprise different things for different experiences. For example, when using the ATM, the user may employ a secure application on the device to communicate with the ATM to perform a transaction, thereby mitigating a need to actually enter information into the ATM (e.g., only use the device to perform the transaction). In this way, in this example, the user-experience is merely activated when the user device with the correct ID comes within the desired proximity of the ATM (e.g., enters appropriate security information into the ATM via the device). As another example, when the console comprises the user-experience, an application may activate on the user's device that allows the user to interact with the console (e.g., like a remote control).","At  in the example embodiment , the user-experience is deactivated when the user's device is outside the distance threshold. In this embodiment, the user-experience can be deactivated on the user's device upon the device moving outside of the distance threshold from the beacon. For example, once the user moves away from the beacon (e.g., kiosk, ATM, console, etc.), the user-experience can be ended, such as by closing the interactive program on the device. In one embodiment, the application on the user device, and\/or the kiosk, may provide a warning to the user when they approach the position threshold boundary. For example, this may provide notice to the user that the user experience will be terminated if they proceed outside of the boundary. As an example, the deactivation can provide security for sensitive transactions (e.g., ATM), and mitigate unnecessary use of the kiosk, console, etc., when the user leaves the area.","In one embodiment, at least three beacons may be activated so that a beacon triangulated position of the device may be identified. For example, the position of the device (e.g., determined by GPS) can comprise an approximate position of the device (e.g., thirty to eighty feet approximation), such as on a map, and the beacon may determine a distance from the beacon (e.g., by detecting signal strength). In this embodiment, for example, three beacons in different location can respectively identify a distance to the device, thereby triangulating a position of the device with a greater degree of fidelity (e.g., accuracy, precision, etc.).","As an example, GPS systems are typically not well equipped to identify a location of the device inside a building, due to line of site limitations of the satellites. In this example, beacons strategically located throughout a building may be able to track movements of the device throughout the building, as well as on different levels (e.g., floors). Further, for example, the mapping application may provide markers on the map indicating a location of beacons, points of interest, etc., relative to the user's position.","A system may be devised that can identify a more accurate location of a user's device, for example, while mitigating location spoofing of a user's device. For example, user experiences that may be accessed on a user's mobile device (e.g., via one or more applications) can be interactive with regard to the user's current environment. Further, GPS data that may approximate a location of the user's device may not provide enough fidelity for the user-experience, and may also be able to be spoofed (e.g., purposely provide false information). Systems, described herein, can utilize two locating technologies to improve the location awareness and mitigate location spoofing for user-experiences. Spoofing can be made more difficult and thus potentially less likely to occur, for example, by implementing low power-short range radio signals (e.g., via Bluetooth), at least with regard to making a second higher fidelity, resolution, granularity, etc. device location determination.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","504","552","550","552","550","550","504"]},"A beacon activation component  is operably coupled with the processor, and is configured to activate a near-field radio system beacon  that is associated with the user-experience .
