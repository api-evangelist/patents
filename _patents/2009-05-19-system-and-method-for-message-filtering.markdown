As is also known in the art, many of these services allow rule-based message processing to enhance messaging functionality. For example, chat services may perform text-based message processing to highlight key words in a conversion. Still further, users may add icons to messages, for example, emotions to indicate expressions, and include abbreviated expressions, for example \u201cLOL\u201d for laugh-out-loud.","In accordance with the systems, techniques, and concepts described herein, a collaborative messaging system includes a communications engine, including a plurality of message interrogators to process a message from a sender to a receiver. The plurality of message interrogators includes a message adjudicator configured to process message information and a message validator configured to allow or deny the message based upon the processed message information.","In further embodiments, the system includes one or more of the following features: based upon a comparison of the message information, the message adjudicator is further configured to modify at least a portion of the message information to a more restrictive value; based upon a comparison of the message information, the message adjudicator is further configured to modify at least a portion of the message information to a less restrictive value; the message adjudicator is further configured to define receiver classification message information to indicate a classification level of the message receiver; the message adjudicator is further configured to define sender classification message information to indicate a classification level of the message sender; the message adjudicator is further configured to define content classification message information to indicate a classification level of the message content; the message adjudicator is further configured to filter the content of the message based upon the processed message information; the message adjudicator is further configured to remove at least a portion of the content of the message; at least a portion of removed content is classified material; at least a portion of removed content is offensive material; at least a portion of the message information includes receiver classification information to indicate a classification level of the receiver, wherein the message validator is further configured to allow or deny the message based upon the receiver classification information; at least a portion of the message information includes content classification information to indicate a classification level of the message content, wherein the message validator is further configured to allow or deny the message based upon the content classification information, and; a portion of the message information includes receiver classification information to indicate a classification level of the receiver, and another portion of the message information includes content classification information to indicate a classification level of the message content, wherein the message validator is further configured to allow or deny the message based upon a comparison of the receiver classification information to the content classification information.","In another aspect, a collaborative messaging system includes a communications engine, including a plurality of message interrogators to process a message from a sender to a receiver. The plurality of message interrogators includes a message adjudicator configured to compare message information from the sender with message information obtained by the message adjudicator and to modify the message information from the sender to a more restrictive value, and a message validator configured to allow or deny the message based upon the modified message information.","In further embodiments, the system includes one or more of the following features: the message adjudicator is further configured to obtain message receiver information and the message validator is further configured to allow or deny the message based upon the obtained message receiver information, and; the message adjudicator is further configured to filter the message content based upon the modified message information.","In a further aspect, a collaborative messaging system includes a communications engine including a plurality of message interrogators to process a message from a sender to a receiver. The message includes message sender information and message content information. The plurality of message interrogators includes a message adjudicator configured to compare message information from the sender with message information obtained by the message adjudicator, the obtained message information comprising message sender information, message receiver information, and message content information, modify the message information from the sender to a more restrictive of the message sender information from the sender and the obtained message sender information and the message content information from the sender and the obtained message content information, and filter the message content based upon the modified message information and the obtained receiver information. The plurality of message interrogators includes a message validator configured to allow or deny the message based upon the modified message information and the obtained message receiver information.","In further embodiments, the system includes one or more of the following features: the message adjudicator filters the message content by removing classified material from the message content, and; the message adjudicator filters the message content by removing offensive material from the message content.","In another aspect, a collaborative messaging method includes, in a communications engine, processing a message from a sender to a receiver, the message comprising message sender information, message content, and message content information. Processing the message includes comparing message information from the sender with obtained message information, the obtained message information comprising obtained message sender information, obtained message receiver information, and obtained message content information, modifying the message information from the sender to a more restrictive value of the message sender information from the sender and the obtained message sender information, and the message content information from the sender and the obtained message content information, filtering the message content based upon the modified message information and the obtained message receiver information, and allowing or denying the message based upon the modified message information and the obtained message receiver information.","In further embodiments, the method includes one or more of the following features: modifying the message information from the sender to a less restrictive value of the message sender information from the sender and the obtained message sender information, and the message content information from the sender and the obtained message content information; the message sender information further comprises message sender classification information and the obtained message information further comprises obtained sender classification information, and further including modifying the message information to a more restrictive value of the message sender classification information and the obtained sender classification information; the message content information further includes message content classification information and the obtained message information further comprises obtained content classification information, and further including modifying the message information to a more restrictive value of the message content classification information and the obtained content classification information; the message information further includes message receiver classification information and the obtained message information further includes obtained receiver classification information, and further including modifying the message information to a more restrictive value of the message receiver classification information and the obtained receiver classification information; the message sender information further includes message sender classification information and the obtained message information further includes obtained sender classification information, and modifying the message information further includes modifying the message sender information to a more restrictive value of the message sender classification information and the obtained sender classification information; filtering the message content further includes removing classified material from the message content, and; filtering the message content further includes removing offensive material from the message content.","Conventional chat services provide rule-based processing and other message enhancement features. However, such features are limited during emergency and\/or military situations in which events rapidly unfold in unpredictable ways. For example, rule-based processing may not be able to adjust to changing or unknown environmental factors or accommodate the dynamic needs or desires of persons involved in an incident, such as joint responders, victims, eye-witnesses, etc. Therefore, although chat services offer useful and convenient messaging features, they are unable to accommodate more dynamic environments during which people must collaborate and share information with each other to mitigate the consequences of an event. This may result in inefficiencies, misinformation, poor planning, and\/or inadequate problem resolution. Worse yet, lives and property may be at stake, as people fail to mitigate the consequences of an event.","The inventive concepts described herein enable message filtering based on message sender, receiver, and\/or message content information. Such information may be provided by users who collaborate and share information with other users. In one embodiment, the information is pre-configured, such as by administrators with special access privileges. In the same or different embodiment, the information is automatically generated.","In one embodiment, a message adjudicator processes the message information and content, including comparing, modifying, and filtering the information and content based on obtained information from other sources. Still further, a message validator allows or denies messages, which may be based on the processed message information, such as the result of a classification service. Other message interrogators can perform other functions to support collaboration and sharing of information, such as message archiving and\/or message event handling.","Advantageously, the inventive concepts provide advanced message filtering to meet the demands of dynamic environments. Persons who work together to mitigate the consequences of an event (e.g. a natural disaster, terrorist event, etc.) and\/or accomplish a task-at-hand (e.g. military operations, business processes, organizational functions, etc.) can use the inventive concepts to process, modify, and\/or validate messages based on dynamic information, as may be supplied by message senders and\/or message receivers, pre-configured, automatically-generated, and obtained from other sources of a collaborative and information sharing environment.","Referring to , a collaborative messaging system  includes a communications engine  including a plurality of message interrogators (generated denoted by reference numeral ) to process a message  from a sender  to a receiver . In one embodiment, the sender  sends the message  over a network  to the communications engine . The network  includes, but is not limited to, the Internet or an intranet. In a further embodiment, the communications engine  sends the processed message  to the receiver  over network , which is the same as network .","In another embodiment, network  is different than network . For example, network  may be an organization's intranet for receiving the message  from the sender  who is an authorized member of the organization. The communications engine  processes the message  and sends the processed message  to the receiver  over network , which is a public network, such as the Internet.","The message  includes message information  including message sender information  and\/or message content information . In a further embodiment, the message information  includes message receiver information . The message  also includes message content . In one embodiment, the message content  is text-based . In the same or different embodiment, the message content  is video-based and\/or audio-based and\/or a combination thereof.","In one embodiment, the sender  inputs at least a portion of the message  using a client device including, but not limited to, a mobile device (or other handheld device), a laptop computer, or a desktop computer. The sender  may use a user interface enabled on the client device to input the message content  and\/or message information . In one exemplary application, the user interface is implemented in a windowing system supported by an operating system such as Microsoft Windows\u2122 manufactured by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","For example, the sender  may use one or more user interface text input boxes and\/or item selection lists and input hardware such as a mouse, keyboard, tablet, pointer, etc., to compose and review a text message (i.e. message content ) and message information , such as a classification level of the sender  and\/or a classification level of the message content  and\/or a classification level of the receiver . Generally, classification level of a person (i.e. a sender  and\/or a receiver ) refers to that person's privileges to view and access information. With regard to content, classification level refers to the required classification of a person to view and access the content. It should be noted that the message information  is not limited classification levels, but includes other kinds of message information , such as message priority level, message reliability, descriptive information related to objects at the scene of an incident, such as automobile in a multi-vehicle crash, etc.","The sender  may use a user interface submit button to send the message  to the communications engine . Alternatively, or in a addition to the submit button, the sender  may use a hardware button on the client device to send the message , such as a toggle button or wheel button on a side of the client device. It should be also noted that the message content  and message information  may inputted in other ways, such as using a keypad on a telephonic device, an audio\/video recorder, a camera, or a combination thereof.","Applications using the inventive concepts will now be described in more detail. In one example law enforcement application, the sender , who is a law enforcement official, uses the collaborative messaging system  to send text-messages related to a hit-and-run accident involving a hit-and-run vehicle and an injured party. The sender  composes a first text message including message content  related to the accident. A first eye witness informs the law enforcement official that the hit-and-run vehicle was a white Cadillac and the law enforcement official adds this information to the first message. However, because the first eye witness only had a glimpse of the vehicle, the law enforcement official adds message reliability information to the first message to indicate that the reported hit-and-run vehicle make and color are unreliable. The law enforcement official sends the first message to the receiver  who is a dispatcher.","A second eye witness who had a more extensive look at the hit-and-run vehicle informs the law enforcement official that the vehicle was light blue and had an unpainted left-rear door. The law enforcement official composes a second message with the updated information and indicates that the message information is highly reliable, and sends the second message.","In the same or different embodiment, the message information  is preconfigured and\/or automatically generated. For example, in one embodiment, an administrator of the collaborative message system  pre-configures message information  on the client device prior to use. For example, the administrator may pre-configure message information  to indicate the trustworthiness of the sender . For example, in one application, the sender  is a private party volunteer enlisted to assist in military operations (e.g., a local resident enlisted to provide information on enemy troop sightings, targets, etc.).","Here, before providing the client device to the private party volunteer for use with the collaborative messaging system, the administrator pre-configures the trustworthiness information on the client device to a low value to indicate that messages sent on the client device are not very trustworthy. When the private party volunteer  sends a message  on the client device, the trustworthiness information is automatically sent with the message . For example, the trustworthiness information may be stored in a memory on the client device and automatically loaded and appended to the message . In one embodiment, at least a portion of the message information , such as the trustworthiness information, is saved in a protected memory inaccessible to the sender . Still further, the trustworthiness information may be re-configured to a higher value, for example, when the private party volunteer proves to be trustworthy over time.","In still another embodiment, the message information  is automatically generated. For example, the client device may incorporate a geographic positioning chip that automatically generates the sender's geographic position and appends it to the message .","Referring again to , the plurality of message interrogators  includes, but is not limited to, a message adjudicator configured to process message information  and a message validator configured to allow or deny the message  based upon the processed message information. Referring to , in which like elements with  are shown with like reference numerals, in one embodiment, the message adjudicator processes message content and message information of a message  (), obtains message information (), compares the message information to the obtained message information and modifies the message information ().","Referring again to , in a non-limiting application that uses an embodiment of the collaborative message system for responding to terrorist threats, the message adjudicator compares the message information  from the sender  related to a threat level to obtained message information related to the threat level. In one embodiment, the message adjudicator obtains the threat level from a military command-and-control system external to the communications engine . For example, the communications engine  may request the threat level information from the military command-and-control system over a network. The request may be in the form of a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) request, although other request formats may be used. In response, the military command-and-control system processes the request and sends information back to message adjudicator Such responses include information (i.e. the obtained information) which in one embodiment is one or more data packets, bit streams, data files, such as an extensible markup language (XML) file, or a combination thereof.","In some instances, the threat levels may not match. For example, the threat level from the sender  may be higher than the obtained treat level, as may be the case when the sender  mischaracterizes the threat level due to out-dated information. Here, the message adjudicator modifies the threat level to the obtained threat level. In the same or different embodiment, the sender  is a joint commander with the authority to change the threat level (e.g. the joint commander may raise or lower the threat level due to the joint commander's observations in the field). In such an instance, the message adjudicator does not modify the threat level; rather, the message adjudicator updates the external system with the joint commander's indicated threat level.","Referring now to , in one embodiment, the message adjudicator obtains message information from adjudication services  and\/or classification services . In one embodiment, the adjudication services  and\/or classification services  are external to the collaborative messaging system  and are accessed over a network . In an example application, the message adjudicator obtains message information  related to the message content  from the adjudication services . For example, the obtained message information can include contextual information such as medical information related to medical terms identified within the message content . The obtained message information may include priority information rendered by the adjudications services , which in turn may have obtained the priority information from other external sources. The priority information may be appended to the message information . Still further, obtained message information may include corrections used to modify the message information . For example, the message information  may include mischaracterized descriptive information related to a residential address. In one embodiment, the descriptive information is sent to the adjudication services , which determines whether the descriptive information is correct and, if not, updates the descriptive information.","In another example application, the message adjudicator obtains classification levels related to the sender  from the classification services . The classification services  may execute on servers within protected military networks. Advantageously, the protected classification services  provide security, centralized control, and transparency to the collaborative message system .","In a further embodiment, the message adjudicator filters the message content  based upon the modified message information (). In one embodiment, the message adjudicator filters classified information from the message content . For example, based upon an obtained classification level of the receiver  (e.g., as obtained from the classification services ), the message adjudicator filters message content  before the communications engine  sends it to the receiver . For example, the message adjudicator may remove classified names and\/or classified meeting locations from the message content  before sending it to the receiver .","In still another embodiment, the message adjudicator filters message content  considered too sensitive for the receiver . For example, the message adjudicator may implement age-based filtering by removing or blocking out message content  considered inappropriate for receiver . For example, the message adjudicator may remove foul language, sexually-explicit language, violent language, etc. from message content  before sending it to a thirteen year old receiver.","The message adjudicator sends a modified message  to receiver  or forwards the modified message  to one or more other message interrogators , such as the message validator (). Referring now to , in which like elements with  are shown with like reference numerals, in one embodiment, the message validator processes the modified message information () forwarded by one of the plurality of message interrogators  (e.g. the message adjudicator ) and allows or denies the message based upon the modified message information (). In one embodiment, the message validator allows the message and sends the message to the receiver  or to another one of the plurality of message interrogators  (). In the same or different embodiment, the message validator denies the message and sends an error message to the sender ().","It should be noted that the communications engine  may include other message interrogators. As a non-limiting example, another one of the plurality of message interrogators  includes a message archiver that archives messages  related to an incident, such as the release of a bio-agent. Here, the message archiver collects messages  and stores them along with date\/time. This may be used to \u201cplayback\u201d messages related to an event for training purposes and\/or to derive\/modify procedures for mitigating the consequences of the event.","Referring now to , an exemplary environment  incorporating the inventive concepts includes a collaborative messaging server which in one embodiment is a server extension to an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) server . As is well known in the art, XMPP is an open, extensible markup language (XML) based protocol used in conjunction with instant messaging (IM), including presence information for IM, such as buddy lists. It should be noted that the collaborative messaging server may be a server extension for use with other protocol servers, such as a Voice-Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) server, as well as services such as AOL Instant Messenger\u2122, and MSN Messenger. The collaborative messaging server may be used to dynamically generate user contacts for a radio gateway system. In such a system, users communicate with each other using radio devices, such as walkie-talkies, in contact with one or more radio base stations.","The XMPP server  may be extended, for example, by using an XMPP application programming interface (API) , which includes capabilities to add functionality to core XMPP services. The XMPP server  further communicates with external clients  including commercial off-the-shelf components such as Pidgin, a multi-platform IM client. Further, the XMPP Server  may access a lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) (not shown) for querying and modifying directory services.","The collaborative message server includes a collaborative messaging system, as may be like the collaborative messaging system  described in conjunction with . The collaborative messaging system includes message filtering functionality, as may be similar to message interrogators  described in conjunction with . Clients , such as domain applications mobile clients and web applications use a collaborative messaging API to extend and\/or customize collaborative messaging system functionality. Clients , such as client may be similar to sender  and\/or receiver , described in conjunction with in .","In one application of the exemplary environment , domain application clients use the collaborative messaging API to customize the collaborative messaging server to add descriptive information to message information, as may be similar to message information  described in conjunction with . For example, domain application clients  a may add descriptive information related to reliability and\/or trustworthiness of the message information. In still other applications, web application clients use the collaborative messaging API to customize the collaborative messaging server to add information sources such as databases. This allows the collaborative messaging server to access the databases for contextual purposes. For example, a web application administrator client may add a database comprising predefined automobile information for manufactures, models, years, and other features that clients  use to input\/specify automobile information.","The collaborative messaging server uses external services  to render a broad array of functionality. For example, in one embodiment, the collaborative messaging server uses classifications services to obtain classification level information pertaining to message content, as well as senders and receivers. Such information may be used to filter at least a portion of the messages, for example, by removing classified materials and\/or sensitive materials within the message content.","In the same or different embodiment, the collaborative messaging server uses a geocoding engine to obtain geospatial information, such as a sender's and\/or a receiver's position. Such information may be used to filter the message, for example, by comparing the sender's inputted location to the sender's location obtained from the geocoding engine. In one example application, the collaborative message server modifies the inputted sender location with the obtained sender location, as may be useful when the sender input's inaccurate location information, for example, because the sender is lost or in unfamiliar surroundings.","The collaborative messaging server uses adjudication services to process message content and message information. For example, the adjudication services may update message information entered by a sender with more restrictive values.","It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the collaborative messaging server and collaborative message API can function across multiple servers, such as a plurality of XMPP servers .","Referring now to , in a further embodiment, a message  of the type which may be used by collaborative message system  described in conjunction with , includes message information  and message content . The message information  includes message sender information  related to a sender of the message , as may be similar to sender  described in conjunction with , and content information  related to message content , as may be similar to message content  described in conjunction with . In a further embodiment, the message information  includes receiver information  related to a receiver of the message , as may be similar to receiver  described in conjunction with .","In one embodiment, the message sender information  includes a message sender identifier a message sender role and\/or a message sender classification level The message sender identifier is a unique identifier for the sender. For illustrative purposes only, the message sender identifier in  equals \u201c001.\u201d Example embodiments of the message sender identifier include, but are not limited to, a number generated by a random-number generator or a primary key generated by a database management system. For one or both of these embodiments, the message sender identifier is generated on a server and sent to a client device, as may be similar to the client devices described in conjunction with , during client device configuration and\/or initialization. The message sender identifier may be used by the collaborative messaging system to identify the message sender and confirm the message sender's credentials, including the message sender's classification level as will be described in more detail below.","The message sender role identifies the role of the sender, for example, a first responder of an incident, a member of a medical team caring for victims of an accident, a law enforcement officer, a joint commander in the field, etc. For illustrative purposes only, the message sender role in  is \u201cBase command,\u201d indicating that the sender is the commander of a military base to support military operations. The collaborative messaging system may use message sender role to determine message processing functions, such as those performed by one or more of the message interrogators (e.g., message adjudicator described in conjunction with ). For example, a message adjudicator may process message information  for a message  sent by an emergency medical team member to add medical terminology and treatments.","The message sender classification level identifies the classification level of the sender. In one embodiment, the collaborative message system includes three classification levels: high; medium; and low. For illustrative purposes only and according to this embodiment, the message sender classification level in  equals \u201chigh\u201d, indicating that the sender has a high classification level. In another embodiment, the collaborative message system uses number rankings from high to low or low to high to indicate the classification levels, such as 1\u22124 where 1 indicates the highest classification level, and 4 the lowest.","The collaborative messaging system uses the classification levels to modify message content  and\/or message information  and\/or allow or deny messages  to message receivers which may or may not be viewable by the message receivers without the proper classification level. For example, the message sender may have a high classification level. The message sender may send a message  to a receiver with a low classification level. Here, the communications engine (i.e., one of the included message interrogators such as the message validator described in conjunction with ) may deny the message  to the receiver because the receiver's classification level is too low. In another example, the communications engine may filter at least a portion of the message content , such as that portion deemed too classified for the receiver based upon the receiver's classification level.","In one embodiment, the message content information  includes keywords and\/or a content classification level The keywords identify important concepts and references within the message content , such as topics of communications, names of persons, locations, hazardous materials, etc. For illustrative purposes only, the keywords in  include \u201ccomm. channel\u201d and \u201ctarget.\u201d Comm. channel may indicate a communications channel for senders and\/or receivers to use during communications. Target may indicate an intended target.","The keywords may be used to modify message information . For example, the communications engine may include a message interrogator that searches for names of persons in a criminal database. If a person is found in the criminal database, the message interrogator may add information related to the person to the message information . This may assist message receivers, for example, by helping receivers to positively identify and apprehend the person during street patrols.","The content classification level c identifies the classification level of a message . For illustrative purposes only, the content classification level in  equals \u201cmedium.\u201d In one embodiment, the sender identifies an appropriate content classification level based upon the sender's assessment of the message content  and\/or message information . For example, for the above mentioned message content related to the communications channel and the target (as indicated by keywords ) the sender sets the content classification level to medium, because the communications engine should not forward such information to senders and\/or receivers with a low classification level.","The communications engine uses the content classification level to determine whether the message  should be sent to the message receiver. For example, one of the message interrogators, such as the message validator described in conjunction with , may compare the content classification level with a message receiver classification level and, based upon the comparison, allow or deny the message . For example, if the content classification level is low and the receiver classification level is high, then the message validator allows the message  to be sent to the receiver.","In a further embodiment, the message receiver information  includes information related to one or more receivers  of the message . For example, message receiver information  related to a first receiver hereinafter referred to as RECEIVER , includes a message receiver identifier, a message receiver role, and\/or a message receiver classification level. The message receiver information may further include information related to a second receiver hereinafter referred to as RECEIVER , and a third receiver hereinafter referred to as RECEIVER .","In one embodiment, the message receiver identifiers are unique identifiers for each of the receivers. For illustrative purposes only, the message receiver identifiers in  are \u201c002\u201d, \u201c003\u201d, and \u201c004\u201d for respective RECEIVER , RECEIVER , and RECEIVER . The message receiver identifies have similar function to the message sender identifier. For example, the communications engine may use the message receiver identifiers to track messages intended for the receivers.","The message receiver roles identify the role of each of the message receivers. For illustrative purposes only, the message receiver roles in  are \u201cSpecial ops\u201d, \u201cAir support\u201d, and \u201cResupply\u201d for respective RECEIVER , RECEIVER , and RECEIVER . The message receiver roles have similar function to the message sender role. For example, the communications engine may use the message receiver roles to modify messages, such as by appending role-related information to the message .","In one embodiment, the message receiver classification levels are classification levels for each of the receivers. For illustrative purposes only, the message receiver classification levels in  are \u201cmedium\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, and \u201clow\u201d for respective RECEIVER , RECEIVER , and RECEIVER . In a further embodiment, the sender identifies an appropriate message receiver classification level based upon the sender's assessment of the message receiver's classification level. For example, for the above mentioned message content related to the communications channel and the target (as indicated by keywords ) for which the sender set the content classification level to medium, the sender may set the classification levels for RECEIVER  and RECEIVER  to medium, since Special Operations and Air support should receive such information, but sets the classification level for RECEIVER  to low, since Resupply does not need such information.","In one or more of the aforementioned embodiments, the sender inputs the message information  using, for example, a user interface and\/or a client device button, as may be similar to those described above with reference to . Still further, at least a portion of the message information  is automatically generated and\/or preconfigured.","Referring now to , in one aspect, the inventive concepts described herein include a collaborative messaging method  including, in a communications engine , processing a message  from a sender  to a receiver  (step ), the message  including message information  and message content  and allowing or denying the message  (step ). Processing the message (step ) further includes, in one of a plurality of message interrogators , obtaining message information  (step ), comparing the obtained message information  to the message information  (step ), modifying the message information  to arrive at modified message information \u2032 (step ), and filtering the message content  based upon the modified message information \u2032 (step ). The method  includes continuing to the next message interrogator (step ).","The method  further includes, in another one of the plurality of message interrogators , allowing or denying the message  (step ) including processing the modified message information \u2032 (step ), allowing or denying the message  (step ) based upon modified message information \u2032, and optionally, continuing to a next message interrogator  (step ). If no other message interrogator  exists, then the method  may include sending the message  to the receiver .","Outside of the communications engine , the sender  may compose the message  on a client device using a user interface, as may be similar to the user interface described in conjunction with . The sender  inputs message information  and\/or at least a portion of the message information  is pre-configured or automatically generated, as may be similar to pre-configured or automatically generated information described above in conjunction with . The sender  submits the message to the communications engine , where the message  is processed (step ) and allowed or denied (step ), as will be described below in more detail. In a further embodiment, the message  is sent over a network , such as the Internet or an intranet.","In one embodiment, obtaining message information (step ) includes receiving message information from external services , as may include classification services  and\/or adjudication services  and as may be similar to classification services and adjudication services described in conjunction with . In a further embodiment, obtaining message information includes issuing a request for message information to the external services  and receiving the message information from the external services  in response to the request. The request may be sent over a network . In a further embodiment, the obtained message information  includes obtained sender information and\/or obtained content information and\/or obtained receiver information to be used when comparing the message information (step ).","In another embodiment, comparing the message information (step ) includes comparing message sender information with obtained sender information and\/or comparing message content information with obtained content information and\/or comparing message receiver information with obtained receiver information. For example, such comparisons may be used in step  to modify message information to more and\/or less restrictive values. In one example, a message sender classification level is compared with an obtained sender classification level, and the message information is modified (step ) to the more restrictive (i.e. the higher classification level) of the two values. This may useful to rectify any errors in the sender's  input of classification levels. For example, the sender  may incorrectly input a content classification level of \u201clow.\u201d After receiving the obtained content classification level of \u201chigh\u201d from the classification services , the message content classification level may be modified from low to high. The classification services may determine the correct content classification level by receiving at least a portion of the message content  from the communications engine (according to a further embodiment of the method ) and reviewing the message content  according to various search parameters to flag any classified material, such as designated targets, friendly troop positions, platoon advancement plans, etc.","In another example, the obtained receiver classification level is lower than the message receiver classification level sent by the sender . In such an instance, the message receiver classification level may be lowered. As with the content classification example above, this may be useful to rectify any errors in the sender's inputted message receiver classification level. Still further, the sender  may not have supplied any message receiver classification level, in which case the communications engine uses the obtained receive classification level from the classification services  to set the receiver classification level. This reduces the burden on the sender  by eliminating the need for the sender  to remember and input the receiver's classification level. It also provides more secure control over classification levels and prevents any attempts to supply classified information to receivers who should not receive it, for example, because their clearance is too low.","In a further embodiment, filtering the message content (step ) includes modifying at least a portion of the message content  based upon the modified message information \u2032. For example, the message content  may include descriptive information related to an automobile driven by a suspect in a crime. The message information  may include reliability information sent along with the descriptive information. The reliability information may be low, because of the low credibility of an eye-witness supplying the descriptive information (as assessed by the sender  who is a police detective). Because of the low reliability of the descriptive information, the message content  may be modified to include inputted descriptive information from prior more reliable eye-witness reports, as well as more accurate automobile information from an automobile database, such as corrected year of manufacture based upon the make and model of the automobile.","In another example, the message content  is filtered by removing at least a portion of the message content . For example, message content  may include \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, and \u201cC.\u201d The obtained message information indicates that \u201cC\u201d is highly classified, and \u201cC\u201d is removed from the message content .","It should be noted that the method  may perform steps , , ,  in an order other than those described or implied above. For example, message information may be obtained after message information is compared, since such the comparison may determine which information should be obtained. Still further, any one of the steps may be repeated, for example, message information may be compared in step , modified in step , and compared again in step .","In one embodiment, allowing or denying the message  (step ) includes processing modified message information \u2032 to determine whether the message  should be allowed or denied (i.e. sent or not sent to the receiver ). For example, the message content classification level may be compared with the message receiver classification level to determine whether the receiver  has the appropriate clearance to receive the message .

In yet another embodiment, if the outcome is to deny the message , an error message  is produced. For example, in one embodiment, the sender  receives an error message  that the message  was not sent. Such an error message may include an explanation of why the message  was not sent, as may be produced by another one of the message interrogators .","In still a further embodiment, the receiver  receives a message that the sender  attempted to send a message, but that it did not go through.
