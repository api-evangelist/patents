In general, exemplary functional groups include hydrocarbons, groups containing halogen, groups containing oxygen, groups containing nitrogen and groups containing sulfur all identifiable by a skilled person. In particular, exemplary functional groups in the sense of the present disclosure comprise alkoxy or alkyl groups, secondary amines, amides and additional functional groups can be identified by a skilled person upon reading of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the monofunctional benzothiazole can be substituted in any positions, wherein the terms \u201csubstituted\u201d or \u201csubstitution\u201d herein indicates replacement of one or more hydrogens with chemical groups that do not substantially interfere with the characteristic chemical interactions or reactions of the functional group as described herein.","In some embodiments, methods and systems are described to provide the precursor with methods starting from a monofunctional benzothiazole attaching in position C2 a functional group of formula (I) (C(\u2550X)NH) wherein Xis O or S, wherein the amide in the functional group of formula (I) is converted to a cyanide group by elimination of a HXcompound.","The term \u201camide\u201d as used herein indicates an organic compound that contains the carbonyl group (R\u2014C\u2550O) linked to a nitrogen atom (N) (herein also carboxamide) or a thiamide group R\u2014CS\u2014NR\u2032R, where R, R\u2032, and Rare same or different and are organic groups with R\u2032 and Rpossibly formed by H.

Typically thioamides are analogous to carboxamides but they exhibit greater multiple bond character along the C\u2014N bond, resulting in a larger rotational barrier. Thioamides are typically prepared by treating amides with phosphorus sulfides such as phosphorus pentasulfide and, in more specialized applications, Lawesson's reagent. An alternative route entails the reaction of nitriles with hydrogen sulfide. The Willgerodt-Kindler reaction also affords benzylthioamides.","The terms \u201celiminate\u201d and \u201celimination reaction\u201d as used herein with reference to a reaction indicate an elimination reaction. An elimination reaction is a type of organic reaction in which two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one or two-step mechanism (E2 and E1 mechanisms, respectively). Either the unsaturation of the molecule increases or the valence of an atom in the molecule decreases by two. E1 mechanism: generally follows the following form: the first step requires the loss of the leaving group, forming a carbocation intermediate. A nucleophilic species, usually a base, then attacks a neighboring hydrogen forming the double bond. E2 mechanism generally follows the following form: a nucleophilic species or base attacks a hydrogen neighboring the leaving group, pushing the electrons into the double bond as the leaving group leaves. In elimination reactions herein described does not necessarily result in an actual production of an HXproduct, as long as the HXcompound is removed from the starting compound. In this connection for example, in embodiments where Xis oxygen and a POClreagent is used the oxygen atom is eventually attached to phosphorus. Exemplary elimination reactions comprise dehydration and dehydrosulfurization. A dehydration reaction is usually defined as a chemical reaction that involves the loss of water from the reacting molecule. Dehydration reactions are a subset of elimination reactions where the leaving group is water (HO). Dehydrosulfurization reactions or HS elimination reactions are another subset of elimination reaction where the leaving group is (HS).","In some embodiments, in the functional group of formula (I) Xis S, the conversion from thioamide to CN group can be performed by dehydrosulfurization directed to elimination the HS compound.

In some embodiments, the benzothiazole presenting the functional group of formula (I) in position C2 is modified to comprise an amino group in position C6. In particular in some of those embodiments, a nitrile group is first introduced in position C6 before or after converting the functional group of formula (I) to a CN group. The nitrile group in C6 of the benzothiazole is then converted to an amino group. A skilled person will be able to identify suitable methods to introduce an NO2 group in monofunctional benzothiazoles herein described at any stage of the procedures. For example, typical nitrations use nitric acid and sulfuric acid to produces the nitronium ion (NO), which is the active species of nitration reactions and attacks the electron-rich reactant, such as a benzene ring, to initiate electrophilic substitution reaction.","In some embodiments, an NH2 is introduced directly into the C6 position of the benzothiazole ring. A skilled reader will be able to identify suitable reaction for introducing an NH2 group directly in monofunctional benzothiazoles herein described at any stage of the procedures herein described.","In some embodiments, the functional group of formula (I) can be provided in the monofunctional benzothiazole herein described starting from a monofunctional benzothiazole attaching in position C2 a functional group of formula (II) (C(\u2550X)XR) wherein R is an alkyl group, or a halogen atom and Xand Xare independently O or S.","The term \u201calkyl\u201d as used herein refers to a linear, branched, or cyclic saturated hydrocarbon group typically although not necessarily containing 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, octyl, decyl, and the like, as well as cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like.

The term \u201cacid halide\u201d indicates a chemical compound that can be typically derived from an oxoacid by replacing a hydroxyl group with a halide group (i.e. a binary compound, of which one part is a halogen atom and the other part is an element or radical that is less electronegative (or more electropositive) than the halogen). Exemplary acid halides comprise (C(\u2550O)Cl) and additional halides identifiable by a skilled person. In some embodiments, the acyl halide can be treated with ammonia, and the reaction is expected to proceed faster than the reaction performed with the ester group.","In embodiments where Xis S the resulting X-R group is an alkyl group and in particular a lower alkyl group, or a halogen such as Cl. Exemplary functional groups of formula (II) comprise (C(\u2550S)OR), which can be made for example by treating the ester with PSas described in ref. 19; (C(\u2550O)SR) which can be made for example by reacting the ester with a mercaptan under basic conditions as identifiable by a skilled person; and (C(\u2550S)SR), which can be made for example by treating the chloromethylbenzothiazole with sulfur and methyl iodide, according to the procedure described in ref. 20.

In particular, in the illustration of  production of the precursor can be performed in four steps. In particular a thio or carboxy ester functional group of formula (II) can be introduced in C2 with suitable reactions. The thio or carboxy ester can then be converted into a corresponding amide which can then be converted into a nitrile. The NO2 group in C6 can then be reduced to NH2 using procedure identifiable by a skilled person. Possible variations of this reaction scheme comprise a three steps procedure performed starting from a monofunctional benzothiazole attaching an ester of formula (II), three steps procedure performed starting from a monofunctional benzothiazole attaching an amide of formula (I) and other variations wherein the reduction of the NO2 group in C6 is performed before the final reduction of the amide of formula (I) to a CN group.","In an embodiment, wherein Xis O the method can be performed as schematically illustrated in .
