{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a 371 of PCT\/FR2008\/051258 filed Jul. 7, 2008.","The invention relates in general to the analysis of lubricating oils, and in particular the determination of the fuel content of an internal combustion engine oil.","In the context of the present invention, fuel means any type of fuel used in the operation of internal combustion engines, for example gasoline, diesel, biofuels, etc.","Methods for analyzing the fuel content (in particular of diesel) in a lubricating oil are known but are not fully satisfactory because they do not rapidly yield reliable, correct and accurate results.","In this field, a chromatograph is conventionally used like the one  shown in , which comprises an injector  of the products to be analyzed, a polymer  for separating the products to be analyzed flushed by a carrier gas which facilitates the elution of the compounds, a detector  of the said products. In operation, the separating column  is traversed at different speeds by the various compounds of the products to be analyzed. The detector  is for example a flame ionization detector known to the person skilled in the art and has a flame fed with gases issuing from the device . The detector  also receives a gas transporting products to the separating column, for example hydrogen, helium or nitrogen. The detector  measures a current generated during the combustion of a compound issuing from the column . The current generated varies according to the presence or absence of a compound in the chamber. A chromatogram is generated to represent, for example, the current as a function of time.","The use of such a chromatograph, known to a person skilled in the art, for determining the proportion of fuel (in particular diesel) in a lubricating oil, serves to obtain highly accurate analytical results. However, a method using such a chromatograph has the following drawbacks: on the one hand, a too slow temperature rise of the column, and on the other hand, a too long cooling time of the same column, thereby increasing the time of occupation of the chromatograph per sample.","The Applicant has developed a device for determining the proportion of fuel in an internal combustion engine lubricating oil, which remedies these drawbacks by using a chromatograph comprising a chromatography column in a particular heating module. The Applicant has also developed a method using such a device, in which the column is subjected to predefined cycles in which the carrier gas temperature and pressure in the column are varied, and which serves to obtain results that are reliable, correct and accurate.","More particularly, the present invention relates to a device for determining the proportion of fuel in an internal combustion engine lubricating oil, the lubricating oil containing an internal standard, and the lubricating oil and the internal standard being diluted in a solvent to form a mixture to be analyzed, the device comprising a gas phase chromatograph which comprises:\n\n","According to the invention, the separating column comprises at least 22000 theoretical plates, with a stationary phase present in the separating column in the form of a film at least 0.40 microns thick, this stationary phase being suitable for separating the internal standard, the solvent, the fuel and the lubricating oil. Also according to the invention, the heating module is suitable for causing an increase in the temperature of the column at a rate of at least 350\u00b0 C.\/min.","Advantageously, the stationary phase is selected from methylpolysiloxanes.","The furnace in which the chromatography column is generally incorporated is replaced, in the inventive device, by a heating module generally located outside the furnace, which is advantageously a linear heating module which can be placed either along the column, or around it, for example in the form of a sleeve into which the column is inserted.","Such a heating module is suitable for faster increases and decreases in temperature than what is usually practiced, in particular with a chromatograph of which the separating column is a conventional furnace having a large volume, which generates high inertia in heating and in cooling, thereby causing a considerable reduction in analysis time.","Advantageously, a heating module is selected which is not only suitable for heating the column at a rate up to at least 350\u00b0 C.\/min but which is also suitable for cooling it at a cooling rate that is at least equivalent.","If the heating module advantageously consists of a tubular heating resistor into which the column is inserted, it is possible to heat the column from ambient temperature to 350\u00b0 C. at a rate of about 1000\u00b0 C.\/min.","According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the column can be associated with a cooling device such as a fan or a refrigerating unit, which allows even faster cooling of the column, and particularly cooling from 350\u00b0 C. to 30\u00b0 C., in a time of 100 seconds or less.","The carrier gas in the separating column may be helium, hydrogen or nitrogen.","However, hydrogen is preferably used as carrier gas because it serves to obtain higher efficiency in terms of product separation.","According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the separating column of the chromatograph has an inside diameter \u03a6 of 0.18 mm and a length of 10 m with a stationary phase thickness of 0.40 \u03bcm.","The present invention also relates to a method for determining the proportion of fuel in an internal combustion engine lubricating oil, using the device according to the invention. In the inventive method, the column () is subjected to a thermal cycle comprising the following successive steps:\n\n","Advantageously, the column is simultaneously subjected to a carrier gas pressure variation cycle comprising the following successive steps:\n\n","In the inventive method, the determination of the proportion of diesel in the oil comprises the following successive analytical steps:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0042"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"T","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"C","mo":"\/","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"M"}},"mo":"-","mi":"b"},"mi":"a"}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":["Where:","a and b are constants defining the equation y=ax+b of a calibration line of the ratio between the second and the first parameter as a function of the proportion of diesel."]}}}},"Advantageously, the second parameter C may be representative of the area of least one peak of the chromatogram associated with a C, C, C, C, Cor Chydrocarbon compound, or of their sum total.","It may also be possible to previously calculate an approximation of the diesel content, by taking account of a second parameter which is only a function of the peak of the Chydrocarbon compound. Depending on this approximation, one can then determine the peaks of the hydrocarbon compounds taken into account in parameter C, to calculate the diesel content. The number of peaks taken into account can thus be a function of the calculated approximation.","Advantageously, the second parameter may be representative of the area of several peaks associated with respective compounds selected from a group of (C-C) hydrocarbon compounds.","In order to take account of a relative area of the various compounds for various chromatographic conditions, the coefficient C is advantageously corrected to bring the concentration of the internal standard compound (C5) to a desired value. C may in particular be determined by the following formula:\n\n\n\n","The mixture formed may further comprise a predefined proportion of carbon disulfide CS. The carbon disulfide has the function of diluting the mixture of oil and Chydrocarbon compound in order to mix them uniformly and to have a liquid and fluid medium which can be separated more easily. Furthermore, the carbon disulfide CSis advantageously invisible to the detector, even in large quantities. The carbon disulfide therefore does not disturb the detection of diesel and oil. However, other solvents may be selected, provided that their signal in the final operation can be taken into account.","The calibration line is preferably obtained previously with the same type of diesel and the same type of oil as in the sample to be analyzed, in order to maximize the final accuracy.","For the prior determination of the equation of the calibration curve, the following steps can be carried out:\n\n","The diesel content of the standard sample is denoted T0 below. For each standard mixture:\n\n","From the pairs of parameters obtained for the various mixtures obtained (which can be represented by points T0 on the x-axis and C0\/M0 on the y-axis), the constants a and b of the calibration line are determined. The constants a and b are for example obtained by using as the calibration line, the line corresponding best to the various pairs formed (T0; C0\/M0).","The chromatogram may be obtained by a flame ionization detector and in which a computation member makes integrations in order to calculate the area of each peak.","Other features and advantages of the invention will appear clearly from the description that follows, provided for information and nonlimiting, in conjunction with the appended drawings, in which:","The chromatograph of the prior art, and also its operating principle, have been described previously in the reference to the preceding prior art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","12","120"]},"By now referring to , the apparatus used for the implementation of the inventive method comprises a gas phase chromatograph fed with hydrogen (for example grade N55) and having a precise programming and control of the temperature and pressure in the column. This chromatograph comprises:\n\n","An example of the conditions of application of the inventive method, for taking measurements of the diesel content in various spent lubricating oils, is now described in detail.","For comparison, we have also taken measurements using an apparatus incorporating a chromatograph like the one shown in .
