No. 10\/356,338, entitled \u201cCONFIGURABLE NETWORK INTERFACE DEVICE AND SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ITS USE,\u201d filed Jan. 31, 2003 by Bruce A. Phillips et al., the entire disclosure of each of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.","The present invention relates to providing telecommunication services. In the past, there has been no consistent interface between telecommunication service providers' networks and their customers' premises wiring. For instance, telephone service often has been hard-wired to the customer's premises wiring by a variety of methods, rendering service calls unnecessarily complicated and intrusive. Such services calls often required service personnel to enter the customer premises, creating logistical issues for the telecommunication service provider and increasing customer frustration. Moreover, the lack of any discrete interface between the customer's premises wiring and the provider's network sometimes forced the use of proprietary hardware from the customer's perspective and limited the provider's flexibility when considering options to upgrade or otherwise modify the network.","This problem has been exacerbated by the increased number of telecommunication services provided to customer premises. For instance, many telecommunication service providers now provide xDSL service to their customers, but those skilled in the art will recognize that there is little (if any) standardization among providers. Thus, implementations vary widely, each requiring different hardware and software configurations to be operable, and customers have little flexibility in choosing hardware. For instance, ADSL service frequently is deployed differently than VDSL service, and ADSL deployments themselves can vary from provider to provider. Likewise, telephone wiring schemes can vary widely among customer premises, requiring different types of hardware to enable and enhance services, such as filters to control interference, and the like. Further, a typical customer premises has multiple wiring networks, including one for video distribution (cable, satellite, VDSL, and the like), one for data distribution (Ethernet or the like, perhaps with a connection to an xDSL modem or cable modem), and another for telephone service, and these networks generally operate independently of one another. And if a customer wants to add a new telecommunication service, an expensive service call (often including one or more new cable drops and\/or the installation of new premises wiring) likely will be required.","Given the wide variety of telecommunication information and services available in the marketplace, it would be helpful if a single provider could allow multiple information providers to initiate services to a customer premises, increasing both efficiency for the providers and ease-of-use for the customer. This proliferation of telecommunication services also has created a need for a more flexible interface between the telecommunication service provider's network and the customer's premises. Preferably, such an interface would be addressable and\/or programmable, so that the interface could quickly and easily be updated to accommodate new services and\/or technologies. There also is a need for methods for replacing such interface devices once installed so that the device's configuration, programming, and the like, may be preserved.","The present invention provides devices, systems and methods for addressing these and other problems.","Certain embodiments of the invention provide network interface devices, as well as systems and methods for using them. For instance, in accordance with some embodiments, a network interface device can comprise an isolation device, which can be configured to isolate an internal transport medium from an external transport medium, such that operational changes to the internal transport medium do not affect the external transport medium, and operational changes to the external transport medium do not affect the internal transport medium.","The network interface can also include a plurality of interfaces coupled to the isolation device. A first interface can be adapted to communicate with the external transport medium, and the external transport medium can be in communication with a distribution point, which may be associated with a telecommunication service provider and\/or a telecommunication information provider. A second interface can be in communication with the internal transport medium. In certain embodiments, the internal transport medium is in communication with one or more pieces of customer premises equipment. Other embodiments can include additional interfaces adapted to be in communication with additional external transport media and\/or internal transport media.","Merely by way of example, the network interface device may comprise a third interface coupled to the isolation device, and the third interface can be adapted to communicate with a second external transport medium as discussed above. That second transport medium can be in communication with a second distribution point and the second distribution point can be associated with a second telecommunication service provider. Alternatively, the first and second external transport media can be associated with the same telecommunication service provider. In particular embodiments, the distribution point can be associated with a telecommunication service provider, and the external transport medium can be maintained by that telecommunication service provider. In other embodiments, the internal transport medium can be maintained by a customer of the telecommunication service provider.","In accordance with other embodiments, the isolation device can be configured to mediate the flow of telecommunication information between the external transport medium and the internal transport medium. Such telecommunication information can include, merely by way of example, voice signals, Internet Protocol data, audio signals, data representing encoded audio signals, video signals and data represented encoded video signals. In still other embodiments, the network interface device can further comprise a power supply, and the power supply can receive electrical current from the external transport medium, the internal transport medium, and\/or an alternative power source.","In accordance with certain embodiments of the invention, the external transport medium and\/or the internal transport medium can include any of a variety of media, including various cables (fiber optic and\/or copper, including twisted pair and coaxial) and wireless transmissions. For instance, the external transport medium can be a telecommunications service provider's local loop and the internal transport medium can be a set of existing wiring at a customer premises. According to some embodiments, the second interface can be configured to allow the simultaneous transmission of voice signals and data signals across the transport medium. Thus, the second interface can be selected from the group consisting of an Ethernet interface, an RJ11 interface, a coaxial cable interface, a universal serial bus interface and a fiber optic interface. In certain aspects, the isolation device can incorporate the functionality of the first interface and\/or the second interface.","In some cases, the external transport medium can be capable of transmitting both voice signals and data, and the network interface device can comprise a discrimination device for separating the voice signals from data. In a particular embodiment, the isolation device can incorporate the functionality of the discrimination device. In other embodiments, the network interface device can comprise a processing system in communication with the isolation device.","The processing system can be adapted to transfer a set of telecommunication information from one of the interfaces to the other interface. The processing system can also process at least some of the transferred information. In certain aspects, the processing system can incorporate the functionality of the isolation device and\/or the discrimination device. The processing system can also be adapted to accept a set of configuration information from a control point and the control point can be associated with a distribution point coupled to the external transport medium. In accordance with certain embodiments, the processing system can include an application programming interface wherein it is receiving configuration information from the control point. Alternatively the processing system can be capable of receiving configuration information from a web browser.","Other embodiments of the invention include systems for providing telecommunication services to customer premises. One exemplary system can comprise a distribution point associated with a telecommunication service provider and an external transport medium in communication with the distribution point. A system in accordance with some embodiments further includes a network interface device, which, as noted above, can include a first interface, a second interface and an isolation device which can be configured to isolate an internal transport medium from an external transport medium. The network interface devices of these exemplary systems can incorporate any of the components and\/or features discussed above.","A system according to certain embodiments of the invention can also include a second external transport medium and the network interface device can include a third interface for communicating with the second external transport medium. The first and second external transport media can be associated with the same telecommunication service provider and\/or can be associated with different telecommunication service providers. The first external transport medium can transport a first set of telecommunication information and the second external transport medium can transport a second set of telecommunication information. The first and second sets of telecommunication information can be associated with the same telecommunication service or can be associated with different telecommunication services. In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, network interface devices can be adapted to be attached to an exterior wall of a customer premises.","Still other embodiments of the invention include methods of providing telecommunication services. For example, a method in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention comprises providing a network interface device as discussed above, and transmitting at least one set of telecommunication information from at least one distribution point to that network interface device. The method can further comprise receiving at the distribution point a set of telecommunication information from the network interface device. According to some embodiments, the least one distribution point can be a plurality of distribution points. Each of these distribution points can be associated with a different telecommunication service provider, and\/or or they can all be associated with the same telecommunication service provider.","Methods according to further embodiments can include receiving the set of telecommunication information from a telecommunication information provider before transmitting the set of information to the network interface device. Exemplary methods can also include providing an interface in the network interface device to allow a third party to transmit at least one additional set of telecommunication information to the network interface device.","Still other embodiments include methods of replacing a network demarcation device. The device isolates an internal transport medium from an external transport medium. The method includes establishing a connection from a service computer to the demarcation device via a service interface of the demarcation device and accessing a storage arrangement of the demarcation device with the service computer. The method also includes using the service computer to select configuration information of the demarcation device and establishing a connection between a copy interface of the demarcation device and a copy interface of the replacement demarcation device. The method also includes using the service computer to cause the selected configuration information to be transferred from the demarcation device to the replacement demarcation device and interfacing the replacement demarcation device to the internal transport medium and the external transport medium.","In still another embodiment, a method of replacing a network demarcation device that isolates an internal transport medium from an external transport medium includes establishing a connection from a service computer to the demarcation device via a service interface of the demarcation device and accessing a storage arrangement of the demarcation device with the service computer. The method also includes using the service computer to select configuration information of the demarcation device and establishing a connection between the service computer and a service interface of the replacement demarcation device. The method also includes using the service computer to cause the selected configuration information to be transferred from the demarcation device to the replacement demarcation device interfacing the replacement demarcation device to the internal transport medium and the external transport medium.","Certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to demarcation devices that can be used to provide telecommunication services, as well as to methods and systems of using such devices. A demarcation device can be any device capable of serving as an interface between a customer premises and a telecommunication service provider's network. Such devices can include, merely by way of example, set top boxes (which can be used, inter alia, as an interface between a customer's video appliance and a provider's video network), broadband modems (including xDSL modems, cable modems and wireless modems, each of which can be used to provide video and\/or data to a customer premises), integrated access devices (which can, for instance, translate between Voice over IP (\u201cVoIP\u201d) signals and traditional telephone signals, thus allowing traditional telephones to connect to a VoIP network), devices compatible with the session initiation protocol (\u201cSIP\u201d) familiar to those skilled in the art, and\/or the like. One particular demarcation device is a network interface device (\u201cNID\u201d), described in detail below. In certain aspects, demarcation devices can be used to separate received telecommunication information into discrete sets, and optionally to process certain of those sets independently from other sets and\/or transmit different sets to different locations, perhaps through the use of different interfaces.","As used herein, references to the term \u201ctelecommunication information\u201d should be interpreted to include any information that can be transmitted or carried by a telecommunication service provider's network (e.g., the Public Switched Telephone Network or \u201cPSTN\u201d) or by any other telecommunication network, including but not limited to the Internet. Such information includes, for example, voice signals (e.g., Plain Old Telephone Service or \u201cPOTS,\u201d as the term is known to those skilled in the art), audio and video signals (encoded in any standard and\/or proprietary, digital and\/or analog format now known or hereafter developed, using any of a variety of means known to those skilled in the art, such as HDTV, NTSC and PAL formatting, as well as, for example, any of the MPEG digital encoding and\/or compression algorithms), and data. Such data can be formatted according any of a variety of protocols familiar in the art, including in particular any of the protocols known in the art as part of the TCP\/IP suite, in particular the Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d). Data can also include infrastructural protocols, including, for instance, routing protocols and protocols necessary to implement advanced networking schemes known to those skilled in the art, such as multiprotocol label switching (\u201cMPLS\u201d), Ethernet in the first mile (\u201cEFM\u201d), to name but two","In this document, the term \u201ctelecommunication service provider\u201d can mean any entity that provides telecommunication service to a customer's premises, including, merely by way of example, incumbent local exchange carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, cable television carriers, and satellite providers, to name a few. In contrast, the term \u201ctelecommunication information provider,\u201d means any entity that is capable of serving as a source of telecommunication information. In many cases, a particular entity may be considered both a telecommunication service provider and a telecommunication information provider, for instance, when a local exchange carrier provides Internet service to a customer, as well as the external transport medium attached to that customer's premises. In other cases, the two may be separate entities. For instance, according to certain embodiments of the invention, a cable television provider could contract with a local exchange carrier to provide broadcast television signals to a customer premises using the local exchange carrier's network and\/or an external transport medium operated by the local exchange carrier.","The term \u201ctelecommunication information set\u201d is used to describe a discrete subset of the telecommunication information transmitted across a particular transport medium and\/or received by a demarcation device. Generally, the telecommunication information that is classified part of a particular information set shares a common characteristic. Merely by way of example, an information set can comprise telecommunication information of a particular type (e.g., voice, IP data, encoded video, and such), information associated with a particular application (e.g., information assigned to a specific IP port, as is known in the art, or information used by a particular software and\/or hardware program), information addressed to or received from a particular device or network segment, information received within a particular reception window, and the like.","In certain embodiments, demarcation devices can support the one-way flow of telecommunication information, as for example, in the case of a simple set top box, which can receive data representing a video signal, decode that data, and transmit a video signal to an attached television. In other embodiments, however, demarcation devices can support bidirectional flow of telecommunication information. For example, an xDSL modem allows the transmission of data both to and from a customer premises. In still other embodiments, a demarcation device can be configured to support both unidirectional and bidirectional information flows simultaneously, depending on the type of telecommunication information transmitted or the source of the information.","In one important aspect, demarcation devices can function to isolate the telecommunication service provider's network from the network at the customer premises. As described in detail below, the service provider's network can be thought of as an \u201cexternal transport medium,\u201d while the customer's network can be termed an \u201cinternal transport medium.\u201d Both external transport media and internal transport media are types of \u201ctransport media,\u201d a term used in this document to describe any cable, wire or other medium capable of carrying telecommunication information, including, but not limited to, twisted pair copper wiring (shielded or unshielded, including, for example, unshielded cables complying with industry-standard categories 3, 5, 5e and 6 and shielded cables commonly known as Token Ring\u2122 cables, to name a few), optical fiber (including both single-mode and multimode fiber, as well as doped fiber, wavelength-division multiplexed, coarse wavelength-division multiplexed, wide wavelength-division multiplexed, dense wavelength-division and ultra-dense wavelength-division multiplexed fiber) and coaxial cable.","Other examples of transport media can also include universal serial bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) cable, cable complying with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (\u201cIEEE\u201d) 1394 standard, as well as any medium capable of complying with the many local area networking standards known in the art. Of course, a transport medium need not be a physical medium; it can also comprise any of a wide variety of wireless transmissions, including (but not limited to) infra-red transmissions, radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) transmissions, and transmissions complying with standards developed by any of the IEEE's working groups governing wireless communication (e.g., the 802.11, 802.15, 802.16 and 802.20 working groups). Similarly, a transport medium can comprise other wireless technologies, such as point-to-point microwave, including local multipoint distribution system (\u201cLMDS\u201d), microwave multipoint distribution system and\/or multipoint multi-channel distribution system (collectively, \u201cMMDS\u201d) transmissions, and satellite, cellular\/PCS, and\/or ultra wideband transmissions, to name a few.","In certain embodiments, a demarcation device can act as an active demarcation point, serving to isolate the external transport medium from the internal transport medium (perhaps via an isolation device, discussed below), such that operational changes in one network do not affect the other network. \u201cOperational changes\u201d can include any changes in the structure, topology, format, protocol, bandwidth, media and\/or other operational parameters of a network. This feature can provide many benefits; for instance, the demarcation device can serve as a disclosed interface between a customer premises and a provider's network, allowing the provider to implement changes in its network without disrupting the service provided to the customer.","Likewise, the isolation of the internal transport medium from the external transport medium can allow for any variety of customer premise equipment (\u201cCPE\u201d) (which can be any device that sends, receives or otherwise utilizes telecommunication information) to be used at the customer premises without fear that the appliance might be incompatible with a particular telecommunication service provider's standards. Moreover, a demarcation device might serve to couple a plurality of external and\/or internal transport media, allowing interoperation among them all, and provide the same isolation features among all of these media.","In this way, certain aspects of the demarcation devices can allow for sales of a wide variety of CPE on a consumer electronics model, instead of the proprietary model necessitated by many of today's telecommunication networks, where, for example, differing implementations of xDSL among providers virtually force consumers to purchase modems supplied or approved by a particular provider to ensure compatibility between the modem and the provider's xDSL implementation. By isolating the topologies of the external and internal transport media, embodiments of the present invention can create a disclosed interface between the provider's network and the customer's network, allowing much greater flexibility in both the provider's networking options and the customer's choice of telecommunication appliances. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these and many other benefits can flow from embodiments of the invention.","In accordance with other embodiments, the isolation abilities of demarcation devices also can allow a demarcation device to serve as an insulator between different transport media coupled to the internal and external transport media in order, for instance to prevent unwanted telecommunication information from one network from entering the other network. For instance, a demarcation device in accordance with particular embodiments can serve to prevent propagation of certain telecommunication information from an internal network (including particular signals or frequencies) into one or more external transport media, preventing interference in the internal transport medium from interfering with the telecommunication service provider's network. In similar fashion, demarcation devices can prevent the contamination of the internal transport medium with unwanted information from the external medium, interference between two or more external transport media coupled to a demarcation device, and unwanted interference or crosstalk between multiple internal media.","The ability of a demarcation device to isolate the internal transport medium from the external transport medium also allows demarcation devices in some embodiments to be used to provide enhanced security for the customer and\/or control customer access to certain features or services. For instance, those skilled in the art will recognize that a demarcation device can prevent unauthorized access (by a telecommunication service provider and\/or a third party) to the customer's data network, or can screen or filter telecommunication information entering or leaving the customer's premises, enabling features like parental controls on incoming and outgoing information, as well as the filtering of outgoing sensitive information (such as credit card information and the like).","Further, according to certain embodiments, the demarcation device, as the consolidation point for all telecommunication information entering or leaving the customer premises, can provide a variety of enhanced features to the entire premises, including things like caller identification, premises-wide telephone, video and data distribution, content (e.g., video, audio or data) on demand, and the like. These and other features of the demarcation devices also allow for a variety of new and useful telecommunication applications to be provided to customers. Details about some exemplary applications are discussed below; given the disclosure herein, those skilled in the art can appreciate the wide variety of such applications that are possible using various embodiments of the invention.","Certain embodiments of the invention provide a variety of systems for utilizing demarcation devices. Merely by way of example,  illustrate several such exemplary systems. For instance,  illustrates a system  for providing telecommunication services using a demarcation device, in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. System  includes a distribution point  in communication with a demarcation device  via external transport medium . In one sense, distribution point  can be considered the source of telecommunication information transmitted to customer premises and the recipient of telecommunication information transmitted from customer premises , although, as described below, distribution point  often will be neither the ultimate source nor the ultimate recipient of telecommunication information. In certain embodiments, distribution point  can be a telecommunication service provider's local office; in other embodiments, distribution point  can be another network element in the service provider's network, for instance, a remote termination cabinet and\/or a digital subscriber line access multiplier (\u201cDSLAM\u201d). In fact, distribution point  can be any facility or equipment operated by a telecommunication service provider that is capable of transmitting telecommunication information to, and\/or receiving telecommunication information from, a customer premises.","In general, distribution points can be classified, inter alia, as discrete distribution points or complex distribution points. With respect to a particular information set, a discrete distribution point often transmits only the necessary or desired information to the NID. In contrast, a complex distribution point can transmit the entire information set to the NID. The contrast may be illustrated with regard to video distribution: A discrete distribution point may perform channel switching (at the request of the demarcation device), encoding and sending only the desired channel information to the demarcation device. In contrast, a complex distribution point might rely upon the demarcation device to perform all channel switching. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each scheme presents relative advantages and disadvantages.","Distribution point  can be capable of transmitting and\/or receiving any type of telecommunication information to\/from demarcation device , and such telecommunication information can be organized into a plurality of telecommunication information sets, as necessary. For ease of description,  does not show any additional sources or recipients of telecommunication information in communication with distribution point , but, those skilled in the art will recognize that, in many embodiments, distribution point  can be coupled to multiple customer premises (perhaps via a demarcation device at each customer premises) and often is neither the ultimate source nor the ultimate recipient of telecommunication information. Instead, distribution point  often can serve as the intermediary between one or more customer premises (e.g., ) and one or more larger telecommunication networks and\/or telecommunication information providers, which, as discussed above, can include cable television networks, telephone networks, data networks, and the like. Further, many such networks (as well as, in some embodiments, distribution point ) can be coupled to the Internet, so that distribution point  can serve as a gateway between customer premises and any source and\/or recipient of telecommunication information that has a connection to the Internet. The interconnection of telecommunication networks is well known in the art and need not be discussed here, other than to note that distribution point  can be configured to transmit telecommunication information to (and receive telecommunication information from) virtually any source or recipient of telecommunication information, through either direct or indirect (e.g., through the Internet) communication. Merely by way of example, a distribution point can transmit video signals received from a television programming provider to customer premises equipment, as described in the applications referenced above. In other embodiments, distribution point  can be in communication with one or more other customer locations, allowing for private virtual circuits between customer premises  and those locations.","In system , demarcation device  can serve as the interface between external transport medium  and customer premises . As conceptually illustrated in , demarcation device  can be attached to an external wall of customer premises , which provides many advantages. For instance, if the telecommunication service provider desires to upgrade or otherwise change its network (including, perhaps, modifying external transport medium ), a technician can perform any necessary changes at demarcation device  without entering the customer premises. Coupled with the ability of some demarcation devices to isolate the telecommunication service provider's network from the customer's premises, this can allow the telecommunication service provider to effect substantial changes in it network without impacting or inconveniencing the customer in any respect. This could, for example, allow the telecommunication service provider to upgrade external transmission medium  from a copper twisted pair to optical fiber, without requiring any topological changes inside the customer premises. Of course, demarcation device  also may be located at a variety of other locations, for example, within customer premises  or at a facility operated by the telecommunication service provider (e.g., distribution point ). As discussed in detail below, a demarcation device may also be divided, with different portions situated at different locations, according to the requirements of the implementation.","Demarcation device  can communicate with CPE  (which can be located inside customer premises ) through internal transport medium , which can comprise any of the media discussed above. In particular, internal transport medium  can comprise the existing telephone wiring in customer premises  and, in some embodiments, is capable of carrying voice, data and video information, as well, perhaps, as other types of telecommunication information, using any of a variety of multiplexing schemes. For instance, as described in Edward H. Frank and Jack Holloway, \u201cConnecting the Home with a Phone Line Network Chip Set,\u201d (IEEE, March-April 2000), which is incorporated herein by reference, the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance (\u201cHPNA\u201d) standards allow for simultaneous transmission of both voice information and Ethernet frames across twisted-pair copper telephone wiring.","Thus, telecommunication information received by distribution point  from any source (for instance, those discussed above) can be transmitted from distribution point  through external transport medium  to demarcation device . Demarcation device  can then transmit the information through internal transport medium  to CPE . Likewise, telecommunication information can be transmitted via the reverse path to distribution point , where it can, for instance, be transmitted to an information recipient, such as a service provider (for instance, to request a pay-per-view movie or the like) or across the Internet to a recipient (such as in the case of an email message).","In certain embodiments, demarcation device  can receive configuration information, in some cases from a control point (e.g., ), which, in the illustrated embodiment, is associated with distribution point . In certain instances, control point  can be software and\/or hardware operated by a telecommunication service provider for controlling certain features of the operation of demarcation device . For instance, control point  can instruct demarcation device  to provide (or cease to provide) a particular telecommunication service (e.g., video distribution) to customer premises , or to control how many information sets and\/or transport media demarcation device  should accept at any given time. Control point  can also provide other direction to demarcation device , including, for instance, instructions to save or record a particular information set (e.g., data representing a movie), such that the information set may quickly (and, in some cases), repeatedly be transmitted to customer premises , allowing the provision of voice, data, video, etc. on demand. Control point  can further be used to test the availability, functioning and\/or performance of demarcation device , and\/or any of the transport media attached thereto. Merely by way of example, control point  can be used to perform a loop test, known to those skilled in the art.","Often, it may be beneficial to allow the customer to provide configuration information to demarcation device . Thus, in certain embodiments, control point  can have a web interface, such that the customer (or any authorized person, such as an employee of the telecommunication service provider or telecommunication information provider) may log on to the web interface and configure options for demarcation device, perhaps resulting in configuration commands being transmitted from distribution point  to demarcation device . In other embodiments, control point  can be a web interface to demarcation device  itself, allowing the customer (or, alternatively, a telecommunication service provider or telecommunication information provider) to configure demarcation device  directly. In still other embodiments, control point  can communicate with demarcation device through an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d). Hence, in some aspects, control point  can interface with demarcation device  through an API.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that, in some embodiments, an API can include a set of software, hardware or firmware routines or libraries that may be invoked programmatically to configure or relay information to demarcation device . In that sense, then, control point  can be understood to be a program running on a computer (perhaps located at distribution point  or customer premises , among other locations) that provides configuration information to demarcation device via using a software API. In other embodiments, however, an API can include a physical interface (perhaps adapted to communicate using any of the transport media discussed herein), that may be accessed remotely and\/or locally, for instance, by a service technician.","Merely by way of example, a service technician could visit customer premises , attach a laptop computer (or other configuration device) to demarcation device , and upload information to demarcation device , including perhaps both configuration information and other telecommunication information. In still other embodiments, demarcation device  can accept configuration information through other means, including merely by way of example, providing a web interface (especially in embodiments where demarcation device  is capable of acting as a web server, as discussed below) and\/or receiving a specially-formatted electronic message, either of which could be considered a control point in such embodiments.","As described below, demarcation device  (and\/or particular components thereof) can be addressable\/and or programmable (e.g., through control point ). As such, demarcation device  can include a storage device, which can be any device known to those skilled in the art as one capable of storing information (including, merely by way of example, any of the memory and\/or storage devices discussed below), for storing configuration information received from control point . As discussed below, the storage device can also store other telecommunication information.","Configuration information can be any set of data or other information that can be interpreted by demarcation device  as operational instructions, including, but not limited to, commands to process certain information sets in certain ways (e.g., provide protocol conversion, allow transmission of the information set, deny transmission of the information set, direct transmission on a particular interface, and the like), commands to provide (or cease providing) a particular service (e.g., to provide access to a pay per view movie or an additional telephone line). Thus, in certain aspects, a telecommunication service provider can control the services provided to a customer in several ways. First, the provider can transmit a telecommunication information set to a demarcation device only if the user of that device is authorized to receive the service associated with that information set. Alternatively, the service provider could send one or more services to a customer's demarcation device regardless of the customer's authorization to use the services, and rely on the device itself to prevent unauthorized access to those services.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain control methods are more well-suited to certain services than to others. For instance, with respect to cable television services, the same set of information may be broadcast to many households, and the demarcation device is well-suited to control access to those services, allowing for greater efficiency in the providing of such services. In contrast, video on demand services may be controlled at a distribution point (or elsewhere), such that a demarcation device will only receive video on demand information if the customer already has requested (and been authorized to receive) that service, and the demarcation device thus may not need to provide access control functions with respect to that service.","According to some embodiments, demarcation device  can implement either of these access control schemes, or both in combination, as well as others. Moreover, demarcation device  can, in some cases, be configured to support a plurality of schemes transparently, so the customer can, for instance, request a service from demarcation device  (perhaps using one of the methods discussed above), and demarcation device can relay that request to the appropriate telecommunication service provider (and\/or telecommunication information provider) if necessary, as well as reconfigure itself to allow access to that service, if necessary. Of course, demarcation device  also can be configured to take any necessary validating or authenticating action (such as notifying distribution point  and\/or control point  that the service has been requested, and, optionally, receiving a return confirmation that the service has been authorized).","In accordance with other embodiments, configuration information sent to demarcation device  can include one or more commands to interface with and\/or control a particular home fixture in a certain way. The term \u201chome fixture\u201d should be interpreted to mean any outlet, fixture, or device (including without limitation those that function electrically and\/or any CPE) that can be intelligently controlled. Home fixtures can include, merely by way of example, any device, outlet, or other equipment that can be included in the \u201csmart home\u201d or \u201cconnected home\u201d concepts familiar to those skilled in the art. For instance, configuration information could instruct demarcation device  to turn on and\/or off certain lights, electrical outlets and\/or equipment (perhaps via additional devices), and\/or to arm, disarm or otherwise monitor and\/or configure a home security system. One skilled in the art, will recognize, moreover, that although termed \u201chome fixtures\u201d for ease of description, home fixtures can easily be located in MDUs and business premises as well.","Configuration information can also include operational data such as an IP address, routing information, and the like, to name but a few examples. Configuration information can further include instructions to modify one or more security settings of demarcation device . Merely by way of example, in certain embodiments, demarcation device  can include a computer virus scanner, and configuration information can include updated virus definitions and\/or heuristics. Likewise, demarcation device  often will be configured with access controls (for instance, to prevent unauthorized access through demarcation device  by third parties, as described elsewhere in this document), and configuration information can include instructions on how to deal with particular third party attempts to access demarcation device  or internal transport medium . Those skilled in the art will recognize as well that some security settings may specify the level of access the customer has to the functions of demarcation device , for instance to prevent unauthorized use of certain telecommunication services, and that these settings also may be modified by received configuration information.","Based on the disclosure herein, those skilled in the art will recognize that a wide variety of configuration information can be transmitted to demarcation device , including those examples discussed above. Moreover, some types of configuration information may be sent periodically to demarcation device  to ensure that the configuration of demarcation device is current. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that configuration information can, in a sense, be considered a subset of the broader category of telecommunication information.","Turning now to , system \u2032 is illustrative of certain embodiments, which can provide multiple demarcation devices A, B at customer premises . As noted above, demarcation device A can be in communication with CPE A through internal transport medium A, and demarcation device B likewise can be in communication with CPE B through internal transport medium B. Demarcation device B can communicate with distribution point  through external transport medium B which, as illustrated by , can simply be spliced into external transport medium A (for example, using one or more active and\/or passive splitting devices, which could be optical, as in a fiber environment, for example, or electrical). If necessary, demarcation devices  and\/or distribution point  can include control logic to prevent unauthorized access by demarcation device A to telecommunication information sent to (or received from) demarcation device B, and vice-versa. In other embodiments, external transport medium B could run directly from demarcation device B to distribution point , or external transport medium B can be omitted, and demarcation device B can be coupled to demarcation device A, which can provide connectivity between demarcation device B and distribution point  through external transport medium A.","System \u2032 can be used in a variety of implementations. For instance, if customer premises  is a multiple-dwelling unit (\u201cMDU\u201d) or a commercial building, separate demarcation devices can be provided for each separate resident, family and\/or tenant (or, alternatively, a single demarcation device, perhaps with more interfaces, can service multiple dwelling or business units). In such implementations, especially when external transport medium B does not directly couple demarcation device B to distribution point , demarcation devices A, B can include security functionality, for example to prevent telecommunication signals intended for CPE A from reaching CPE B and vice-versa. In some embodiments, demarcation devices can provide a variety of such security, encryption and authentication functions.","As described above, in certain embodiments, multiple demarcation devices A, B can be daisy-chained together (using any of the telecommunication media discussed herein). This could allow a telecommunication service provider to provide service to additional customers without requiring any additional external transport media (e.g., B). Similarly, demarcation devices at multiple premises can be coupled together (using wired or wireless transport media), such that if the external transport medium coupled to one of the demarcation devices fails, that device can maintain connectivity to the distribution point through its connection to another demarcation device. A demarcation device in accordance with specific embodiments thus may have an interface for securely connecting to one or more additional demarcation devices (thus, perhaps, forming a mesh network of one or more demarcation devices and\/or distribution points), that would allow a particular demarcation device to serve as a conduit between another interface device and a distribution point, without allowing any unauthorized reception of telecommunication information intended for the connected interface device. This secure interface can be included, for instance, in a portion of the demarcation device that is inaccessible to customers, as illustrated in  and described below.","In other embodiments, a single customer premises might have connections to a plurality of telecommunication service providers. For example, turning now to , system \u2033 includes a distribution point A coupled to demarcation device A and also includes a second distribution point B coupled to demarcation device B via external transport medium B. Merely by way of example, distribution point B could, for example, be associated with a cable television provider, while distribution point A could be associated with a telephone company. Thus, CPE A could be a telephone, and CPE B could be a television. (Of course, it should be noted that both telephone and video signals, as well as other forms of telecommunication information, can be provided through a single distribution point as well.) Further, as illustrated by example system \u2033, multiple CPE A, C can be coupled to a single demarcation device  (either through two internal transport media A, C as illustrated by , or through a common internal transport medium, as discussed below). As described above, each demarcation device A, B, can receive configuration information from a control point A, B respectively.","In an alternative embodiment, such as, for example system \u2032\u2033 illustrated on , a single demarcation device  can provide connectivity to a plurality of distribution points (e.g., A, B), as well to a plurality of CPE A, B, C. In such an embodiment, demarcation device  could include attachments for multiple internal transport media A, B, C and multiple external transport media A, B. Moreover, as illustrated by , each distribution point A, B can be associated with a different control point A, B, respectively. In alternative embodiments, a single control point could provide configuration information to demarcation device  with respect to both distribution points A, B.","Turning now to , another exemplary system \u2033\u2033 is presented in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention. In exemplary system \u2033\u2033, demarcation device  can be in communication with distribution point . In turn, distribution point  (perhaps operated by a telecommunication service provider) can be in communication with one or more telecommunication information providers A, B. Each telecommunication information provider A, B can be the source or recipient of one or more telecommunication information sets (each of which can be associated with a particular telecommunication service), each of which can be transmitted to (or received from) distribution point . Distribution point  can also transmit these information sets to (or received them from) demarcation device , via external transport medium . As discussed below, demarcation device  can be capable of processing a plurality of such information sets in a variety of ways.","In certain embodiments, each telecommunication information provider A, B can have an individual control point B, C. In some such embodiments, control points B, C can be in communication with demarcation device  via distribution point , or, alternatively, could have a separate means of communication with demarcation device  (e.g., via a modem and telephone line). Thus, in some embodiments, demarcation device  can receive configuration information from each control point B, C. As discussed above, configuration information can direct the behavior of demarcation device , in particular with respect to how to handle telecommunication information received from, or sent to, the associated telecommunication information provider.","In some embodiments, demarcation device  can be configured to accept configuration information related only to the telecommunication information and\/or services provided by the telecommunication information provider sending the configuration information. In this way, demarcation device can be protected against inadvertent (or malicious) misconfiguration, which could interrupt a telecommunication service provided by another telecommunication information provider. Likewise, demarcation device  could be configured to automatically request updated configuration information from control point A associated with distribution point  in the case of misconfiguration, and control point A could maintain a master set of configuration information to be able to accommodate such a request.","In other embodiments, telecommunication information providers A, B may not have an associated control point. In such embodiments, telecommunication information providers A, B can send configuration information to control point A (perhaps via distribution point A), and control point A can relay that configuration information to demarcation device  (again, perhaps through distribution point ). In this way the telecommunication service provider can control which configuration information is transmitted to demarcation device .","In certain embodiments, demarcation device  can submit a request for configuration information to one or more control points A, B, C, perhaps via distribution point . Such a request might be made, if, for instance, the customer would like to watch a pay per view movie. The appropriate control point (e.g., B) could then provide the proper configuration information to demarcation device as described above, and the configuration information could enable demarcation device to transmit the movie to customer premises .","As exemplified by system  on , embodiments of the invention enable a single demarcation device  to serve multiple CPE A-F, each of which can be a different appliance, at a single customer premises . For instance, CPE A can be a computer with an Ethernet interface, CPE B can be a telephone, CPE C can be a video game system, CPE D can be a set-top box attached to a television, CPE E can be a computer with an HPNA interface, and CPE F can be a laptop computer equipped with a wireless network card.","Also as illustrated by system , demarcation device  can support multiple network topologies. For instance, demarcation device  can serve as a hub for a point-to-point network topology, with multiple point-to-point connections to CPE A, B via internal transport media A, B, respectively. In addition, demarcation device  can support a bus topology, as illustrated by internal transport medium , which can connect demarcation device  to CPE C, D, E. Demarcation device  can also be equipped with a wireless transmitter  for communication with wireless-capable CPE F. In this way, demarcation device  can support a wide variety of networking media in customer premises , including the existing telephone, satellite, cable, and network wiring. For instance, the existing telephone wiring in most homes is arranged in a bus topology, as is most coaxial cable (for instance RG6 or RG59) installed by cable television providers, although each may, in some implementations, be wired using a star topology. In contrast, many homes also have 10Base-T Ethernet networks, which sometimes require a central hub. As used herein, the term \u201c10Base-T\u201d can be understood to include newer implementations of Ethernet over unshielded twisted pair wiring, including, for instance, 100 megabit Ethernet (100Base-T, 100VG-AnyLAN, etc.) and gigabit Ethernet (1000Base-T) standards. Demarcation device  can support these and other network topologies, serving as the hub in a 10Base-T network if necessary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 1G","b":["150","152","154","156","158","160","160","156"]},"In accordance with some embodiments, distribution point  also comprises a central office shelf  in communication with the PSTN, as well with an asynchronous transfer mode (\u201cATM\u201d) network , either of which can provide connectivity to any of the variety of data sources and\/or recipients discussed above. In certain embodiments, shelf  is, in turn, coupled to fiber distribution panel , which is connected by transport medium  to a digital loop carrier remote termination cabinet . Remote termination cabinet  can also be coupled to DSLAM  by transport medium , which may be routed through serving area interface . In effect, transport medium  can carry one or more POTS information sets, and transport medium  can carry one or more non-POTS (in this case xDSL) information sets.","As illustrated, these two information sets can be combined at DSLAM , which is in communication with serving area interface  through transport medium . Serving area interface  can coupled to demarcation device  by transport medium , and in the illustrated embodiment, demarcation device  is fixedly attached to an exterior wall at customer premises . Demarcation device can then be coupled via one or more internal transport media A-I to a variety of CPE, including without limitation a television set , a video phone , an IP-compatible set-top box , an analog (POTS) telephone , an IP-compatible phone , and a personal computer . In this way, a demarcation device can be used to provide a plurality of telecommunication services to a customer premises.","As alluded to above, a NID is one type of demarcation device that can serve as the interface between an external transport medium and an internal transport medium. Generally, a NID can incorporate all of the functionality of the demarcation devices discussed above. In addition, in accordance with some embodiments, a network interface device also can offer enhanced functionality in the provision of telecommunication services, as described below.","Turning now to , one exemplary embodiment of a NID  is illustrated. In the illustrated embodiment, NID  comprises a clamshell design, with a lid portion  and a body portion  connected by hinges A, B. Turning now to , it can be seen that body portion comprises a network area  and a customer area . Generally, network area  is adapted to receive a cover and is designed generally to be accessible only to personnel authorized by the telecommunication service provider. In contrast, when NID  is open, the customer can access customer area  to add or remove components as desired. In this and other ways, NID serves to isolate the telecommunication service provider's network from the customer's network, as described above. As discussed below, lid portion  can contain a processing system (not shown in )","Returning to , NID  can include a first interface  for communicating with the provider's external transport medium. Those skilled in the art will recognize that, in some embodiments, as described above, the external transport medium can be the twisted-pair copper \u201clocal loop\u201d running from the customer's premises to the telecommunication service provider's local office, and interface  can allow for the attachment of the local loop to NID . As discussed above, in other embodiments, the external transport medium can be any of a variety of other media, including satellite transmissions, wireless transmissions, coaxial cable. In fact, in certain embodiments, the external transport medium can comprise multiple transport media (of the same or different types), for which NID  could include multiple interfaces. In some such embodiments, NID  can function to logically couple or bond a plurality of external transport media to one another, seamlessly increasing the bandwith available to the customer premises. For instance, a customer premises might have a satellite link to one telecommunication service provider and an ADSL link to another provider, and NID  could combine or multiplex these two links to provide an apparent single, higher-bandwidth to the customer premises. Similarly, those skilled in the art will recognize that, in certain of these embodiments, a particular external transport medium (for instance, a satellite link) may be more well-suited to one way transmission of telecommunication information; in such cases, NID  could use a second external transport medium (for instance, an ADSL link) to allow transmission in the other direction.","Interface  can be coupled to a discrimination device , which can be operative to separate information sets received on interface  (and, conversely, aggregate information sets for transmission on interface ). Merely by way of example, in particular embodiments, discrimination device  can separate POTS information from other telecommunication information and\/or isolate signals on the internal transport medium from the external transport medium (and vice-versa). In some embodiments, for instance xDSL implementations, discrimination device  can comprise one or more filters. Such filters can include (but are not limited to) high-pass, low-pass and\/or band pass filters. For instance, in an xDSL implementation, discrimination device  might include a high-pass and\/or low-pass filter for separating high-frequency (e.g., data) from low frequency (e.g., POTS) information. In other embodiments, discrimination device  can comprise many other types of filters, including both digital and analog filters. Demarcation device  can be operable to separate information sets through a variety of criteria, including for example, by frequency, by destination device, information type, frequency. Further, in certain embodiments, information sets can be multiplexed (for instance, using various time-division multiplexing or wave-division multiplexing schemes known in the art) for transmission over an external transport medium, and discrimination device  can comprise a de-multiplexer capable of separating multiplexed signals and, optionally, routing each signal to the appropriate destination.","In the illustrated embodiment, discrimination device  is in communication with a second interface , which can interface with the telephone wires at the customer premises to provide traditional analog telephone service. In some embodiments, an aggregator  can be situated between discrimination device  and interface  to allow additional (perhaps non-POTS) information sets to be sent and received through interface  simultaneously with the POTS information. This can include, for example, aggregating information sets for transmission of an HPNA (or HPNA+) signal over an internal transport medium.","The discrimination device can also be coupled to a processing system , which in the illustrated embodiment is located in the lid portion , and all non-POTS information sets can be routed to processing system  for additional processing. Processing system  is described in detail below, but can, in general, comprise one or microprocessors, including digital signal processor (\u201cDSP\u201d) chips, and\/or memory devices, including both volatile and nonvolatile memories, as well as a variety of read-only memory devices known in the art, such as programmable read only memory (\u201cPROM\u201d) devices and erasable programmable read only memory (\u201cEPROM\u201d) devices (a term which should be interpreted to include electrically erasable programmable (\u201cEEPROM\u201d) devices, in addition to other EPROM devices) and storage devices (including hard disk drives, optical drives and other media) In fact, processing system  can comprise the equivalent of one or more personal computers, running any of a variety of operating systems, including variants of Microsoft's Windows\u2122 operating system, as well as various flavors of the UNIX\u2122 operating system, including open source implementations such as the several Linux\u2122 and OpenBSD\u2122 operating systems.","Telecommunication information (or information sets) can be processed by processing system  in a variety of ways, including, for example, routing a given information set to a particular interface, transforming information (for example, encoding\/decoding information and converting between different transport protocols), storing information, filtering information, and any of the other functions described herein with respect to processing systems. In certain embodiments, processing system  can serve as the termination point for an external transport medium; for instance processing system  can incorporate the functionality of an xDSL modem. In other embodiments, processing system  can serve to identify quality of service requirements (for instance, latency requirements for voice transmissions and bandwidth requirements for streaming media transmissions, to name a few) and enforce those requirements, ensuring that sufficient bandwith is provided to a particular device, network segment or application to maintain the quality of service required.","In certain embodiments, for instance, as described above with respect to , a NID may comprise another interface in communication with a second distribution point B, perhaps operated by a different telecommunication service provider, through an additional external transport medium A. In such a case, the additional external interface could be coupled to discrimination device , or it could be coupled to another discrimination device, which could also be in communication with processing system , interface  and\/or aggregator . Thus, certain embodiments allow a single NID to serve as a communication gateway between the customer premises and multiple telecommunication service providers, including combining or multiplexing multiple external transport media (each of which may be in communication with a different telecommunication service provider and\/or telecommunication information provider) as discussed above.","Returning to , processing system  can be in communication with aggregator , which, as discussed above, can aggregate non-POTS information sets received from processing system  and POTS information sets received directly from discrimination device  for consolidated transmission via interface , among other functions. In effect, discrimination device  and aggregator  (perhaps in conjunction with processing system ) can function to separate telecommunication information received on interface  into a set of POTS telecommunication information and a set of non-POTS telecommunication (wherein POTS information can be understood to be ordinary telephone signals, and non-POTS information can be understood to include all other telecommunication information), route the non-POTS information via transport medium  to processing system  for processing, and route the POTS information to interface  for transmission to the internal transport medium. In certain embodiments, one or more sets of non-POTS information can be routed to interface  using transport medium  for transmission through interface , perhaps in combination with one or more sets of POTS information.","Of course, discrimination device  and aggregator  can perform the same function in reverse (i.e., to separate and recombine different sets of telecommunication information received on interface  from the customer's premises). Thus, in some embodiments, both discrimination device  and aggregator  each can perform a combined discrimination device-aggregator function, depending on the direction of information flow. In fact, while termed \u201cdiscrimination device\u201d and \u201caggregator\u201d for ease of description, those two devices can actually be identical, and further, their functionality can, in some embodiments, be incorporated into a single device, which could be coupled to interface , interface , and processing system  and could route information sets among any of those components as necessary. Moreover, as described below, the functionality of discrimination device  and\/or aggregator  can be incorporated into processing system ; likewise, discrimination device  can incorporate interface  and\/or aggregator  can incorporate interface , such that discrimination device\/and or aggregator comprise the necessary components to be coupled directly to the external and internal transport media, respectively.","Discrimination device  and\/or aggregator can also serve another function in certain embodiments: Since the external transport medium is coupled to first interface  and the internal transport medium can be coupled to, inter alia, second interface , the discrimination device and\/or aggregator can serve as an isolation device for intermediating between the two media, such that when a topological change occurs in one of the media, only the NID interface need be changed, and the other transport medium is not affected. In some such embodiments, discrimination device  and\/or aggregator  can serve to intermediate (including protocol translation and the like) between interfaces , , allowing either the internal or the external transport medium to be upgraded or changed without impacting the other transport medium. Of course, in certain embodiments, this isolation function also could be performed by processing system. In yet other embodiments, the isolation device might comprise a separate piece of hardware in communication with discrimination device , aggregator  and\/or processing system .","In certain embodiments, NID  can have one or more additional interfaces ,  in communication with processing system  via transport media , , respectively. Additional interfaces ,  can be adapted to communicate with any of a variety of internal transport media to send\/receive telecommunication information to\/from the customer premises. For instance, interface  can be a coaxial interface for connection to RG6 and\/or RG59 cable, and interface  can be an RJ45 and\/or RJ11 interface for connection to unshielded twisted pair cable (which can, for instance, form a 10Base-T Ethernet network).","In certain embodiments, NID  can comprise a line driver (not shown on ), coupled to processing system  and aggregator . The line driver can function to allow conversion between various network formats and media, allowing a variety of different media types (e.g., twisted pair and\/or coaxial cable, in accordance with the HPNA and HPNA+ standards, as well, perhaps, as the customer premises' A\/C wiring, in accordance, for example, with the HomePlug\u2122 standard) to transport combined POTS and non-POTS information sets. If necessary, one or more different line drivers can be used to accommodate a variety of transport media.","The ability of NID  to support multiple interfaces of different types allows great flexibility in routing telecommunication information throughout the customer premises. Merely by way of example, if interface  receives telecommunication information that includes digitally-encoded video signals (e.g., MPEG-2 data), the information set that includes the encoded video signals can be routed by discrimination device  to processing system , which can decode the signals into an RF-modulated NTSC, HDTV and\/or PAL format and transmit the signals via transport medium  to coaxial interface , where it can be transmitted via coaxial cable to one or more televisions at the customer premises. Alternatively, if the customer has a digital set-top box located at the television, the encoded signals can be routed by processing system  (perhaps through the appropriate line driver) to aggregator , where the signals can be transferred through interface  to the set-top box for decoding.","Similarly, in some embodiments, NID  might receive IP data (perhaps combined with other types of telecommunication information) on interface . The information set comprising the IP data can be routed by discrimination device  via medium  to processing system , where it can be processed, and depending on the embodiment, routed via transport medium  to the customer's existing telephone wiring (perhaps using interface , optionally in conjunction with aggregator  and\/or one or more line drivers), routed to a 10Base-T network (perhaps transport medium  and interface ), routed to a coaxial cable (e.g., using transport medium  and interface ), or routed via a wireless interface (not shown in ). Alternatively, the IP data can be routed to any combination of these interfaces, and any of these interfaces could also receive IP or other telecommunication information from a CPE at the customer premises, for routing to processing system . In this way, NID  can allow virtually unlimited connectivity options for each CPE at the customer premises. Adding to the flexibility of NID , processing system  can include the necessary components to serve, for instance, as a cable, wireless, or xDSL modem, as well as components necessary to serve as an Ethernet hub, switch, router or gateway, the functions of each of which are familiar to those skilled in the art.","In certain embodiments, NID  can comprise a power supply  for providing electrical power to the components in NID . Power supply  can be powered through electrical current carried on the external transport medium and received on interface . Alternatively, power supply can receive electrical current from a coaxial interface (e.g., ), or through a dedicated transformer plugged into an A\/C outlet at customer premises, e.g., through 12V connection . Processing system  can be powered by a connection  to power supply , or through one or more separate power sources, including perhaps the A\/C power of the customer premises. In some embodiments, processing system  might have its own power supply.","As mentioned above, processing system  can comprise a plurality of processing devices, and each processing device can comprise multiple components, including microprocessors, memory devices, storage devices and the like. Merely by way of example,  provides a detailed illustration of exemplary processing system , which comprises multiple processing devices , , . In accordance with the exemplified embodiment, transport medium  links processing system  with an external transport medium (perhaps via a discrimination device and\/or interface, as described above).","Transport medium  can be coupled to microserver , such that any information received by processing system  via transport medium  is first processed by microserver . Microserver can, in some embodiments, be the equivalent of a server computer, complete with memory devices, storage devices, and the like, each of which is known in the art and none of which is illustrated on . In certain embodiments, microserver  serves as the controller for the NID, overseeing the NID's configuration and monitoring performance; in some such embodiments, the controller functions can be accessed using a web browser. Depending on the embodiment, microserver  can be capable of performing a wide variety of additional functions, including functions related to administering any local area network comprised by the internal transport medium. For instance, microserver  can function as an xDSL modem in certain embodiments, allowing a home network attached to the NID to transmit and receive data via an xDSL connection to a telecommunication service provider. Microserver  can, in some cases, also function as a hub, bridge, switch or router.","Further examples of functions of microserver  in various embodiments include a dynamic host configuration protocol (\u201cDHCP\u201d) server, which, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, allows for flexible configuration of an IP network using any internal transport medium attached to the NID, and a network address translation (\u201cNAT\u201d) server, which provides some security against unauthorized use of the customer's network. Microserver  can also function as a HyperText Transport Protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d) server, which, among other benefits, can allow configuration of the NID through a convenient web interface, as well as a bridge, switch or router, which can be capable of supporting advanced routing techniques, such as MPLS and EFM, to name a few. Microserver  can function further to manage quality of service requirements, as described above.","In addition to these functions, microserver  can be configured to route information sets received via transport medium , according to the type of telecommunication information in the set (e.g., encoded video, IP data, etc.) as well as any addressing information associated with either the set or the information it comprises (e.g., a specified destination port or network address for a particular subset of telecommunication information). In this way, microserver  can serve a switching function somewhat similar to that described with respect to discrimination device  described in relation to . For instance, if IP data is received by microserver , such data can be routed to an Ethernet connection, to the existing telephone wiring (e.g., in an HPNA implementation), or to any other appropriate medium (perhaps via an appropriate line driver). In fact, in certain embodiments, processing system  (and in particular microserver ) can incorporate the functionality of discrimination device  and\/or aggregator , rendering those components optional.","In addition to microserver , processing system  can include other components, including, for instance, application server  and set-top box , which, in the illustrated embodiment, are coupled to microserver . Application server  can comprise the equivalent of a computer, as described above, and thus can comprise one or more storage devices, such as hard disk drive , as well as memory devices, microprocessors and the like, to enable it to store and process telecommunication information and other data. In certain embodiments, application server  can perform tasks with processing, memory and\/or storage requirements that render microserver  unsuitable, including a wide variety of consumer applications. For instance, application server  can act as a digital recorder for storing video (perhaps as a video-on-demand server or a personal video recorder), a file and\/or application server for a home network attached to the NID, a Voice over IP (\u201cVoIP\u201d) server, caller identification server, or voice gateway for a telephone system attached to the NID. Application server  can also function as a home security server, allowing the control of various features and configuration options for a home security system.","Set-top box , which, in some embodiments, can be coupled to microserver  as illustrated on , can provide traditional set-top box functionality (e.g., decoding of television signals, frequency switching, etc.), as well as provide enhanced features, including, for example, the provision of picture-in-picture signals for non picture-in-picture televisions, the provision of video on demand, personal video recorder features, and many other such features.","Processing system  can have multiple means of input and output. Merely by way of example, microserver  can communicate with one or more external transport media (perhaps, as discussed above, via intermediary devices) using one or more transport media (e.g., ). Processing system  (and, specifically, microserver ) also can communicate with one or more internal transport media (for example category 5, 5e and\/or 6 unshielded twisted pair wire , RG6 and\/or RG59 coaxial cable , and category 3 unshielded twisted pair copper (telephone) wire ), again possibly via intermediary devices, as discussed with reference to . Notably, some embodiments of processing system  can include interfaces for multiple transport media of a particular type, for instance, if processing system (and, in particular, microserver ) serves as a networking hub, switch or router. Processing system  can also have infra-red and radio-frequency receivers and\/or transmitters, for instance to allow use of a remote control device, as well as wireless transceivers, for instance to allow wireless (e.g., IEEE 802.11) networking.","As illustrated on , in some embodiments, microserver  manages the connections between application server , set-top box  and transport media , , , , routing data as necessary. In other embodiments, each processor , ,  can have independent connections to one or more transport media.","It should be recognized that the devices within processing system  are described for illustrative purposes only. The functionality described above with respect to microserver , application server  and set-top box , respectively, each could be incorporated into a single device within processing system . Alternatively, their functions described herein could be divided among any number of processors and devices within processing system . Thus, the division of functions among devices within processing system  is discretionary and should not be considered to limit the scope of the invention.","In accordance with some embodiments, the NID might comprise multiple enclosures, each located in a different location and in communication with one another. Merely by way of example,  illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention, including a NID  and a separate processing system . In the illustrated embodiment, NID  can include the features described above, except that processing system  can be located distal to NID . In this way, processing system  can be located in a more secure area (for instance, inside the customer premises), while NID  can be located conveniently at the exterior of the customer premises, where it can be accessed easily by service personnel. (Of course, it should be noted that a NID can also be hardened, so that it can be securely located in its entirety on the exterior of the customer premises, as, for instance, in the embodiments discussed above.) In some embodiments, processing system  can be in communication with NID  via similar transport media , , ,  to those discussed with respect to  (, , , , respectively) and can include all of the same functionality of the embodiments discussed above. As illustrated in , processing system  generally will draw power from its own source , although it could also be powered by NID , either via one of the transport media , , ,  or through a separate power connection .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","504","504","506","504","508","512","512","516","520","508","516","520"]},"Attached to internal transport medium  (which, in the illustrated embodiment can support the HPNA standard) can be a normal POTS telephone , along with an integrated access device, which, among other things, can provide POTS service via IP data transmitted via the HPNA network on internal transport medium . In the illustrated embodiment, three additional POTS telephones A, B, C are coupled to the integrated access device, although those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain embodiments will support different numbers and types of devices attached to the integrated access device. Also attached to transport medium  is a VoIP telephone , as well as a personal computer , which can use system  to access the Internet, among other things.","Further embodiments can include an IP-compatible utility meter , which can allow a utility provider such as a city water department or electrical utility to monitor and bill utility usage over the Internet or the telecommunication service provider's network, and\/or an IP-compatible home security system , which can allow the customer to monitor and control home security functions remotely. Via an Internet connection to NID , a customer on vacation could administer home security system , view images from security cameras, check the status of all sensors, and even turn various lights in the house on and off.","Internal transport medium  can also be coupled to an IP-compatible set-top box , which may have a television  attached. In addition, certain embodiments allow for a video phone  to be included in system  and attached to medium . Processing system  can also support a digital-to-analog converter  (perhaps with a ring generator), to allow direct connection of a POTS phone  to the NID, perhaps for testing purposes or for mandated life-line service.","As mentioned above, NID  can support a variety of other interfaces and attachments as well. For example, in certain embodiments, NID  (and more precisely processing system ) can comprise one or more fiber optic interfaces, including for example, IEEE 1394 interface , as well a variety of standard Ethernet connections, including for instance a category 5 10Base-T interface  that can be used, for example, to attach one or more personal computers (e.g., ) to NID , as well as a wireless interface . Processing system  can also include a coaxial (RG6 and\/or RG59) interface, either through use of a balun  (to convert, for example, from twisted pair to coaxial cable) or through a direct coaxial connection to processing system .","Like the other interfaces, coaxial interface  can support a wide variety of CPE and associated services, including transmission of both a video (e.g., HDTV, NTSC or PAL) information set and a data (e.g., IP data) information set, simultaneously. Supported devices can include an IP residential gateway, which can provide IP to HDTV\/NTSC\/PAL conversion for video display on a television , as well as direct IP connectivity, for example, to provide Internet access to a personal computer .","Through coaxial interface , NID  can also communicate with an IP-compatible set-top box, as well as directly with a cable-ready television , a personal computer  (either via a coaxial connection on the computer or through a balun), a POTS telephone  (for instance, through an integrated access device ), or to any other IP-compatible device , such as a utility meter, home security system or the like. As discussed above, NID  can be programmable and\/or addressable, and in some embodiments, NID  can include an application programming interface  to facilitate in the programming and\/or addressing of NID .","Notably, different embodiments of the ND can provide several benefits, including simultaneous video, data and voice transmission, while maintaining required Quality of Service levels for each particular information set. Further, some embodiments of the NID can comprise a router that is capable of multi-protocol label switching (\u201cMPLS\u201d), which, those skilled in the art will recognize, allows the telecommunication service provider tremendous flexibility in designing the architecture of the external transport medium, including options, such as EFM and tag switching schemes (e.g., MPLS), that provide enhanced features and performance across the provider's network. Various embodiments of the NID also allow for a plurality of virtual private networks to be established through the NID, allowing one or more secure data connections from the customer premises to other locations.","Other embodiments of the present invention provide methods for using demarcation devices, and NIDs in particular. One exemplary method  in accordance with certain embodiments is illustrated on . It should be noted that the blocks displayed on  are arranged for ease of description only, and their order and arrangement should not be considered to limit the scope of the invention; hence, some of functions illustrated on  may be performed in an order different than that illustrated, or they may be omitted entirely.","In block , an external transport medium is provided. A wide variety of external transport media, including any of those discussed above, may be used without varying from the scope of this embodiment. At block , a demarcation device is provided. In a particular embodiment, the demarcation device can be a NID, as described above. In some embodiments, the demarcation device can be attached to an external wall of the customer premises (block ), while in other embodiments, the demarcation device can be located elsewhere, including various locations at the customer premises (such as proximate to a particular CPE or coupled to an internal transport medium in an attic, garage, basement, crawl space or the like. In still other embodiments, the demarcation device could be co-located with a portion of the external transport medium, for instance in a digital loop carrier remote termination closet, at a DSLAM, or even at the distribution point.","In certain embodiments, a distribution point can receive telecommunication information from a telecommunication information provider or other source of telecommunication information (block ). As discussed above, the telecommunication information can comprise a plurality of sets of telecommunication information, and each telecommunication information set can be associated with a particular telecommunication service. In many embodiments, the distribution point can receive the plurality of telecommunication information sets from a plurality of telecommunication information providers.","At block , the telecommunication information can be transmitted to the demarcation device through the external transport medium. Generally, the telecommunication information can be transmitted from the distribution point, although, as discussed above, the distribution point need be neither the ultimate source nor the ultimate destination of the telecommunication information. At block , the distribution point (or other facility) can receive a request, either for configuration information as discussed above, or for a particular telecommunication information set, and, in certain embodiments, the distribution point can forward that request to the appropriate telecommunication information provider (block ). At block , the distribution point can receive information (e.g., telecommunication information, perhaps including configuration information) from the telecommunication information provider that is responsive to the request, and at block , that responsive information can be transmitted to the demarcation device, whether generated by the distribution point (and\/or an associated control point) or the telecommunication information provider.","At block , the demarcation device optionally can separate any telecommunication information received from the distribution point (whether or not sent in response to a request from the demarcation device) into discrete information sets, according to, inter alia, any of the criteria discussed above. Once the information sets have been separated, the demarcation device can take the appropriate action for each. Such actions can include processing the information set (perhaps with a processing system similar to that described above), transmitting the information set to a particular internal transport medium (see block  below), consolidating the information with one or more other information sets for combined transmission onto an internal transport medium, storing the information set (perhaps to a storage device, as discussed above), and discarding the information set, among other things.","At block , the demarcation device optionally can mediate the flow of telecommunication information between the internal transport medium and the external transport medium. This can be done in a variety of ways, including filtering the signals and\/or frequencies sent from one transport medium to the other so as to diminish interference on one network by extraneous information, signals, and\/or frequencies transmitted (intentionally or inadvertently) by the other. Mediating the flow of information can also include filtering the information sent through the demarcation device, such that particular telecommunication information (and\/or information sets) can be treated differently from other information (and\/or information sets). For instance, as discussed above, a given information set can be processed, routed or stored differently than other sets.","At block , the telecommunication information (or a subset thereof) can be transmitted to the customer premises by the demarcation device. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, that while for ease of description, method  has been described with respect to unidirectional information flow (from a distribution point to a customer premises), certain embodiments of the invention easily can accommodate information flow in the opposite direction, as well as bi-directional information flow. Thus, information also could be transmitted from a CPE, through the internal transport medium, to the demarcation device. The demarcation device then could separate that telecommunication information into information sets, if necessary, and take any of a variety of actions (including those discussed above) with respect to each information set, including transmitting the information in the information set to the distribution point via the external medium.","Likewise, methods in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention can support the transmission of telecommunication information from a CPE, through a demarcation device, to a distribution point, and, ultimately to a telecommunication information provider. Further, methods according to other embodiments allow for simultaneous and\/or near simultaneous two-way transmission of telecommunication.","Having described demarcation devices according to embodiments of the invention, attention is directed to , which illustrate systems and methods for replacing such devices. Demarcation devices as described herein may need to be replaced occasionally for various reasons. Such a device may become defective, for example, or, even though programmable and software upgradeable, may ultimately become obsolete. When a demarcation device needs replacing for any reason, it is important that such an operation take place as efficiently as possible.","Efficiently replacing demarcation devices is important for a number or reasons. First, such devices may have accumulated extensive programming and\/or configuration data that may be difficult to replicate. Second, such devices may be integral to the proper operation of many telecommunication devices. Thus, to ensure that such devices are out of service for the minimum time possible and to eliminate the need to re-program such devices, efficient replacement methods are needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["750","752","750","752","754","756","754","758","760","762","764"]},"Attention is now directed to  in combination with . According to this embodiment, a technician, for example, connects a portable computing device  to the service interface - of the old demarcation device  via interface , as shown in . This takes place at block  of . Using, for example, a locally-installed web browser, the technician accesses the microserver -, which may be, for example, a NID controller. This takes place at block . Accessing the microserver - may comprise, for example, logging into the server as an administrator. At block , the technician then selects the appropriate configuration information to transfer to the new demarcation device . Depending upon the specific configuration of the new device  vis-\u00e0-vis the old device , it may not be necessary to transfer the entire configuration of the old device to the new one. At block , the technician establishes an interface between the old demarcation device  and the new demarcation device . This is illustrated by the interface  in .","Continuing with this example, the technician initiates the process to configure the new device. This is shown as block  and comprises providing the configuration information from the old device to the new device via the interface . At block , the technician interfaces the new demarcation device  to both the network and the premises. In some embodiments, this comprises removing the connections from the old device  and connecting them to the new device . In other embodiments, however, the devices may be connected in parallel for a period of time, thereby allowing the old device to be replaced with the new device without an interruption in any of the services the customer receives. In either case, at block  the new demarcation device registers with the network. Registering with the network may comprise providing its physical address and specific configurations.","The example of replacing a demarcation device illustrated and described with respect to  is but one example, and those skilled in the art will realize others in light of this disclosure.  provide a second example. In this example, as with the last, a technician establishes a connection to the old demarcation device  at block , accesses the microserver  at block , and selects the configuration information to transfer. At block , however, the technician establishes an interface  between the computing device  and the service interface - of the new demarcation device . The technician then initiates the a process to configure the new device at block . In this example, configuring the new device comprises extracting information from the old device  via the interface  and transferring the information to the new device via the interface . In some cases, this comprises a two-step process of first copying the information to the computing device  then downloading the information to the new device. In other examples, this comprises a one-step process of simply streaming the information from the old device to the new device via the computing device.","As with the process described with respect to , the new device is interfaced to the network and the premises at block  and the new device registers with the network at block .
