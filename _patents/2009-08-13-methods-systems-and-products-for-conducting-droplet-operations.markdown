herein, the following terms have the meanings indicated.","\u201cActivate\u201d with reference to one or more electrodes means effecting a change in the electrical state of the one or more electrodes which results in a droplet operation.","\u201cDroplet\u201d means a volume of liquid on a droplet actuator that is at least partially bounded by filler fluid. For example, a droplet may be completely surrounded by filler fluid or may be bounded by filler fluid and one or more surfaces of the droplet actuator. Droplets may, for example, be aqueous or non-aqueous or may be mixtures or emulsions including aqueous and non-aqueous components. Droplets may take a wide variety of shapes; nonlimiting examples include generally disc shaped, slug shaped, truncated sphere, ellipsoid, spherical, partially compressed sphere, hemispherical, ovoid, cylindrical, and various shapes formed during droplet operations, such as merging or splitting or formed as a result of contact of such shapes with one or more surfaces of a droplet actuator.","\u201cDroplet Actuator\u201d means a device for manipulating droplets. For examples of droplet actuators, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,911,132, entitled \u201cApparatus for Manipulating Droplets by Electrowetting-Based Techniques,\u201d issued on Jun. 28, 2005 to Pamula et al.; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/343,284, entitled \u201cApparatuses and Methods for Manipulating Droplets on a Printed Circuit Board,\u201d filed on filed on Jan. 30, 2006; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,773,566, entitled \u201cElectrostatic Actuators for Microfluidics and Methods for Using Same,\u201d issued on Aug. 10, 2004 and 6,565,727, entitled \u201cActuators for Microfluidics Without Moving Parts,\u201d issued on Jan. 24, 2000, both to Shenderov et al.; Pollack et al., International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2006\/047486, entitled \u201cDroplet-Based Biochemistry,\u201d filed on Dec. 11, 2006; and Roux et al., U.S. Patent Pub. No. 20050179746, entitled \u201cDevice for Controlling the Displacement of a Drop Between two or Several Solid Substrates,\u201d published on Aug. 18, 2005; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Certain droplet actuators will include a substrate, droplet operations electrodes associated with the substrate, one or more dielectric and\/or hydrophobic layers atop the substrate and\/or electrodes forming a droplet operations surface, and optionally, a top substrate separated from the droplet operations surface by a gap. One or more reference electrodes may be provided on the top and\/or bottom substrates and\/or in the gap. In various embodiments, the manipulation of droplets by a droplet actuator may be electrode mediated, e.g., electrowetting mediated or dielectrophoresis mediated or Coulombic force mediated. Examples of other methods of controlling fluid flow that may be used in the droplet actuators of the invention include devices that induce hydrodynamic fluidic pressure, such as those that operate on the basis of mechanical principles (e.g. external syringe pumps, pneumatic membrane pumps, vibrating membrane pumps, vacuum devices, centrifugal forces, piezoelectric\/ultrasonic pumps and acoustic forces); electrical or magnetic principles (e.g. electroosmotic flow, electrokinetic pumps, ferrofluidic plugs, electrohydrodynamic pumps, attraction or repulsion using magnetic forces and magnetohydrodynamic pumps); thermodynamic principles (e.g. gas bubble generation\/phase-change-induced volume expansion); other kinds of surface-wetting principles (e.g. electrowetting, and optoelectrowetting, as well as chemically, thermally, structurally and radioactively induced surface-tension gradients); gravity; surface tension (e.g., capillary action); electrostatic forces (e.g., electroosmotic flow); centrifugal flow (substrate disposed on a compact disc and rotated); magnetic forces (e.g., oscillating ions causes flow); magnetohydrodynamic forces; and vacuum or pressure differential. In certain embodiments, combinations of two or more of the foregoing techniques may be employed in droplet actuators of the invention.","\u201cDroplet operation\u201d means any manipulation of a droplet on a droplet actuator. A droplet operation may, for example, include: loading a droplet into the droplet actuator; dispensing one or more droplets from a source droplet; splitting, separating or dividing a droplet into two or more droplets; transporting a droplet from one location to another in any direction; merging or combining two or more droplets into a single droplet; diluting a droplet; mixing a droplet; agitating a droplet; deforming a droplet; retaining a droplet in position; incubating a droplet; heating a droplet; vaporizing a droplet; condensing a droplet from a vapor; cooling a droplet; disposing of a droplet; transporting a droplet out of a droplet actuator; other droplet operations described herein; and\/or any combination of the foregoing. The terms \u201cmerge,\u201d \u201cmerging,\u201d \u201ccombine,\u201d \u201ccombining\u201d and the like are used to describe the creation of one droplet from two or more droplets. It should be understood that when such a term is used in reference to two or more droplets, any combination of droplet operations sufficient to result in the combination of the two or more droplets into one droplet may be used. For example, \u201cmerging droplet A with droplet B,\u201d can be achieved by transporting droplet A into contact with a stationary droplet B, transporting droplet B into contact with a stationary droplet A, or transporting droplets A and B into contact with each other. The terms \u201csplitting,\u201d \u201cseparating\u201d and \u201cdividing\u201d are not intended to imply any particular outcome with respect to size of the resulting droplets (i.e., the size of the resulting droplets can be the same or different) or number of resulting droplets (the number of resulting droplets may be 2, 3, 4, 5 or more). The term \u201cmixing\u201d refers to droplet operations which result in more homogenous distribution of one or more components within a droplet. Examples of \u201cloading\u201d droplet operations include microdialysis loading, pressure assisted loading, robotic loading, passive loading, and pipette loading. In various embodiments, the droplet operations may be electrode mediated, e.g., electrowetting mediated or dielectrophoresis mediated.","\u201cFiller fluid\u201d means a fluid associated with a droplet operations substrate of a droplet actuator, which fluid is sufficiently immiscible with a droplet phase to render the droplet phase subject to electrode-mediated droplet operations. The filler fluid may, for example, be a low-viscosity oil, such as silicone oil. Other examples of filler fluids are provided in International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2006\/047486, entitled, \u201cDroplet-Based Biochemistry,\u201d filed on Dec. 11, 2006; International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2008\/072604, entitled \u201cUse of additives for enhancing droplet actuation,\u201d filed on Aug. 8, 2008; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20080283414, entitled \u201cElectrowetting Devices,\u201d filed on May 17, 2007; the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The filler fluid may fill the entire gap of the droplet actuator or may coat one or more surfaces of the droplet actuator. Filler fluid may be conductive or non-conductive.","The terms \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d are used throughout the description with reference to the top and bottom substrates of the droplet actuator for convenience only, since the droplet actuator is functional regardless of its position in space.","When a given component, such as a layer, region or substrate, is referred to herein as being disposed or formed \u201con\u201d another component, that given component can be directly on the other component or, alternatively, intervening components (for example, one or more coatings, layers, interlayers, electrodes or contacts) can also be present. It will be further understood that the terms \u201cdisposed on\u201d and \u201cformed on\u201d are used interchangeably to describe how a given component is positioned or situated in relation to another component. Hence, the terms \u201cdisposed on\u201d and \u201cformed on\u201d are not intended to introduce any limitations relating to particular methods of material transport, deposition, or fabrication.","When a liquid in any form (e.g., a droplet or a continuous body, whether moving or stationary) is described as being \u201con\u201d, \u201cat\u201d, or \u201cover\u201d an electrode, array, matrix or surface, such liquid could be either in direct contact with the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface, or could be in contact with one or more layers or films that are interposed between the liquid and the electrode\/array\/matrix\/surface.","When a droplet is described as being \u201con\u201d or \u201cloaded on\u201d a droplet actuator, it should be understood that the droplet is arranged on the droplet actuator in a manner which facilitates using the droplet actuator to conduct one or more droplet operations on the droplet, the droplet is arranged on the droplet actuator in a manner which facilitates sensing of a property of or a signal from the droplet, and\/or the droplet has been subjected to a droplet operation on the droplet actuator.","The present invention provides modified droplet actuator systems, software, and software-executed methods for use in droplet actuator operation and droplet actuator systems that are configured and programmed to execute such software. An aspect of the software components of the invention is an interface description file for each hardware component of a microfluidics system that allows hardware components to be changed without modifying the program for performing droplet operations protocols. Another aspect of the software components of the invention is the establishment of electrode-to-electrode relationships and other aspects of droplet actuator configurations, which may be used when programming droplet operations protocols.

Another aspect of the software components of the invention is a droplet actuator description file that contains the physical and electrical description of the droplet actuator. Another aspect of the software components of the invention is a router component for determining routes of droplet operations in a droplet actuator. Another aspect of the software components of the invention is the use of tri-state vectors for programming sequences in a droplet actuator. Still other aspects will be apparent from the ensuing description of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","100","100","100","102","102","102","104","100","102","104"]},"The components illustrated in  may be a mix of manufacturers, models, and even different operating principles. Some combinations of the controller , the interface , and the droplet actuator  may have communications or configuration problems, and some combinations may even be incompatible. That is, the controller , the interface , and the droplet actuator  may not \u201ctalk\u201d to each other, thus degrading the droplet operations performed by the droplet actuator . The controller , for example, has logical data channels that correspond to a physical input\/output (\u201cI\/O\u201d) pin assignment. The droplet actuator  and the interface  also have their respective physical input\/output pin assignments. If these pin assignments are mismatched, the controller , the interface , and\/or the droplet actuator  may not correctly perform the desired droplet operations.","Exemplary embodiments overcome any incompatibilities. Exemplary embodiments utilize one or more interface description files  to ensure that the controller , the interface , and\/or the droplet actuator  perform the desired droplet operations. The interface description files  translate inputs to outputs. A controller interface description file , for example, describes the logical and physical inputs\/outputs to\/from the controller . An actuator interface description file  describes the logical and physical inputs\/outputs to\/from the droplet actuator . Similarly, a description file  may also describe the logical and physical inputs\/outputs to\/from the interface . The interface description files , in other words, map inputs to outputs, whether logical or physical. , for example, illustrates the controller interface description file  as a table  that associates, maps, or otherwise relates logical channels  to physical pin assignments . This mapping transforms the controller's logical inputs\/outputs into the corresponding input\/output pin assignments. The actuator interface description file  performs a similar mapping of inputs (whether logical or physical) to outputs (whether logical or physical) for the droplet actuator . The description file  for the interface  performs a similar mapping transformation. The interface description files  thus permit any droplet actuator  to be used with any controller  and\/or with any interface . That is, the interface description files  allow any component to be interchanged with another manufacturer or model, regardless of each component's logical and physical requirements. All that is needed is a component's corresponding interface description file that maps the component's inputs to outputs, whether logical or physical. Once a logical channel  is mapped to a physical pin assignment  for the droplet actuator , for example, any droplet operation may be communicated to the droplet actuator via the corresponding physical pin .","The interface description files may be locally or remotely maintained.  illustrates the interface description files  as all being locally stored within the controller .

For example, when the droplet actuator  is replaced with a different droplet actuator of a different design, a new actuator interface description file  is loaded into the memory (illustrated as reference numeral  in ) of the controller . The new actuator interface description file  corresponds to the different droplet actuator and describes the associated pin assignments.

For example, the flow of droplet operations across droplet operations electrode F (the droplet operations electrode nearest to the waste reservoir ) may be defined as one-way toward the waste reservoir . That is, a droplet is permitted to only flow from the droplet operations electrode F and into the waste reservoir . Fluid is not allowed, however, to flow from the waste reservoir  back to the droplet operations electrode F.","\u201cTwo-way\u201d relationships may also be defined. A two-way relationship permits a droplet to flow in two directions across an electrode . A two-way relationship, in other words, permits fluidic movement into and from an electrode . Referring again to , droplet operations electrode K and, likewise, droplet operations electrode J may both be defined as two-way electrodes. This two-way relationship means that fluid is allowed to flow in any direction between droplet operations electrode K and droplet operations electrode J. Fluid may flow, for example, from droplet operations electrode K and into droplet operations electrode J. Fluid may also flow from droplet operations electrode J and into droplet operations electrode K.","Another electrode-to-electrode relationship is a \u201cneighbor\u201d relationship. With respect to a certain electrode , a neighbor electrode may be any immediately adjacent electrode. Droplet operations may be allowed directly between neighbor electrodes, i.e., a digital fluidic path may exist between neighbor electrodes. Again referring to , the droplet operations electrode C has, as \u201cneighbors,\u201d electrodes B, D, H, and G. The neighbors of droplet operations electrode H are electrodes C and I, and the neighbors of droplet operations electrode E are electrodes D and J. Droplet operations electrode F has electrode G and the waste reservoir  as neighbors. The neighbor of droplet operations electrode M is electrode L. Other neighbor relations may likewise be defined for all the electrodes within the droplet actuator . (As another example, electrodes B and D may be defined as neighbors of electrode H.) Fluidic movement may be permitted, or prohibited, between any neighbor electrodes .","The \u201cneighbor\u201d relationship may also refer to location and connectivity. A neighbor electrode may be a physically adjacent electrode, but the neighbor electrode(s) may also imply electrical connectivity. That is, the (physical) neighbors of an electrode may determine where to a droplet may next travel. When a droplet needs to be restricted from moving to a particular electrode, the neighbor relationship may be altered or changed to implement that movement restriction. Geometrical relationships between electrodes, however, may be separately maintained for rendering the physical integrated circuit and need not explicitly contain adjacency information.","Another electrode-to-electrode relationship is an \u201cinterface\u201d relationship. The concept of neighbor relationships may be extended to bridge electronic circuit chips. One chip, for example, may fluidically connect to another chip and may, therefore, define a neighbor relationship between electrodes on two different chips.","Another example of an electrode-to-electrode relationship is a \u201cfriend\u201d relationship. With respect to a certain electrode, a \u201cfriend\u201d electrode  is any electrode this is not immediately adjacent, but which when activated, may influence droplet operations at the certain electrode. Droplet operations may, or may not, be allowed directly between friend electrodes, i.e., a fluidic path may or may not exist between friend electrodes. For example, electrodes that are diagonally positioned from one another may be categorized as friend electrodes. Again referring to , the friends of droplet operations electrode G are electrodes B and D; the friends of droplet operations electrode B are G and H; the friends of droplet operations electrode H are B and C; the friends of droplet operations electrode D are G and H; and so on. Fluidic movement may be permitted, or prohibited, between any friend electrodes. The friend relationships were developed to help ensure that assertion of an electrode (e.g., friend) may not adversely affect a droplet sitting on a given electrode (e.g., the designer may not want to assert that electrode's friend). Friend relationships need not imply physical proximity.","The electrode-to-electrode relationships may also include one-way and two-way friends. An example of a one-way friend relationship is that the waste reservoir  may be a friend to both droplet operations electrode L and M, but, droplet operations electrodes L and M are not friends of the waste reservoir . When the waste reservoir  is activated, the force exerted by the waste reservoir  on droplets at operations electrodes L and M is enough to adversely influence the droplets. In other words, when the waste reservoir  is electrically activated, the waste reservoir  may electrically affect the droplet operations performed by droplet operations electrodes L and M. However, when the droplet operations electrodes L and\/or M are electrically activated, their individual and\/or combined energy is not sufficient to influence droplet operations at the waste reservoir . Because the droplet operations electrodes L and M may be disproportionate in size compared to the waste reservoir , the droplet operations electrodes L and M may have little or even negligible electrostatic effects at the waste reservoir .","Another example of a one-way friend relationship is provided. Droplet operations electrode A may be a friend to droplet operations electrodes I, E, J, K, L, and M; but, droplet operations electrodes I, E, J, K, L, and M may not be friends of droplet operations electrode A. This is because a control line  of droplet operations electrode A is routed in close proximity to droplet operations electrodes I, E, J, K, L, and M. Therefore, when the control line  is activated (to activate droplet operations electrode A), its energy may influence droplet operations at droplet operations electrodes I, E, J, K, L, and\/or M. However, the energy of droplet operations electrodes I, E, J, K, L, and\/or M, when activated, will not influence droplet operations at droplet operations electrode A because of the large distance therebetween. The control line  may thus electrically\/electromagnetically affect droplet operations electrodes I, E, J, K, L, and\/or M, but these same electrodes may not affect the control line . If an applied voltage at any of the electrodes I, E, J, K, L, and\/or M increases, though, any of these electrodes may affect the control line . Similarly, a low-enough voltage or current in the control line  may produce negligible effects at the electrodes I, E, J, K, L, and\/or M.","Relationships, though, are likely more complex.  illustrates a simple electrode configuration  within the droplet actuator . A more complex design, having hundreds or thousands of electrodes, may require more complex definitions of electrode-to-electrode relationships. Moreover, the droplet actuator  may have several layers of devices, conductors, and ground planes, and so a more complex electrode configuration may require a more complex definition of electrode-to-electrode relationships.","Friends may thus influence droplet operations.  illustrates a sphere  of influence around droplet operations electrode G. The sphere  of influence graphically illustrates the influence droplet operations electrode G may have on neighboring electrodes F, C, B, and D. When a voltage is applied to electrode G, the voltage may attract or repel another droplet at a neighboring electrode. The ON condition at the droplet operations electrode G may thus require that any neighboring electrodes be OFF to avoid influential effects. Relationships may also be specified by solving out multiple sphere of influence. Computational complexity, however, increases, so pre-specifying the relationships may be simpler.","Friends may thus be electrical relationships. A friend relationship may influence any energy, electrical, or electromagnetic relationship or effect at a single electrode, between two or more electrodes, and\/or at any component within the droplet actuator . If the friend relationship is one-way, then the electrical effect is more influential at one location and perhaps negligible at another location within the droplet actuator . When the friend relationship is two-way, then the electrical effect may influence neighbor, adjacent, or diagonal electrodes or other components within the droplet actuator .","These electrical relationships may influence hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties. Because a friend relationship may induce an electrical\/electromagnetic field at another electrode, hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties may be affected. An induced electrical\/electromagnetic field, for example, may make a surface of an adjacent electrode more, or less, hydrophobic. A stray electrical\/electromagnetic field, for example, may cause a neighboring electrode to become more, or less, hydrophilic, thus affecting droplet operations. The neighbor and\/or friend relationships between electrodes may thus describe electrical\/electromagnetic effects that increase or decrease hydrophobic\/hydrophilic properties.","One or more weighting factors  may also be defined. The weighting factor  may be assigned to any neighbor and\/or friend relationship. For example, a certain friend electrode may have a weighting factor  of one (1), while another friend electrode may have a weighting factor  of two (2). The numeric value of the weighing factor  may be bounded by any upper limit and\/or by any lower limit, with any increment in between. The higher the weighting factor , then perhaps the higher the influence.","The weighting factors  may be applied to fluidic neighbors. Sometimes the trip between fluidic neighbors is expensive and sometimes the trip is not (e.g., low weight). The weighting factors  may thus be applied when evaluating long trips. If the total cost is the smallest of all possibilities, then the path may be optimal. It also allows choosing between paths on the basis of cost. The relationship can have a negative weight, but an infinite weight may not make practical sense (for example, if a weighting factor is infinite, it may be best to simply remove the relationship).","These electrode-to-electrode relationships (with or without the directional components described above) may be incorporated in any of the interface description files . The electrowetting application , for example, may access, retrieve, or reference the electrode-to-electrode relationships when programming droplet operations protocols. The actuator interface description file  contains the physical and electrical description of the droplet actuator . An a priori knowledge of the electrode-to-electrode relationships may be useful when programming droplet operations protocols in parallel vectors of the droplet actuator  (as later paragraphs will explain). A detection of droplets (e.g., capacitance detection) may determine the fluidic layout of a chip by just randomly asserting vectors to build up experience to be used a posteriori.","The actuator interface description file  is not limited to a file format only. This actuator information may be stored and retrieved in any number of ways. In one example, software objects are generated rather than interface description files. The droplet actuator information may be in a file format (e.g., droplet actuator description file ) for long term storage only.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"],"b":["400","400","402","136","400","404","406","406","404","400","132","100","100","404","400","400","406"]},"Each predefined electrode element may perform a function.

Associated with each sequence  may also be certain attributes or flags. For example, a \u201cfixed flag\u201d means that the sequence must not be stalled (i.e., held up). This is useful for splitting, dispensing and other time-sensitive sequences. A \u201cvariable flag\u201d means that the exact duration of the sequence is not known at compile time and, as such, it should not be merged with a fixed sequence. A \u201cpriority flag\u201d means that a sequence  having a priority value X is never merged with any other sequence having a priority value less than X.","The sequence scheduling algorithm  provides the ability to merge sequences.

The second part  of the driver model memory space  may be one or more virtual address spaces that correspond to a particular hardware peripheral device. Each special variable may be divided into fixed blocks  of a pre-prescribed number  of variables. Each block may correspond to a function. A \u201cmove droplet\u201d function, for example, may have a pre-prescribed location of virtual address space. Other functions, such as manipulating temperature and counting photons, may have their own corresponding blocks of virtual address space. Each block may be populated with known, popular, or custom variables that are associated with, or relevant to, the corresponding function. The block  associated with the \u201cmove droplet\u201d function, for example, may have a pre-prescribed memory space for setting voltage , setting control mode , and asserting vectors . Any other predefined variables associated with the \u201cmove droplet\u201d function may also be pre-prescribed within the block . Each driver communicating with the microfluidics system  may claim a memory block and interpret reads\/writes to the corresponding memory block as actions that the controller  performs.","One advantage of the driver model memory space  is that multiple, different peripherals may claim the same memory block. Because a common abstract address block may be shared by multiple peripherals, the peripherals appear to be same to a software application (such as the electrowetting application ), even though the peripheral hardware is different. When the controller  boots or starts, the controller  may perform a check to determine what peripherals are connected and communicating with the controller .

As a particular assay is performed, electrodes may be electrically activated to move one or more droplets. When the simulation component  performs a simulation of an assay, the simulation component  may track what individual electrodes and\/or groups of electrodes are repeatedly activated in the simulation. The simulation component , in other words, may maintain a table in the memory  that logs and sums the number of times a particular electrode is turned ON and\/or turned OFF. The simulation component  may maintain a counter associated with each electrode. The simulation component  may sum the activations to obtain a total number of times each electrode in the simulation is turned ON and turned OFF. This droplet activity is monitored throughout a simulated assay. The traffic map , then, visually displays what electrodes or group of electrodes are heavily activated during the simulated assay, and what electrodes are little used or unused.","The traffic map  is particularly useful in validation. A validation assay may be developed to purposefully test every electrode in the droplet actuator . When the validation assay is simulated, the traffic map  would indicate what electrodes were activated during the validation assay. The traffic map  is updated in real time, so the slider control  may be used to skip forward and backward in time to view the traffic at any moment.","The traffic map  may also utilize color coding. When an electrode is activated a high number of times during a simulation, the electrode may be colored (such as red coloring) to indicate high usage. A green coloring may indicate low levels of traffic. Different threshold values of activation may be defined and associated with a software color. No coloring may indicate no traffic at a particular electrode or group of electrodes.","The traffic map  may also be used to predict failures. When a particular electrode has high usage (perhaps indicated by a red software coloring), then that electrode may be more prone to failure. When an electrode is highly used during an assay, then that electrode may also be more prone to contamination, which may lead to degraded results. The simulation component , then, may be configured with a maximum number of activations for any electrode. If any simulation causes an individual electrode's activations to exceed the maximum number of activations during an assay, then the simulation component  may determine another route that reduced the potential for failure.","The traffic map  may also visually display a current position of any droplet.

If the assay requires twenty (20) droplets of reagent, then the R reservoir alone cannot supply the assay. Another reservoir must be used, and\/or the assay must be reconfigured.","Multiple reservoirs may be used. If a single reservoir cannot dispense the needed material, an assay may use multiple reservoirs. Reservoirs R and R, for example, may be combined to dispense the needed amount of material. Reservoirs R and R may, likewise, be combined to dispense the needed amount of material. The assay may thus be flexible and permit either reservoir pair (R and R) or (R and R) to be used.","Parallel assays, however, may impose constraints. When multiple assays are being performed in parallel, any reservoir, or combination of reservoirs, may be claimed or needed by a particular assay. Suppose a first assay is assigned reservoirs R and R, and a second parallel assay is assigned reservoirs R and R. The simulation component  may thus determine what reservoirs can, and cannot, be shared when multiple assays are performed. The assignment of the reservoirs may thus be indicated in the reservoir assignment map .","Bussing may also affect the assignment of reservoirs. The droplet actuator , as earlier explained, may have hundreds or even thousands of electrodes. Each electrode, of course, may have its own dedicated activation circuit. The overall circuitry, however, would be very complex. Bussing may thus be used to simply the circuitry of the droplet actuator . When bussing is used, multiple electrodes are connected to the same activation circuit or \u201cbus.\u201d When an individual circuit bus is activated, all the electrodes connected to that circuit are ON. The assay development application , and\/or the simulation component , may thus include software code that determines what bus circuits need to be activated to correctly move a droplet. When bussing is used, one or more of the reservoirs R through R may also be connected to the same bus circuit.","The reservoir assignment map  may indicate the bussed reservoirs. The reservoir assignment map  may visually indicate what reservoirs are bussed together on the same bus circuit. , for example, illustrates a solid line (illustrated as reference numeral ) connecting reservoirs R and R. The solid line  indicates reservoirs R and R are commonly activated by the same bus circuit. If the common bus circuit is activated, in other words, then both reservoirs R and R may dispense a droplet. Reservoirs R and R may, likewise, be bussed together, as may be reservoirs R and R and reservoirs R and R.","Bussing may thus impose additional constraints or restrictions. Suppose a first assay uses reservoir R, but the same first assay will not use reservoir R. Reservoir R, then, cannot be assigned to a second assay. The assignment of reservoir R to a second assay would cause both reservoirs R and R to dispense droplets, thus interfering with the first assay. The first and the second assay, then, may not be able to be run in parallel.","Each assay may publish or present its reservoir requirements. Some assays may require a certain reservoir, while other assays may be more flexible and not care from which reservoir a droplet is dispensed. Each assay may thus determine its associated restrictions, and each assay may report options for different combinations of reservoir operations.
