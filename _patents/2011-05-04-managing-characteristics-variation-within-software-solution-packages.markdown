{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The technical field relates generally to software solution packages, and more particularly to managing characteristics variation within software solution packages.","Business software is generally any software that helps an enterprise to manage its business. The business software may be categorized as individual business software (that caters to a specific need of a specific enterprise) and standard business software (that caters to the specific need of several enterprises). For example, a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software is the standard business software that caters to the customer relationship management of several enterprises. The enterprise may deal in various industries and may have various branches all over the globe. The standard business software may be configured based upon the type of industries (i.e., verticalisation) and\/or countries (i.e., globalization) where the business software has to be implemented. For example, if the enterprise \u2018A\u2019 deals in telecommunication, transport, and medicine industries and has branches all over the globe, the enterprise \u2018A\u2019 can configure the standard business software (e.g., CRM) to cater to the need of its various industries and branches.","The standard business software is generally configured by a software developer or a software consultant of the enterprise. Essentially, the software consultant is provided training to configure (customize) and\/or maintain the standard business software based upon the requirement of the enterprise. However, the training provided to the software consultant is very costly and time consuming. Further, the enterprise may be interested in the specific domain of the standard business software (e.g., Activity and Opportunity Process within CRM) however, the software consultant has to undergo training in all aspects of the CRM which is again time-consuming.","A software solution package (e.g., Rapid Deployment Solution by SAP\u00ae) is developed to address the above mentioned problems. Essentially, the software solution package includes the standard business software along with a training material (modeling charts\/maps, etc.). The training material can be easily referred to by the software consultants. The training material helps in installing the standard business software in the enterprise. Essentially, the software solution package helps the software consultant in installing and configuring the standard business software without undergoing the time consuming and costly training. Further, the software solution package may include specific standard business software with a well defined scope of business functionality which helps the consultant to implement the solution package in the domain of interest, e.g., a payroll within HR (Human Resources).","The software solution package also includes a configuration list that defines a business scenario (business circumstances), one or more business processes associated with the business scenario, and one or more process steps associated with each business processes. Essentially, the configuration list specifies each process step and the business software that is to be executed for realizing the process step. Usually, the software consultant manually configures the configuration list to specify the software(s) to be executed for one or more process steps.","However, it might be inconvenient and time consuming for the software consultant to manually configure or prepare the configuration list. Further, the software to be used for a given process step may vary depending on number of characteristics, e.g., a country and\/or industry in which the process step has to be implemented. For example, the process step \u201cpaying taxes\u201d differs across countries while the process steps related to \u201clogistics\u201d differs across industries. Furthermore, it might be troublesome for the software consultant to manually configure or prepare the list with all possible characteristic variations. Again, it might be inconvenient for the software consultant to repeat configuration of the process steps for various industries\/countries. Additionally, it might also be difficult and time consuming to define rule(s) and exception(s) that govern each process step. Finally, it may also be inefficient and inconvenient for the software consultant and a software provider to have individual solution packages for every combination of industry and country with only small deviations inside the solution packages.","It would be desirable, therefore, to efficiently manage characteristics variation within software solution packages that among other things obviates the above mentioned problems.","Various embodiments of systems and methods for managing characteristics variation within software solution packages are described herein. In one aspect, a method includes displaying one or more identifiers corresponding to one or more solution packages, receiving a user selection of the solution package, rendering one or more industries and one or more countries supported by the selected solution package, receiving a user selection of at least one of the one or more countries and the one or more industries, based upon the selection of at least one of the one or more countries and the one or more industries, identifying modeling element(s) associated with the solution package, receiving a user selection of the modeling element comprising one or more characteristics, and based upon the user selection, providing one or more configuration blocks to configure the selected solution package by setting or configuring the corresponding one or more characteristics of the modeling element. The configuration for specifying applicable industries (verticalisation) and\/or countries (globalization) for the modeling element (e.g., process step) makes the solution packages very flexible and reusable. Essentially, the modeling element can be configured easily and efficiently using the configuration block(s).","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for managing characteristics variation within solution packages are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","1","120","130","130","110","1","110","1","130","110","1","110","1","110","1","120","140","140","1","1","110","1","1","1","140","1","1","120","150","110","1","150","160","190","160","190","120","110","1","160","190","110","1"],"i":["n","n"]},"The solution package () may be selected from the list  based upon the requirement of a business enterprise. The list  includes the identifier corresponding to the solution package (). The identifier may be at least one of a textual label (e.g., \u2018CRM Rapid Deployment Solution\u2019) and a symbol. The identifier corresponding to the solution package () may be selected to select the solution package (). Essentially, the user selects the solution package () based upon the requirement of the business enterprise. The list  includes various types of solution packages for business enterprises, e.g., \u2018CRM Rapid Deployment for Sales\u2019, \u2018SAP\u00ae Extended Warehouse Management Rapid-Deployment Solution\u2019, \u2018IT Service Desk Operation\u2019 etc. If the user is interested in sales requirement of the enterprise, the user may select \u2018CRM Rapid Deployment for Sales\u2019 from the list . Essentially, the user analyzes the list  to select the solution package ().","Once the solution package () is selected from the list , the characteristic management module  renders the list . The list  illustrates the countries (C-Cn) and\/or the industries (I-Im) supported by the solution package () (i.e., for which the solution package () is applicable). The user may select the one or more countries and\/or the one or more industries from the list , based upon the requirement. For example, the user (e.g., the software consultant) who configures the software for use in a telecommunication industry located in India may select the industry I (Telecom) and the country C (India) from the list .","Once the country C and the industry I are selected from the list , the characteristics management module  identifies the BOM  applicable for the selected country C and the industry I. The BOM  includes the modeling elements (-). The modeling element may be a business scenario (business circumstance) , a business process  associated with the business scenario , and a process step ( or ) associated with the business process . Essentially, the BOM  may include one or more business scenarios. Each of the business scenarios includes one or more business processes, e.g., the business scenario  includes the business process . Each business process intern includes one or more process steps, e.g., the business process  includes the process steps (-).","Each modeling element (-) has one or more characteristics associated with it. The characteristics may be a country, an industry, and a product. For example, the business scenario  may have two characteristics namely a country characteristic and an industry characteristic. Similarly, the business process  or the process steps (-) may also have the characteristics namely the country characteristic and the industry characteristic associated with it.","The characteristic (e.g., industry or country) of the modeling element (e.g., the process step ) has one or more values. For example, the country characteristic of the process step  may have values {India, Pakistan, and China} and the industry characteristic of the process step  may have values {Automotive and Telecommunication}. Essentially, the user can configure one or more characteristics (e.g., country characteristic, industry characteristic, etc.) of the modeling element (e.g., the process step ). The user configures the characteristic (e.g., country) of the modeling element (e.g., the process step ) by specifying\/assigning the values (e.g., India and China) for the characteristic (i.e., the country).","The BOM  may be analyzed to identify the modeling element and the characteristic(s) of the modeling element that is required to be configured. For example, the user may analyze the BOM  of the solution package \u2018CRM Sales\u2019 or () that includes the following modeling elements:\n\n","It may be analyzed that the process step , i.e., the determination of taxes varies from country to country and therefore, the process step  (modeling element ) may be required to be configured. Essentially, if the solution package () is required to be implemented in \u2018Brazil\u2019, the user needs to configure the country characteristic of the process step .","The modeling element (e.g., the process step ) is configured using the one or more configuration blocks. Essentially, each characteristic (country, industry, etc.) of the modeling element (e.g., the process step ) may be configured using a corresponding configuration block. The country characteristic of the modeling element may be configured using a country configuration block and the industry characteristic of the modeling element may be configured using an industry configuration block. There may be other configuration blocks related to other characteristics, e.g., product type, etc. For example, the country characteristic of the process step  may be configured using the country configuration block () (refer to ) and the industry characteristic of the process step  may be configured using the industry configuration block () (refer to ). Similarly, the country characteristic of the process step  may be configured using the country configuration block () (refer to ) and the industry characteristic of the process step  may be configured using the industry configuration block () (refer to )",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["220","1","220","1","310","320","310","310","310","310","190","320"]},"The country characteristic vector  includes at least two fields (-). One of the two fields (i.e., first field ) receives one or more values of the characteristics (country). Essentially, the user enters the value(s) of the characteristic (country) in the first field .
