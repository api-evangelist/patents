{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Overhead (electrical) power transmission line include: support structures, or towers, insulators, and a conductor that is supported by the towers. In some cases, long distances may be covered by an overhead power transmission line. An overhead power transmission line typically includes: multiple dead-end towers, multiple tangent (suspension) towers and conductors. Typically, one type of conductor is used in the construction of the entire overhead power transmission line comprising multiple tangent and dead-end towers.","In general, the invention is directed to methods for selecting a conductor configuration within a transmission line tension section when the conductor configuration includes at least two different types of conductors that are spliced in series, where different types of conductors have at least one different parameter between them. A transmission line tension section refers to a portion of the overhead power transmission line that extends from one dead-end tower to another dead-end tower; a transmission line tension section can include multiple tangent towers. The distance between two adjacent towers, either tangent (also referred to as \u201csuspension\u201d) or dead end towers, is referred to as a span. A tension subsection is some portion of the transmission line tension section that includes only one type of conductor. This tension subsection may cover more or less than one span between two adjacent towers, and two different tension subsections may meet within a span or at a tower. The conductor configuration defines the multiple tension subsections of the transmission line tension section (e.g., how much of the transmission line tension section is made up of each conductor type). As an example, two tension subsections that make up a portion of the overhead power transmission line may meet within a span or at the attachment point to a tower. Geographical profile information and overhead power transmission line preferences are used along with predetermined selection rules when selecting the appropriate conductor configuration.","While a user may manually use preferences and equations to determine the useful (including the most desirable or best) available conductor configuration(s) of an overhead power transmission line, a computing device may more efficiently aid the user throughout the selection process. The user may provide transmission line input to define preferences or requirements of the conductor configuration. Some examples of transmission line preferences include electrical characteristics and conductor sag, while examples of selection rules include conductor costs and conductor tension.","In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a method for selecting conductors for an overhead power transmission line including identifying at least one desired parameter of the overhead power transmission line to be supported by at least two towers and selecting a conductor configuration of the overhead power transmission line based upon the identified at least one desired parameter and selection rules. The conductor configuration comprises at least a first conductor and a second conductor of different conductor types.","In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a system that selects conductors for an overhead power transmission line that includes a processor that identifies at least one desired parameter of the overhead power transmission line to be supported by at least two towers and selects the conductor configuration of the overhead power transmission line based upon the identified at least one desired parameter and selection rules. The conductor configuration comprises at least the first conductor and the second conductor of different conductor types.","In an alternative embodiment, the invention is directed to a computer-readable medium having instructions that cause a processor to identify at least one desired parameter of the transmission line tension section to be supported by two dead-end towers and select the conductor configuration of the overhead power transmission line based upon the identified at least one desired parameter and selection rules. The conductor configuration comprises at least the first conductor and the second conductor of different conductor types.","The invention may provide one or more advantages. For example, an overhead power transmission line tension section may be constructed using the advantages available from at least two types of different conductors. This may allow conductors with different sag characteristics or other characteristics (e.g., different ampacity) to be used together where they are needed in the overhead power transmission line tension section. Moreover, these overhead power transmission lines may allow less support structures to be used or a wider variety of terrain to be covered. In addition, the overhead power transmission line may utilize relatively higher cost conductors only where needed, to reduce the cost of installing a new, higher cost overhead conductor.","The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","An overhead power transmission line broadly encompasses the components between an electricity supply source and an electricity destination. One component of an overhead power transmission line is an electrical conductor. Typically, the conductor is a stranded overhead power transfer medium comprised of a plurality of wires twisted together. Other components of an overhead power transmission line include the structures (e.g., transmission towers and distribution poles) that support the elevated conductors and devices that insulate the conductor from the structures.","Conventionally, the overhead power transmission line tension section between two dead ends (e.g., terminating structures) is typically composed of one type of conductor. However, at least two different types of conductors may be joined together to form the entire overhead power transmission line tension section to provide design flexibility and benefits to the overhead power transmission line design between two dead-ends or between at least two tangent towers. Conductors of different types are defined herein as one conductor having at least one parameter different than at least one parameter of another conductor. Each conductor that makes up the overhead power transmission line tension section may be referred to as a tension subsection. Each tension subsection may end at towers or in the middle of a span between two adjacent towers. Different types of conductors may be used in one overhead power transmission line tension section when a repair is needed, the entire overhead power transmission line needs to be replaced, or a new overhead power transmission line needs to be designed. In one example, mixing different types of conductors may allow the overhead power transmission line to utilize conductors with lower sag characteristics in spans that require greater overhead clearance and conductors with higher sag characteristics in spans that do not have specific requirements such as overhead clearance. The resulting conductor configuration of the overhead power transmission line tension section may be less expensive or more effective than constructing the entire overhead power transmission line out of the low sag type of conductor. A conductor is defined by the type of materials, dimensions, electrical properties, and mechanical properties.","Selecting the most appropriate conductor configuration for the overhead power transmission line tension section may be a complicated exercise in considering many variables. In this manner, computer software programs may assist in meeting the requirements of the overhead power transmission line while fulfilling the desires of the user. The software programs may be simple spreadsheets, equation calculators, or full computational models that provide graphical representations of potential conductor configurations. These computer programs may also include performance and cost analyses of the potential conductor configurations that are used when selecting the most appropriate overhead power transmission line configuration.","Types of conductors used for overhead power transmission lines may vary widely between overhead power transmission line due to environmental conditions, electrical requirements, or cost limits. Some conductors may be constructed of steel cores, composite (e.g., aluminum matrix composite and polymeric composite) and Invar (i.e., an iron alloy comprising iron, nickel, and optionally other elements such as chromium, titanium, and carbon, wherein the iron alloy has a thermal expansion coefficient that is less than the linear combination of its constituents) cores, or any other cores commonly known in the art. Each span, or length of the overhead power transmission line tension section between two towers, may include a tension subsection that covers the entire span, and includes one conductor type or a tension subsection that includes multiple conductor types. Each span may cover a large distance (e.g., about 1250 feet (about 400 meters)), but other smaller or larger spans may be included in a designed overhead power transmission line tension section. These span lengths may be determined by the type or types of conductors used in the span. Other span lengths may be, for example, at least 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400, 2700 or even at least about 3,000 meters in length. Tower design may change depending on the length of a given span of the overhead power transmission line tension section.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["13","14","12","13","16","18","20","20","22","23","24","26","28","10","12","13","12","22","23","16","12","24","26","28","13","12","13"]},"User  may be any individual, company, power utility, or party who has an interest in the design of the overhead power transmission line and the selection of conductors for the overhead power transmission line to increase system performance or decrease the cost of the system. In one embodiment, user  is an employee of a manufacturing company that produces conductors suitable for overhead power transmission line applications. In this embodiment, user  may use conductor selection system  to identify possible conductor configurations for the overhead power transmission line and select the useful (including the most desirable or best) conductor configuration(s) for the specific system being designed. The useful (including the most desirable or best) system(s) may be determined as such according to user requests or preferences such as overhead power transmission line performance or total overhead power transmission line cost. In another embodiment, user  is a power company, utility, or other entity that makes decisions, or aids in making decisions, regarding power lines. In such an embodiment, user  may use conductor selection system  to understand which types of conductors could be used given various line preferences and geographical profiles. In another embodiment, user  is a third party that sells or assists in selling conductors.","Computing device  typically includes hardware (not all shown in ) that may include at least one processor , memory  (e.g., random access memory), a device for reading computer-readable media (not shown), and user interface  that may include input\/output devices such as a display, a keyboard, and a pointing device. Computing device  may be, for example, a workstation, a notebook computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a multimedia device, a network server, a mainframe or any other general-purpose or application-specific computing device. Although not shown, computing device  may also include other software, firmware, or combinations thereof, such as an operating system and other application software. Computing device  may read executable software instructions from a computer-readable medium (such as a hard drive, a CD-ROM, or a computer memory), or may receive instructions from another source logically connected to computer, such as another networked computer or server. Moreover, conductor selection system  may be distributed to execute on multiple computers, and may be used remotely by user  and accessible via a web browser or other interface.","In some embodiments, conductor selection system  may include more than one computing device, network connections, network servers, data repository, modeling environments, or any other electronic device that may be beneficial to the performance and operation of the conductor selection system. In other embodiments, conductor selection system  may require some calculations or decisions to be performed by user . These manual portions of conductor selection system  may be required due to user  preferences or special case scenarios that cannot be handled by the conductor selection system.","User interface  may take any form of interface that provides input\/output capabilities. In one embodiment, the user interface is a graphical user interface (GUI), and may comprise, for example, various windows, control bars, menus, switches, radio buttons, or other mechanisms that facilitate presentation and reception of data and interaction with user . One common exemplary user interface is provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. sold under the trade designation \u201cWINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM.\u201d Although described in various embodiments with respect to direct user interaction, user  may also remotely access conductor selection system  via a client device. For example, user interface  may be a web interface presented to a remote client device executing a web browser or other suitable networking software. Moreover, although described with respect to user , user interface  may be invoked by a software agent or other computing device remote to computer device . Additionally, in one embodiment, conductor selection system  may be invoked and utilized without a GUI, via an application programming interface (API) provided by the computing device .","In other embodiments, user interface  may provide 2D or 3D data for the geographical site to which the conductors are to be installed so as to allow user  to view possible conductor configurations of the overhead power transmission line. User interface  may also visualize the geographic profile and towers (structures) used to support the overhead power transmission line. The geographic profile describes a geographic region to which the overhead power transmission line is to be installed. From this visualization, user  may be able to identify conductor sag between towers and adjust the overhead power transmission line parameters (e.g., the transmission line input, used to create the conductor configuration). User interface  may additionally allow user  to view the effect of environmental forces on the overhead power transmission line before user  selects the conductor configuration to be used as the overhead power transmission line.","In some embodiments, user interface  may include more user friendly input devices that user  may use to interact with conductor selection system . For example, user interface  may provide a touch screen to receive user  touch directly when inputting conductor preferences or adjusting tower placement. Alternatively, user interface  may include a touch pad or drawing pad to receive user  input. In cases when at least two users  are concurrently using conductor selection system  from remote computing devices, user interface  may provide separate interfaces viewable by each user or a common interface in which control of the user interface may be exchanged between each user. In this manner, complex projects may be completed in less time and with greater success. In particular, this process may be useful in communication between the manufacturer and a client when designing the overhead power transmission line or between the manufacturer and installation site workers to troubleshoot problems in the field.","Processor  controls the flow of data between user interface  and memory . In some embodiments, processor  may separately communicate with the different elements of memory . Processor  retrieves instructions from model software  which may define possible conductor configurations for the overhead power transmission line based upon the preferences of the overhead power transmission line. Model software  utilizes data from several repositories in order to compute possible conductor configurations. These repositories include geographic profiles  and conductor data . In addition, rules engine  provides instructions to model software  that govern the possible conductor configurations according to selection rules . The data contained in geographic profiles , conductor data , and selection rules  may be pre-existing in memory  or provided by user .","It should be mentioned that the arrangement of components of conductor selection system  is only illustrative, and other arrangements or components may be provided to attain the same result as the example provided herein. For example, software modules may be greater in number and be accessed when necessary or data may be contained within separate memories such as hard disks, optical media, or networked storage devices.","Data defining conductors or suitable overhead power transmission line may include, for example, size, stranding, core fraction, diameter, resistivity, strength, a compressive stress parameter for the conductor's outer strands, compressive strain, associated stress\/strain curves, ruling span, actual span, incline, and a number of ampacity conditions including ambient temperature, wind velocity, wind angle, emissivity, solar absorption, conductor elevation, conductor direction, latitude, total solar flux, sun time (time of day for solar radiation calculations), and atmosphere. Data defining overhead power transmission line preferences may be derived from the data describing the possible conductors, or may be a subset of the data describing the overhead power transmission line. For example, data defining overhead power transmission line preferences may include: maximum conductor diameter, maximum actual span sag, minimum emergency ampacity, maximum horizontal tension overall, maximum tension overall, maximum vertical tension overall, maximum horizontal tension at install, transverse tension, and maximum tension at install. Transverse tension is the force imposed on a conductor, usually by wind, transverse to the overhead power transmission line direction.","Additionally, various overhead power transmission line preferences may be specified as associated with at least one environmental scenario. An environmental scenario is data that defines an environmental condition that the overhead power transmission line may be exposed to in the operation in the field. Often these scenarios represent weather extremes the overhead power transmission line may encounter, as well as the environmental conditions at the time of installation. Environmental scenarios are defined by data such as ambient temperature, thickness of ice buildup, wind pressure, and National Electrical Safety Code overload factor, K. Each environmental scenario, then, may have with it its own set of overhead power transmission line preferences. For example, an environmental scenario may describe blizzard conditions with heavy ice buildup and wind. Line preferences, in terms of maximum horizontal tension, maximum tension, and maximum vertical tension, may be specifically associated with this environmental scenario. These environmental scenarios may eliminate certain conductor configurations from being acceptable to the overhead power transmission line design.","Data stored within memory , and its constituent databases or repositories, may be implemented in a variety of forms including data storage files, computer memory, or at least one database management system (DBMS) executing on at least one database server. The database management system may be a relational (RDBMS), hierarchical (HDBMS), multidimensional (MDBMS), object oriented (ODBMS or OODBMS) or object relational (ORDBMS) database management system. Data could, for example, be stored within a single relational database such as SQL Server from Microsoft Corporation. In one embodiment, the data is a flat file loaded into memory  of computing device . In another embodiment, the data, and particularly conductor data  is loaded into memory  of computing device .","Overhead power transmission line design, specifically the choice of a single type of conductor to carry electrical current, is typically facilitated with two distinct sets of known calculations. In some cases, overhead power transmission line design may be performed by at least one engineer or system designer. In other cases, the system design is facilitated by computer software programs. Initially, a first computer program utilizes a first set of calculations to determine ampacity of a given conductor. Ampacity is a calculation of current carrying capacity for a conductor, given conductor temperature, and given a set of weather conditions.","Stress\/strain and sag\/tension calculations may be performed with model software  to calculate sag of each span of the conductor configuration given the type of conductor's physical properties, and stress-strain behavior stored as conductor data . In one embodiment, stress\/strain and sag\/tension calculations utilize a method described in Overhead Conductor Manual, Southwire Company, 1994, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Chen, S. Z., Black, W. A., Loard, H. W. Jr., \u201cHigh Temperature Sag Model for Overhead Conductors,\u201d IEEE Transaction on Power Delivery, Vol. 17, No. 4, October 2002 describes a method combining ampacity and line sag calculations, and has a disclosure that is hereby incorporated by reference. In some embodiments, stress, strain and sag, and tension limitations may be regulated through rules engine  according to overhead power transmission line limits, tower limits, or other limiting factors.","Some conventional software programs perform only one of these two calculations, while others perform both. Examples of such conventional software programs include that marketed by ACA Conductor Accessories, Spartanburg, S.C., under the trade designation \u201cSAG10\u201d, or that marketed by Power Line Systems, Inc., of Madison, Wis., under the trade designation \u201cPLS-CADD\u201d, or that marketed by Pondera Engineers, Spokane, Wash., under the trade designation \u201cTL-PRO DESIGN STUDIO.\u201d","Conductor data , in one embodiment, holds data defining each type of conductor and operating parameters for the types of conductors. Some conductors may be constructed, for example, of steel cores, composite (e.g., aluminum matrix composite and polymeric composite) cores, Invar cores, or any other cores commonly known in the art. Specific types of conductors may be constructed of aluminum matrix composite, polymeric composite, aluminum alloys, ceramics, boron, graphite, carbon, titanium, tungsten, and shape memory alloys. An example of a polymeric composite is aramid and poly(p-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole). In addition, a conductor may be manufactured of any combination of these or other materials commonly known in the art. The conductor also includes stranded wires around the core, which are commonly made of an aluminum or copper alloy. However, conductor types referred to herein are generally referred to as the types of conductor cores within the conductor. A conductor having an aluminum matrix composite core is sometimes referred to as aluminum conductor composite reinforced (\u201cACCR\u201d).","Other exemplary overhead power transmission line conductors for tension subsections include: aluminum conductor steel reinforced (ACSR), thermal-resistant aluminum alloy conductor steel reinforced (TACSR), ultra thermal-resistant aluminum alloy conductor steel reinforced (ZTACSR), ultra thermal-resistant aluminum alloy conductor Invar reinforced (ZTACIR), heat resistant aluminum alloys (ZTAL), ultra thermal-resistant aluminum alloy conductor steel reinforced (ZTACSR), extra thermal-resistant aluminum alloy conductor steel reinforced (XTACSR), extra thermal-resistant aluminum alloy conductor Invar reinforced (XTACIR), gap type ultra thermal resistant aluminum alloy steel reinforced (GZTACSR), high strength thermal resistant aluminum alloy conductor steel reinforced (KTACSR), all aluminum conductor (AAC), all aluminum alloy conductor (AAAC), aluminum conductor composite core (ACCC), and aluminum conductor steel supported (ACSS).

In between the dead-end structures, suspension structures support the conductor vertically. The conductor is connected to the suspension tower via an insulator string (typically strung-together insulated ceramic discs). One end of the insulator string is attached to the suspension tower and the other end of the insulator string is attached to the conductor. This latter attachment is referred to as the conductor attachment point. As changes in tension occur in the conductor, the insulator string, pivoting around the suspension tower attachment site, will pull on the conductor and longitudinally move the conductor attachment point to balance the ensuing forces. This movement is referred to as insulator swing. Changes in conductor tension between spans on a suspension tower are normally equalized by insulator swing. The insulator swings from the lower-tension span towards the higher-tension span to equalize the tension between spans. This causes the tension to drop in the higher-tension span increasing sag in that span. One example of this is that the center of balance of the overhead power transmission line tension section at the tower resides at the center of the tower instead of to one side of the tower. With other types of conductors, Sand Smay be very similar in cases where the weight of each conductor is almost equivalent.
