Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device.","2. Related Art","FeRAMs (Ferroelectric Random Access Memories) are nonvolatile memories and destructive read-out type memories. Thus, during data read operations, after data is read from memory cells, the data must be restored surely in the memory cells in the FeRAM. In the data read of the FeRAM, a chip enable signal (bCE) is activated (logical low) while a write enable signal (bWE) is in an inactivated state (logical high). The FeRAM then enters the read operation. When the write enable signal (bWE) becomes activated (logical low) thereafter, however, the FeRAM enters a write operation. If such an operation is made in the FeRAM, the data is temporarily read from the memory cells and external data is waited to be inputted before the read data is restored. When the data is externally inputted to the FeRAM during the standby period, the externally inputted data is written in the memory cells. When the data is not inputted externally during the standby period, the read data is written back to the memory cells.","If power supplies suddenly shut down while the FeRAM waits the external data to be inputted, both the externally inputted data and the read data may not be written in the memory cells.","Such a problem also arises in memories operating in a burst mode that data is serially read from or written in a plurality of columns. The same problem occurs in the series connected TC unit type ferroelectric RAM.","A semiconductor memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises: a memory cell array configured by two-dimensionally arranging destructive read-out type memory cells that stored data is degraded by data read; a decoder configured to select a memory cell in the memory cell array; a sense amplifier configured to detect the data stored in the selected memory cell; and a read and write controller configured to control a read operation for reading data externally from the memory cell and a write operation for writing external data in the memory cell, wherein the read and write controller outputs a logical value of a write enable signal at the start of the read operation in a first period and makes the write enable signal invalid after the read operation starts during the first period, on the basis of the write enable signal and a restore signal keeping an activated state during the first period, the write enable signal being a signal allowing the write operation, the first period being a period from when the read operation starts to when a restore operation for writing the data back to the memory cell is completed.","A memory system according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises: the semiconductor memory device according to any one of claims  to ; and a power supply circuit configured to keep a power supply voltage to be supplied to the semiconductor memory device at a certain voltage or higher during the first period, wherein","the power supply circuit comprises: a switch between an external power supply and the semiconductor memory device; a stabilizing capacity connected to a node between the switch and the semiconductor memory device; and a power supply monitoring circuit configured to receive a voltage of the external power supply and a reference power supply voltage and to compare the external power supply voltage to the reference power supply voltage, the reference power supply voltage serving as a threshold for the external power supply voltage,","wherein the power supply monitoring circuit turns off the switch when the external power supply voltage gets across the reference power supply voltage.","Embodiments of the present invention will be explained below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Note that the invention is not limited thereto.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The first embodiment can be applied to, in addition to the series connected TC unit type ferroelectric RAM, other ferroelectric memories. Further, the first embodiment can be applied to, in addition to the ferroelectric memories, other destructive read-out type memories. In the destructive read out memory, when data is read from memory cells, the data stored in the memory cells is degraded (destructed). Thus, when the data is read from the memory cells in the destructive read out memory, external write data must be written in the memory cells reliably or data detected by a sense amplifier SA must be written back reliably to the original memory cells (must be restored). That is, the present invention can be applied to any memories as long as they are destructive read-out type memories.","A memory cell array  includes a plurality of memory cells MC each of which comprises a ferroelectric capacitor and a cell transistor. The array is configured by two-dimensionally arranging these memory cells. The memory cell MC is arranged at an intersection of a bit line BL with a word line WL (an intersection of the bit line BL with a plate line PL).","A row decoder  drives a word line WL selected from the word lines WL. A plate line decoder  drives a plate line PL selected from the plate lines PL. A row control circuit  selects the word line WL and the plate line PL in a row depending on an externally received row address and controls the row decoder  and the plate line decoder  to drive the corresponding word line and plate line.","A column decoder  selects a bit line BL among the bit lines BL through a column gate . A sense amplifier SA is configured to read data stored in the memory cell MC or write data in the memory cell MC through the selected bit line BL. A column control circuit  controls the column decoder  to select the bit line BL in a column depending on an externally received column address.","A data buffer  is configured to temporarily store the read data detected by the sense amplifier SA and output the read data via an I\/O circuit to external of the memory chip. Alternatively, the data buffer  is configured to transfer the externally inputted write data via the I\/O circuit to the sense amplifier SA in the selected column.","According to a read operation for reading data externally, the sense amplifier SA detects the data stored in the memory cell MC and the detected data is outputted to external of the memory chip via the data buffer  and the I\/O circuit. The read operation includes a restore operation for writing the data latched by the sense amplifier SA back to the original memory cell MC. According to a write operation for writing external data, after the sense amplifier SA detects the data in the read operation, the external write data is transmitted via the I\/O circuit and the data buffer  to the sense amplifier SA, and the sense amplifier SA writes the write data in the memory cell MC.","A read\/write control circuit  is configured to receive externally a chip enable signal bCE, a write enable signal bWE, and a restore signal bRESTOR and generate an equalize signal EQL and sense amplifier activating signals SAP and BSAN.","The chip enable signal bCE allows the memory chip of the first embodiment to be in an activated state so that the memory can be accessed. The write enable signal bWE allows either the write operation or the read operation. More specifically, if the write enable signal bWE is in an activated state (logical low) when the chip enable signal bCE is activated, the ferroelectric memory of the first embodiment enters the write operation. In contrast, if the write enable signal bWE is in an inactivated state (logical high) when the chip enable signal bCE is activated, the ferroelectric memory of the first embodiment enters the read operation. The restore signal bRESTOR keeps the activated state during a first period from when the ferroelectric memory enters the read operation to when the restore operation is completed.","An internal power supply circuit  is configured to receive an external power supply voltage Vext and generate an internal power supply voltage Vint. The internal power supply voltage Vint is supplied to components shown in . The internal power supply circuit  can include a boost circuit as needed.","The ferroelectric memory of the first embodiment becomes activated when a precharge state (standby state) ends and the chip enable signal bCE supplied from external to the chip becomes logically low. As the ferroelectric memory being in an activated state, a control circuit  including the row control unit , the column control circuit , and the read\/write control circuit  allows access to the memory cell array .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"1"},"The bit lines BL and bBL are connected via transfer gates TG to the respective sense nodes SN and bSN in the sense amplifier SA. The transfer gates TG are controlled by a signal \u03c6t. The sense amplifier SA includes a latch circuit LC. The latch circuit LC is controlled by the sense amplifier activating signals bSAP and SAN. The latch circuit LC latches the read data or the write data at the sense nodes SN and bSN. The bit lines BL and bBL transmit data whose logics are opposite to each other (complementary data) to the sense nodes SN and bSN. Thus, the sense amplifier SA latches the data whose logics are opposite to each other at the sense nodes SN and bSN.","In the first embodiment, by selecting a bit line pair BL, bBL in a column and the word line WL in a row, the memory cells MC at their intersection are selected.","The sense nodes SN and bSN are connected via the respective column selective transistors CST to the DQ lines DQ and bDQ. When the column selective line CSLi is selected, the column selective transistor CST in the selected column is switched on. Accordingly, the read data latched at the sense nodes SN and bSN in the selected column is outputted via the DQ lines DQ and bDQ to the data buffer  shown in . Meanwhile, the write data from the data buffer  is transmitted via the DQ lines DQ and bDQ to the sense nodes SN and bSN in the selected column. The sense amplifier SA latches the write data at the sense nodes SN and bSN and then writes the data in the selected memory cell MC.","An equalizing circuit EQ is configured to keep the bit lines BL and bBL equipotential (ground potential Vss) when the memory is in a standby state. When the memory is accessed for read or write, the equalizing circuit EQ is in an inactivated state.","Activation or the activated state means switching on or driving devices or circuits, and inactivation or the inactivated state means switching off or stopping devices or circuits. Thus, note that a logical high signal can be an activating signal or a logical low signal can be an activating signal. For example, NMOS transistors are activated when the gates are made to be logical high. PMOS transistors are activated when the gates are made to be logical low.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["84","84","83","84","84","2"]},"In the read operation, when the chip enable signal bCE is activated to be logical low, the write enable signal bWE is in an inactivated state (logical high). The restore signal bRESTOR is activated to be logical high when the read operation starts. Because the restore signal bRESTOR becomes logically high while the write enable signal bWE is in an inactivated state (logical high), the NOR circuit  keeps the inactivated state (logical low) of the write enable signal bWE as long as the restore signal bRESTOR is kept logically high. That is, the NOR circuit  can make the write enable signal bWE invalid during the read operation that the restore signal bRESTOR is kept logically high. Thus, even if a user activates the write enable signal bWE to be logical low, the inactivated state (logical low) of the write enable signal bWE is kept regardless of the logical value of the write enable signal bWE. As a result, the restore operation can be completed reliably during the read operation (first period).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 4","FIG. 2"],"b":"0"},"The ferroelectric memory of the first embodiment starts the data read operation or the data write operation when the chip enable signal bCE becomes activated (logical low). As shown in , if the write enable signal bWE is inactivated (logical high) when the chip enable signal bCE is activated to be logical low (t), the ferroelectric memory enters the read operation. The equalizing signal EQL is inactivated at t to end the precharge state. Thus, the equalizing circuit EQ shown in  becomes inactivated.","The restore signal bRESTOR is activated to be logical high simultaneously with t or at t immediately after t. The NOR gate  shown in  keeps the inactivated state (logical low) of the write enable signal bWE. The signal bWE is kept inactivated during the first period T from when the read operation starts to when the restore operation is completed.","Thereafter, at t, the selected word line WL is inactivated to be logical low and the cell transistor T connected to the selected word line WL (see ) is switched off. Unselected word lines WL to WL keep the activated state (logical high) as shown by a broken line. The block selective signal BS is activated to be logical high at t. The selective transistor ST corresponding to the activated block selective signal BS (see ) is thus switched on. At this time, because the cell transistors T in the unselected memory cells MC connected to the unselected word lines WL to WL are on, the ferroelectric capacitor C in the memory cell MC is electrically connected between the bit line BL and the plate line PL. The unselected block selective signal BS keeps the inactivated state (logical low). The signal \u03c6t is activated to be logical high at t. Thus, the bit line pair BL, bBL is respectively connected to the sense node pair SN and bSN. The plate line PL corresponding to the block selective signal BS is activated to be logical high at t. The data stored in the selected memory cell MC is thus transmitted via the bit line BL to the sense node SN. At this time, the reference data indicating the intermediate potential between data \u201c\u201d and data \u201c\u201d is transmitted to the sense node bSN. Accordingly, the potential difference between the data from the selected memory cell MC and the reference data is expanded between the sense nodes SN and bSN. The sense amplifier activating signals SAN and BSAN are activated at t. The sense amplifier SA thus amplifies the potential difference between the sense nodes SN and bSN and latches the resultant potential difference between the sense nodes SN and bSN. The column selective line CSL is then activated, so that the data detected by the sense amplifier SA is outputted externally as DOUT. The bit line BL is logical high (for example, has the data \u201c\u201d) in the embodiment shown in .","After the data is externally outputted, the plate line PL falls to be logical low at t. The potential difference between the bit line BL and the plate line PL is then applied to the ferroelectric capacitor C in the selected memory cell MC. Thus, for example, the data \u201c\u201d is written back to the selected memory cell MC (restored).","The sense amplifier SA is inactivated at t. The equalizing circuit EQ is activated at t and the bit line pair BL, bBL is set to be equipotential (Vss). The bit line pair BL, bBL is then disconnected from the sense node pair SN, bSN at t. Thereafter, the block selective signal BS is inactivated to be logical low and the selected word line WL is activated to be logical high. The chip enable signal bCE and the restore signal bRESTOR are inactivated. After the restore signal bRESTOR is inactivated, the ferroelectric memory can enter the write operation.","The restore signal bRESTOR is kept logically high during the first period T from t to t in the first embodiment. Thus, the inactivated state (logical high) of the write enable signal bWE is kept regardless of the logical value of the signal bWE. Accordingly, even if a user put the write enable signal bWE in the activated state (logical low) during the read operation, the restore operation can be performed surely during the read operation.","When the memory enters the write operation, the restore signal bRESTOR and the write enable signal bWE become logical low. The write enable signal bWE is thus activated to be logical high. In the write operation, the sense amplifier SA writes the externally received write data in the memory cell MC instead of the restore operation. Because other processes in the write operation are the same as in the read operation, descriptions thereof will be omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"When the restore signal bRESTOR is inactivated (the restore operation is completed) before the chip enable signal bCE is in an inactivated state (logical high), the write enable signal bWE is made to be invalid until the restore signal bRESTOR becomes inactivated (logical low). That is, when the restore operation is completed before the chip enable signal bCE is inactivated (logical high) after inactivation, the ferroelectric memory can enter the write operation at any point before the chip enable signal bCE is inactivated since the restore operation has been completed. This is because as long as the write enable signal bWE and the restore signal bRESTOR are inactivated, the ferroelectric memory can enter the write operation quickly.","According to the second embodiment, the read operation and the restore operation described in the first embodiment are completed before tat which the restore signal bRESTOR becomes inactivated (logical low). After t, the ferroelectric memory can enter the write operation. The second embodiment can achieve effects identical to those of the first embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1","1"]},"The burst read\/write mode product designates a row address to access a plurality of successive column addresses from the row address and reads or writes data serially.","The operation of the third embodiment during the period from when the memory enters the data read operation to when the chip enable signal bCE and the restore signal bRESTOR are inactivated (t to t) is substantially the same as the one from t to t in the first embodiment. Because the data read\/data write is performed in a burst mode in the third embodiment, when the data is read from the sense amplifier SA via the I\/O circuit to external of the chip, the data is serially read depending on the clock signal. Further, when the externally received write data is written through the I\/O circuit to the sense amplifier SA, the data is serially written depending on the clock signal. Thus, as indicated by the column selective line CSL and the data output signal DOUT in , bit lines in a plurality of columns are selected successively and the data is serially outputted.","The third embodiment comprises the NOR circuit like the first embodiment. The NOR circuit makes the write enable signal bWE invalid during the read operation that the restore signal bRESTOR is kept logically high. Even if a user activates the write enable signal bWE to be logical low, the inactivated state (logical low) of the write enable signal bWE is kept regardless of the logical value of the write enable signal bWE.
