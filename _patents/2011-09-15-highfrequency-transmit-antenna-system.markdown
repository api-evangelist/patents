Ranges of thousands of miles are supported using sky-wave propagation and lesser ranges on the order 100 miles are supported using surface wave propagation over sea water. Suitable antennas are well known in the art and include standard types such as simple dipoles and monopoles along with larger types such as the Yagi-Uda antenna and log-periodic antenna which provide improved performance (i.e., greater gain or bandwidth or both). Since these wavelengths are quite large (i.e., 150 meters at 2 MHz and 10 meters at 30 MHz), effective communications using these well-known antennas requires their dimensions to be suitably large and, ideally, resonant (i.e., wavelength for the dipole and \u00bc wave for the monopole). These dimensions unfortunately are not compatible with many applications such as small mobile platforms (e.g., \u201cman pack\u201d or hand held devices) and small marine platforms (e.g., unmanned buoys or vehicles).","The use of electrically-small antenna structures to meet size requirements typically uses passive matching networks to \u201ctune\u201d these structures such that they present a good match to standard 50-ohm transmitters at the desired operating frequency. The drawbacks to this traditional approach include poor efficiency, low bandwidth, and a high susceptibility to small environmental changes (e.g., proximity to a changing waterline or adjacent object such as a structure or person). These drawbacks become more problematic as the desired antenna structure is made smaller and the subsequent departure from the standard 50-ohm transmitter impedance increases.","In an effort to address some of these drawbacks, U.S. Pat. No. 7,804,454 entitled \u201cActive High Frequency Transmitter Antenna Assembly\u201d to Paul M. Mileski, describes an antenna system that utilizes an active electronic circuit close to the antenna structure that overcomes the drawbacks of a passive matching network in order to provide a highly unconventional Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) signal as part of a wide-band pulse modulated communication system. The active transmit electronics improve the efficiency, bandwidth, and flexibility of the electrically-small antenna system. However, the antenna system does not have the ability to transmit conventional relatively narrow band (or non UWB) high duty cycle signals necessary to support common modulation types such as Phase Shift Keying (PSK) and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK).","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a high-frequency transmit antenna system.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a transmit antenna system that provides over the horizon communications at high frequencies between 10 MHz and 30 MHz.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.","In accordance with the present invention, a transmit antenna system includes a pulse generator outputting a series of voltage pulses with a pulse frequency associated therewith. A transistor has its gate coupled to the pulse generator for receiving the voltage pulses. A coupled inductor is coupled to the transistor's drain. A tuning capacitor is coupled to the coupled inductor. An antenna is coupled to the coupled inductor and tuning capacitor. A choke inductor is coupled to the coupled inductor and a direct current voltage source. During each of the voltage pulses of the pulse generator, a resonant circuit is defined where parameters of the resonant circuit include resistance and capacitance of the antenna, capacitance of the tuning capacitor, inductance of the coupled inductor, and capacitance of the transistor. The resonant circuit is configured such that a resonant frequency thereof is equal to the pulse frequency of the pulse generator.","Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to , a transmit system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown and is referenced generally by numeral . Antenna system  includes a relatively short monopole antenna  ranging from about one to six feet in length. Antenna  can be an adjustable in length (e.g., a telescoping antenna) to provide for performance tuning as will be explained later below. Antenna  is fed against a ground plane  such as sea water with active transmit electronics  located near the base of antenna  or at the antenna feed. Antenna  utilizes a capacitive \u201ctop hat\u201d assembly  that can be four horizontal and radially-extending wires A arranged as a \u201ccross\u201d centered at the top of antenna . Such capacitive \u201ctop hat\u201d assemblies are well known in the art.","Antenna system  utilizes solid-state active transmit electronics  to allow antenna  to transmit narrow-band and high duty cycle signals necessary to support common modulation types such as Phase Shift Keying (PSK) and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK). Referring now to , an embodiment of active transmit electronics  (coupled to antenna ) is illustrated schematically. A direct current (DC) voltage source  is joined to one contact of a radio frequency choke inductor . DC voltage source  can be any voltage source producing a voltage level required by antenna  and within the handling capacity of the elements of active transmit electronics . For example, for mobile applications, DC voltage source  could be realized by low-voltage batteries coupled to a DC-DC converter that boosts voltage output. A coupled inductor  is joined to the other contact of choke inductor . A bypass capacitor  is coupled between choke inductor , coupled inductor , and ground . Choke inductor  and bypass capacitor  provide filtering that minimizes the peak current presented to DC voltage source . Coupled inductor  is further coupled to the drain \u201cD\u201d of a transistor  which can be a field effect transistor (FET). The source \u201cS\u201d of transistor  is coupled to ground . The gate \u201cG\u201d of transistor  is coupled to a pulse generator  which can be a short duty cycle pulse generator (i.e. a signal source that provides a signal as a series of continuous pulses whose width is much smaller than the time between pulses; in the current embodiment the time between pulses is actually 1\/operating frequency of the antenna and the width of the pulses is as small as possible while compatible with the \u201cresponsiveness\u201d of the transistor) operating at the actual transmit frequency of antenna  as will be explained later below.","As is known in the art, coupled inductor  is defined by two distinct inductors, i.e., a first inductor A in proximity to a second inductor B. Inductors A and B are close enough they are \u201ccoupled\u201d together by generated magnetic fields as current flows through to thereby define a \u201cmutual inductance\u201d which is the inductance of inductor A coupled to inductor B. In terms of active transmit electronics , one contact of inductor A is coupled to choke inductor  and bypass capacitor , while the other contact of inductor A is coupled to the drain of transistor . Inductor B (forming the output of coupled inductor ) has a tuning capacitor  coupled across its contacts to thereby define a tuning circuit that is also coupled to ground . Antenna  is coupled to the output of coupled inductor . Antenna  can be modeled as a capacitor in series with a resistor as shown.","In operation, pulse generator  generates a continuous series of voltage pulses that are narrow. To conserve power, the pulse width is chosen to be as short as possible while still allowing transistor  to be operationally responsive. The time between each pulse is chosen to be the period of the desired transmit frequency of antenna  (or 1\/transmitter frequency). The output of pulse generator  acts as an impulse drive for transistor . That is, transistor  is turned \u201con\u201d during each short voltage pulse. Since the pulse width is narrow, transistor  wastes very little power in transition to the \u201con\u201d state or in the \u201con\u201d state. When in the \u201con\u201d state, transistor  provides a high-amplitude and short-duration current pulse through the \u201cprimary\u201d of coupled inductor . The \u201cprimary\u201d of coupled inductor  is defined as the mutual inductance provided by inductors A and B when they are magnetically coupled to each other.","The impulse current pulse provided by transistor  to coupled inductor  is stored in the primary of coupled inductor  where the momentarily-generated magnetic field from inductor A is coupled to inductor B. By virtue of the pulsed impulse current, the magnetic field is rapidly changing thereby producing a rapid change in current at the output of coupled inductor . The rapidly-changing output current of coupled inductor  flows through antenna  as well as tuning capacitor  and back through inductor B. During the time of the impulse current pulse, the entire circuit of active transmit electronics  consists of antenna , tuning capacitor , inductor B, the primary of coupled inductor , and the capacitance associated with transistor . The corresponding circuit parameters associated with this circuit are the resistance and capacitance of antenna , capacitance of tuning capacitor , inductance of inductor B, the mutually coupled inductance of the primary of coupled inductor , and the capacitance of transistor . Since this circuit is \u201ccreated\u201d with each impulse current pulse, the circuit can be thought of as a resonant circuit whose resonant frequency is equal to that of the impulse current which, in turn, is equal to the pulse frequency of pulse generator . Thus, the transmit frequency of antenna  is equal to the pulse frequency of pulse generator  which, for high-frequency applications, can be set between 10-30 MHz with the resonant circuit parameters being selected to support the desired transmit frequency.","The parameters associated with coupled inductor  must be chosen to provide an adequate amount of mutual coupling. That is, too much mutual coupling combined with the typically high capacitance of transistor  lowers the quality factor of the created resonant circuit. However, too little mutual coupling causes the output of coupled inductor  to be small and useless.","The advantages of the present invention are numerous. Narrow band, high-frequency transmissions for over the horizon communication are supported by the transmit antenna described herein. The active transmit electronics are small solid-state electronics that are placed close to the antenna feed thereby providing for a compact antenna design. Tuning of the antenna can be provided using an adjustable-length antenna and the tuning capacitor coupled to the electronics' coupled inductor. The length of the antenna can be small compared to the wavelength due to the impedance matching effect of the active electronics. The bandwidth and efficiency are also improved compared to that using a passive matching network.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
