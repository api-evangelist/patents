{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is based on and claims the benefit of priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-103636, filed on Apr. 11, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure generally relates to a remote operation apparatus for use in a vehicle.","In recent years, increasing number of automotive vehicles are equipped with a display unit for displaying various information in a view of the driver, that is, at a position such as a front portion of the vehicle compartment (e.g., a far-front side of the driver's seat), so that a move of a driver's look direction should be decreased. In those vehicles, the display unit is out of reach of the driver, and thereby making it difficult for the driver to perform a stable touch operation on the display unit. Therefore, instead of allowing a direct touch on the display unit (e.g., allowing a touch on a switch image shown on the display unit), an operation unit is provided on, for example, a center console for in-directly operating the display contents of the display unit based on a remote control of the operation unit in general (see Japanese patent document JP-A-2005-100151, or an equivalent US publication US20050068296).","However, a remote control apparatus disclosed in the above patent document is susceptible to a mis-input, if the vehicle's travel condition becomes unstable due to a steep braking, a steep turn or the like while the operation unit of the remote control apparatus is operated. Further, if required consciousness for operating the operation unit is too demanding for the driver of the vehicle, which leads to the deteriorated concentration on the driving operation, or, in other words, that leads to the distraction of the driver's attention from the driving operation, thereby making it difficult for the driver to stabilize the travel condition of the vehicle.","In view of the above and other problems, the present disclosure provides a remote operation apparatus that considers a stable travel of the vehicle.","In an aspect of the present disclosure, a remote operation apparatus includes: an operation unit for remotely operating display contents displayed on a display unit; a travel condition acquisition unit for acquiring information on a travel condition of a subject vehicle; and a control unit for allowing an operation of the operation unit if the travel condition of the subject vehicle is determined to be in a stable condition and for restricting the operation of the operation unit if the travel condition of the subject vehicle is determined to be in a non-stable condition, based on the information acquired by the travel condition acquisition unit. In this case, \u201crestricting the operation\u201d basically indicates invalidation of the operation by using the operation unit. That is, depending on the function of the operation unit used for the operation, an input operation by using the operation unit may be, for example, made to be difficult, or the input operation itself may be rejected (i.e., the target device of the operation in the vehicle is not operated).","The remote operation apparatus of the present disclosure allows the operation of the operation unit under control by the control unit, if it is determined that the subject vehicle is in a stable condition, based on information acquired by the travel condition acquisition unit. On the other hand, if it is determined that the subject vehicle is in a non-stable condition, the operation of the operation unit is restricted by the control unit.","Therefore, even if the travel condition of the subject vehicle is unstable, the mis-input from the operation unit is prevented due to the restriction of the operation of the operation unit. As a result, the concentration on the driving operation of the driver is maintained, that is, is kept unchanged, thereby easily enabling the stabilization of the travel condition of the subject vehicle.","a. First Embodiment","Hereafter, with reference to the drawing, the first embodiment of the present disclosure is described.  is an overview that schematically illustrates a remote operation apparatus according to the present invention, and the remote operation apparatus is realized as a combination of a well-known type navigation system NS and a centralized device operation system DS, that is, the system DS for remotely controlling the display contents of a display unit  of the navigation system NS.","The navigation system NS includes, besides the display unit , well-known type components such as a position detector, a map data input unit, a voice synthesizer circuit, a speaker, a memory, a transceiver, a hard disk drive, an interface unit, and a control circuit (i.e., a navigation ECU) connected to those components. The display unit  is arranged at the front of a vehicle compartment close to a viewing range of a driver D (i.e., at a far front position of a driver's seat), and displays, as the display contents, various command switches and a pointer for pointing the command switches as well as a vehicle symbol superposed on a road map.","The centralized device operation system DS includes an operation unit , a reaction force generation mechanism , and a control unit . The operation unit  is assembled on a console box CB in the palm neighborhood of the left hand side (on the right hand side in case of the left-hand-drive vehicle) for the ease of operation by the driver D. The operation unit  is composed of, as shown in , a main body , and a case  that covers the upper side of the main body , and an operation knob  arranged in an exposed manner from an open mouth of the case  for allowing a direct operation of the user. The operation knob  serves as a so-called haptic device.","The main body  of the operation unit  is connected with the control unit , and transmits, to the control unit , manipulation signals corresponding to a move in the front, back, left and right directions of the operation knob . The case  has a streamline shape, with its center and rear-half portion serving as a palm rest ","The operation knob  is configured to have a reaction force from the reaction force generation mechanism  when moved in the front, back, left and right directions.  shows an example of the movement of the knob  in the front and back directions. The operation knob  has a shaft  extending from a reverse side of the knob  in a vertical direction, and a lateral axis  extending from a middle part of the shaft  towards both sides of the vehicle. The shaft  and the lateral axis  are used to connect the knob  to the case . The lateral axis  allows the knob  to move in the front and back directions around the axis, and the shaft  allows the knob  to move along the shaft  (i.e., in the vertical direction) for an input of \u201cEnter\u201d equivalent signal.","The reaction force generation mechanism  is composed of a rack gear , a pinion gear , an electric motor , a code board , and a photo-interrupter . The rack gear  is integrally connected with the bottom part of the shaft  to extend in the front and back direction of the vehicle. The pinion gear  is fixed on a driving axis of the electric motor , and is engaged with the rack gear . The electric motor  (i.e., an electric actuator) is built into the main body  of the operation unit , and provides the reaction force to the operation knob  according to the output instruction from the control unit  through the pinion gear , the rack gear , and the shaft .","The code board  is a circular board having a row of radial slits , and is fixed on the driving axis of the electric motor . The photo-interrupter  (i.e. an encoder module) is composed of a photo IC and a signal diode facing to each other with the code board  interposed therebetween. The photo IC contains a photo-diode, a preamplifier, a comparator, and an output buffer. The amount of rotation of the code board  that represents the operational movement of the knob  in the front and back direction as well as the rotation speed of the board  representing the operational speed of the knob  are detected by the photo-interrupter , and are output to the control unit .","The control unit  has, as its main component, a microcomputer consisting of a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, an I\/O, a driving IC, and the like, and repeatedly executes a control program shown in  that is memorized in the ROM or the like. The control unit  can communicate with the navigation system NS through a vehicle LAN, and transmits position information of the operation knob  (i.e., switch information) and pointer information to the navigation system NS according to the sensor signal that is detected by the photo-interrupter . The navigation system NS displays on the display unit  a pointer in synchronization with the operation of the operation knob  upon receiving the information from the control unit . Further, the control unit  receives, from the navigation system NS, reaction force information for controlling the reaction force of the knob  according to the command information (i.e., screen information) to be displayed on the display unit , output instruction information and the like.","More practically, for example, a pointer P is displayed on the display unit  corresponding to the operation position of the operation knob  in a Japanese alphabet key tops arrangement shown in  when the text input screen is displayed on the display unit . In , the illustration shows that the operation of the knob  has moved the pointer to a position of \u201cyo (a pronunciation of one of Japanese alphabets shown in the \u201ckey top\u201d having hatching).\u201d In this case, the pointer P moves in a L direction on the screen if the knob  is operated in the front and back directions, or the pointer P moves in a L direction on the screen if the knob  is operated in the left and right directions, relative to the position of the key top \u201cyo.\u201d","Further, if the user desires to move the pointer from the key top \u201cyo\u201d to a key top \u201cu\u201d on the right side, the operation knob  must be operated by a force that is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold, thereby enabling the user to recognize the reaction force in the course of operation. That is, when the reaction force information is transmitted from the navigation system NS to the control unit , the control unit  use the information to control a torque of the motor  for creating a \u201cclick feel\u201d by generating force against the user operation and for allowing the user to sense the reaction force (e.g., a dynamic reaction force, a dumper brake or the like). The reaction force thus generated is varied in a range between a standard reaction force Rst and a minimum reaction force Rmin according to the pointing position of the pointer P while the pointer P is within a button area S. As a result, the reaction force recognized by the user is in the range between Rst and Rmin.","Thus, the pointer P doesn't move outside of the button area S beyond a boundary W of the button area S unless the user applies a force exceeding a maximum reaction force Rmax. The maximum reaction force Rmax is, for example, set to a magnitude of  to  N, and the same reaction force is used to prohibit the operation of the operation knob  by the user.","The control unit  in  is connected to a speed sensor , a brake sensor , a steer angle sensor , and a side G sensor  respectively serving as a travel condition acquisition unit through the vehicle LAN. The speed sensor  detects and transmits a vehicle speed V to the control unit . The brake sensor  detects and transmits a step amount B of the brake pedal to the control unit . The steer angle sensor  detects and transmits, to the control unit , a steer angle \u03b8 of the steering wheel H, with, for instance, a distinction between a right turn and a left turn of the wheel H according the positive and the negative value of the steer angle \u03b8. The side G sensor  detects and transmits, to the control unit , a lateral acceleration G of the vehicle.","Next, the operation scheme of the remote operation apparatus according to the control program in  is described. The control unit  turns on the centralized device operation system DS upon having a turn-on operation of the ignition switch (S).","If the operation knob  is operated by the user (S), it is determined whether the vehicle is traveling stably or not (S). In S, the determination processing shown in  is executed, for instance. More practically, the vehicle speed V, the brake pedal step amount B, the steer angle \u03b8 of the steer steering wheels H and the lateral acceleration G are respectively acquired from the speed sensor , the brake sensor , the steer angle sensor , and the side G sensor  (S). Then, it is determined whether or not the speed V is equal to or exceeding a speed Vo (S). The speed Vo is set to a sufficiently small value that allows a stable travel of the vehicle even when the vehicle steeply turns or steeply decelerates.","When the speed V is smaller than the speed Vo (S in FIG. :NO), the electric motor  is driven to generate the reaction force according to the operation of the operation knob  (see ), and a command input by a press operation of the knob  to input the \u201cEnter\u201d equivalent signal is permitted (S:YES, S). The process from S to S is repeated until the turn-off of the ignition switch.","Therefore, a command input is freely allowed, in this case, according to the operation of the operation knob . The control unit  turns off the centralized device operation system DS (S) upon having a turn-off operation of the ignition switch (S:YES), and the execution of the control program is concluded.","When the speed V is equal to or exceeding the speed Vo (S:YES), whether or not the vehicle is in a steep braking condition is determined. That is, a stepping speed of the brake pedal dB\/dt is calculated based on the step amount B, and the stepping speed dB\/dt is compared with a stepping speed \u03b2o. The stepping speed \u03b2o is set to a sufficiently great value that makes it difficult for the vehicle to maintain a stable travel condition if the steep braking of that magnitude is applied to the vehicle.","If the stepping speed dB\/dt is smaller than the stepping speed \u03b2o (S:NO), the process proceeds to S, and whether the angular steer speed of the steering wheel H is calculated based on the steer angle \u03b8. More practically, the angular steer speed d\u03b8\/dt is calculated based on the steer angle \u03b8, and the angular steer speed d\u03b8\/dt is compared with an angular steer speed \u03c9o. The angular steer speed \u03c9o is set to a sufficiently great value that makes it difficult for the vehicle to maintain a stable travel condition if the steep turn of that magnitude is applied to the vehicle.","When the angular steer speed d\u03b8\/dt is smaller than the value \u03c9o (S:NO), the process proceeds to S, and the condition of a steeply curved travel of the vehicle is determined. That is, whether or not the lateral acceleration G is equal to or exceeding the acceleration Go is determined. The lateral acceleration Go is set to a sufficiently great value that makes it difficult for the vehicle to maintain a stable travel condition in the steeply curved travel if the lateral acceleration of that magnitude is applied to the vehicle.","When all of the determination results of S to S are \u201cNO,\u201d it is assumed that the stable travel of the vehicle can be easily achieved (S:YES) even when the speed V of the vehicle exceeds the value Vo (S:YES). On the other hand, when at least one of S to S is \u201cYES,\u201d it is assumed that the stable travel of the vehicle can not be achieved, and the process proceeds to S (S:NO).","In S, the electric motor  is driven to generate the maximum reaction force Rmax (see ), and the command input from the operation knob  is prohibited (S). Thus, the mis-input is prevented due to the prohibition of the command input, thereby effectively reducing a psychological pressure for the user coming from a fear of the mis-input.","The above embodiment can thus be summarized that real-time behavioral information of the vehicle including the vehicle speed V, the step amount B, the steer angle \u03b8, and the lateral acceleration G is used to determine whether the operation of the operation unit  should either be allowed or prohibited. Therefore, even when the travel condition of the vehicle is unstable due to the steep braking, steep turn, or steeply curved travel, the user's attention can be turned from the operation of the operation unit  to the driving operation of the vehicle, thereby easily stabilizing the travel condition of the vehicle by providing plenty of room, in the user's mind, for maintaining the concentration on the driving operation.","Further, in the above embodiment, the maximum reaction force Rmax is provided for the operation knob  from the electric motor , thereby allowing the user, through haptic sensation (i.e., haptic stimulus, haptic feedback) of the haptic device (i.e., the operation unit ), to instantly recognize that the operation of the operation unit  is currently under restriction. That is, the concentration of the driver on the driving operation can be preferably maintained, because the user saves the confirmation operation for confirming that the operation of the operation unit  is under restriction by, for example, watching the display unit .","In the above embodiment, for finding that the vehicle is in a steeply braking condition, the stepping speed of the brake pedal is determined based on the calculation of dB\/dt that is derived from the step amount B. However, the steep braking condition may also be determined based on, for example, the increase speed of the oil pressure in the wheel cylinder, or the deceleration index from the front-rear direction acceleration sensor.","Furthermore, the steeply curved travel of the vehicle may also be determined, instead of using the angular steer speed of the steering wheel H, based on, for example, the lateral acceleration G from the side G sensor, or the lateral acceleration G from a yaw rate sensor.","b. Second Embodiment","In the second embodiment, the vehicle is assumed to be capable of having an inter-vehicle communication through the navigation system NS, that is, communication between vehicles, or communication between a road-side unit and a vehicle. That is, as shown in , information in association with the surroundings of the current position of the subject vehicle is acquired from a management center , a roadside unit , or an other vehicle  (shown in blocks with the broken line), through the navigation system NS. In this case, the management center , the roadside unit , and the other vehicle  respectively serve as a travel condition acquisition unit. Further, the control unit  performs S to S in , instead of performing S to S in , in the course of executing S of the control program in .","In S of the present embodiment, the information on the current position of the vehicle is acquired through the navigation system NS (S). Then, the information in association with the surroundings of the current position of the vehicle is acquired by the inter-vehicle communication through the navigation system NS (S). The information in association with the surroundings of the current position of the subject vehicle includes a clue that suggests a steep braking or a steep turn of the vehicle expected after now, that is, in the near future. In other words, for example, a successively curved road, a rotary, an intersection or the like that can hardly be recognized or perceived at the current position of the vehicle is provided in this information. When the current position of the vehicle is determined to be reaching the curvy road based on the information (S:NO), processing in S is executed.","According to the process scheme in the present embodiment, the maximum reaction force Rmax is provided for the operation knob  from the electric motor , when the vehicle reaches a position where a steep braking or a steep turn is expected on the basis of information in association with the surroundings of the current position of the vehicle (S:NO), thereby letting the user know that the operation of the operation unit  is restricted through haptic sensation in a timely manner. Therefore, the user can intuitively recognize the restriction of the operation of the operation unit  without seeing the display unit  or other devices for confirmation of the operation restriction, thereby allowing the driver the continuation of concentration on the driving operation of the vehicle, or, in other words, without disrupting the concentration on the driving operation, which makes it easy for the driver to stabilize the travel condition of the vehicle.","c. Third Embodiment","In the third embodiment, a wiper controller , an air conditioning system , and a light controller  are connected with the control unit  as shown by the broken line in , and the operation of a wiper  as well as the switching of the defroster of the air conditioning system  and the lighting operation of a light  (i.e., a headlight, a fog lamp, etc.) are configured to be controlled by the operation unit . Further, after the determination of \u201cNO\u201d in S of the control program by the control unit  (see ), S in  is configured to be performed.","In S of the present embodiment, whether the wiper  is operated, whether the air conditioning system  is switched to the defroster, or whether the light  is turned on, is determined. The wiper , the defroster of the air conditioning system , and the light  are indispensable and important for securing the view of the driver and for the stable travel of the vehicle.","Therefore, even when the determination in S is \u201cNO,\u201d that is, even when the travel condition of the vehicle is unstable, the operation of the operation unit  for controlling the wiper , the defroster of the air conditioning system  or the light  is allowed. In this manner, the view of the driver in the traveling vehicle is secured, thereby enabling the stabilization of the travel of the vehicle.","Further, though, in the first to third embodiments, the command input from the operation knob  is prohibited beside providing the maximum reaction force Rmax for the knob  from the electric motor  in S of , the prohibition of the command input from the operation knob  may be omitted. This is because the maximum reaction force Rmax provided for the operation knob  substantially prohibits the input operation of the operation unit . As a result, the haptic communication function, that is, the notification function for notifying the restriction of the operation of the operation unit  through haptic sensation, as well as the restriction function for restricting the operation of the operation unit  are provided only by controlling the reaction force from the electric motor , thereby enabling a simplified configuration of the remote operation apparatus.","Further, the reaction force provided in S from the motor  may be changed to other amount. That is, though, in the first to third embodiments, the maximum reaction force Rmax is provided against the operation of the operation knob  in S, a reaction force that is greater than the standard reaction force Rst and smaller than the maximum reaction force Rmax may be generated, or the generation of the reaction force may be stopped (i.e., a reaction force of zero may be used). The user can also perceive, through these modified type haptic sensation, that the operation of the operation unit  is currently restricted.","(Modifications)","Although the present disclosure has been fully described in connection with preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art. That is, for example: the haptic device (i.e., the operation unit ) used in the above embodiments may be replaced with a so-called prompter device that uses a touch input on an operation panel based on the display contents of the display unit . The prompter device usually uses the two-dimensional coordinates of the operation panel that has a one-to-one correspondence to the coordinates on the display screen for accepting the input from the operation panel. Though the prompter device is not capable of notifying the user of the restriction of the operation through haptic sensation, S\u2032 described in  may be added to the process of the control program in  to let the user know, through visual notification, that the operation of the operation panel is currently restricted. In this manner, the user can be promptly notified that the operation of the operation panel is restricted through the visual message, thereby allowing the non-interrupted concentration of the driver on the driving operation. Further, in this case, instead of erasing the display contents, a text message such as NO INPUT ALLOWED, INPUT RESTRICTION IN FORCE or the like, for example, may be used to notify the restriction of the operation.","Such changes, modifications, and summarized scheme are to be understood as being within the scope of the present disclosure as defined by appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Objects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
