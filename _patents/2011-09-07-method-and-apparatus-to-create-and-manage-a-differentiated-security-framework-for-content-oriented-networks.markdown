{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/429,827 filed Jan. 5, 2011 by Xinwen Zhang et al. and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus to Create and Manage Differentiated Security Framework for Content Oriented Networks,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference as if reproduced in its entirety.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","In a content oriented network (CON), a content router is responsible for routing user requests and content to proper recipients. In the CON, a domain-wide unique name is assigned to each entity that is part of a content delivery framework. The entities may comprise data content, such as video clips or web pages, and\/or infrastructure elements, such as routers, switches, or servers. The content router uses name prefixes, which can be full content names or proper prefixes of content names instead of network addresses, to route content packets within the content network.","In one embodiment, the disclosure includes a network component comprising a receiver configured to receive a signed content item and an associated security information from a publisher, wherein the security information indicates which group from a plurality of groups is allowed to access the signed content item, a storage unit configured to cache the content item and the associated security information, a processor to implement procedures to enforce security policies defined by the security information, and a transmitter configured to send the signed content item from the cache to a subscriber when the subscriber is a member of a group indicated by the security information as authorized to access the signed content item, wherein the subscriber verifies the signed content.","In another embodiment, the disclosure includes a content router comprising storage configured to store a signed content item and an associated security policy, wherein the signed content item is received from a first one of a plurality of users in a content oriented network (CON), wherein the security policy indicates which group's members from a plurality of groups is allowed to access the signed content item, and a processor configured to enforce the associated security policy for the signed content item.","In another embodiment, the disclosure includes a system for enforcing a plurality of security policies for shared content, comprising a content oriented network (CON) comprising a plurality of content routers, and a plurality of edge nodes coupled to the CON, wherein the edge nodes are configured to couple a first group of users to the CON and a second group of users to the CON, wherein the first group of users are associated with a first security policy for a first content item, wherein the first security policy is created by the first group of users, and wherein the second group of users are associated with a second security policy for a second content item, wherein the second security policy is created by the second group of users, wherein the first security policy is different from the second security policy, and wherein the CON is configured to implement the first security policy and the second security policy.","In another embodiment, the disclosure includes a network apparatus implemented method, comprising receiving, at a receiver, a publisher signed content item from a publisher, encrypting, with a processor, the publisher signed content item, storing the encrypted publisher signed content item in a storage, and enforcing, with a processor, a publisher defined security policy to provide security to the encrypted publisher signed content item","These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.","It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and\/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.","In CONs, content delivery, including publishing, requesting, managing (e.g., modification, deletion, etc.) is based on content name. One aspect of CONs that may be different from traditional Internet Protocol (IP) networks is the ability of CONs to interconnect multiple geographical points and cache content temporarily or on a more persistent basis. This may allow content to be served from the network instead of an originating server, and thus may substantially improve user experience. The caching feature of a CON may have some implications to the user in terms of performance, security, and\/or reliability of handled data. Such implications may depend on service level agreements (SLAs) between the CON and the user. For instance, the user may entrust the CON to manage all its data, which may include strict SLA requirements. Such SLA requirements may require service differentiation in the context of content delivery with respect to performance, security, and\/or reliability. Alternatively, the CON may only provide a best effort content dissemination service by first prioritizing its preferred user.","Disclosed herein is a system and method for providing security level service differentiation among the users of a CON. The system and method may create and manage different security levels for different users or user classes in the CON. The provided security level service differentiation may span multiple security aspects, such as privacy of published data, integrity of permanent or cached data, e.g., to prevent malicious attacks within or outside the network, issues related to trust management, and\/or other security aspects. The security differentiation may address securing published data in terms of privacy and accessibility to other users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","110","112","114","114","120","140","150","100","160","112","114"]},"The internal nodes  may be any nodes, devices, or components that support transportation of traffic, e.g., frames and\/or packets, through the CON . The internal nodes  may pass the traffic onto or receive the traffic from other nodes in the same network domain . For example, the internal nodes  may be routers, switches, or bridges, such as backbone core bridges (BCBs), provider core bridges (PCBs), or label switch routers (LSRs). The internal nodes  may also be content routers  that forward content based on content name prefixes. The content routers  may be any nodes, devices or components that support transportation of traffic between the network domain  and external components. The content routers  may be edge nodes that forward content traffic from the internal nodes  to the customer nodes  and\/or the customer sites , e.g., based on a customer request or demand. The content routers  may also receive content requests from the customer nodes . For example, the content routers may be routers or bridges, such as backbone edge bridges (BEBs), provider edge bridges (PEBs), or label edge routers (LERs) that forward content based on content name prefixes. The internal nodes  and\/or the content routers  may comprise or may be coupled to a plurality of content servers that store or cache content, which may be provided to customers or subscribers, e.g., upon demand.","The customer nodes  may be nodes, devices, or components configured to deliver content to a user or customer and receive content requests from the customer nodes . For instance, the customer nodes  may be fixed or mobile user-oriented devices, such as desktop computers, notebook computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or cellular telephones. Alternatively, the customer nodes  may be connectivity devices at customer premises, such as modems or set-top boxes. The customer nodes  may also comprise customer equipment (not shown) that may be configured to receive content from the content routers , via the access networks , and distribute the content to a plurality of customers. For instance, the customer nodes  may comprise optical network terminals (ONUs) and\/or very high bit rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) transceiver units at residential locations (VTU-Rs). The access networks  may be any networks that provide access to the content in the CON , such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The customer sites  may be any sites or office environments configured to receive content from the content routers  and may send the content to corresponding customer nodes , via the access networks . The customer sites  may also receive content requests from the customer nodes  and send the content requests to the content routers .","The users or customers may be subscribers of the CON  or subscribers of another entity\/community or user group (e.g., Enterprise, Social Network (SN)) that may be a customer of the CON . The User group may comprise a plurality of users that may publish (push) and\/or subscribe (pull) content from the CON . If the users are subscribers of CON , the users may be categorized into multiple classes or categories (such as gold, silver, and bronze) and the CON  and\/or the management plane  may implement a mechanism to provide stronger or enhanced security assurance for the users. If the users are subscribers of another entity\/community or user group that is a customer of the CON , then the CON  and\/or the management plane  may implement different mechanisms or schemes to provide different security levels for different user classes.","For instance, different user groups may have different SLAs, which may ensure a plurality of guarantees with respect to performance, reliability, availability, and\/or security. The CON  may provide security services or functions for the different user groups. The content routers  may be aware of the different user groups for which the CON  provides security services. Specifically, the CON  or the management plane  may comprise a central authority that is aware of the user group instances within a content router  and may manage the user groups, which may allow installation, management, and content publishing\/subscribing for each user group. The CON  and\/or the management plane  may use unique global and local identification of the user groups to enable control\/data plane related content dissemination functions for the user groups. The management plane  may use virtual private user group identifiers (VPG-IDs) and\/or member identifiers (IDs) to be aware of the policy actions being mapped to the user groups. This information may be exchanged between the management plane , the content routers , the customer sites , and\/or the customer nodes  (as indicated by the dashed arrow lines in ).","In an embodiment, content sharing between multiple user groups may be enabled in the CON . For example, in the case where multiple user group instances are present in all the content routers , the meta data associated with a user's request for content may be used to resolve the content to its appropriate location in the CON  by applying the request against the user group identified by the content name. In another embodiment, only some of the user groups may be defined in a subset of content routers , e.g., due to scalability reasons. In this case, the central authority of the management plane  may have knowledge of the mapping between the user groups instances and the content routers .","In an embodiment, the CON  may use three modes of operation to ensure user privacy and data accessibility for the user groups and their users, which may be based on different SLA requirements. The first mode may be implemented when the user group (e.g., Enterprise or SN) handles content security. In this case, the user may interact with the user group to seek authorization to publish or request any content and the CON  may basically serve as a content dissemination engine. In the second mode, the user group (Enterprise or SN) and the CON may participate in ensuring privacy and accessibility of data that has been published. In this case the security responsibility may be divided between the user group and the CON . The third mode may be a CON complete solution where the CON  takes over the responsibility of providing security and preventing wrongful access to the published content, without substantial involvement from the user group.","The three modes above may be supported in the CON  using three confidentiality\/privacy protection functions or schemes, which may be applied for different user groups or different user classes (categories), e.g., in the same or different user groups. In a first scheme, the security service may be limited to ensuring data integrity among the users of a user group or among all the user groups. In the second scheme, security features may be defined for each user in a user group or for each user group, which may enable more security than the first scheme. This scheme may include data confidentiality\/privacy for ensuring that cached data is secure in the network. In the third scheme, security policies may be enabled so as to share the content among multiple user groups to preserve both data integrity and confidentiality\/privacy for users. The third scheme may allow users in a user group to access and\/or publish content or information in another user group or multiple user groups. The three schemes for the three modes are described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","260","210","100","260","270","270","276","274","272"]},"The central authority for managing users  may comprise a service differentiation layer  for identifying the different user groups and users, such as based on VPG-IDs for the user groups and\/or member IDs for the users , which may be indicated in the content of the users . The central authority for managing users  may comprise a differentiated security service , which may be implemented to the different user classes by a service oriented content plane , such as based on one of the three schemes above. For example, the first scheme may be used to provide data integrity to the bronze users . The second scheme may be implemented to provide data integrity and data confidentiality to the silver users . The data confidentiality may be based on security requirements or policies, such as SLAs for the users  or user groups. The service oriented content plane  may also use other policies , such as Quality of Service (QoS) or other policies for the users  or user groups. The third scheme may be implemented to provide data integrity and shared confidentiality among different user groups for the gold users , e.g., based on the other policies .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","276","300","310","310","312","314","112","114","314","350","120","150","350","310"]},"Based on the first level scheme , each user group may have a public\/private key pair (pb-p, pr-p) and general cryptographic algorithms or functions. In some scenarios, each content router  may also have a public\/private key pair (pb-c, pr-c). The cryptographic algorithms may include functions for signing content (Sign(pr, m)) and verifying content signature (Verify(pb, Sign(pr, m). The functions may be based on the parameters public key (pb), private key (pr) and content (m). The cryptographic algorithms or functions may be any cryptographic algorithms or functions known or used in existing CONs, e.g., using algorithm libraries such as open Secure Sockets Layer (openSSL).","For instance, a first customer node\/site  may be a content publisher that publishes content for a user to the CON , via a first content router  (CR). The user may belong to a user group that is subscribed to or associated with the customer node\/site , such as an Enterprise, organization, or SN. The user may sign content using Sign(pr-p, m) and publish the content with CR using Publish(m, name), where pr-p is a private key for the publisher (e.g., the first customer node\/site ) and name is the content name (e.g., name prefix). The content may be signed by the private key to provide a digital signature on the content. CR may optionally also sign the published content using Sign(pr-c, m), where pr-c is a private key for the content router . The content may then be stored or cached in the CON .","A second customer node\/site , which may correspond to the same user group or a different user group of the first customer node\/site , may then obtain the content. The second customer node\/site  may subscribe the content with CR or with a second content router  (CR) using Subscribe(name). The first level scheme  may allow the second customer nodes\/site  to verify the integrity of the content by examining the digital signature of the first customer node\/site  and\/or CR using Verify(pb-p, Sign(pr-p, m)), where pb-p is a public key for publishers. In some scenarios, CR may also verify any unwanted tampering of the data (e.g., while cached in the CON ) using an optional signature computed by the CR servicing the publisher. Thus, the second customer node\/site  may determine that the content is provided by a publisher of the CON  and not by an intruder or unauthorized entity. For instance, each content router  may have a corresponding public\/private key pair (pb-c, pr-c), which may be distributed in the CON  using network management functions. In some scenarios, the subscriber may also verify the integrity of the content signed by CR using Verify(pb-c, Sign(pr-c, m)). Additionally, CRmay verify the content using Verify(pb-p, Sign(pr-p, m)) or Verify(pb-c, Sign(pr-c, m)), since pb-p and pb-c may be publicly available to all entities (users and routers) of the CON .","The functions for content publishing and subscribing may be provided, e.g., as application programming interfaces (APIs), by the CON  to the customer nodes\/sites . By providing signature verification, the first level scheme  may allow users basic security by verifying content integrity of pulled or subscribed content. However, the first level scheme  may not provide content confidentiality\/privacy protection to the users (e.g., publishers\/subscribers). Thus, threats of passive eavesdropping during content transmission and\/or of access from unauthorized subscribers may still exist.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","274","400","410","300","410","400","300","410","412","414","412","414","414","450","120","150","450","410"]},"Based on the second level scheme , one or more of user groups may have a public\/private key pair and general cryptographic algorithms or functions, as in the first level security scheme . The cryptographic algorithms or functions may include functions for signing content (Sign(pr, m)) and verifying content signature (Verify(pb, Sign(pr, m), which may be provided via algorithm libraries such as openSSL. At least some of the routers may have encryption keys and general cryptographic algorithms or functions, including content encryption (Enc(k, m) and content decryption (Dec(k, Enc(k, m)),","For instance, a first customer node\/site  may be a content publisher that publishes content for a user to the CON , via a first content router  (CR). The user may belong to a user group that is subscribed to or associated with the customer node\/site , such as an Enterprise, organization, or SN. The user may sign content using Sign(pr-p, m) and publish the content with CR using SecurePublish(m, name). The content may be published in original format, e.g., as plaintext. As such, CR may encrypt the content, e.g. in cyphertext format, using Enc(k, m) to protect content confidentiality and user privacy. The encryption key k may be selected by CR upon content subscription or may be generated upon user registration. CR may optionally also sign the encrypted content using Sign(pr-c, Enc(k, m)). The encrypted content may then be stored or cached in the CON . The encryption key may be uniquely assigned to the user group and may be distributed to CR in the CON . However, the encryption key may not be shared to other user groups to prevent other user groups from sharing the encrypted content and to maintain groupwise content confidentiality\/privacy.","A second customer node\/site , which may correspond to the same user group of the first customer node\/site  or to another organization or user group authorized by the user group, may then request the content from CR or from a second content router  (CR). CR may receive the encryption key k that was used for encrypting the content and decrypt the content using Dec(Enc(k, m)). CR may optionally also verify the integrity of the encrypted content using Verify(pb-c, Sign(pr-c, Enc(k, m))), where pb-c is a public key for CR. The second customer node\/site  may subscribe the decrypted content with CR using SecureSubscribe(name) and verify the integrity of the content using Verify(pr-b, Sign(pr-p, m)), where pr-b is a private key for the subscriber (e.g., the second customer node\/site ).","The functions for secure publishing and secure subscribing may be provided, e.g., as APIs, by the CON  to the customer nodes\/sites .

The content may be protected for confidentiality during transmission as a security service provided by the CON . In the second level security scheme , the channels or links between the customer nodes\/sites  and the content routers  may be secured channels. For instance, trust may be established between the content routers  and the internal nodes  before exchanging the encryption key k. The content routers  may exchange the encryption key k over the secured channels. Alternatively, the encryption key may be distributed to the content routers  by a centralized authority in the CON , such as the a management plane . The content encryption may be used to provide protection against passive eavesdropping during content transmissions.

Additionally, the third level scheme  may use a set of group IDs for users authorized to publish and subscribe content, such as according to an organization policy. The authorized users may be members of one or multiple user groups, which may be allowed to share publishing\/subscribing content.","For instance, a first customer node\/site  may be a content publisher that publishes content for a user to the CON , via a content router . The user may belong to one user group that may share content with other user groups or may belong to multiple user groups that share content, such as different Enterprises, organizations, or SNs. The user may sign content using Sign(pr-p, m) and publish the content with a content router  using AuthorizedPublish(groupid-p, groupid-s, m, name), where groupid-p is one ID in a set of group IDs (or memberships) for authorized publishers for the content and groupid-s is one ID in a set of group IDs or keys (memberships) for authorized subscribers for the content. The content may be published in original format, e.g., as plaintext. As such, the content router  may encrypt the content, e.g. in cyphertext format, using Enc(groupid-s, m), where groupid-s is one ID in a set of group IDs or keys (memberships) for authorized subscribers for the content. The content router  may create and distribute a plurality of group keys in the CON  to other content routers . The content router  may optionally also sign the encrypted content using Sign(pr-c, Enc(groupid-s, m)). The encrypted content may then be stored or cached in the CON  in cyphertext.

The user may sign content using Sign(pr-p, m) and publish the content with CR using AuthorizedPublish(groupid-p, policy, m, name), e.g., as plaintext. CR may then encrypt the content, e.g. in cyphertext format, using Enc(policy, m), where policy is a logical formula based on group memberships that indicates user\/user groups or members authorized to share content. For example, a policy set to (group1 AND group2) OR group3 may indicate that content may be shared (e.g., published and subscribed) by a user that is both a member of a first user group (group1) and a second user group (group2) or that is a member of a third user group (group3). CR may create group keys for the content and distribute the keys in the CON  to other content routers . CR may optionally also sign the encrypted content using Sign(pr-c, Enc(policy, m)).

The encrypted content may be authorized for any user that satisfies the indicated policy.","A second customer node\/site , which may correspond to any of the user groups indicated in the policy may then request the content from CR or a second content router  (CR). CR may receive the encryption group keys that were used for encrypting the content and decrypt the content using Dec(set of groupid-s, Enc(policy, m)), where set of groupid-s is a set of group IDs for authorized subscribers of the content that satisfy the policy. A subscriber may belong to a plurality of groups and may have a plurality of corresponding group IDs.

The second customer node\/site  may subscribe the decrypted content with CR using AuthorizedSubscribe(set of groupid-s, m, name) and verify the integrity of the content using Verify(pr-b, Sign(pr-p, m)). A single cached or stored copy of the content in the CON  may be used for multiple publishers\/subscribers that satisfy the policy, which may improve the efficiency\/scalability of the third level security scheme , e.g., in comparison to the third level security scheme  since less content may be cached.","In the third level security scheme , the user groups authorized for sharing content may not be registered with each content router . For instance, a first subset of authorized user groups may be registered with some of the content routers  and a second subset of authorized user groups may be registered with other content routers . In this case, a content request from a user may be forwarded to a central authority to determine which closest content router  may be capable of resolving the request for the user, which may be a different content router  that is not registered to the user or his user group. Further, each user or user group may have its own organization policies and enforcements. For example, the groupid-p in AuthorizedPublish( ) and the groupid-s in AuthorizeSubscribe( ) may be obtained after implementing an organization's authorization policy, which may group multiple authorized publishers with multiple authorized subscribers for content. The third level security scheme  may also have the same trust relations among the components\/channels of the CON  as the second level security scheme .","In the group-based schemes above, e.g., the third level security schemes  and , a plurality of crypto mechanisms may be used to implement the group-based encryption and decryption algorithms to satisfy the requirements in the CON. In one embodiment, the CON (or content router) may generate symmetric group keys for individual user groups. A content that belongs to multiple user groups may be encrypted with different group keys, e.g., for different user groups. In another embodiment, the CON may use an attribute-based encryption where each groupid is an attribute, such as described in http:\/\/acsc.cs.utexas.edu\/ and http:\/\/www.cs.berkeley.edu\/\u02dcbethenco\/oakland07cpabe.pdf, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. As such, when a content is published, the CON may include the policy as part of the cached or stored meta data. The policy may indicate what user groups are allowed to access the content. When the CON delivers the content to a user, the CON nodes (e.g., content routers) may decrypt the content based on the subscriber's group memberships.","The security schemes described above may be extended and customized for multiple levels of security services upon customer requirements.

The programmable content forwarding plane block  may interpret user requests for content and accordingly fetch content, e.g., based on metadata and\/or content name, from the network or other content routers and may store the content, e.g., temporarily, in the storage blocks . The programmable content forwarding plane block  may then forward the cached content to the user. The programmable content forwarding plane block  may be implemented using software, hardware, or both and may operate above the IP layer or L2. The storage blocks  may comprise a cache  for temporarily storing content, such as content that is requested by a subscriber. Additionally, the storage blocks  may comprise a long-term storage  for storing content relatively longer, such as content submitted by a publisher. For instance, The cache  and the long-term storage  may include Dynamic random-access memories (DRAMs), solid-state drives (SSDs), hard disks, or combinations thereof.","The network components described above may be implemented on any general-purpose network component, such as a computer or network component with sufficient processing power, memory resources, and network throughput capability to handle the necessary workload placed upon it.  illustrates a typical, general-purpose network component  suitable for implementing one or more embodiments of the components disclosed herein. The network component  includes a processor  (which may be referred to as a central processor unit or CPU) that is in communication with memory devices including secondary storage , read only memory (ROM) , random access memory (RAM) , input\/output (I\/O) devices , and network connectivity devices . The processor  may be implemented as one or more CPU chips, or may be part of one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).","The secondary storage  is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non-volatile storage of data and as an over-flow data storage device if RAM  is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage  may be used to store programs that are loaded into RAM  when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM  is used to store instructions and perhaps data that are read during program execution. ROM  is a non-volatile memory device that typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM  is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM  and RAM  is typically faster than to secondary storage .","At least one embodiment is disclosed and variations, combinations, and\/or modifications of the embodiment(s) and\/or features of the embodiment(s) made by a person having ordinary skill in the art are within the scope of the disclosure. Alternative embodiments that result from combining, integrating, and\/or omitting features of the embodiment(s) are also within the scope of the disclosure. Where numerical ranges or limitations are expressly stated, such express ranges or limitations should be understood to include iterative ranges or limitations of like magnitude falling within the expressly stated ranges or limitations (e.g., from about 1 to about 10 includes, 2, 3, 4, etc.; greater than 0.10 includes 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, etc.). For example, whenever a numerical range with a lower limit, R, and an upper limit, R, is disclosed, any number falling within the range is specifically disclosed. In particular, the following numbers within the range are specifically disclosed: R=R+k*(R\u2212R), wherein k is a variable ranging from 1 percent to 100 percent with a 1 percent increment, i.e., k is 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, 7 percent, . . . , 70 percent, 71 percent, 72 percent, . . . , 97 percent, 96 percent, 97 percent, 98 percent, 99 percent, or 100 percent. Moreover, any numerical range defined by two R numbers as defined in the above is also specifically disclosed. Use of the term \u201coptionally\u201d with respect to any element of a claim means that the element is required, or alternatively, the element is not required, both alternatives being within the scope of the claim. Use of broader terms such as comprises, includes, and having should be understood to provide support for narrower terms such as consisting of, consisting essentially of, and comprised substantially of. Accordingly, the scope of protection is not limited by the description set out above but is defined by the claims that follow, that scope including all equivalents of the subject matter of the claims. Each and every claim is incorporated as further disclosure into the specification and the claims are embodiment(s) of the present disclosure.
