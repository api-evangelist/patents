title: Methods and systems for interactive classification of objects
abstract: Methods and systems provide a computational assistance for interactive classification that compensates for the small size of computer screens and accelerates classification tasks. Similarity indicators reduce manual search by enabling information objects to “call out” automatically to encourage a sensemaker to place related items nearby. Similarity terms signal which groups or objects match and why they match. Using these techniques, an interactive classification tool can focus a sensemaker's attention, move things into view automatically, and provide shortcuts for automatic classification. These techniques speed up classification for rule-based classification, example-based classification, and mixed strategies and have the potential for application in a wide variety of sensemaking tools.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This non-provisional application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/357,850, entitled \u201cZooming Interfaces For Sensemaking, Visualization, and Navigation\u201d which was filed on Feb. 21, 2002, and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The following related U.S. patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety:\n\n","1. Field of Invention","This invention relates to methods and systems for interactive classification of object.","2. Description of Related Art","\u201cSensemaking\u201d is a process of gathering, understanding, and using information for a purpose. Sensemaking tasks often involve searching for relevant documents and then extracting and reformulating information so that the information can be better utilized. A sensemaker gathers information, identifies and extracts portions of the information, organizes such portions for efficient use, and ultimately incorporates the information in a work product with the required logical and rhetorical structure.","A common part of many sensemaking tasks is organizing \u201cfactoids\u201d or other units of information, or objects, into related groups. Objects may be any form, such as simple text or a list of items. The difficulty of organizing objects depends on several practical factors, including the number of objects to be organized and the efficiency of the operations for finding, reading and manipulating the objects.","A key factor that influences the efficiency of an organizing task on a display, such as a computer display, is the size of a viewed space in a workspace. For a classification task on a display too small to show all of the objects, some objects are necessarily out of sight, so that a sensemaker must take additional steps and often use more time in locating and manipulating objects. In this case, search operations generally require not only scanning with the eyes, but also navigation with a pointer using panning, scrolling, and zooming. Such operations, which bring objects into the viewed space, significantly add to the time required in comparison with larger displays. The overhead of panning or scrolling can also adversely affect overall performance by distracting the sensemaker with extra steps and by requiring the sensemaker to remember things while navigating between objects.","Estes teaches that there are two primary types of models used to explain human classification behavior: exemplar-based models and rule-based models (Estes, W. K. (1994) Classification and Cognition. New York: Oxford University Press, pp 33-87). These two models of classification also correspond well with how humans organize objects into groups using a workspace such as a computer display.","In organizing objects into groups in a workspace, the rule-based classification tends to be formal. In this instance, a set of categories is determined, and explicit membership criteria are established for each of the categories by rules. To classify an object, a sensemaker checks the rules for each category and adds an object to whichever category the object satisfies the rules. Classifying an object amounts to adding the object to a \u201cbucket\u201d containing the objects that satisfy the membership criteria.","Determining or defining a category requires upfront work. A sensemaker may have to assign or allocate a place for the new category, determine the membership criteria, add the object to the category, and write down the membership criteria in a title or other visible label. Once this is done, however, future assignments of objects to this category go faster because the sensemaker need only check the label and then \u201cdrop\u201d appropriate objects into the category.","With respect to computer systems, the membership criteria often take the form of a title or label on a window or folder. For example, e-mail systems, such as Eudora\u00ae and Microsoft\u00ae Outlook\u00ae, provide hierarchies of named mail folders for classifying messages. Storing an email message into an appropriate folder is an example of classifying an object. A key feature of interactive rule-based classification is that the decision about how to classify an object requires reading the membership criteria (in the form of titles or folder names), but generally does not require reading the previously classified objects (such as the email messages already in the folder).","Organizing objects into groups in a workspace using exemplar-based classification, on the other hand, is more tentative and informal. To classify an object, one must compare the object with the examples in an informal category or cluster in order to determine whether the object fits. Classifying an object amounts to placing the object in or near a cluster of similar objects.","Creating a cluster or implicit category requires less upfront work than creating a formal, or explicit category, but has greater overhead for future classifications. To set up a new cluster, a sensemaker simply places a new object in some uncrowded region of the workspace, possibly near other clusters or categories that seem somewhat related. No label or membership criteria are supplied. Future classifications are somewhat more tedious than in the case of explicit categories because the sensemaker needs to examine members of clusters in order to determine where to place new objects. Unless the sensemaker remembers tentative abstractions for a cluster, there is no shortcut for membership determination by checking a label or rule.","In a workspace, exemplar-based classification amounts to visual clustering. There are no explicit titles or rules for membership in a cluster. The boundaries of the clusters can be somewhat more tentative and ambiguous, especially when two clusters are near each other. The decision about how to classify an object requires reading or scanning other objects to detect similarity, and then locating the new object near the other objects that the new object best matches.","In interactive sensemaking workspaces, two types of overviews may be available: structural overviews that show a list of categories to which objects may be classified, and special overviews that show positional relationships of objects in the workspace.","Structural overviews are well suited for rule-based classification where the formal categories correspond to labels in an outline.  is an example of structural overviews. An interface, such as a drag-and-drop interface, makes the process of adding objects to a category convenient. Structural overviews can incorporate nesting, yielding hierarchical trees of categories.","However, structural overviews provide no support for exemplar-based classification because the structural overviews show the labels of formal categories, but nothing about the informal categories.","Spatial overviews provide a rendering of the workspace. Such overviews can be allocated permanently or transiently at a portion of the display space, while most of the sensemaker's work is done in a focus of the workspace. Using such spatial overviews, formal categories and informal categories can be both shown at a reduced scale.","However, because of the reduced scale, the sensemaker may have to zoom in the workspace in order or put a desired section of the workspace in focus, to recognize and understand the contents of objects for classification.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","110","130","140","150","160","150","140"]},"U.S. Pat. No. 6,243,093 to Czerwinski et al. discloses a system for spatially organizing stored web pages that automatically highlights similar web pages during organization and retrieval tasks. When the user drags or clicks on a web page, similarity metrics between the dragged or clicked web page and other stored web pages in a single-level spatial workspace are computed and web pages with such similarity are highlighted to the sensemaker. This system computes similarity metrics between items in a spatial workspace and displays this similarity to the user. However, this system does not indicate how objects are similar, but rather simply indicates numeric scores for the similarity. Similarly, this system does not use automatic similarity indicators for labeled hierarchical organizations rather than large single level spaces.","Similar techniques have also been applied to information retrieval in large document collections, such as the Web. One such technique described by Hearst (Hearst, 1995, TileBars: Visualization of Term Distribution Information in Full Text Information Access, Proceedings of CHI '95. p. 59-66), called TileBars, creates simple colored rectangles to represent the pages in a set of documents. In this technique, the intensity of the fill color of these rectangles signifies the number of query matches on the specified page. A related technique by Woodruff et al. (Woodruff, Faulring, Rosenholtz, Morrison, & Pirolli, 2001, Using Thumbnails to Search the Web, Conference Proceedings of CHI 2001, Vol. 3, Issue 1, p. 198-205, 552) enhances standard web page thumbnails with enlarged text labels. These enlarged labels indicate the location and frequency of query terms, combining the benefits of traditional thumbnails with the benefits of simple text summaries. Nevertheless, both these techniques have been applied only to static one-dimensional documents. These techniques do not extend them to dynamic documents with multiple dimensions.","The interactive classification technique according to the invention facilitates classification of a new object added to a workspace. In a workspace for sensemaking, objects often include text segments. In addition, objects may be made multi-level, that is, objects may have sub-objects within. Sensemakers tend to use a mixture of rule-based and exemplar-based strategies for classification tasks when working in such a workspace. A mixture of strategies enables sensemakers to create tentative clusters when the sensemakers are not yet sure of the criteria, and to create efficient rule-based categories, as the criteria are determined or established.","To increase the efficiency and ease of locating and understanding objects in a workspace, objects may be interactively classified and put together based on the objects' similarity.","Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide methods and systems for interactive classification of objects. In various exemplary embodiments, the method includes receiving an instruction to place a new object into a workspace, determining a similarity of the new object to an existing object, category, or cluster, and providing a visual indication of the similar words in both the new object and an existing object, cluster, or category. The visual indication may also reflect the degree to which the new object is similar to the existing object, cluster, or category. The method may also provide an indication of a place for manual placement of the new object. The method may also include providing a view of a place with objects having the similarity.","Therefore, the methods and systems according to this invention can facilitate classification of objects in a workspace and thus facilitate the sensemaker's understanding of the objects and the workspace.","Interactive classification methods according to this invention can provide a way to automatically classify and\/or place a new object, or provide assistance for manual classification and\/or placement of objects in a workspace, based on similarity of the objects. In various exemplary embodiments, the methods according to this invention facilitate interactive classification with improved performance, such as speed and\/or ease.","Various aspects of this present invention may be incorporated in a system, such as the systems disclosed in a co-pending, co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/371,017 entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Interaction of Graphical Objects on A Computer Controlled System,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","For interactive classification of an object, a similarity metric may be determined for identifying which objects are more similar, and a key element identifier may be used for determining which of various elements, such as words, in an object contributes most to the judgment of similarity. For example, similarity may be determined as follows.","First, an object may be divided into elements, such as, individual words. Then, the words are reduced to the smallest form, or stems, so that variant forms of each individual word become identical. Stem or term frequencies in the object (\u201cdocument\u201d) and in the collection of objects (\u201ccorpus\u201d) are then computed. A combined weight reflecting the relative frequencies of the terms in the document and corpus is computed using a term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) or similar scheme.","A similarity matcher may be used in conjunction with other parts of a sensemaking tool to give a sensemaker more useful feedback and to facilitate an interactive classification task. For example, related objects and groups in the workspace and overview may be highlighted when a new object is selected for classification. For example, as shown in , in an overview , objects  that have a similarity with the new object are highlighted for an indication to the sensemaker. Such highlighting may draw the sensemaker's attention to the most likely classification opportunities, depending on the selectivity of the similarity computation. Alternatively or additionally, the system may automatically pan into a view that includes a best-matching object, cluster, or category for the new object. Further, a shortcut operation, such as a gesture or button on the object, may be provided that instructs the system to classify the object, without the sensemaker needing to perform a drag-and-drop operation. In many cases, combining such feedback with what the sensemaker already knows about the collection may be enough to facilitate complete classification.","In addition to determining a similarity metric for individual objects, a similarity score for a group, such as a cluster or explicit category, may be determined.","One approach is to take all of the objects in a group and treat the objects as if the objects constitute a single document. Assuming that the term frequencies are normalized for the document, this approach may essentially create an average document to which the unclassified object may be compared.","Another approach is to take a score of the best matching object in a group as a representative of the group. This approach may tend to emphasize clusters where at least some of the objects have a very high similarity to the unclassified object.","Another approach is to determine a weighted intermediate score between the average match and the best match for a group. For example, a composite score may be determined from the average similarity and the best similarity for the group.","The methods for computing a similarity score for a group as described above may not take into account any explicit rules for formal categories. In classification tasks, the \u201crules\u201d may be in the form of labels rather than executable rules. Various methods are contemplated for including the content of the label of a group in a similarity matching process, as further described below.","One approach is to simply match the label, ignoring the content of the objects in the group. Another approach is to append one or more copies of the group label to the individual objects in order to enhance the contribution of the label terms in the computation of a similarity score for each object. This approach can be combined with the methods described above.","In the case of informal categories, two exemplary approaches are computing similarities only for individual objects and computing aggregate similarities. The latter approach may require determining which objects are in a cluster. Two kinds of information may be used to in determining cluster membership: the coordinates of the objects in the workspace and the similarity of the objects. Such information may be combined in various ways. Once a cluster is identified, the aggregate scoring methods described above for groups may be used.","One approach to displaying similarity information, either in an overview or in a detailed workspace, is to use a similarity metric to determine which regions to highlight. This approach may be similar to a technique disclosed in a copending, co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/369,617 entitled \u201cMethods and System for Indicating Invisible Contents of Workspace\u201d, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Various visual effects may be used to convey information, such as color and intensity.","For example, only matches above a predetermined threshold may be included in the visual transfer functions using, for example, one form of highlighting to indicate matches for which there is a very high degree of similarity and another form of highlighting to indicate matches with a significant, but more moderate degree of similarity.","An issue with just using similarity scores for classification is that the scores may be non-specific. An object about, for example, \u201cdriving tips\u201d might match one group of objects on the basis of one criterion (e.g., \u201cweather rules\u201d or rules mentioning \u201cfog\u201d) and another group of objects on the basis of another criterion (e.g., \u201cspeed rules\u201d or rules mentioning \u201cspeed\u201d). If the similarity scores for the two groups are about equal, then highlighting by itself does not convey information for discriminating between the two groups.","An alternative to simple highlighting based on the similarity score is to augment the display of matching objects with a specific indicator of the reason for the match, such as the particular elements that contribute most to the similarity score. In the above-described examples, the indicator may be, for example, temporarily superimposing the most important matching or similarity term(s) in a different color on each object or group.","This approach of enhancing the display of similar objects and groups compensates to some degree for the inevitable irregularities in similarity matching scores and provides more specific signals to the sensemaker about which groups or objects are similar in ways that matter. As shown in , where more than one category is similar, specific terms  like \u201cfog\u201d and \u201cspeed\u201d may be enlarged to convey more information to the sensemaker. Other indication of terms is contemplated as well, such as highlighting, flashing, and the like.","When similarity signals are displayed, the indication should be clear as to which objects the similarity signals refer. One approach is to display similarity signals, such as similarity terms, within the bounds of the matched object. Another approach is to provide call-outs or labels on arrows that indicate that a similarity signal refers to a particular object.","As new objects are classified, the similarity signals may need to be refreshed to make use of the information in the objects. That is, signals from a previous match may need to disappear. One approach is to make similarity signals transient so that the signals may stay in view only during a specific matching operation. Another approach is to make the signals slowly fade from the display, or to make the signals disappear in response to a sensemaker's request. It will be appreciated that many other approaches are possible.","The strongest matches may not be close enough to be displayed simultaneously. The system may automatically bring into view the objects or groups with the greatest degree of match. Furthermore, the system may automatically pan, scroll, or zoom based on the similarity scores of the groups and\/or objects.","Should the sensemaker desire to return to the workspace in which the sensemaker was working before such panning, scrolling or zooming, controls enabling the sensemaker to go forward or backward, for example, by forward and backward buttons, may be provided to help the sensemaker tour the matching groups and\/or objects. An example of a technique used to go forward or backward is described in a co-pending, co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/369,612 entitled \u201cMethod and System for Navigating A Workspace,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Another approach is to use \u201cpop-up signals\u201d such that the similarity signal appears on the objects when an input is received. For example, as the sensemaker moves a cursor, a mouse pointer or the like over an overview or over the workspace, annotations about similarity may transiently appear.","Moreover, when a new object to be classified has a degree of match with nested groups at several levels of a hierarchy, the signal may need to differentiate among the levels and may indicate the level where the similarity is the greatest.","Similarity may be shown either to individual objects of a group or to a group as a whole. Generally, there may not be enough space to display both. The amount of space available can be used to govern the choice. When there is insufficient space to indicate the similarity to each of the separate objects in a group, the display may be limited to the similarity terms for the group as a whole. In the case of clusters, a determination of the elements that are in the cluster may be required.","Drag-and-drop interfaces to an overview may speed up the classification of a new object. Using the drag-and-drop interfaces, when the user places a new object, the system may automatically indicate one or more positions to which the user may place the new object based on the similarity between the new object and the objects that already exist in the workspace. The description of how the drag-and-drop technique works is omitted here since any existing or hereafter developed drag-and-drop technique may be used. It should be understood that any other known or hereafter developed technique for introducing an object to the workspace may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","510","520","530","540","550","560","570","580","590","600","530","610","620","630","611","621","631"]},"The controller  controls the general data flow between other components of the interactive classification system .

To provide the instruction, the user may use a drag-and-drop technique, for example, to place a new object.","The similarity determination circuit  determines the similarity of a new object to the objects in the workspace. Such determination may be done by, for example, determining a similarity metric for identifying which object(s) is most similar and determining which of the elements (e.g., words) in the new object most contributed to the judgment of similarity. Such similarity metric may be calculated by breaking an object into elements, such as words, reducing the elements to stems, and computing term (stem) frequencies in the object and in the collection of objects.","The cluster detecting circuit  determines a cluster or a group of objects in the workspace. Determination of a cluster or a group may be done by identifying coordinates of the objects in the workspace and\/or the similarity of the cluster or the group.","The similarity representation circuit  represents the indication of similarity of the new object to the existing objects by, for example, highlighting the most similar categories or objects. In addition, the similarity representation circuit  may transiently pop up a similarity signal based on an input from a user interface, such as moving a cursor onto an interface using a mouse or the like. The representation circuit  may also represent elements in objects that are most similar to the new object and refresh the similarity signal for previous matches by using, for example, fading operations.","The placement assisting circuit  provides assistance to the sensemaker for placement of the new object, including, for example, highlighting a possible space for placement of the object based on the similarity metric or providing an arrow in the overview.","The visual effect circuit  provides visual effects after placement of the new object.
