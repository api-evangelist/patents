Under vehicle crash conditions of sufficient severity, the inner seat back portion B is configured to move, e.g., pivot, away from the outer back portion A to a predefined position relative to the outer back portion A.","In the embodiment illustrated in , the restraint harnesses ,  and  are identical to those illustrated and described hereinabove with respect to the configurable restraint system  of , A and , although the restraint harnesses ,  and  may alternatively be identical to those illustrated and described hereinabove with respect to the configurable restraint system \u2033 of . It will be understood that either of the restraint harnesses \u2033 and \u2033 may otherwise be configured as a conventional two-point restraint harness, and\/or any of the restraint harnesses \u2032\u2033, \u2032\u2033 and  may be configured as conventional 4 or 5-point restraint harnesses. Modifications to the system required to accommodate 4 or 5-point restraint harnesses would be a mechanical step for a skilled artisan.","As with the embodiments , \u2032, \u2033, \u2032\u2033 and illustrated and described herein, the configurable restraint system is configurable to restrain a number of relatively larger occupants of a vehicle seat , and is also configurable to restrain a larger number of relatively smaller occupants of the vehicle seat \u2032. The embodiment of the configurable restraint system is identical in some respects to the configurable restraint systems , \u2032, \u2033, \u2032\u2033, \u2033\u2033 and illustrated and described herein, and like numbers are therefore used to identify like components.","The configurable restraint system includes a movable engagement member, designated generally at , and another engagement member  that may or may not be movable. It will be understood that while the movable engagement member is provided in the system in the form of the movable engagement member  illustrated and described herein, and the engagement member  is provided in a movable form as illustrated and described herein, such engagement members may alternatively be provided in any movable or non-movable form using any of the configurations illustrated and described herein with respect to .","The system illustrated in  may be configured to restrain up to two relatively larger occupants, e.g., teenage or adult occupants by moving the movable engagement member  toward the center  of the vehicle seat . In this configuration, as specifically illustrated in , the restraint harness \u2032\u2033 may restrain one relatively larger occupant of the seat  when the engagement member  engages the engagement member , and the restraint harness \u2032\u2033 may restrain another relatively larger occupant of the vehicle seat when the engagement member  engages the engagement member . In this configuration, the restraint harness  and the engagement member  are not used. The system may also be configured to restrain up to three relatively smaller occupants, e.g., toddlers, elementary, middle-school and\/or junior high-school aged children by moving the movable engagement member  toward the end  of the vehicle seat \u2032. In this configuration, as specifically illustrated in , the restraint harness \u2032\u2033 may restrain one relatively smaller occupant of the seat  when the engagement member  engages the engagement member , the restraint harness  may restrain another relatively smaller occupant of the seat  when the engagement member  engages the engagement member , and the restraint harness \u2032\u2033 may restrain yet another relatively smaller occupant of the vehicle seat  when the engagement member  engages the engagement member .","While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the foregoing drawings and description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only illustrative embodiments thereof have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. For example, while the embodiment of the configurable restraint systems , \u2032, \u2033, \u2032\u2033, \u2033\u2033, and are illustrated and described herein in the context of a vehicle seat  or \u2032 that is sized and configured to accommodate two larger occupants or three relatively smaller occupants, any one or more of the configurable restraint harness systems , \u2032, \u2033, \u2032\u2033, \u2033\u2033, and may alternatively be configured for use with vehicle seats allowing for more or fewer larger occupants and\/or relatively smaller occupants simply by adding or eliminating one or more restraint harnesses, movable or non-movable engagement members similar to one or more of the movable engagement members -\u2033\u2033 and\/or one or more movable or non-movable engagement members similar to the engagement member ."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1-3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1-4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIGS. 6A-6E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 7B","FIGS. 6A-6E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 15"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 15"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
