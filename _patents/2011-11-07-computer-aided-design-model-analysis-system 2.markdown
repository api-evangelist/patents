{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The present disclosure relates generally to models and, in particular, to computer aided design models. Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for processing computer aided design models.","2. Background","Computer aided design (CAD) systems employ the use of computers and software to design objects. The models generated by computer aided design systems include drawings of objects. These drawings may be two-dimensional drawings, three-dimensional drawings, or a combination of the two. Additionally, these models also may include information about the objects. For example, materials, processes, dimensions, tolerances, and other information about an object and the different parts making up the object may be present. In addition, models of computer aided design systems can also include design history, features, design parameters, constraints, and dependencies of parts for an object in the models.","Computer aided design systems are often used to generate models of complex objects, such as an aircraft. With objects such as an aircraft, the size of models for these types of objects may increase in size and complexity. For example, a model of a single fuselage section for a very complex vehicle such as an aircraft may have thousands of elements, which can result in a model which is over 100 MB and\/or even a terabyte in size. Such an aircraft may have many such fuselage sections, which adds to the complexity and substantially increases the size of the resultant model. The different elements in the model may have multiple complex interdependencies and may include inefficiencies such as extraneous and redundant elements. Thus, the complexity of the model greatly increases as the number of elements and complex interdependencies per elements grows. Models for other parts of the aircraft may have similar or greater numbers of elements. As a result, the cost to create, maintain, and change models also may increase more than desired.","It is often desirable to analyze, view, and check various parts of a model. Reviewing a model generated by a computer aided design system may aide a designer in validating, documenting, and understanding a design process. However, viewing a model in a computer aided design system does not easily provide this type of information to a designer or other person.","Additionally, the model may not be organized or as efficient as desired. For example, the model may be larger than needed because of duplicate elements or redundant elements in the model. As a result, a computer aided design system may not process the model as efficiently or as quickly as desired. Further, when models are larger than needed, the storage space used for the models also is larger than needed. Additionally, the CAD systems may require unnecessarily powerful and expensive components equipped with large amounts of processors, random access memory, and memory storage devices, which are needed to enable the CAD systems' users to effectively design, use, manipulate, and modify large models of complex real-world objects.","Therefore, it would be advantageous to have a method and apparatus that takes into account at least some of the issues discussed above as well as possibly other issues.","In one advantageous embodiment, a method for managing models is present. Elements in a model of an object are identified. Dependencies for the elements are identified. The method generates at least one of a matrix of the elements and a knowledge model of the object using the elements.","In another advantageous embodiment, a model management system comprises a model manager and a model database. The model database is coupled to the model manager. The model manager is further configured to identify dependencies for the elements identified in the model database by the model manager. The model manager is configured to generate at least one of a matrix of the elements and a knowledge model of the object using the elements","The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments in which further details can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.","The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account a number of different considerations. For example, the different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that obtaining information from a model generated by a computer aided design system through the computer aided design system may be more difficult than desired. The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that computer aided design systems are designed to facilitate designing of objects.","The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that these systems may provide an ability to see an object from different angles, sections, and other types of views. The different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that these systems, however, are not well suited for viewing and analyzing other information that may be part of the model. For example, identifying dependencies between different elements may be difficult when viewing the model using computer aided design systems. Further, the different advantageous embodiments recognize and take into account that identifying extraneous elements, redundant elements, process flows, and other information may be more difficult than desired using a computer aided design system to view information within a model.","Thus, the different advantageous embodiments provide a method and apparatus for managing models. In one advantageous embodiment, elements in a model of an object are identified. Dependencies are identified for the elements. A data structure of the elements with the dependencies is generated. In these illustrative examples, a matrix of elements in the model of the object is generated.","With reference now to the figures and, in particular, with reference now to , an illustration of a model management system  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The model management system  in  includes a model database  of models . In the illustrative examples, the model database  of the models  may be vendor neutral and may have a universal format that does not rely of a particular vendor.","In these illustrative examples, a model manager  may manage the models  in the model database . As depicted the model database  is coupled to the model manager . In other words, the model manager  may be connected to a storage device, a computer system, or some other device containing the model database . In some cases, the model manager  and the model database  may be on the computer system .","The model manager  may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination of the two. In these illustrative examples, the model manager  may be implemented in a computer system . The computer system  is one or more computers. When more than one computer is present in the computer system , these computers may be in communication with each other using a communication medium, such as a network.","This management of the models  by the model manager  may include at least one of analyzing models, modifying models, creating new models, and\/or other operations. As used herein, the phrase \u201cat least one of\u201d, when used with a list of items, means different combinations of one or more of the listed items may be used and only one of each item in the list may be needed. For example, \u201cat least one of item A, item B, and item C\u201d may include, for example, without limitation, item A, or item A and item B. This example also may include item A, item B, and item C, or item B and item C.","In managing the models , the model manager  may identify a model  for processing. The model  is a model of an object . The object  may take various forms in these illustrative examples. For example, the object  represented in the model  may be a mobile platform, a stationary platform, a land-based structure, an aquatic-based structure, a space-based structure, an aircraft, a submarine, a bus, a personnel carrier, a tank, a train, an automobile, a spacecraft, a space station, a satellite, a surface ship, a power plant, a dam, a manufacturing facility, a building, an engine, a wing, a propeller, a strut, a landing gear assembly, a mold, a tool, and\/or some other suitable object.","As depicted, the model  comprises model information . The model information  includes elements  in these illustrative examples. Dependencies  are present between the elements  in the model . In these illustrative examples, the elements  in the model  are identified by the model manager . Additionally, the model manager  also identifies the dependencies  between the elements  from the model information  in the model .","In these illustrative examples, the model manager  creates a data structure . As depicted, the data structure  takes the form of a matrix . The elements  identified from the model  are placed into the matrix  by the model manager . Additionally, the matrix  includes the dependencies  between the elements  as identified by the model manager .","In these illustrative examples, the matrix  takes the form of a design structure matrix . The design structure matrix  may also be referred to as a dependency structure method, a dependency structure matrix, a problem-solving matrix, an incidence matrix, an n-square matrix, and\/or a design precedence matrix.","In generating the design structure matrix , the model manager  may implement any currently used processes for creating design structure matrices. The design structure matrix  is a matrix representation of the model . In particular, the matrix representation provides an ability to analyze, visualize, or perform other operations with respect to information in the model .","Currently available analysis techniques analyze information in design structure matrices. Some of these currently available techniques include, for example, partitioning, tearing, banding, clustering, sensitivity, and other known techniques for analyzing design structure matrices.","The selection of a particular technique or combination of techniques depends on at least one of the size of the model , the complexity of the model , the number of dependencies in the model , the domain of the model , and other factors about the model . The domain of the model  is what the model  covers or the scope of the model . For example, the domain of the model  may be any design problem space, such as, for example, aerospace, automotive, marine, semiconductors, and other suitable areas. In another illustrative example, the domain may be a phase of design, such as a conceptual phase, a detailed design phase, and other phases of design. In still another example, the domain may be a functional area, such as tooling, systems, structures, electrical, and other suitable functional areas.","In the illustrative examples, the structure of the model  and the dependencies  for the elements  may also depend on the nature of the design problem which is dependent on a phase of design domain. For example, with phases of design, the conceptual phase is more iterative in nature than other phases downstream from the conceptual phase, such as a detailed design phase. The detailed design phase is more detail oriented than the conceptual phase. Another illustrative example is that the dependencies  in a structural domain are more hierarchical in nature than in an electrical domain. These differences in domains may lead to different selections of techniques for analyzing the design structure matrix  because different types of change and\/or amounts of change may occur when the model  has different domains.","An example of an analysis technique that may be used to analyze the impact of a change to the model  is a sensitivity analysis technique. This analysis technique may be applied to the design structure matrix  for the model . The sensitivity analysis technique may potentially identify the elements  in the model  that are sensitive to a change. These elements  may then be grouped together to create a cluster and\/or sub-cluster by applying clustering analysis.","A graphical user interface  may be used to interact with the model , the matrix , or some combination thereof. In these illustrative examples, the graphical user interface  is displayed on a display system , which is coupled to the model manager . The display system  is hardware and also may include software. In these illustrative examples, the display system  is one or more display devices.","User input to the graphical user interface  may occur using a user input system , which is coupled to the model manager . The user input system  may include at least one of a mouse, a touch screen, a keyboard, a trackball, a joystick, and\/or some other suitable type of user input device. The user input may be made to manipulate the model , the matrix , and\/or other information accessible by the model manager  in the model management system . In these examples, the manipulation may include at least one of changing view, modifying information, adding information, deleting information, and\/or other suitable operations.","Additionally, an analysis  may be performed using the matrix . The analysis  may be used to identify changes  to the model . In other illustrative examples, the analysis  may provide information for use in other operations that may involve designing objects similar to the object . In these illustrative examples, the changes  may form a modified model  from the model .","In still other illustrative examples, the model  may be configured for use with one or more systems . The systems  may be hardware, software, or a combination of the two. In these illustrative examples, the systems  may include computer aided design systems . These computer aided design systems  may include, for example, a first type of computer aided design system , a second type of computer aided design system , an analysis system , and\/or other suitable types of systems that may use the models  in model the model database .","In these illustrative examples, different one of the systems  may use the models  with different formats from formats  for the models . For example, the model  may have a first format  that is used by the first type of computer aided design system .","In some cases, it may be desirable to use the model  with the second type of computer aided design system . In this illustrative example, the second type of computer aided design system  uses a second format . As depicted, the model  with the first format  is unusable by the second type of computer aided design system  because the model  is in the first format .","For example, the first type of computer aided design system  may be Catia and\/or SolidWorks, and the second type of computer aided design system  may be AutoCad and\/or NX Unigraphics. In another illustrative example, the first type of computer aided design system  may be a first version of Catia, while the second type of computer aided design system  may be a second version of Catia.","In these illustrative examples, the model manager  may generate a new model  from the model  that is configured for use with the second type of computer aided design system  using the matrix . In these illustrative examples, the new model  has the second format , which is usable by the second type of computer aided design system . The new model  is also a model of the object , but is usable in the second format  that is used by the second type of computer aided design system .","The process of generating the new model  from the matrix  may include generating a knowledge model  in knowledge models  in a knowledge database , which is coupled to the model manager . In these illustrative examples, the knowledge model  contains knowledge model information  needed to create the new model  for use with the second type of computer aided design system . In the illustrative examples, the knowledge model information  in the knowledge model  may be in a number of different formats. For example, without limitation, the knowledge database  may store the knowledge model information  for the knowledge model  in a markup language format such as an extensible markup language (XML), a relational database, an object-oriented database, or in some other suitable format.","In these illustrative examples, the model manager  does not perform a translation of the model  in the first format  into the new model  with the second format . Instead, the model manager  extracts the model information  from the model  and creates the matrix  using the model information . The model information  is also used to generate the knowledge model . The knowledge model information  in the knowledge model  is used to create the new model  for the object . The new model  has the second format  that is selected for the type of system that the new model  is to be used by in these illustrative examples.","In addition, the model manager  also may create the new model  with the second format  that is configured for use with the analysis system  in the systems  using the knowledge model . The analysis system  may be, for example, a finite element analysis system, a simulation system, a neural network, and\/or some other suitable type of analysis system. This type of the new model  may be created when the analysis system  does not use a format in the formats  for the computer aided design systems , such as the first type of computer aided design system  and the second type of computer aided design system . In this manner, the knowledge models  in the knowledge database  may function as a universal source for creating the models  with the formats  for use with the systems .","Further, the object  may include assemblies  represented by the elements  in the model  of the object . In these illustrative examples, clusters  may be identified in the elements  in the model . These clusters  may be identified using the matrix  in the illustrative examples. The clusters  correspond to the assemblies  in the object .","With this ability to identify the clusters , the new model  may be created for a particular assembly  in the assemblies . For example, a selected cluster  in the clusters  corresponds to the particular assembly  in the assemblies . With the identification of the selected cluster , the model manager  may use the knowledge model  to generate the new model  for just the selected cluster . In other words, the new model  is a model for the particular assembly  rather than all of the assemblies  for the object . As a result, the new model  for the particular assembly  is smaller in size and\/or complexity as compared to the model  of the object .","This feature may be particularly useful when an operator  desires to view or analyze the particular assembly  rather than all of the assemblies  for the object . For example, the new model  for the particular assembly  may be created for use on either the first type of computer aided design system  or the second type of computer aided design system . As another example, the new model  for the particular assembly  may be created for analysis by the analysis system . With this ability to create smaller sizes for the models , the processing and analysis of these versions of the models  may be performed more quickly than using the original versions of the models .","In this manner, the model manager  may make analyzing the models  easier as compared to employing a computer aided design system. Additionally, the model manager  may be used to convert the model  in the models  for use in the second type of computer aided design system .","As a result, if the models  in the model database  include vendor specific formats, the knowledge database  with the knowledge models  provide vendor neutral models from which the new model  can be made. In other words, the knowledge models  in the knowledge database  are not proprietary and rely on any vendor format. The knowledge models  can be turned into the models  with formats  for specific computer aided design systems  currently present or for future computer aided design systems.","The illustration of the model management system  in  is not meant to imply physical or architectural limitations to the manner in which an advantageous embodiment may be implemented. Other components in addition to and\/or in place of the ones illustrated may be used. Some components may be unnecessary. Also, the blocks are presented to illustrate some functional components. One or more of these blocks may be combined, divided, or combined and divided into different blocks when implemented in an advantageous embodiment.","For example, the knowledge model information  may be generated by the model manager  without generating the matrix . Instead, the knowledge model information  for the knowledge model  may be identified by the model manager  from the model . The model manager  may identify the knowledge model information  for the knowledge model  directly or may send calls, commands, and\/or requirements to the first type of computer aided design system .","Turning next to , an illustration of a block diagram of a model  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this illustrative example, the model  has a format  for a particular type of system in the systems  in . As depicted, the model  depicted in  is an example of the model  illustrated in the model management system  in .","In this illustrative example, the model  comprises elements  in a structure . In these illustrative examples, the elements  may include at least one of geometry , rules , parameters , constraints , processes , object information , and\/or other types of elements.","The geometry  in the elements  may include at least one of solids, surfaces, planes, points, curves, vertexes, edges, faces, and\/or other suitable types of geometry . The rules  may include, for example, without limitation, any expert rules and formulae that can be applied to any object. These rules  may be used across the lifecycle of a product. The rules  may include rules for design, manufacturing, tooling, analysis, environmental, configuration, costing, and other suitable rules.","The parameters  may include values for parameters relating to the geometry , the rules , the processes , and\/or other elements . In these illustrative examples, the constraints  may be values that limit or set the parameters . The processes  may include processes for manufacturing an object . Additionally, the processes  may include steps for assembling the object , depending on the particular implementation.","The object information  may be any information about the object . For example, the object information  may be notes made by a designer, comments about materials for manufacturing the object , production plans, material costs, environmental information, and\/or other suitable information.","In these illustrative examples, the structure  is used to organize the elements . As depicted, the structure  is a hierarchical structure . In these illustrative examples, the hierarchical structure  is used to organize the elements  with respect to each other. With the hierarchical structure  for the elements , dependencies  may be formed between the elements  using the hierarchical structure . In these illustrative examples, the hierarchical structure  may take the form of a tree .","With reference now to , an illustration of a block diagram of a data structure  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The data structure  illustrated in  is an example of an implementation for the data structure  in . In this particular example, the data structure  is a matrix  generated from the model  in . More specifically, the matrix  takes the form of a design structure matrix .","As illustrated, the matrix  has rows  and columns . The rows  and the columns  are for elements . The elements  in the matrix  correspond to the elements  in . Further, the matrix  also has cells . Values  for the cells  provide information about the elements  in the matrix . In particular, the values  provide information about dependencies  between the elements  in the matrix . These dependencies  for the elements  correspond to the dependencies  for the elements  in the model  in .","In these illustrative examples, the matrix  provides an easier way to identify the dependencies  for the elements  in the model  as compared to identifying the dependencies  directly from the model .","Further, an order  of the elements  in the matrix  may indicate a design process flow  for the elements  in the model  in .","With reference now to , an illustration of a block diagram of an analysis  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The analysis  in  is an example of the analysis  in . The analysis  is performed using a data structure, such as the data structure  in .","As depicted, the analysis  in  may include identifying at least one of a design history , a design process flow , dependencies , extraneous elements , redundant elements , and clusters .","The design history  may indicate when changes or revisions were made. In these illustrative examples, the design history  represents design iterations and intermediate objects that are created at different stages of the design process. Intermediate objects are identified using clustering analysis and iterations in the design process can be identified in the matrix as feedback loops or cross dependencies that show interdependencies among the elements  from .","For example, inside a sub-cluster an element that depends on other elements but has no dependent elements inside the sub-cluster can be an intermediate object of the design process. A list of these intermediate objects may become part of the design history. Also, design iterations change the model  over time. The changes may be part of the design history . These changes to the model  in the design history  may be obtained by analyzing different dependencies present for different versions of the model  using the matrix . In particular, as the model  changes, the matrix  also changes. These changes may be included in the design history . These changes and other changes may be included in the design history  as part of the overall design history.","The design process flow  may identify an order in which the elements  were added to the model  in . In these illustrative examples, the elements in the clusters and\/or the sub-clusters may be analyzed to identify the design process flow  for the elements  in the clusters and\/or the sub-clusters. The analysis  may identify the dependencies  between the elements  and may apply partitioning and topological sort algorithms to generate the design process flow . Also, a similar analysis may be made between the clusters and\/or the sub-clusters. For example, dependencies  between the clusters and\/or sub-clusters may be topologically sorted to identify the design process flow  for these components. In other words, the design process flow  may be identified at different levels of granularity.","The design process flow  may be used to analyze how the model  in  was created by a designer. This design process flow  may be used to create other models in the models  in .","The dependencies  in the analysis  are identifications of the dependencies  for the elements  for the model  in . The extraneous elements  may be portions of the elements  that may be removed from the model  in .","The redundant elements  are portions of the elements  in  that may be consolidated. For example, two identical functions may be present in the elements  in the model  in . The two sets of elements in the elements  in the model  may each use one of the functions. The model  may be modified such that both sets of the elements in the elements  use the same function rather than both because they are identical.","The clusters  may be examined to identify groupings of the elements  in the model  in . For example, an element cluster in the clusters  may be an assembly in the model  in  that may be identified with the analysis  performed using the data structure  in . The clusters  may be assemblies  in the object  in . For example, one cluster in the clusters  may be a landing gear assembly, another cluster may be an engine housing, and another cluster may be an aircraft network data processing system. With the identification of the clusters , review and visualization of these assemblies may be made more easily.","Further, with the analysis , various operations may be performed. For example, the analysis  may be used to modify the model . In these illustrative examples, the extraneous elements  identified in the elements  for the model  in  may be removed. In this manner, the size of the model  may be reduced. Further, when redundant elements  in the elements  for the model  in  may be consolidated, the model  in  again may be reduced in size. Further, the model  in  may be reduced in complexity. In this manner, the model  in  may be processed more efficiently by a computer aided design system or by some other software, such as an analysis program.","With these capabilities in mind, it can be further appreciated that any amount of reduced complexity will substantially improve the efficiency by which the elements  of the model  can be processed and manipulated by a user of one or more of the computer aided design systems . Additionally, many such complex forms of the object  in  and\/or the object  in  may have industry standard practices and requirements, which mandate that information must be maintained and\/or stored for the entire life cycle of the object  in  and\/or the object  in .","Such information that must be maintained and\/or stored may typically include design and manufacturing information, which may be included in the model database , the data structure , and\/or the knowledge database . The capability to reduce the size of the information that must be maintained can reduce the costs associated with the long-term retention of such information over the life cycle of the object  in  and\/or the object  in .","Also, the current innovation enables such maintenance and\/or storage of such information within the model database , the data structure , and\/or the knowledge database  in a form that is independent of any particular or specific CAD vendor. Thus, such information can be better utilized over the life cycle of the object  and\/or the object  even as vendors leave and\/or arise within the CAD industry, or even if such CAD tools become obsolete as new and more capable CAD systems enter the CAD industry.","As another illustrative example, with the identification of the clusters  for the elements , analysis of those clusters may be made. In these illustrative examples, the clusters  correspond to assemblies of the elements . With an identification of the clusters , the new model  in  may be made for one or more of the clusters . This new model  is smaller and\/or less complex than the model  in . As a result, the new model  may be processed more quickly as compared to the model  in  when a further analysis is performed.","With reference now to , an illustration of a block diagram of a knowledge model  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this illustrative example, the knowledge model  illustrated in  is an example of the knowledge model  in .","In this illustrative example, the knowledge model  is created using the data structure  in . As depicted, the knowledge model  comprises knowledge model information . The knowledge model information  includes at least one of elements , dependencies , design process flow , redundant elements , and\/or other suitable forms of object information.","In these illustrative examples, the design process flow  identifies the order in which the elements  were created for a model in model database  in . The design process flow  may be used to identify an order  in which the elements  were used to create the model from which the knowledge model  was created.","The design process flow  may be used to create the new model  in . The creation of the new model  in  may be created by adding the elements  in the order  identified through the design process flow .","For example, the elements  may include a first point, a second point, a third point, and a spline. The design process flow  may indicate that the first point was created first and that the second point was created after the creation of the first point. The design process flow  may also indicate that the third point was created after the second point. Further, the creation of the spline may occur after the creation of the third point as identified in the design process flow .","This sequence of creation forms a portion of the order  for the elements . This sequence in the order  may be used to create the new model  from the model  in  that is configured to be used in a desired type of system in the systems  in .","The illustrations in  of example implementations for components in the model management system  in  is not meant to imply physical or architectural limitations to the manner in which an advantageous embodiment may be implemented. Other components in addition to and\/or in place of the ones illustrated may be used. Some components may be unnecessary. Also, the blocks are presented to illustrate some functional components. One or more of these blocks may be combined, divided, or combined and divided into different blocks when implemented in an advantageous embodiment.","For example, the knowledge model  in  is shown as having the design process flow . In some illustrative examples, the design process flow  may be omitted from the knowledge model information  in the knowledge model . The design process flow  may be identified when the new model  is created.","With reference now to , an illustration of a tree structure for a model  of an object  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The model  is an example of an implementation of the model  in .","In this illustrative example, the model  is for the object . The object  is defined by elements  arranged in a tree . In this illustrative example, the tree  in  is an example of the tree  in .","As depicted, the tree  has nodes , , , , and . These nodes represent different elements in the model  in . In this illustrative example, the node  is a root node for the object , the node  is a product instance, the node  is a part instance, the node  is a product instance, and the node  is a part instance. In this example, the nodes , , , , and  may reference other objects. Those objects may also have structures such as the tree .","With reference now to , an illustration of another tree structure for a model  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The model  is an example of an implementation of the model  in .","In this illustrative example, the model  is for an object  in the form of a part . In this illustrative example, the part  includes elements  arranged in nodes , , , , , , , and  in a tree . The object  may be an example of an object included as an element in the model  in .","In this illustrative example, the node  is a root node  for the part . The root node  identifies the object  in . In this illustrative example, the node  represents an XYPlane, the node  represents a YZPlane, and the node  represents a ZXPlane. The node  represents a part body. The part body is a solid that defines the part . The node  is a body. This body is an optional solid that may be used in the part . The node  is a geometrical set. This geometrical set in the node  may define lines, points, and\/or other suitable geometries. The node  is a mechanical set in this illustrative example. A mechanical set of elements is a set of non-geometrical elements. The illustration of the model  in the tree  in  and the model  in the tree  in  are only meant as examples of trees that may be used to organize and create relationships between the elements  in  and the elements  in . Of course, in actual implementation, these tree structures may be much more complex and may contain many more elements.","The model  in  may be processed to identify the elements  and their dependencies. The dependencies may be identified from the arrangement of the elements in the tree structure. In a similar fashion, the model  in  may be processed to identify the elements  and their dependencies. This process may be applied to any model in the models  in the model database  in .","Next in , an illustration of a data structure  in the form of a matrix  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this illustrative example, the matrix  in  is a design structure matrix . This design structure matrix  is an example of the design structure matrix  in . In these illustrative examples, the design structure matrix  may be displayed in the graphical user interface  in the display system  in .","As depicted, the design structure matrix  comprises rows  and columns . The rows  represent elements . These elements  are also located in the columns . In these illustrative examples, cells  in the design structure matrix  may provide information about a model, such as the model  in .","For example, the elements , including a rectangle , a rectangle , and a rectangle , have a dependency to a LoftSolid . This dependency with the LoftSolid  is indicated by cells , , and , respectively.","As another example, RectangularCurvePlane  has a dependency with the rectangle  as indicated in a cell . RectangularCurvePlane  has a dependency with the rectangle  as indicated by a cell . RectangularCurvePlane  has a dependency with the rectangle  as indicated by a cell . In yet another illustrative example, a Spline  has a dependency with the RectangularCurvePlane , the RectangularCurvePlane , and the RectangularCurvePlane  as indicated by cells , , and , respectively.","As can be seen, the cells  indicate a dependency between elements when a value is present in the cells . Further, the values also may indicate a strength of the dependency. For example, the cells , , and  indicate a stronger dependency as compared to the cells , , and . In another illustrative example, Point  has a dependency with the Spline  as indicated by a cell . Point  has a dependency as indicated by a cell . Point  has a dependency with the Spline  as indicated by a cell .","In these illustrative examples, Line , Line , and Point  do not have any dependencies that lead back to the LoftSolid . For example, the Line  and the Line  do not have any dependencies with any other of the elements . The Point  has a dependency to the Line  as indicated by a cell . However, the Line  has no dependency back to the LoftSolid . As a result, Line , Line , and Point  are extraneous features.","As another example, the LoftSolidGeoSet  and the LoftSurfaceGeoset  are sets of elements  that do not have any dependencies. With the identification of the extraneous elements , the model  in  may be modified to remove these extraneous elements . As a result, this change to the model  may form the modified model  in .","Further, the design structure matrix  may be used to identify other information in addition to the extraneous elements  and the dependencies as shown. For example, modeling process flow for the model containing the elements  may be identified from the design structure matrix . In this illustrative example, an arrow  indicates the modeling process flow direction. For example, AxisSystems  is the first of the elements  placed into the model. XYPlane , the YZPlane , and the ZXPlane  are the next elements placed into the model, respectively. The arrow  illustrates the addition of other elements  to the model.","Additionally, clusters , , , and  also may be identified from the design structure matrix . The clusters , , and  are groupings of like elements. First, the cluster  is a grouping of rectangles, rectangle , rectangle , and rectangle . Next, the cluster  is a grouping of rectangular curve planes: RectangularCurvePlane , RectangularCurvePlane , and RectangularCurvePlane . The cCluster  is a grouping of points: Point , Point , and Point .","The cluster  is a grouping of the elements  that have dependencies on each other. In this illustrative example, the cluster  includes RectangularCurvePlane , RectangularCurvePlane , RectangularCurvePlane , Point , Point , Point , and the spline .","When identified, the clusters , , , and  may be used to generate a view of particular ones of the elements  that have dependencies with each other. The clusters , , , and  may be identified in a number of different ways using currently known techniques. Examples of some techniques that may be used include, for example, partitioning algorithms, hierarchical clustering algorithms, and other suitable techniques. These techniques may be used alone or in combination to identify potential clusters. Partitioning may be used to create subsystems by grouping and sorting the subsystems based on the dependencies. These subsystems may represent assemblies or other groupings in the elements  in design structure matrix .","With reference now to , an illustration of a flowchart of a process for managing the models  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In this illustrative example, the process may be implemented in the model manager  in . For example, the model manager  may select the model  in  for processing (operation ).","Thereafter, the elements  in the model  are identified (operation ). The identification may be performed by the model manager  processing the model  directly, by the model manager  interacting with the first type of computer aided design system , or a combination of the two. For example, the model manager  may send calls to the first type of computer aided design system  in the form of application programming interface calls to an interface in the first type of computer aided design system .","The process then identifies relations between the elements  that may be present for the model  (operation ). In particular, the model  may have a format . The format  may define potential relations between the elements  in the model . These potential relations may be between the elements  in the model . Examples, of potential relations between elements that can be identified are parent-child relations, physical connections, input-output relations, and other relations. These potential relations are ones that may be used in a computer aided design system. Some potential relations may be in all of the computer aided design systems  and some may be only in selected computer aided design systems  in .","Thereafter, the process identifies the dependencies  for the elements  (operation ). Some of the dependencies  for the elements  identified in operation  may be, for example, parent-child relations, physical connections, input-output relations, and other dependencies. The process then creates a matrix using the elements  and the dependencies  (operation ).","With the matrix, an analysis  may be performed (operation ), with the process terminating thereafter. Further, different actions may be taken based on the analysis .","With reference now to , an illustration of a flowchart of a process for modifying the model  is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. In these illustrative examples, the model manager  may perform an analysis  such as the analysis  in  (operation ). The analysis  may be performed using the matrix  in . The process identifies extraneous elements  from the analysis  in  (operation ).","The extraneous elements  are in the elements  in the model  in . When an identification of the extraneous elements  in the elements  is made, the process removes the extraneous elements  from the elements  (operation ). Operation  may be performed by the model manager  processing the model  directly, by the model manager  interacting with the first type of computer aided design system , or a combination of the two.","Next, the process identifies redundant elements  in the elements  in the model  (operation ). A determination is made as to whether any of the redundant elements  can be consolidated (operation ).","If some or all of the redundant elements  can be consolidated, the process consolidates the identified ones of the redundant elements  (operation ). This consolidation of the redundant elements  may be made to the model  directly, using the first type of computer aided design system , or a combination of the two. The process then forms a modified model  from the remaining elements in the model  (operation ) with the process terminating thereafter.","With reference again to operation , if none of the redundant elements  can be consolidated, the process also proceeds to operation  as described above.","With reference now to , an illustration of a flowchart of a process for generating a knowledge model, such as the knowledge model  in , is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The process may be implemented using the model manager  in .","The process begins by identifying the elements  for the knowledge model  from the matrix  in  (operation ). The process then places the identified elements  into the knowledge model  as part of the knowledge model information  for the knowledge model  in  (operation ). In the illustrative examples, the elements  may be processed to remove extraneous elements and consolidate redundant elements prior to the elements  being placed into the knowledge model .","The process also identifies the dependencies  between the elements  using the matrix  in  (operation ).","Thereafter, these identified dependencies  are added to the knowledge model information  in the knowledge model  for the elements  (operation ). The process also identifies the design process flow  from the matrix  (operation ).\n\n","In some illustrative examples, the design process flow  may be identified in other ways other than using the matrix . For example, a graph of the elements  in the model  in  may be made. The nodes in the graph represent the elements . The lines between the nodes represent the dependencies . This information may be obtained from the analysis of the model , including the tree  in the model .","The tree  may be traversed to identify the dependencies  for the elements  in the model . With the graph, the design process flow  may be identified for the knowledge model . In other words, the techniques used to identify the design process flow  from the matrix  also may be used to identify the design process flow  from the graph.","In these illustrative examples, the order  may be identified in the knowledge model information  in the knowledge model  (operation ). The process terminates thereafter. This process may be performed for each knowledge model that is to be created for a particular model.","With reference now to , an illustration of a flowchart of a process for creating a new model is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment. The process illustrated in  may be implemented using the model manager  in . In these illustrative examples, the knowledge model  in  may be used to create the new model  in . The creation of the new model  by the model manager  may be performed directly by the model manager  or with the use of a computer aided design system in the systems  in .","The process begins by identifying a desired system in the systems  for the new model  (operation ). This desired system may be, for example, a particular type of computer aided design system or the analysis system  in . For example, the analysis system  may be a finite element analysis system or some other suitable type of system that may not use computer aided design models for the analysis . In this manner, the new model  may be tailored for the particular type of system used in the systems  in .","The process then identifies which ones of the elements  are needed for the new model  (operation ). In some cases, only some of the elements  may be needed for the new model . As another example, the second format  for the new model  may not use all of the elements . In another example, a particular assembly  in the assemblies  for the object  may be selected for the new model . As a result, only those portions of the elements  in the particular assembly  may be needed for the new model . Further in operation , a number of extraneous elements in the elements  may be removed from the knowledge model  prior to forming the new model  from the knowledge model . Also, redundant elements in the elements  may be consolidated in the knowledge model  prior to forming the new model  from the knowledge model .","The process also identifies the design process flow  for creating the new model  (operation ). In these illustrative examples, the new model  is created based on the order  identified by the design process flow  for the elements . The process adds the identified elements from the elements  to the new model  in the order  identified by the design process flow  (operation ) with the process terminating thereafter. In operation , these elements  are placed into the new model  with a format for the desired system to form the new model .","In these illustrative examples, all of the knowledge model information  is maintained in the knowledge model  in case another new model is to be generated that may need different portions of the knowledge model information  to generate the new model.","The flowcharts and block diagrams in the different depicted embodiments illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of some possible implementations of apparatus and methods in an advantageous embodiment. In this regard, each block in the flowcharts or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, function, and\/or a portion of an operation or step.

When implemented in hardware, the hardware may, for example, take the form of integrated circuits that are manufactured or configured to perform one or more operations in the flowcharts or block diagrams.","In some alternative implementations of an advantageous embodiment, the function or functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, in some cases, two blocks shown in succession may be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be performed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. Also, other blocks may be added in addition to the illustrated blocks in a flowchart or block diagram.","For example, the knowledge model  generated in the operations in  may be generated without using the matrix  in . Instead, the model manager  may use the model  directly or by interacting with the first type of computer aided design system  in  that uses the model  with the first format . For example, the identification of the elements  and the dependencies  between the elements may be performed in this manner to generate the information for the knowledge model .","Turning now to , an illustration of a data processing system is depicted in accordance with an advantageous embodiment.
