For example, in a cellular network, there may be any number of wireless base stations serving individual cellular telephones. More specifically, in a cellular radio system, a land area to be supplied with radio service is typically divided into regular shaped cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver known as a cell site or a base station. When joined together these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. This enables a large number of portable transceivers (e.g., mobile telephones, pagers, etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission.","A cellular network is a radio network distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver known as a cell site or a base station. When joined together these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. This enables a large number of portable transceivers (e.g., mobile telephones, pagers, etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission.","There may be several types of cells in a cellular network. For example, a macrocell is a cell that provides radio coverage over a relatively large area and is served by a powerful cellular base station. The antennas for macrocells are usually mounted on ground-based masts, rooftops, and other existing structures, at a height that provides a clear view over the surrounding buildings and terrain. Macrocell base stations typically have power outputs of tens of watts. A microcell is a cell served by a low power cellular base station, and covers a limited area such as a mall, a hotel, or a transpiration hub. Generally, microcells provide coverage areas smaller than macrocells. A microcell uses power control to limit the radius of its coverage area. A picocell is a small cell typically covering a small area, such as inside a building (e.g., offices, shopping malls, train stations, etc.), or more recently inside an aircraft. A picocell is usually smaller than a microcell, though the distinction is not always clear. Picocells are typically used to extend coverage to indoor areas where outdoor signals do not reach well, or to add network capacity in areas with very dense telephone usage (e.g., train stations). Picocells provide coverage and capacity in areas difficult or expensive to reach using the more traditional macrocell approach. A femtocell is another small cell typically designed to use in a home or a small business. A femtocell connects to a service provider's network via broadband (e.g., DSL or cable). Current designs of femtocells typically support two to four active mobile telephones in residential settings, and eight to sixteen active mobile telephones in enterprise settings. A femtocell allows service providers to extend service coverage indoors, especially where access would otherwise be limited or unavailable.","In a cellular network, a portable wireless device (e.g., mobile telephones, pagers, etc.) located in a specific cell may communicate with the other devices in the network via the base stations serving that cell, by transmitting and receiving data packets through the base stations serving that cell. If the portable wireless device moves to another cell, it may communicate with the other devices in the network via the base stations serving the second cell, again, by transmitting and receiving data packets through the base stations serving the second cell.","In particular embodiments, in a cellular network, there may be cells that serve all wireless devices belonging to the network, and there may be cells that serve only specific sets of wireless devices belonging to the network. The former may be referred to as \u201cpublic cells\u201d, and the latter may be referred to as \u201cprivate cells\u201d. Examples of public cells may include, without limitation, macrocells, microcells, and picocells. Examples of private cells may include, without limitation, picocells and femtocells. In particular embodiments, a wireless device belonging to a cellular network may utilize the base stations serving any public cell to communicate with the other devices also in the network. On the other hand, for a private cell, only a wireless device that belongs to the cellular network and is also authorized to use the private cell may utilize the base station serving the private cell to communicate with the other devices in the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["112","122","112","122","110","112","120","122"]},"In particular embodiments, macrocell  may serve a relatively large area, while femtocell  may serve a relatively small area (e.g., a home, an office, etc.). In particular embodiments, any wireless device in the network may utilize macrocell base station  to communicate with the other devices in the network. On the other hand, only a specific set of wireless devices in the network that are also authorized to use femtocell  may utilize femtocell base station  to communicate with the other devices in the network. For example, in , suppose wireless devices A, B, C all belong to the network and thus can all utilize macrocell base station , but only wireless device C is authorized to utilize femtocell base station  and wireless devices A and B are not authorized to use femtocell base station . In particular embodiments, wireless devices A, B, C may each be a mobile or cellular telephone, and may also be referred to as \u201cuser equipment\u201d.","In particular embodiments, a femtocell base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) may communicate with each wireless device (e.g., wireless device C) authorized to utilize the femtocell base station using the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) LTE (Long Term Evolution) standard. In particular embodiments, a femtocell base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) may be connected to an Internet connection (e.g., through an Ethernet connection) available at the location where femtocell base station  is installed (e.g., the Internet connection available at the home or office where femtocell base station  is installed). Data packets to and from wireless device C may be received and transmitted over the Internet connection.","In particular embodiments, there may be one or more specific wireless devices (e.g., wireless device C) that are authorized to utilize a femtocell base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) to communicate with the other devices in the network. In particular embodiments, femtocell base station  only services and responds to requests from an authorized wireless device (e.g., wireless device C), and ignores requests from any unauthorized wireless device (e.g., wireless devices A and B). In particular embodiments, femtocell base station  may maintain a list of identifiers of the authorized wireless devices in order to determine which wireless device is authorized to utilize it and which is not. In particular embodiments, a wireless device (e.g., wireless device C) may maintain a list of identifiers of the femtocells that the wireless device is authorize to use so that the wireless device only utilizes those femtocell base stations that it is authorized to utilize.","In particular embodiments, there may be interferences from specific wireless base stations to specific wireless devices, due to the wireless base stations transmitting various types signals at various times. For example, in , wireless devices A and B are not authorized to utilize femtocell base station , and can only use macrocell base station . Yet, femtocell base station  may cause interferences to wireless devices A and B, especially when wireless devices A and B get closer to femtocell base station . Wireless device C is authorized to utilize both femtocell base station  and macrocell base station . When wireless device C is closer to femtocell base station , it may be preferable for wireless device C to communicate with other devices via femtocell base station  because femtocell base station  provides stronger, clearer signals under the circumstances, and yet, macrocell base station  may cause interferences to wireless device C. Sometimes, the interferences from one wireless base station may be so strong, and thus bad, that a wireless device may not be able to communicate with another wireless base station at all. For example, in , wireless device B may be sufficiently close to femtocell base station  such that, in the worst case scenario, the interferences from femtocell base station  may completely prevent wireless device B from communicating with macrocell base station .","There may be several approaches to address the problem of a wireless base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) causing interferences to a wireless device (e.g., wireless device A or wireless device B), especially to a wireless device not authorized to utilize the wireless base station. Particular embodiments may provide a time domain approach to the problem. In this case, a first wireless base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) may reduce its interferences to a wireless device by not transmitting in some subframes. The wireless device may then use those subframes, in which the first wireless base station does not transmit, to communicate with a second wireless base station (e.g., macrocell base station ). Alternatively, particular embodiments may provide a frequency domain approach. In this case, a first wireless base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) may reduce its interferences to a wireless device by limiting its air resource usage to a part of the frequencies and not transmitting in some frequencies. The wireless device may use those frequencies, in which the first wireless base station does not transmit, to communicate with a second wireless base station (e.g., macrocell base station ). Alternatively, particular embodiments may provide a power control based approach. In this case, a first wireless base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) may reduce its interferences to a wireless device by reducing its transmission power when necessary. However, all of these approaches require that the wireless device maintaining its connection with the second base station (e.g., macrocell base station ) for signaling. That is, the wireless device needs to be able to communicate with the second base station in order to indicate to the second base station that it is suffering from the interferences from the first base station. Only then can the second base station communicate with the first base station to request that the first base station reduces its interferences for the wireless device. Yet, under some circumstances, the interferences from the first base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) to the wireless device (e.g., wireless device A or B) may be so strong (e.g., when the wireless device is very close to the first base station, when there is a sudden increase in interferences from the first base station, or when there is a sudden decrease of signal strength from the second base station) such that the wireless device may not be able to maintain any connection with the second base station. Consequently, in such cases, the wireless device cannot inform the second base station at all that it is suffering from the interferences from the first base station.","Particular embodiments address the problem of a wireless base station (e.g., femtocell base station ) causing interferences to a wireless device (e.g., wireless device A or B), especially to a wireless device not authorized to utilize the wireless base station, by enabling the wireless device to initiate an evolved Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) mechanism through the wireless base station. In particular embodiments, the wireless device may initiate eICIC when necessary (e.g., when the wireless device suffers interferences from the wireless base station).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIGS. 2 and 3"]},"In particular embodiments, there are two wireless base stations (i.e., a first wireless base station and a second wireless base station) and a wireless device involved. For example, the first wireless base station may be a femtocell base station; the second wireless base station may be a macrocell base station; and the wireless device may be a cellular telephone. In , femtocell base station  is an example of the first base station; macrocell base station  is an example of the second base station; and wireless device  is an example of the wireless device. In particular embodiments, the wireless device is authorized to utilize (e.g., connect to and communicate with) the second wireless base station, but is not authorized to utilize the first wireless base station. For example, in , wireless device  is authorized to utilize macrocell base station , but is not authorized to utilize femtocell base station . In particular embodiments, the wireless device suffers interferences from the first wireless base station. For example, in , wireless device  suffers interferences from femtocell base station . Suppose that wireless device  wishes to initiate eICIC to have femtocell base station  reduce its interferences so that wireless device  may connect to and utilize macrocell base station .","In particular embodiments, femtocell base station  may broadcast its information to wireless devices within its signal range. This information enables a wireless device to initiate a connection with femtocell base station . In particular embodiments, wireless device  may initiate communication with femtocell base station  by transmitting a random access procedure preamble to femtocell base station , as illustrated in STEP . Because wireless device  is not authorized to utilize (e.g., connect to and communicate with) femtocell base station , this random access procedure preamble may indicate to femtocell base station  that wireless device  is suffering interference stress caused by femtocell base station . In particular embodiments, the random access procedure preamble may be a standard random access procedure preamble. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, the random access procedure preamble may be a special, non-standard random access procedure preamble. For example, a set of preambles may be reserved for the purpose of managing interferences. These special preambles may be referred to as non-standard random access procedure preambles to distinguish them from the standard random access procedure preambles used for regular network access. In the non-standard case, the non-standard random access procedure preamble may, although not necessarily, include some information specifically relevant to the interference stress. In particular embodiments, femtocell base station  may assign a different priority (e.g., a higher priority) to wireless device  if wireless device  has sent a non-standard random access procedure preamble. For example, femtocell base station  may respond to the non-standard random access procedure preamble sent by wireless device  as soon as possible so that wireless device  does not need to suffer the interference stress for long. On the other hand, if wireless device  has sent a standard random access procedure preamble, femtocell base station  still responds to the standard random access procedure preamble as it normally does but may not give wireless device  a higher priority so that there may be some delay before the interference is reduced for wireless device .","In particular embodiments, even though wireless device  is not authorized to connect with femtocell base station , femtocell base station  nevertheless transmits a random access response to wireless device  upon receiving the random access procedure preamble from wireless device , as illustrated in STEP . Femtocell base station  treats this communication from wireless device  as a special case and does not ignore wireless device .","In particular embodiments, upon receiving the random access response from femtocell base station , wireless device  transmits an interference stress message to femtocell base station , as illustrated in STEP . In this case, the interference stress message becomes a part of the random access procedure (e.g., replacing the standard third message of the random access procedure between femtocell base station  and wireless device ). The interference stress message indicates to femtocell base station  that wireless device  is suffering interferences from femtocell base station . In particular embodiments, the interference stress message may include an identifier of femtocell base station , one or more measurements of the interferences, and any other applicable information.","Upon receiving the interference stress message from wireless device , femtocell base station  may respond in several ways. In particular embodiments, femtocell base station  may forward the interference stress message to a coordination device over the network, as illustrated in STEP .  illustrates an example of this response. In particular embodiments, the coordination device may be a self-organizing network server in the cellular network for interference coordination. The coordination device may have information about many parts of the network (e.g., having a comprehensive view of the network and information about many base stations in the network) so that the coordination device may determine how to appropriately reduce interferences for each base station. In , server  is an example of the coordination device. Femtocell base station  may forward the interference stress message to server  over core network . Upon receiving the interference stress message from femtocell base station , server  may determine what femtocell base station  should do in order to sufficiently reduce its interferences for wireless device  based on the information provided in the interference stress message (e.g., interference measurements) as well as the information server  has about the network itself. The interference reduction information determined by server  for femtocell base station  may indicate what interference reduction approach (e.g., time domain approach, frequency domain approach, or power control based approach) to be used and the specific actions to be taken by femtocell base station . In particular embodiments, server  may transmit the interference reduction information to femtocell base station  over core network , as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments, the interference reduction information may be sent to femtocell base station  as one or more eICIC messages. In addition, in particular embodiments, femtocell base station  may coordinate with macrocell base station  over core network  using one or more eICIC messages.","Alternatively, in particular embodiments, there may not be a coordination device (e.g., server ) available in the network. In this case, femtocell base station  may estimate for itself how best to reduce its interferences for wireless device  based on the information provided in the interference stress message (e.g., interference measurements), as illustrated in STEP .  illustrates an example of this response. For example, femtocell base station  may determine for itself the interference reduction approach (e.g., time domain approach, frequency domain approach, or power control based approach) to be used and the specific actions to be taken. In addition, in particular embodiments, femtocell base station  may coordinate with macrocell base station  over core network  using one or more eICIC messages.","In particular embodiments, femtocell base station  may inform wireless device  that it is about to reduce its interferences for wireless device . In particular embodiments, femtocell base station  may reduce its interferences for wireless device  based on the interference reduction information either received from server  (as illustrated in ) or estimated by femtocell base station  itself (as illustrated in ), as illustrated in STEP . For example, the interference reduction information may instruct femtocell base station  to use the time domain approach and what specific subframes to transmit and what specific subframes not to transmit. Alternatively, the interference reduction information may instruct femtocell base station  to use the frequency domain approach and what specific frequencies to transmit and what specific frequencies not to transmit. Alternatively, the interference reduction information may instruct femtocell base station  to use the power control based approach and the amount of power to reduce. Once femtocell base station  has sufficiently reduced its interferences to wireless device , wireless device  may connect to and communicated with macrocell base station .","Particular embodiments may be implemented in a network environment.  illustrates an example network environment , which may be a cellular network environment.
