title: Methods and systems for reducing the spread of files on a network
abstract: Methods and systems can reduce the spread of computer files or data on a network by obtaining and tracking times of arrival for chunks of data transmitted on the network. The times of arrival for a node can be transformed into time-series and periodograms computed from the time-series. Successive periodograms can be compared to determine changes in the strongest peaks of the periodograms. If a new peak is identified, a search for the occurrence of the peak in previous periodograms can be conducted. If no peak having a matching frequency is found, a search for the peak in the periodograms for neighboring nodes can be performed. If matching peaks are found, the associated data stream can be classified. Predictions of the timing and length of associated data packets can be used to randomly interrupt transmission of associated data packets resulting in reducing the spread of the classified data stream.

No. 10\/826,620, filed Apr. 16, 2004, entitled, \u201cMethods and Systems for Reducing the Spread of Files on a Network,\u201d, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,540,029, to which priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120 is claimed, which in turn is a Non-Provisional of and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/463,389 filed on Apr. 16, 2003. This application is co-pending with a related patent application entitled \u201cMethods and Systems for Tracking File Routing on a Network\u201d, by the same inventor and having assignee in common, filed concurrently with the instant application's parent application, Ser. No. 10\/826,620, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,540,029. The entire contents of the aforementioned applications are herein expressly incorporated by reference.","The disclosed methods and systems were developed with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; contract number MDA972-01-C-0080. The United States Government may have certain rights in the disclosed systems and methods.","The methods and systems relate generally to communication networks, and more particularly to methods and systems for monitoring data transmitted over such networks.","Communication networks typically can include a number of interconnected communication devices. Connections among the devices in some communication networks are accomplished through physical wires or optical links. Such networks can be referred to as \u201cwired\u201d networks. Connections among other devices in other communication networks can be accomplished through radio, infrared, or other wireless links. Such networks can be referred to as \u201cwireless\u201d networks.","Increasingly, network users can experience receiving unwanted communication messages. While some unwanted messages can be benign, e.g., advertisements, the amount of unwanted traffic can consume valuable resources. Additionally, some unwanted messages, e.g., computer worms and viruses, can maliciously destroy other data at a receiving node and\/or disable the operation of the node, while causing the node to forward the unwanted message to further unsuspecting nodes. Methods are known in the art for identifying and blocking receipt of some unwanted messages, e.g., virus scanning software. Generally, such methods include analyzing the contents of such messages.","Communication messages (e.g., data packets) sent across communication networks can be intercepted. Intercepted messages can yield valuable information and the process of intercepting and analyzing messages can be referred to as \u201ctraffic analysis\u201d. In general, traffic analysis can seek to understand something about the message traffic on a network by observing the traffic and analyzing that traffic to extract information. However, to guard against unwanted traffic analysis, messages can be typically encrypted. For example, both the content and the destination of a message can be obscured through encryption.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/212,324, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,574,597, entitled \u201cEncoding Signals to Facilitate Traffic Analysis\u201d, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes methods and systems that can acquire information about communication among nodes in a network by intercepting chunks of data in the network by a tap located among the nodes in the network. Characteristic information about the intercepted chunks of data can be obtained. The characteristic information can include times of arrival of chunks of data at the tap and identifiers of the source nodes that sent the chunks of data. A signal can be constructed to represent the characteristic information over time.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/243,489, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,359,966, entitled, \u201cMethods and Systems for Passive Information Discovery Using Lomb Periodogram Processing\u201d, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes methods and systems for processing communications signals in a network that can obtain time of arrival information for chunks of data in the network and construct a signal to represent the time of arrival of the information. The signal can consist of data that is non-uniformly spaced. The system can process the signal using a Lomb technique to obtain periodicity information about the signal.","The information obtained using the above described methods and systems can be based on the time of arrival for chunks of data and not on the contents of the data. Thus, the information can be available for encrypted messages. Methods and systems can be developed to aid in identifying unwanted messages using this information and further to dampen, slow down or otherwise reduce the spread of the unwanted messages on the network.","Methods and systems can reduce the spread of computer files or data on a network by obtaining and tracking times of arrival for chunks of data transmitted on the network. The times of arrival for a node can be transformed into time-series and periodograms can be computed from the time-series. Successive periodograms can be compared to determine changes in the strongest peaks of the periodograms. If a new peak is identified, a search for the occurrence of the peak in previous periodograms over a predetermined time period can be conducted. If no peak having a matching frequency is found within the searched periodograms, the peak can be marked for further analysis. A search for marked peaks in the periodograms for neighboring nodes can be performed. If marked peaks having matching frequencies are found, the associated data stream can be classified. Predictions of the timing and length of associated data packets can be used to randomly interrupt transmission of associated data packets resulting in reducing the spread of the classified data stream.","In one embodiment, a method of reducing spread of data on a network can include obtaining a spectral analysis of times of arrival of data packets at receiving nodes of the network from sending nodes of the network over predetermined time periods. For each pair of sending node and receiving node, the method can include marking transmissions of data packets for the pair as marked transmissions when the spectral analysis indicates peak frequencies associated with the marked transmissions are different from peak frequencies associated with others of the transmissions for the pair over a window of a predetermined number of time periods. When marked transmissions from pairs having at least one common sending node and\/or one common receiving node and from within a specified number of windows of each other have corresponding frequencies, the transmissions can be marked as interruptible transmissions. Timing and length information for future data packets corresponding to the interruptible transmissions can be estimated and traffic of the future data packets can be interrupted based on the estimates.","Obtaining a spectral analysis can include tracking times of arrival data, transforming the times of arrival data into time-series, parsing the time-series into windows, and obtaining Lomb periodograms for the windows. Estimating can include applying a Hidden Markov Model technique for classifying the interruptible transmissions as belonging to one of a plurality of classes of transmissions having determinable characteristics. Interrupting can include randomly removing data packets for a specified time. After the specified time, the method can determine if a further spectral analysis of times of arrival of data packets since beginning the interrupting indicates the peak frequencies associated with the marked transmissions. When the further spectral analysis indicates said peak frequencies, the method can return to estimating based on the further spectral analysis associated with the marked transmissions.","In one embodiment, a method of reducing spread of data on a network can include obtaining, at a receiver node of the network, periodograms based on times of arrival of data packets from a sender node of the network, comparing peak frequencies in successive ones of the periodograms for the sender node to determine if one of the periodograms includes a peak above a threshold at a frequency different from the peak frequencies in a preceding periodogram from the sender node, determining if at least one peak above the threshold at the frequency occurs in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node, determining if the at least one peak at the frequency occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at the receiver node for other sender nodes of the network, estimating timing and length information for future data packets corresponding to the frequency when the peak at the frequency does not occur in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node and when the at least one peak at the frequency does occur in at least one of said specified number of periodograms obtained at the receiver node for other sender nodes of the network, and interrupting traffic of the future data packets corresponding to that frequency based on the estimating.","Obtaining the periodograms can include tracking times of arrival data, transforming the times of arrival data into time-series, parsing the time-series into the windows, and obtaining Lomb periodograms for the windows: Estimating can include using a Hidden Markov Model to classify a data stream for the at least one peak at the frequency based on said periodograms. Interrupting traffic can include randomly removing data packets for a specified time, determining, after the specified time, if the at least one peak at the frequency occurs in at least one additional periodogram based on times of arrival of data packets since beginning the interrupting of traffic, and returning to estimating based on including the additional periodograms with the specified number of periodograms when the at least one peak at the frequency occurs in at least one additional periodogram.","In one embodiment, a method of reducing spread of data on a network can include obtaining, at a router node of the network, periodograms based on times of arrival of data packets from a sender node of the network, comparing successive periodograms for the sender node to determine when at least one new peak above a threshold is present in one of said periodograms, determining if the new peak occurs in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node, determining if the new peak occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at the router node for other sender nodes of the network, estimating timing and length information for future data packets corresponding to the new peak when the new peak does not occur in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node and when the new peak does occur in at least one of said specified number of periodograms obtained at the router node for other sender nodes of the network, and interrupting traffic of the data packets corresponding to the new peak based on the estimation.","In one aspect, interrupting traffic can include randomly removing data packets for a specified amount of time. To obtain the periodograms, the method can track times of arrival data, transform the times of arrival data into time-series, parse the time-series into windows, and obtain Lomb periodograms for the windows. Estimating can include using a Hidden Markov Model to classify a data stream for the new peak based on the periodograms.","In one embodiment, a method of classifying disruptive data packet traffic flow on a network can include obtaining at a router, periodograms based on times of arrival of for data packets from nodes of the network, comparing successive periodograms for each of the nodes to determine when at least one new peak above a threshold is present in one of the periodograms for one of the nodes, marking the new peak as a suspicious peak when said new peak does not occur in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for that node, determining if the suspicious peak occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at the router for other nodes of the network, determining if the suspicious peak occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at other routers for that one node, and providing a signal to classify traffic flow corresponding to the suspicious peak as disruptive traffic flow when the suspicious peak occurs at least in one of the specified number of periodograms obtained at the router for others of the nodes and in at least one of the specified number of periodograms obtained at other routers for that one node.","In one embodiment, a computer-readable medium can contain instructions for controlling a processor to classify disruptive data packet traffic flow, by obtaining at a router, periodograms based on times of arrival of the data packets from nodes of the network, comparing successive periodograms for each of the nodes to determine when at least one new peak above a threshold is present in one of the periodograms for one of the nodes, marking the one new peak as a suspicious peak when the new peak does not occur in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for that one node, determining if the suspicious peak occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at the router for other nodes of the network, determining if the suspicious peak occurs in at least one of a specified number of periodograms obtained at other routers for that one node, and providing a signal to classify traffic flow corresponding to the suspicious peak as disruptive traffic flow when the suspicious peak occurs either in one of the specified number of periodograms obtained at the router for others of the nodes, or in at least one of the specified number of periodograms obtained at other routers for that one node.","In one aspect, the computer-readable medium can contain instructions for controlling the processor to obtain the periodograms by tracking times of arrival data, transforming the times of arrival data into time-series, parsing the time-series into windows, and obtaining Lomb periodograms for the windows. The instructions can include instructions to provide a signal to classify traffic flow by using a Hidden Markov Model. The instructions for controlling the processor to interrupt can include instructions to randomly remove data packets for a specified time, determine, after that specified time, if the at least one peak at the frequency occurs in at least one additional periodogram based on times of arrival of data packets since beginning the interrupting, and returning to estimating based on including the additional periodograms with the specified number of periodograms when the at least one peak at the frequency occurs in the at least one additional periodogram.","In one embodiment, a computer program can be disposed on computer-readable medium for reducing spread of data on a network. The computer program can include instructions for causing a processor to obtain a spectral analysis of times of arrival of data packets at receiving nodes of the network from sending nodes of the network over predetermined time periods. For each pair of sending node and receiving node, transmissions of data packets for said pair can be marked when the spectral analysis indicates peak frequencies associated with the marked transmissions are different from peak frequencies associated with others of the transmissions for the pair over a window of a predetermined number of said time periods. The marked transmissions can be further marked as interruptible transmissions when marked transmissions from pairs of sending\/receiving nodes having at least one of a common sending node and a common receiving node and within a specified number of said windows have corresponding frequencies. The instructions can cause the processor to estimate timing and length information for future data packets corresponding to the interruptible transmissions, and to interrupt traffic of the future data packets based on the estimated information.","The instructions to obtain a spectral analysis can include instructions to track times of arrival data, transform the times of arrival data into time-series, parse the time-series into the windows, and obtain Lomb periodograms for the windows. The instructions to estimate can include instructions to apply a Hidden Markov Model technique to classify the interruptible transmissions as belonging to one of a plurality of classes of transmissions having determinable characteristics. The instructions to interrupt can include instructions to randomly remove data packets over a specified time, and determine, after that specified time, if a further spectral analysis of times of arrival of data packets since beginning the interruption indicates further peak frequencies associated with the marked transmissions. The computer program instructions to interrupt can include instructions to repeat the instructions to estimate based on the further spectral analysis when the further spectral analysis indicates that peak frequencies associated with the marked transmissions do occur.","To provide an overall understanding, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described; however, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems and methods described herein can be adapted and modified to provide systems and methods for other suitable applications and that other additions and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the systems and methods described herein.","Unless otherwise specified, the illustrated embodiments can be understood as providing exemplary features of varying detail of certain embodiments, and therefore, unless otherwise specified, features, components, modules, and\/or aspects of the illustrations can be otherwise combined, separated, interchanged, and\/or rearranged without departing from the disclosed systems or methods. Additionally, the shapes and sizes of components are also exemplary and unless otherwise specified, can be altered without affecting the disclosed systems or methods.","Referring to , there is shown an exemplary network . The network  can include a number of network nodes  connected by a number of network links . The network  can also include one or more network nodes that serve as routers. For the exemplary embodiment of , network  can include seven nodes  connected in a particular configuration, with nodes n-n serving as routers. The illustrated configuration can be understood to be exemplary, and other configurations can be contemplated that can include varying numbers and configurations of nodes , links , and\/or routers.","Network nodes  can be configured to send and\/or receive information according to a communications protocol, such as TCP\/IP. Although not specifically shown, some nodes  can be configured to provide a route for information to a specified destination. Other nodes  can be configured to send the information according to a previously-determined route. The network nodes  can communicate via discrete \u201cchunks\u201d of data that can be transmitted by \u201csenders\u201d . The chunks can include separate pieces of data and\/or data elements that extend over a period of time. A chunk can be individually detectable or distinguishable. For example, router nodes n-n can determine when a chunk starts and\/or ends. A chunk of data need not exactly correspond to a packet of data. A chunk may represent part of a packet (e.g., a fragment or an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cell of certain protocol description units), or multiple packets (e.g., two packets concatenated).","A sender node  can be understood herein to be the most recent node  to transmit a particular chunk. As an example, node n of  can originate a chunk and forward the chunk to node n of  via router node n of . For the exemplary configuration of , router node n can intercept the chunk as it is transmitted from mode n to node n. Thus, node n and\/or n can be considered a sender node.","Network links  can include electronic links (e.g., wires or coaxial cables), optical links (e.g., fiber optic cables), and\/or wireless links. In a wired network , the links  can provide a connection between two nodes  (e.g., nodes n and n). Router nodes, e.g., node n, can be a part of the links  and can observe the information carried on them. Routers n-n can include devices that can intercept chunk transmissions on the network  at a physical layer, a link layer, a network layer, or at higher layers of the network  being monitored. For example, router n can include a physical connection to a corresponding link  between nodes n and n and circuitry to detect chunks of data on the link . The layer at which interceptions occur can be determined by those skilled in the art, and can be chosen based on knowledge of, and access to, the network links .","The router nodes can include, for example, a transceiver for sensing the chunks of data and can also include other circuitry (e.g., clock circuitry) for determining times of arrival and\/or duration of the chunks. The router nodes can include a processor for computing other information associated with the chunks, such as information contained within a header of the chunk of data (e.g., the identity of a sending node  and\/or a receiving node ).","In the example of , router node n can observe traffic on the link  between nodes n, n, n and n. Router node n can record information about the chunks that it observes in a \u201ctracefile.\u201d A tracefile can contain information for observed chunks, and accordingly, can be understood to be an associated grouping of such data, where such data can be associated and\/or grouped using a variety of mechanisms and\/or schemes. For example, the information can include the time a chunk is\/was observed and the identity of the sender node(s)  of the chunk. The identity of the sender node(s)  can include, for example, the exchange point address of an Internet Protocol security (IPsec) gateway, the upstream or downstream transmitter on the point-to-point link , or information such as \u201cthe same sender node  as the one that also transmitted [specified other] chunks.\u201d If available, the tracefile can also include additional information about the length or duration of the chunk, the destination node , or information concerning the contents of a chunk. In addition, available information can include the location of a router node along the link  relative to the nodes  at either end of the link , e.g., nodes n and n.","It can be understood that errors can occur in the information observed by router nodes n-n. For example, router node n can mistakenly believe it has seen a chunk when no chunk was transmitted due to bit errors on network . Such error events, including the false transmission detection of the previous example, or missed transmissions, or misclassification of a sender node , can be viewed as adding noise to the signals generated by the router nodes n-n. Other sources of noise in the signal generated by the router nodes n-n can include interference from other signals (e.g., packets belonging to another flow, or jitter in timing due to sharing of a bottleneck among multiple flows).","Router nodes n-n can listen passively and not participate in the monitored network  at the Media Access Control (MAC) (or higher) layers. Such passive listening can be referred to as covert information collection. In some cases, for example with 802.3, or 802.11b Local Area Networks (LANs), the router nodes n-n can snoop at the MAC layer and extract some information about higher layer protocols. In other networks, such as Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET), the information about the MAC or higher layer protocols can be limited, or unavailable.","Although  illustrates multiple router nodes, network  can include one or more router nodes, which can be interconnected. Router nodes can work independently using purely local information. Distributed algorithms and\/or processing schemes can allow sharing of information among router nodes. In such a case, the router nodes can have a globally synchronized clock that allows information from multiple router nodes to be combined. A clock resolution of the router nodes n-n can be finer than the data sampling resolution of the router nodes n-n, so that information about transmissions (e.g., the start time, duration, inter-transmission gap, and even the presence of short transmissions) can be obtained without missing some of the information.","In addition, a router node (or a network of router nodes) can store the detected transmissions for an amount of time such that information concerning longer duration events can be obtained. For example, to determine the round-trip time of a transport layer flow, the history stored at router node n can be equal to or greater than one roundtrip time. The total volume of data stored can depend on the capacity of the links  to the router node n and a maximum roundtrip time of flows seen on the links . Router nodes n-n can assign a unique identifier to each sender node . For example, the identifier can be based on the address of the IPsec gateway, though other identifiers can be assigned by router nodes n-n.","It can be understood that network  can include a wireless network. In a wireless network , nodes  can communicate via wireless transmission, including point-to-point, broadcast, and\/or other known wireless transmission methodologies. Sender nodes  can transmit using various types of wireless physical layers, such as terrestrial Radio Frequency (RF), satellite bands, and\/or free space optical. In a wireless network, nodes  can include radio routers and\/or client radios. The links  of  can represent wireless links at a point in time, and it can be understood that wireless links  can be reconfigured as the various nodes  communicate with other nodes . For example,  illustrates a link  between node n and node n. At another point in time, the communications between node n and node n can be completed and node n can establish a communication with node n, as illustrated by dashed line ","In such a network, router nodes can include a wireless router nodes that can intercept wireless transmissions on the network . Wireless router nodes can observe some (potentially very large) fraction of the wireless spectrum, and thus can observe transmissions from a wide range of wireless sender nodes . As illustrated by dashed line  shown in , wireless router nodes can have a limited effective reception range. Dashed line  can indicate an effective reception area through which router node n can receive communications from the nodes . Some nodes , such as nodes n and n in , can be out of the effective reception area and will not be monitored router node n. Nodes n-n, which can be within the range illustrated by dashed line , can be monitored by router node n.","For wireless nodes , node identity information observed by the router nodes can include, for example, an RF signature and\/or the location of a radio transmitter node . For a wireless router node, e.g., n, additional information can include the geographic location of the router node n, as determined by, for example, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver. As previously described, although  illustrates a multiple router nodes n-n, network  can include one or more router nodes. For a wireless network, the number of router nodes placed in the network  can be determined by the desired coverage level of network . Wireless router nodes can have a globally synchronized clock that allows information from multiple router nodes to be combined.","In the presence of mobile nodes , e.g., in ad hoc wireless networks or Mobile IP, router nodes can include mobile router nodes, though stationary nodes can be utilized. Wireless router nodes can be placed randomly over a specified geographic area, or can be placed in a predetermined pattern. Alternately, wireless router nodes can be placed near respective sender nodes . Sender nodes  can move into or out of range of one or more wireless router nodes. Sender nodes  typically can dwell in the range of one or more router nodes long enough for transmission to be observed and the sources identified and recorded. For wireless sender nodes , the unique identifier can be based on the RF signature of the wireless sender node .","Referring to , there is a flow chart of a method  that can track routing of traffic on a network, such as network  of . The method  can include identifying traffic frequency emanating from code and\/or processor instructions executing on a network. The method can begin  by obtaining traffic flow data for the network  at one or more router nodes, as shown at nodes n-n in . It can be understood that other known means of obtaining traffic flow data can be used and the implementation of method  need not be restricted to the use of router nodes n-n. For example, one or more taps can be provided that can determine when a chunk starts and ends. Such taps can include physical connections to corresponding links  and circuitry to detect chunks of data on the links . As in the case of router nodes n-n, the taps can include transceivers for sensing the chunks of data and can also include other circuitry (e.g., clock circuitry) for determining times of arrival and duration of the chunks. The taps can include processors for computing other information associated with the chunks, such as information contained within a header of the chunk of data.","Using the traffic flow data, method  can track (), e.g., in a number of tracefiles, the time of arrival of packets at a router, or node , from the various sender nodes  seen by the router, with a sender node  having a corresponding tracefile. The tracefiles can be transformed () into a time-series. Those of skill in the art can appreciate that numerous methods can be employed to obtain a time-series from data, such as the traffic flow data in the above mentioned tracefile, including those described in detail in referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/212,324. In one embodiment for representing the time of arrival of chunks, a time quantization can be chosen, time can be \u201cbinned\u201d and\/or separated\/grouped into time increments and\/or intervals at that quantization and a marker can be placed in the bins that contain a detected chunk. A non-uniform signal can be represented as a non-uniformly-spaced sequence of impulses. The impulses can indicate leading edges of the discrete events in the tracefile for a router node, such as node n in .","In tracking file routing where the ingress-egress frequencies of the data stream are not known, e.g., in tracking worms that may enter the network, the time-series from  can be parsed () into discrete processing time windows and\/or intervals of a predetermined duration, and\/or size. The window size can depend on the characteristics of the network  and can be chosen to ensure that a window can include sufficient data for processing. As an example, a window size can taken as twice a round-trip time via a satellite link, 2*300 ms=600 ms. If a router node is on a 1 Gigabit\/second link, the window size translates to 600 Megabits of memory for the window. Method  can compute  the Lomb Periodogram for a given window and\/or source, and\/or sender node . As known in the art, the Lomb technique provides a spectral analysis technique specifically designed for non-uniformly sampled data. Inherently, packet arrival times in computer networks, such as network  can be unevenly spaced, resulting in a non-uniformly sampled natural signal encoding. As described in further detail in referenced U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/243,489, the Lomb technique can compute a periodogram by evaluating data only at the times for which a measurement is available.","Successive periodograms for the same source, or sender node , can be compared () with one another. Generally, the comparison can include obtaining a predetermined number (x) of strongest peaks of a periodogram, e.g., 10-100 peaks, and comparing them to the x strongest peaks of the previous periodogram. If a new peak is identified above a predetermined threshold, as determined at , it can be determined  if the identified peak occurred in one of a predetermined number of previous periodograms for the sender node. Generally, the number of previous periodograms can be chosen to provide an extended timeframe, e.g., in the range of seconds, during which the router can have experienced a full range of data types. As an example, the number of timeframes can depend on a network operator's requirements for false positives, with fewer false positives requiring the use of more timeframes. In one example, two timeframes can be used. In another example, the number of timeframes can be equal to the total available memory of the router node divided by the window size as described above.","If the identified peak has not occurred in one of the number of previous periodograms for the same sender node, the identified peak can be marked () for further analysis. If one or more marked peaks from other sender nodes , or from other router nodes in the network neighborhood have matching frequencies within nearby windows, as determined at , the peaks can be marked for spread reduction, as at . Generally, a nearby window can be the two or three windows, or timeframes, previous to the window in which a marked peak was identified, though other numbers of windows can be contemplated.","As shown in , the illustrated embodiment  can forward, at , the peaks marked for spread reduction to a process , which can reduce the spread of the packets identified corresponding to the marked peaks. Accordingly, the disclosed systems and methods  can provide for a continuous monitoring function that can obtain traffic flow data while the network is operable or active. Thus, the  method  can return to obtain additional data at  until monitoring is no longer desired, as determined at . Additionally, the  method  can return to obtain data at  via 226, if no new peaks are determined at , or if the new peaks have occurred in previous periodograms, as determined at , or if no peaks with matching frequencies are determined at .","Referring now to , there is a flow chart of a method or process  that can reduce the spread of files on a network, such as network  of . Method  can begin when method  receives (302) a peak forwarded to method  by method  at  of . Based on the identified peak and the corresponding periodogram data, the data stream for the marked peak can be classified (). Numerous algorithms can provide such classification, including algorithms using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach and those incorporating a threshold-based cepstogram-bin approach. Such algorithms can serve to identify an unknown data flow, or data stream, as belonging to one of plurality of classifications of data flows whose characteristics can be determined.","The classification can allow for predictions to be made, as at , as to the timing and length of the next chunk transmission corresponding to the identified peak. Based on the predictions, method  can randomly interrupt transmission of packets () corresponding to the predicted timing and length. It can be understood that method  can continue random interruption of transmission for a period of time, as determined at . Depending on the classification approach, the time period can be a function of the predictions, or can be a predetermined time period.","If the time is exceeded, method  can check () current periodogram data to determine  if the transmission interruptions at  have succeeded in reducing the spread. If so, the method can end and await new peak data, as at . If not, the time period can be reset at  and method  can return to  to continue random interruptions of the transmission. In one embodiment, method  can return to  to reclassify the marked peak using current periodogram data, as indicated in phantom at . It can be understood that more than one peak can be marked for reduction and that multiple spread reduction processes  can operate in parallel. In one embodiment, spread reduction process  can cycle through the multiple peaks, as indicated in phantom at .","The systems and methods described herein can help to provide a robust network by reducing the spread of malicious or disruptive traffic on the network. The systems and methods can observe the frequency response of the traffic between the nodes of the network and can jam or interrupt unusual frequencies suspected to be generated by malicious traffic, such as traffic generated by a computer worm and\/or other files or data streams that do not normally pervade the network traffic, that start suddenly and\/or spread quickly. Analysis of the traffic flow data corresponding to the suspect frequencies can provide estimates for the timing and length of data packets corresponding to those frequencies and data packets can be dropped based on the estimates.","In addition, the techniques described herein can be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination thereof. The systems and methods can be implemented in one or more computer programs executing on one or more programmable computers, such as may be exemplified by nodes  and\/or the previously described taps, among others, that include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), one or more input devices, and one or more output devices.","The computer programs, or programs, may be preferably implemented using one or more high level procedural or object-oriented programming languages to communicate with a computer system; however, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. The language can be compiled or interpreted. The computer program(s) can be preferably stored on a storage medium or device (e.g., CD-ROM, hard disk, or magnetic disk) readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer for configuring and operating the computer when the storage medium or device is read by the computer to perform the procedures described herein. The system can also be considered to be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer to operate in a specific and predefined manner.","While the method and systems have been disclosed in connection with the preferred embodiments shown and described in detail, various modifications and improvements thereon will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art. As an example, those with ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the arrangement and connectivity of the components shown in the figures are merely for illustrative purposes, and can be varied accordingly and components may be combined or otherwise reconfigured without departing from the scope of the disclosed systems and methods. Accordingly, many additional changes in the details and arrangement of parts, herein described and illustrated, can be made by those skilled in the art. It will thus be understood that the following claims are not to be limited to the embodiments disclosed herein, can include practices otherwise than specifically described, and are to be interpreted as broadly as allowed under the law."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The following figures depict certain illustrative embodiments in which like reference numerals refer to like elements.
