title: Location based router
abstract: A method of providing location based service to a mobile device in a wireless network. The method receives a query for location in the wireless network from the wireless device. The query includes an opt-in level for participating in offers for location based services. Mobile device location computed from packets transmitted between the mobile device and nodes in the wireless network is determined. The method provides a data structure comprising location, opt in level, and mobile device user information to a market for services, where the market for services determines an associated service based on the location, opt in level and mobile device user information and adds metadata for the associated service to the data structure to produce a response structure, enabling the user device to obtain the associated service.

The core thrust of this disclosure is that timing and location of digitally-enabled nodes needs to become a central operational aspect of such networks, as specified functional components and network layers.","Previous disclosures have laid much of the groundwork for such components and layers. In particular, in our prior disclosures, we describe how to adapt networks to provide inherent positioning and timing calibration to devices within the network. These disclosures are provided in Assignee's U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,876,266, 7,983,185, Published US Patent Applications 20090233621 and 20090213828, and unpublished U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/187,723 filed Jul. 21, 2011, entitled MULTI-PATH-COMPENSATION METHODS FOR LOCATION-DETERMINATION OF MOBILE DEVICES (published as 2012-0309415), Ser. No. 13\/179,807 filed Jul. 11, 2011, entitled LOCATION AWARE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (published as 2012-0309414), and 61\/613,915, filed Mar. 21, 2012, entitled Positioning Systems for Wireless Networks (now filed in non-provisional form as Ser. No. 13\/833,679), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety (referred to as \u201cspace-time calibration patents\u201d).","As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,876,266, the approaches described in the space time calibration patents are interoperable with current techniques for positioning and timing, and also can reside independent of these and provide location and timing for devices in a network. Examples of current techniques for positioning within the urban environment include the following: Cellular: GPS, A-GPS, Time of Arrival, Radio Fingerprinting, Cell Global Identity, and Enhanced Cell ID. Wi-Fi: Radio Fingerprinting, Wi-Fi TOA, and Wireless Access Point War-driving. GPS: DGPS, WAAS, A-GPS, and Laser Augmentation.","This disclosure will further describe the functional concept of a Location Based Router (LBR). Any and every node in a network can serve the LBR role. If it can communicate, it can take on the role of the LBR. Mesh Networks are particularly suited for operating LBR components and software layers\u2014and the same principle applies with Mesh Networks: location and timing matter, so build them into the core of what Mesh Networks are.","A familiar prior art to LBR is what is commonly referred to as \u2018Routers\u2019 today, which duly receive digital packets from one IP address and do their best to route such packets to\u2014or at least closer to\u2014some destination IP address. The LBR of this disclosure uses and builds upon the simplified operations of this type of network router, while attempting to add the above elements of location and timing to the overall functional picture.","One aspect of the invention is a location based router system comprising a router in communication with an ad hoc network of devices, including at least one mobile device. The router directs packets from the network to associated agents. The router and its agents execute on one or more processing units within a device or distributed among different devices over a network. The router receives queries from requesting clients, such as the mobile device, and provides location to the requesting client. Additionally, depending on preferences of the client, it also routes market packets for location based services back to the mobile device dependent on its location.","The particular configuration of agents can vary. In one embodiment, the agents include a grouping agent, a packet processing agent, and a solution agent. The grouping agent manages an ad hoc network of nodes, including at least one mobile device. The packet processing agent receives packets originating from the ad hoc network of nodes, and prepares information from the packets for determining location of the mobile device node. The solution agent processes information prepared by the packet processing agent to determine location of the mobile device node.","Additional agents provide pre-processing of packets to manage the flow of packet data from ad hoc network to other agents that process the packets to determine location of devices. For example, in one embodiment, a pair filtering agent determines from packets coming from the network whether communication between a pair of nodes in the network is sufficient to use signal transmissions between the nodes to determine location solutions. This agent may be used by the packet processing agent or solution agent to pre-filter packets routed from the network to the solution agent for determining location.","Additional components of the router system may include an agent for managing active agents to which the router sends packets for determining location, as well as agents for providing location based services to a mobile device within the ad hoc network.","The router communicates directly or indirectly with the mobile device to receive its queries for location and services, to route packets for determining its location, and to route market packets to the mobile device to provide services dependent on its location.","The ad hoc network of nodes changes over time as the mobile device makes new connections with wireless network nodes. The grouping agent updates the wireless network nodes from which data is used to determine the location of the mobile device. In one particular Wi Fi device network embodiment, the mobile device is a Wi-Fi transmitting device, such as a cell phone or tablet, and the wireless network nodes comprise Wi-Fi modules that transmit and receive signals with each other in pairs, capture transmit and receipt data for these signals, and send the transmit and receive data in packets to the router for determining the location of the mobile device.","Another aspect of the invention is a method of providing location based service to a mobile device in a wireless network. The method comprises:","from the wireless device, receiving a query for location in the wireless network, the query including an opt-in level for participating in offers for location based services;","receiving location computed from packets transmitted between the mobile device and nodes in the wireless network;","providing a data structure comprising location, opt in level, and mobile device user information to a market for services, where the market for services determines an associated service based on the location, opt in level and mobile device user information and adds metadata for the associated service to the data structure to produce a response structure, enabling the user device to obtain the associated service.","There are several variants of this method, in terms of system architecture and alternative features, and methods, which are described in more detail below. Inventive features are not intended to be limited to various combinations of elements presently claimed in this patent application.","Further features will become apparent with reference to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","11","12","13"]},"To the far left of the figure, , the duality and interchangeability of \u2018buyers\u2019 and \u2018sellers\u2019 is explicitly and centrally indicated, applying to \u2018The Market\u2019 nodes and\/or agents. These actors circle around the central \u2018LBR\u2019 core agent, , implying that no direct communication between any nodes\/agents is required for the overall system to function, all that is required is for each node to be able to communicate packets to and from the LBR hub.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"Foreshadowing much more disclosure to come, the classic question that a GPS receiver can answer of \u2018where am I\u2019 is slowly and inevitably replaced by \u2018what am I interested in at this place and whom am I willing to choose to help me satisfy those interests\u2019. That I would need to even ask \u2018where am I\u2019 becomes quaint, replaced by an implied location based query with a globally vast array of eager suppliers of answers to my query . . . the bead shop just around the corner being most eager to alert me of its spitting-distance-presence, knowing that I LOVE to string weird necklaces and hand them out at parties.  and \u2018Tri-Quads\u2019 formalize these notions as engineering specifications on xml-like software packets, the flipside of weird necklaces.","A quick thumbing through of some of the figures in this disclosure can provide a finish to this introductory section. An underlying theme of these technical moving parts is the far-left text of \u2014the duality\/interchangeability of buyers and sellers\u2014and its manifestation as richly populated location-based queries interconnected through an LBR architecture to a large, BUT, well organized sea of willing respondents to those queries.","Agent-LBR Packet Exchange","An LBR-designed network would operate with simple packet exchange as its most elementary operation. An agent (node) needs to know how to send and receive packets from \u2018an LBR\u2019. At the end of the day, there needs to be only one basic format for a packet, but cracking one open would quickly find one of the two flavors of packet exchange:","1) Market Packets, and","2) Plumbing Packets","corresponding to the left and right halves of  respectively. In both cases, the form of those packets would follow industry standardized protocols similar if not even fully borrowing from familiar examples such as HTML, XML, image file formats, IP data packet formats, etc. Indeed, the more such existing formats and protocols can be used the better. No need to invent entirely new data formats; rather, existing formats can be adapted to LBR requirements.","A simple and by no means only example of a Market Packet is illustrated in ,  showing a conceptual view of the packet and  illustrating its software-like description. This disclosure refers to this market-oriented packet as a \u201cTri-Quad\u201d as later sections will describe in detail. The driving idea behind Market Packets is that they are actively engaged in the direct exchange of goods and services, interpreted very broadly. One of the recently modern concepts of \u2018selling metadata\u2019\u2014where \u2018metadata\u2019 is really just an iceberg with the submerged part actually being detailed demographic data down to preferred color of socks\u2014is thus included in the definition, as depicted in . The words \u2018selected metadata\u2019 in  is a prelude to the descriptions of the many levels of \u2018opt in\u2019 that consumers can choose for themselves and thus control the level of selling they do of their own interests and what they are willing to be presented with.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"As detailed in the Space Time Calibration patents incorporated above, pings are transmissions from one network node to another, while pungs are records of pings that are collected over time intervals and used to determine timing and location of network nodes. While the space time calibration patents describe implementations of pings and pungs for space-time calibration within networks, the LBR can also be implemented for other types of positioning with or without integration of the space-time calibration. These include positioning systems that are rely on strength of signal (Received Signal Strength (RSS)), dead reckoning using directional sensors, positioning systems listed in the above Background and Summary, or hybrid systems that fuse data from combinations of these techniques.","Note in both  there is an LBR field which will be further described on its own accord later in the disclosure. An element of that field to note early on is that this field can and will often contain multi-layered routing instructions such that a single packet exchange to the LBR can instigate one or more packet exchanges, including sequence-type instructions such as \u2018send subset A and B of this packet to Agent X, get a response C from Agent X and then send a packet with B and C to Agent Y. These multi-layered and time-sequenced routing instructions will be seen to be critical to many location-based query and response networks replete with competitive forces wanting to buy the right to serve up responses to various queries.","Each of these packet types and their many variants will be further described herein. The higher level point to be made here is that an LBR-prescribed network need only specify\u2014at the network message passing level\u2014this basic exchange of packets between any given node\/agent and an \u2018LBR\u2019, used here as an explicit noun. Everything else having to do with timing and location\/position knowledge will be performed \u2018in the cloud\u2019 and the resulting solutions made available to the node in a steady stream of LBR-packets coming back to that node\/agent. Again, this does not mean that \u2018an LBR\u2019 needs to be halfway around the world, across the country, in another county or halfway across a building; it can be as simple as a second thread on a CPU in a mobile handset! The actual physical location of the various nodes\/agents and how they all share resources and how they all communicate is 100% flexible accordingly.","Establishing an LBR Infrastructure: Registering Plumbing-Side Agents","As previous disclosures and now patents have described (see the space time calibration patents incorporated above), certain nodes in a network will need to take on responsibilities for initiating and then maintaining basic location and timing services for the network as a whole. Such nodes are generally aligned with the right side of , the plumbing side. Though it is certainly possible for any node to have all \u2018LBR software\u2019 and all \u2018agent software\u2019 available to it, this will almost never be the case in implementations. The usual case will be that most nodes will want to minimize both their software requirements and their communications requirements to just those necessary to either offer their specialized brand of services to the network on the plumbing side, or consume location and timing services from the network certainly in the upper left quadrant of . One wishes to get to the situation where a given node fires up and one of its first communications to some other node will be a query whether that other node can directly or indirectly provide to it both location and timing services. For brevity, we shorten this to the simple question: \u201cAre you an LBR or can you connect me to one?\u201d The remainder of this section will assume that location-aware operations are not simply built into the standards of the network operations, and thus all initiation procedures need to be explicitly performed as opposed to \u2018hard wired\u2019. Once some of these procedures are more familiar to wireless device designers, many of the explicit initiation steps will be pre-programmed into nodes.","One embodiment of an LBR sets up a common IP-address with a variety of services it offers, i.e. setting up what has been branded as a Web Service. See, in particular, discussion of web services (e.g., ZuluTime Web Service) in unpublished U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/187,723 filed Jul. 21, 2011, entitled MULTI-PATH-COMPENSATION METHODS FOR LOCATION-DETERMINATION OF MOBILE DEVICES (published as 2012-0309415), Ser. No. 13\/179,807 filed Jul. 11, 2011, entitled LOCATION AWARE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (published as 2012-0309414), and the web service architecture in 61\/613,915, filed Mar. 21, 2012, entitled Positioning Systems for Wireless Networks (now filed in non-provisional form as Ser. No. 13\/833,679), which are incorporated by reference. Previous and companion disclosures have also described the operations of such a service without an LBR perspective, this disclosure will emphasize certain modifications to such a web service which can have it behave in line with LBR design principles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"In , we see the circle with \u2018LBR\u2019 inside and labeled with italicized . This circle represents the packet ingest software at the IP address discussed above. Also depicted is an \u2018Agent Registry\u2019 icon, , with a view into its registry structure, . This Agent Registry is itself an agent in the LBR definition of that term, where also depicted is some external random agent contacting the LBR with an incoming packet, , in this case the packet is an initial registration packet from the external agent announcing its presence and requesting association with the LBR and its universe still to be described. The incoming packet contains a flag which emphasizes that it is a registry initiation packet and the packet also contains typical metadata allowing the LBR to route the packet to the Agent Registry, , along with the metadata needed to populate the registry fields, .","The LBR software, , cares little about the contents of the registration packet and just knows it needs to pass it on to the Agent Registry, depicted as action , then expecting some kind of return packet , with whatever routing instructions it may contain.","When the Agent Registry receives the packet, , it performs quite typical database operations checking to see if the registration packet is valid, has not already been registered, etc. Later disclosure sections will examine the various intricacies and options available to this agent, but for the purposes of just showing how an LBR network is established, we'll leave it to this simple registration act with the fields shown. The field \u2018LBR-assigned ID\u2019, , indicates that the Agent Registry, , is uniquely assigned to the LBR  and it is free to use its own internal ID scheme, even though the external agent sending in the registration packet may have its own ID as sent in the packet, where that ID is stored in field . Later sections will better explain why an isolated LBR should follow best practices of setting up its own unique agent identification system whilst still respecting the externally defined ID systems of the various agents contacting it. In this way, this is just a mapping exercise between all the various agents that the LBR will be mediating with all their various flavors of ID's, and a unified ID scheme that the LBR and its associated Agent Registry can deal with. [The ID schema for both can certainly be identical in LBR-designed networks of lower and contained complexity].","Also depicted in  at a basic level is field  \u2018Type\u2019 and field  \u2018Properties\u2019. Again, further sections will dive into details on these and other fields, but for the establishment of an LBR network, suffice to say that plumbing-side agents checking in to establish an LBR infrastructure need to announce their roles and provide basic information on their properties. An example of \u2018type\u2019 might be a Wi-Fi \u2018wallwart\u2019 listening node or a common Wi-Fi Access Point. An Example of \u2018properties\u2019 might be specifications on ping count stamp resolution or the anticipated rate at which the agent expects to be contacting the LBR with data packet traffic. One \u2018property\u2019 for plumbing-side nodes\/agents is any knowledge they might have of their location. This is usually expressed in latitude, longitude and altitude, if they know this. Clearly, these fields are quite flexible and expandable.","The Agent Registry  having finished its registration task then sends a response packet back to the LBR, . Later sections will go into much greater detail on how this response packet  can contain several layers of packet-routing combinations, basically telling the LBR to route some subset of the packet  to some \u2018Agent X\u2019, another subset to \u2018Agent Y\u2019, and perhaps yet another subset of the packet back to the initiating external agent (not depicted) that sent the original packet . This general notion is referred to as a \u2018flurry\u2019 in , attached to label . Deferring the discussion of a \u201cflurry\u201d to later sections, the main three actions (realized as packet transmissions) the Agent Registry would like to see happen after this registration act are depicted as , sending a subset of the response packet  to one or more plumbing-side agents, , sending a subset of the response packet to one or more market-side agents, and , sending a subset of the response packet back to the initiating (registering) agent. What is difficult to depict in  but should be appreciated and described is that in general, the steps listed as 4, 5 and 6 in the figure are performed sequentially and that there is an option for the response packets from, say, step 4 to append new data into the packet sent to step 5 agents. Unfortunately, it CAN be even more complicated than this sequential stepping, but for registration, we can imagine it to be strictly sequential and that routed packets can have appended metadata attached. The next few figures and associated text will parse steps 4 and 5 a bit more, so for the purposes of describing this , suffice it to say that interested plumbing-side and market-side agents have been contacted, with response packets duly received by the LBR, as one consequence of the external agent registering itself with the LBR. This appending of packet information can be an operation performed by the LBR software, , or, one can posit a \u2018packet appender\u2019 agent not depicted in , or, even send packets back to the Agent Registry, , to do this operation along with the typical process control steps ensuring that the response  ultimately sent back to the registering agent is correct and authentic.","As stated,  is trying to isolate the initiation process and, given its still high level nature, the \u2018flurry\u2019 aspects of ,  and  will all be further described. Concluding then with discussion on , a confirmation packet  is of course sent to the initiating agent, presumably almost all the time with a \u2018good to go\u2019 flag and the implicit message, \u2018start doing whatever thing you are going to do,\u2019 with the implicit notion that LBR  is willing to serve the initiating agent's needs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":"120"},"It should also be noted that  reinforce the location correspondences between common infrastructure nodes and market-services that hope to tap into a given location. So when a Wi-Fi wall wart or access point registers its lat-long-altitude and some flurry indicates (via looking up the lat-long-altitude database as is common in geographic services) that this new device is in some public cafeteria, then inherently the new device's function is being set up for the plumbing-side service of helping to locate clients determine where they are in the cafeteria, AND, setting up its participation in market-services to those clients. All of this gets back to the ideas behind , illustrating that injecting location information into the setting up of common infrastructure nodes becomes a foundation for also setting up location-based services to a location. A technician installing some device is inherently creating a location-based marketplace by bolting the device in and turning it on. The proprietor\/owner of the device then becomes free to exclusively exploit the marketplace thus created, lease it, make it free to all corners, etc., as further sections will continue to describe.","Not every last step, packet and operation can be depicted in . The intent is to show that even in the simple act of registering a plumbing-side node\/agent into an LBR's domain, many things can happen. Further sections of this disclosure will describe these more detailed steps and operations.","Establishing an LBR Infrastructure: Timing and Location Agents",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"]},"With reference to , this section explains how elements of the space time calibration system can be \u2018broken up\u2019 into an LBR framework, where various algorithmic and organizing steps become their own independent agents.  continues with the agent registration process flow established in the previous section and explains both how timing and location can be initialized within an LBR context, but also how data can start to flow through that infrastructure and produce timing and location solutions for those nodes requesting such. We will run through  twice, first as it is connected to the registration process of new agents as described in  with associated text, and then a second time as external nodes become active data producers providing real-time data toward the LBR, expecting timing and location solutions in return.","In , at the left we see a packet  coming in to the LBR from some external node\/agent as described in . Let us first postulate that this is the same \u2018initialization and registration\u2019 packet described in those previous , and hence, as label  indicates in the upper right of , we will take a peek in on one example of a \u2018flurry\u2019 that can happen as part of setting up the LBR infrastructure and enabling it to provide timing and solution services, i.e. a peek in on cloud flurry  of .","We have already been through the various registration steps consolidated as label  in , let's now enquire about the packet  being sent to a newly introduced agent called the \u2018Topology and Real-time Grouping Agent\u2019 . This agent  has already registered itself with the LBR and its Agent Registry. In an initialization phase, packet  will be announcing the arrival of a new RF-active plumbing-side node, call it Bob, and implicitly asking the Grouping Agent  to group together nodes with certain proximity relationships to each other, as described in the space time calibration patents incorporated above. An example of this might be that folks are setting up a given floor in a given building with 5 Wi-Fi access points (AP's) and 30 Wi-Fi wall warts, and the first packet received by  instructs it that such a new grouping is coming its way and that it should initiate a group associated with this very specific floor. The next 34 of these 35 registering agents will indicate they want to belong to the newly established Bob's group and agent  obliges by setting up a group database. In both the case of Bob asking for the group to be set up, and the 34 agents after Bob, a response packet  is sent back to the LBR of \u2018all clear\u2019 which eventually makes its way back to the RF-active nodes via packet  of . Later sections of this disclosure will further examine the operations of the grouping agent , so again for the purposes of describing how an LBR infrastructure is first established,  at least shows the basics of how RF-active nodes can become associated (grouped) based primarily on proximity and implicitly, RF interaction (utilization of common Wi-Fi channels, sharing of those channels, etc.).","The section entitled \u2018baseline operations, timing and positioning\u2019 will come back to  and discuss its operation in a real-time setting. The remaining item to note for this section is that also part of response packet  going back to the LBR is a sub-packet destined for the LBR's Agent Registry , instructing it that the group agent  accepted the new agent as part of \u2018group Bob\u2019 and that the agent  should perform the registry-appending as described in  accordingly. Part of the packet  is also a message to agent  that pung data received from the newly registered node will in most cases be routed toward the agent labeled packet processing agent in .","Using the example of 5 AP's and 30 wall warts above, at some point enough of these active Wi-Fi agents have fired up and registered with the LBR such that the grouping agent will send a message back to the LBR that it has estimated that Bob's group is probably sufficiently populated for timing and location solution action. This message can both a) trip a flag in the Agent Registry's database and\/or b) can be sent all the way to the registered nodes. This then completes a look at how an LBR infrastructure can be set up and made ready for live data feeds (\u2018data feeds\u2019 meaning: floods of pung packets, referring to the collection and distribution of ping data in pung packets in the space time calibration patents incorporated herein, above).","Enter LBR Market-side Participants: Initializing\/Registering RF-Active Nodes\/Agents","For the purposes of this section, we shall confine the description to RF-active nodes\/agents on \u2018market-side\u2019 to be any device which primarily wishes to accept and use timing and location services from the network along with the later described marketplace services of the network. A primary example here is mobile phones. Other examples include laptops and tablets, RF-active sensors and RFID's, two-way radios, industrial devices and equipment, etc. Market side agent applies to any device that communicates and wishes to consume location services.","There are two main classes of these nodes\/agents: ones which explicitly interact with an LBR universe and ones that don't. The former category is rather straightforward and will be described first. Industrial devices using Zigbee, IEEE standard 802.15, are excellent examples of this class. The latter class is typified by transmit-only tracking of smart phones, where the users of such phones typically do not care about LBRs operating within the surrounding network, but they just want to know where they are and have very explicit and reliable \u2018opt in\u2019 or \u2018opt out\u2019 participation in market services. In the latter smart phone case, the smart phone merely makes packet transmissions and does not directly interact with an LBR, at least relative to the pro-active determination of its location (it often wishes to consume\/use the solutions to that process, however).","Starting with the first class, a typical operational scenario would be for a client device, for example a Zigbee-based mobile sensor communicating with some fixed-in-space infrastructure device also Zigbee-based. There are of course many options available to this mobile sensor but a common one is where it wants to have a direct relationship with an LBR and directly consume timing and location services from that LBR.  also depicts how such an agent\/node can pretty much follow the same initialization\/registration procedures as fixed infrastructure nodes\/agents. This section will describe some small variations from the plumbing-side nodes\/agents case.","Looking again at , such a client device has at least two options for directly participating in LBR timing and positioning. Option one is to have knowledge of the IP address of the LBR and to just register itself directly, and the other is to \u2018ask or assume\u2019 that some local infrastructure node\/agent will do all that for it. Either way, a registration packet  is sent to the LBR just like the earlier case but now with the simple distinction inside the packet that this node is a market-side (or client-side, equivalently, where one can imagine that this industrial device is \u2018in the market for determining its location\u2019, and may later be \u2018in the market to have certain industrial services provided to it based on its location\u2019) node and generally will be expecting to be provided services as opposed to providing them. As previous disclosures have explained, this is not a hard distinction, as even client-side nodes can also provide data to an LBR network that assists other nodes (indeed, it is hard for data to be provided which does not somehow accrue to the benefit of all nodes in the network except in data glut situations).","The LBR will then generally follow the same routine previously described with a few small differences. For example, there may be a logically separate Agent Registry for client nodes, think of it as \u2032 ( prime), with slightly different fields being populated with ID's, metadata and associations. Such a registry would also expect a more fluid coming and going of client nodes whereas the plumbing-side registry may be more stable as interpreted in a geographic and 24\/7 sense. This separation of registries is by no means required however, where another approach is to just have more data fields, where plumbing-side nodes will have \u2018N\/A\u2019 in several fields that apply only to market-side nodes, and vice versa.","Also, the cloud-side flurries  and  will be similar at the high level (they happen), but in each case there will be different agents potentially contacted with indications that a market-side node is being registered. For example, the grouping agent  of  will fundamentally \u2018expect\u2019 that this new market-side node will probably be mobile (especially if such a field is set \u20181\u2019), and thus to expect that it will be changing its group relationships over time (see Ser. No. 13\/179,807 filed Jul. 11, 2011, entitled LOCATION AWARE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (published as 2012-0309414), and \u2018topographic ooze\u2019, for example, which is incorporated by reference). Likewise as will be discussed later in this disclosure, the Agent Opt-in cloudside flurry  will in general be much richer and complicated, reaching and interacting with more cloudside agents, than is the general case with plumbing-side nodes.","All in all, however, the registration and initializing into the LBR framework for a duplex RF-active node is therefore quite similar to a plumbing-side node. The case of an RF-active agent\/node such as a Smart-Phone needing to be registered, where the device itself is only participating in a transmit-only modality, is just a bit more involved than the directly participating duplex agent. The primary difference is that such a Tx-only device needs to either a) directly \u2018instruct\u2019 some LBR-participant that it wants to be registered and that second participant will do the registering, b) be \u2018heard\u2019 by some LBR participant and registered as an anonymous Tx-only agent, c) find the IP address of the LBR and do the registration itself, d) request some \u2018third party app\u2019 that it wishes to participate in timing\/location services and thereby \u2018imply\u2019 choice \u2018a\u2019 above where then that third party app does the registration. There are clearly even more options than a) through d) above, but the main point is that for most practical implementations, it is rather inefficient for the network as a whole to have the smart phone do anything more than \u2018transmit RF packets like you usually do\u2019 and let other nodes do the work. Later sections on levels of \u2018opt in\u2019 elucidate the various choices a smart phone has in participation in an LBR-enabled network.","Baseline Operations for Timing and Positioning","Previous sections started to touch upon the actual functioning of the timing and positioning services once some set of nodes have been registered and are ready to begin producing ping data and sending pung data. The space time calibration patents incorporated herein provide additional explanation of the meanings of pings and pungs, how they are shared and organized, and how timing and location solutions are generated. This disclosure and this section of this disclosure will continue to concentrate on practicing these methods in an LBR-mediated fashion as opposed to the many other forms presented in the space time calibration patents.","Going back to the example of our building with 5 AP's and 30 Wi-Fi wall warts (see, for example, U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/179,807 (published as 2012-0309414) incorporated herein by reference, for more information about how AP's and wall warts can function together as a space-time calibration enabled network), let us now assume that all 35 agents have registered themselves and all have indicated, ultimately to the grouping agent  of , that they all are on floor 4 of building 7 on some corporate campus, and all have provided their \u2018floor coordinates\u2019 in the registration process (\u2018Bob\u2019 decides that they should not name the group after him finally, and he served his role however in at least being the first to initiate a group later to be renamed \u2018floor 4 bldg 7\u2019). One activity that the grouping agent  begins doing and continues to do as these new agents (the 35) register themselves is to initiate a new group structure assigned to this floor and it will enquire back to one of those agents the following English-phrased questions, but of course executed as LBR-agent packet exchanges AND as indicated by setting flags accordingly to fields associated with the English questions:","a) Are you and your floor associated with any of my existing macro-groups, e.g. Building 7 or Acme Corp Trilling Pines Campus?","b) Are you willing to share with me (agent ) your square footage of the floor or even a floor plan?","c) Can you fix that floor plan onto latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates? If not, would you like me to try?","d) how many plumbing-side nodes do you expect to register, i.e. when should I believe you have registered most or all of the agents (5+30 in our example)?","e) Are you expecting floors 3 and 5 to also register and am I allowed to attempt cross-floor sub-groupings (thus providing for Z-axis continuity of solutions).","f) Do you have estimates of your expected traffic loads, ping rates, pung rates, etc., that are in addition to the individual \u2018properties\u2019 that I will already be acquiring through the individual registrations of the nodes on your floor?","g) MANY other such questions, many of which have been described in the space time calibration patents, especially U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/179,807 (published as 2012-0309414), incorporated herein, dealing with grouping, mobility and constantly changing network topologies.","As item g indicates, this list of questions is far from inclusive for all such relevant questions that can assist the grouping agent  do its job. The notion that the grouping agent  needs to \u2018enquire\u2019 of one of these nodes is also just a convenient tutorial example, actual campus-wide and building-wide implementations will no doubt have batch uploads to agent  covering thousands of devices, hundreds of floors and often a couple dozen buildings (think college campuses for example). The more explicit example laid out above, including its deliberately \u2018non-engineering English question formulation\u2019, is meant to be clearer on the steps involved and some of the critical information necessary\/desirable for the grouping agent .","Once the grouping agent  has some minimum threshold of information as indicated above, and once a dozen or two of the floor agents\/nodes have registered themselves (or have been bulk-registered), the agent then performs some first-cut pairings of plumbing-side nodes, using proximity of those nodes as an initial guide. The pair-wise associations of nodes has been explored at length in the space time calibration patents, incorporated herein, and agent  in  is specifically geared toward processing real time pung data of such pairs. The reason that this is \u2018first-cut\u2019 pairings is that as anyone practiced in RF-arts knows, proximity and radio specifications do not equal expected quality of channels. One goal at this point is to understand exactly \u2018who is talking to whom\u2019 RF-wise, can node M hear and respond to node N, or just one hear the other, the combinations are obviously quite complicated.","The more refined step that agent  can initiate at this point is to send simple \u2018calibration\u2019 packet messages to some or all of the nodes on floor 4. The message to some particular node will be: send me a few dozen packets please (through the LBR of course), it can have any message you like inside, indicated as  in . Agent  also respectfully requests all other nodes on the floor to \u2018listen and record pings\u2019 while our selected node sends these \u2018dummy messages\u2019, indicated by  in . Presumably agent  either sends one LBR-agent packet to one master node on the floor, or, individual packets to all 35 participants, either way. All nodes duly listen and record pings then take turns shipping in their pung packets to the LBR, BUT, they too send several dozen pung packets, not just one, such that all nodes can attempt to hear all other nodes for not just one packet but many. This sending of pung packets and simultaneous listening and recording pings is indicated as  in . Finally, after all nodes (including the very first one) have had a chance to try to gather pings from as many other nodes as they can during this induced chatter calibration session, they all then send in their pungs from this chatter session, whereupon the agent  sorts these pungs and performs a thresholding of pairwise associations by asking \u2018Did node J EVER even hear node K, and if so, was it at least 25% (tunable) of the pings node J actually sent\u2019? Crossing this threshold for any given pair, agent  then submits the raw ping values to packet processing agent  (described below) for it to determine whether pair J and K is of sufficient quality to indeed \u2018log\u2019 as a valid pair, with such pairings then being recorded in a registry inside agent . It tests this for all possible pairings (and then some, if floors 3 and 5 are indicated as associated with floor 4 as well)\u2014or 35*34\/2=595 possible valid pairings.","The above description of a more refined notion of \u2018grouping\u2019 is thus predicated on first finding decent channel characteristics between pairs of nodes. The above description and  is truly more of a didactic example and those implementing such pairwise testing will assuredly use more batch-oriented methods and will no doubt use \u2018normal chatter\u2019 as the source for the pings and pungs. Again, the description above is explicitly meant to draw out steps and lessons on at least one way to manage the grouping of nodes. In short, the grouping agent determines the pairs that are communicating sufficiently, and logs them, and as the pairs change over time, it does periodic checks to maintain the validity of the pairs.","Let us now imagine the agent  has performed the steps laid out in  and has empirically found 300-or-whatever qualified pairings of plumbing-side nodes amongst the 35 nodes of floor 4. One thing it can do at this point is to lay out a graphical presentation of these pairing and present them as a graphic to a technician, although it would be pretty busy as a visual. A better \u2018intuitive\u2019 graphic might be presentations in an animated manner, stepping through nodes and ensuring that each node can hear some minimum desired number of other nodes. For more discussion of the density of nodes and the effects such densities have on quality of timing and spatial solutions, see the space time calibration patents incorporated herein. Automated agents can also be employed rather than requiring a human technician to make judgment calls on densities and qualities of connections.","Preparing for live operation, now, a minimum step that agent  should take is to at least store away the registry of pairings itself in its own memory and\/or disks, and then to send either a rather large LBR-agent packet to the LBR, addressed to the Agent Registry , instructing  to add new fields to all of the tested nodes, indicating in their own database entries which nodes they seem to be well paired with. Such data fields would properly show up under the \u2018associations\u2019 field of . Exactly how such information will be used in live time-space services situations will be explored below.","It should be clear that the explicitness of the inherent pair-wise checking is really more of an ongoing operation. So, one of the operational jobs of the agent  during live operations is to routinely (e.g., every hour or once a day) do pairwise checking, testing, what have you, deleting valid pairs if they somehow stop behaving well and adding new pairs if they are discovered during normal operations.","Between the questions listed and presumably answered in the early part of this section, and the pair-wise mapping of the latter part, agent  has much of what it needs to now be ready for real time pung ingestion and the performing of its real time role.","The next step is for either some node at the building or some human controller at the building to send a packet to the LBR instructing \u2018all concerned agents\u2019 that everything is ready to initiate an ad hoc network session. At this stage, each of the 35 plumbing nodes on floor 4 start listening for Wi-Fi traffic (or Zigbee, cell packets, etc. as the case may be) and generate and store pings from the traffic it hears, then ship this data as normal pung packets to the LBR, which then feeds them into the solutions group of agents, as mediated by the grouping agent .","As noted above, elements of the space time calibration system are implemented as LBR agents. Another one of these agents in  is the \u201cPair Filtering Agent\u201d . Its main role is to be the first guard at the gate of the flood of incoming pung packets, trying to condense pungs down to just the \u2018good pairs\u2019 that the packet processing agent processes further. The processed data one desires from the plumbing-side nodes is real time and continually changing clock count relationships between pairs of infrastructure nodes (plumbing-side). The next agent (packet processing agent) transforms the pung data of these \u2018good pairs\u2019 into a form usable for computing location solutions. One embodiment of the packet processing agent, called the Median Slope Offset packet processing agent, applies a model to ping data sampled over time by a pair of nodes and transforms it into form used by the solutions agent, as described further below. The filtering agent  is a computational efficiency filter, removing lower quality data from subsequent processing stages, like the packet processing and solution agents. One side task it can perform for the sake of agent  is to monitor the ongoing quality of pair-channels and report back on problems or new additional pairs discovered.","The picture becomes complete when a mobile market-node comes onto the scene. The mobile node starts transmitting packets that are heard by a handful of fixed nodes. In these packets, the mobile node issues a query for its spatial location to be determined, and in response, the X-Y-[Z] Solution agent,  , provides a solution for the location of the mobile node. The space time calibration patents describe how the combinations of pairwise data mixes with the raw ping\/pung data received by fixed nodes from the mobile devices' transmissions, all leading toward an X-Y-[Z] location determination. Particular implementations, for example, for mobile devices are described in patent application 61\/613,915, filed Mar. 21, 2012, entitled Positioning Systems for Wireless Networks, which is incorporated herein.","Spotlight on Dynamic Topology and Grouping Agents: Continuity of Solutions and Continuity of Connections","Expanding upon the description of the previous section\/ending paragraph, details on how incoming pung packets from fixed infrastructure-side nodes get turned into mobile client location solutions is better described by going straight to the \u2018normal\u2019 situation of some mobile device entering, travelling around in, then leaving a typical retail space. This section keys in on what exactly might happen behind the scenes in an embodiment of a LBR while this scenario plays out. Many of the ensuing figures are taken directly from U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/179,807 (published as 2012-0309414) and Ser. No. 13\/187,723 (published as 2012-0309415), which are incorporated herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["350","352","354","350","356","352"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"All infrastructure devices strewn throughout the store are generic and essentially identical, BUT, there are two different icon types presented in , indicating the differences between those infrastructure devices,  or \u2018+\u2019, which choose to associate with AP  and use its particular Wi-Fi channel accordingly, and those,  or \u2018x\u2019, which choose to associate with AP  and use its Wi-Fi channel. A description of how such devices are configured, installed and subsequently \u2018associated\u2019 with an AP is provided in U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/179,807, incorporated herein. Existing Wi-Fi communications may be employed for installing, configuring and associating such devices with an AP.","The general point that  is setting the stage for is that this particular store has effectively two slightly overlapping \u2018zones\u2019 with two different Wi-Fi channels, foreshadowing the coming description whereby mobile devices move randomly throughout this store and yet are supplied with continuous and seamless location determination solutions. That only two AP's are presented is for tutorial\/description reasons, and many if not more larger stores will have more than two AP's, yet will have identical LBR principles apply which are discussed in this section.","Now, let us assume that the set-up operations described by , and all the accompanying sections around those figures, are performed on all of the infrastructure devices depicted in , including the creation of two sub-groups associated with the two AP's, with the two combining to form one overall group identified by the store itself. Consider also that a \u2018chatter session\u2019 has been run whereby a grouping agent has determined all the decent pairs of Wi-Fi direct channels between two random GS1011 devices.  then depicts one particular infrastructure node, , and which other nodes were found to both \u2018hear it\u2019 and \u2018be heard by it\u2019, depicted as green lines versus red lines. The red lines to the nodes associated with the other AP are not depicted as being obvious (as they are different channels and won't hear each other). Note that many of the further devices on the same channel nevertheless have red lines indicating that the high quality reception of signals was below threshold for those given pairings. This may be due to simply being out of range, some process applied whereby it was determined that too much noise or \u2018multipath\u2019 was present between two nodes, perhaps they hear each other but there is some sporadic distortions due to an excessively RF-distortion-mobile factors\u2014it can be any number of reasons for a grouping agent to determine whether a given pairing is a good one or not (and as stated, these pairings are constantly monitored and changed if necessary, even during X-Y-[Z] solutions stages).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["350","364"]},"The reality is that there are a great many variants on what exactly might happen during this initial association. Many variants will have more to do with the customer\/store-proprietor relationship being formed than they do with LBR and location determination. Many of these customer-relationship activations and \u2018opt-ins\u2019 and loyalty program implementations will be covered in greater detail in sections devoted to LBR marketplace dynamics. This section will concentrate exclusively on LBR operations in support of location determination with mobility and channel-switching involved. So the dashed line  in  effectively represents what was discussed previously in the section on market-side node registration and initiation, where it referred largely to . More particularly, what was described in the final paragraph of that section included several options of how a market-side client, most typically a consumer's smart phone, gets registered into an LBR framework.","Perhaps the easiest but by no means only way to register a new mobile node, \/, is for the store proprietor to first establish a loyalty program Wi-Fi session with that node\u2014logging in to a mobile application for the store\u2014then simply ask a newly arrived customer if they want location based services inside the store. This can also simply be a \u2018checked setting\u2019 so that a customer only need be asked once. Once the store knows a given customer is desiring location services, the store will know the ID or MAC address of the device and will instigate all the LBR registration activities described in earlier sections of this disclosure. Again, the dashed line  is very short hand graphic indication of all of this activity. We can then assume that now an LBR, an Agent Registry AND a Grouping Agent, generally run by the store or some service provided to the store, knows about our new mobile node . This mobile need do no more than transmit Wi-Fi packets every now and then (once or twice a second if it wishes to be real-time tracked with navigation assistance) for it to be located, with details on how this is done immediately below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"b":["362","362","366"]},"So, back in the cloud (e.g., LBR embodiment operating as a cloud service), some Agent Registry  now has taken note of the sheer presence and typical \u2018opt-in\u2019 of mobile node , instigated whatever flurry is necessary to alert other agents of this presence, with a Grouping Agent , , being one important agent in this regard. Such a Grouping Agent will as previously stated have many options available to it but at the core it must effectively say \u2018I notice that this new device is obviously now within my store ABC123 group, I know it is mobile, I know it is transmit-only and I know it is currently associated with AP , which itself has nodes N through T associated with it\u2019\u2014the stage is set for putting all these pieces together as a contained local-solution group generally centered around the nodes that actively and with ever-changing configurations hear this new node . The grouping agent will monitor which nodes continue to hear transmissions from  and a section below will describe what happens as the node  wanders about the store.","Returning still to , let us now posit that the store-app-server, the \u2018loyalty program server\u2019 having been informed by node  that it wishes to play in its location services realm, now instructs the new node  to simply transmit a few more Wi-Fi packets (or, if the device  was already going to be sending packets for session relationship purposes, there is no need to instruct  to send packets as it was going to anyway). The end effect of this is that our small group of infrastructure nodes will collect maybe five, maybe a dozen ping-values each as they hear the packet transmissions from . Over an ensuing period of a couple seconds (difficult to graphically depict in  and hence not present), each infrastructure node also dutifully packs up such ping values into its pung packets that will be \u2018over the Wi-Fi airways\u2019 sent to the LBR as described in earlier sections. Of important explicit note in this example is that as nodes transmit their own pung packets \u2018over the airwaves\u2019\u2014i.e. as their own RF transmissions, other nodes will hear and record pings on these pung transmissions. So, at least for this isolated example of just one mobile device  being in the store, the infrastructure nodes will be recording pings from both the mobile device  AND all neighboring nodes in its vicinity, generally speaking the ones in the \u2018good pairings\u2019 list being tracked by the grouping agent, , . After a couple seconds therefore, and after every infrastructure node has had an opportunity to submit its latest batch of ping data to their LBR as pung packets, and after the LBR has routed such pung packets to the appropriate grouping agent, at last we get to the point where some pung processing agent, , , can collect such data and launch a specific solutions thread associated with new mobile device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 8","FIG. 13, 370","FIG. 13"],"b":["290","368","362","340","368","362","372"]},"Those practiced in the art of real-time ad hoc networks will recognize that the main ideas being described in  is that mobile devices are just that, mobile, and generally on a second by second basis their RF transmissions will be somewhat stably heard by certain specific devices but that exactly which will always be changing.

This situation is depicted in , where the pung packet  sent from some other random infrastructure node to the LBR is also heard and ping-recorded by our example node . It is exactly the same packet transmission, the two numbers just refer to the fact that both AP  and infrastructure node  receive the packet, with  also count stamping the packet and placing its value and ID of the transmitting node into its pung list . It should be recalled that all 14 depicted mobile devices are just having \u2018normal Wi-Fi communication sessions\u2019 as mediated by AP . AP  can also be countstamping incoming packets just like the infrastructure nodes, indeed, this will be the preferred embodiment of this invention once more AP providers understand the benefits of enabling location capabilities in their offerings, but for now, these capabilities generally do not exist on AP's and thus, the situation depicted and described herein simply posits the AP's as doing their usual thing: mediating communication sessions with a variety of Wi-Fi devices around them.","Another quite acceptable variant to the scenario herein described which will work just fine but is not generally supported by 2102-era devices is that duplex count-stamping (ping gathering) can also be happening between fixed nodes (both GS 1011 devices AND AP's) and the mobile devices themselves. One can envision  all having mobile devices with on-board count stamping capabilities for Wi-Fi packets received by those devices, pung packets constructed accordingly, then the mobile devices could place such data into packets received by AP  and sent to the \u2018store app\u2019 or whatever \u2018session\u2019 they are a part of, to then be passed onward to some LBR and therefore their data would also participate in location determination. Indeed, it is this inventor's belief that mobile devices will someday ALL have accessible packet-receipt (and probably packet-transmit) count stamps latched upon packet Rx (and Tx) events. When this happens, mobile devices can choose to be more active participants in LBR sessions. \u2018App developers\u2019 will be able to create and provide all manner of new apps exploiting a more direct relationship with LBR's and location-based marketplaces. \u201cOpt-in\u201d and \u201copt-out\u201d capabilities go to a new level of sophistication and trust once a given device itself can choose what data to share and what not to share, or, to simply keep all of its operations to itself similar to a GPS receiver being able to function by simply listening to public-domain signals. Likewise, a mobile device can also just sit and consume (receive) public domain signals and determine where it is. The LBR architecture CAN support such pure consumption of services by making many of its current data feeds (from infrastructure nodes such as the illustrated GS 1011's devices, for example) publicly accessible.","Concluding this section, one can see that in the nominal case of mobile devices simply broadcasting Wi-Fi packets every so often, then scaling is just a matter of how many mobile devices can be heard by any given fixed-node infrastructure device\u2014in the final analysis this will be determined by Wi-Fi airways and contention for air-space, as one would put it in the parlance of wireless communication. The LBR cloud-side construction is such that LBR's can be parallel, agents parallel, threads spawned and pretty close to \u2018indefinitely scalable\u2019 as the hyphen \u2018cloud-side\u2019 implies.","Dynamic Topology and Grouping Agents: From Raw Pung Data Ingest to Location Solutions","This section will go further into details of what is happening as the infrastructure nodes continually send their pung data to an LBR. As will be seen, essentially all of the \u2018algorithmic steps\u2019 remain similar to those of previous disclosures in the space time calibration patents, including prescriptions on dealing with multipath distortions and dropped channels. Here, the emphasis is on breaking up these steps into a more efficient and easily scalable form. One simple example of this is embodied in a rhetorical question, answered in this section: if two fixed infrastructure nodes are involved with receiving packets from 20 or 30 mobile nodes in order to assist in determining those mobile node locations, and if there are sub-operations common to just those two nodes applying to all 20 and 30 mobile nodes, why do such operations 20 or 30 times?

This is, in our implementation, \u2018wrapped\u2019 by a LBR packet frame, see  and its accompanying description. Via wrapping instructions, the LBR and its associated Agent Registry, the LBR in this case knows to pass along this packet, , largely intact to the grouping agent, , that has been previously assigned to fixed infrastructure node . The LBR may also perform some housekeeping operations such as incrementing a counter for how many pung packets it has received from , and\/or updating the \u2018time of last LBR packet\u2019 from , and\/or broadcast a message to any agents which have signed up to be alerted any time  submits a pung packet. There are other options as well, but generally speaking these will be mediated by fields in the Agent Registry where such instructions have been previously loaded.","Grouping Agent  immediately determines (step ) which of its many nodes it might be handling has sent this incoming packet, again through the LBR wrapping. In this case, it determines the sending node through database look-up through a conventional database process. From this look up, it finds whatever operative ID(s) are associated with the sending node. Much of the Grouping Agent's task has already been performed when it was tasked with doing a crude grouping of nodes based on \u2018floors\u2019 and \u2018AP's\u2019, etc., where subsequent operations created the chatter sessions and found initial configurations of \u2018good pairs\u2019. In a highest level design sense, the Grouping Agent is chief instigator of the cloud-side flurries required to initiate groups and set the stage for real-time solutions processing, and its real-time role becomes therefore more of just another router with some housekeeping chores watching over the general health of the established groups, pairs, serviced mobile clients, etc., doing something about the \u2018health\u2019 and\/or changing network configurations if it discovers major changes in such. Inherent to these earlier activities was the storing of such information and the creation of its own internal listings of managed nodes and node associations, with  making this more explicit.","Continuing on with , we see a broadly defined column heading labeled \u2018node associations\u2019 which is obviously more involved than a simple column would indicate. The activities depicted primarily by  and its associated text are generally kept track of (recorded and monitored) at a higher level in this agent's database (higher level=the nodes generally grouped with AP  but not necessarily \u2018good pairings\u2019, which we will come to; and also, generally which active mobile devices MAY, but not necessarily ARE, being heard at any given few second period of time). We might refer to this level of association as a virtual or potential level, and ensuing discussion on the pairwise agent and the packet processing agent clarifies another level of granularity on how few-second by few-second changes are monitored, stored, processed, etc.","For this scenario, we can imagine that Agent  does a quick check on the pung packet looking to see that most if not all of what it contains is within the \u2018known\u2019 group of nodes, and if so, it mainly just passes along the intact packet () to the Pair-Filtering Agent . If it does find \u2018new nodes\u2019 in the pung packet, or some other anomalies (division of labor of anomaly-checking can be negotiated between  and ), it may perform other actions such as inquiring back through the LBR whether there are new fixed infrastructure nodes that have neglected to register themselves, new mobile nodes which have not explicitly registered to \u2018opt out\u2019\u2014which itself launches a complex decision process on what to do with such \u2018purely anonymous\u2019 nodes\u2014etc. As the sections describing more of the marketplace aspects of LBR will further elucidate, the whole privacy\/opt-in\/opt-out choices are rich and varied, and the Grouping Agent  is one logical contained set of software where some of those capabilities can be expressed and acted upon in public\/readily identifiable and \u2018trustworthy\u2019 ways.","Continuing with the specific scenario, once the Pair-Filtering Agent  receives the packet , its primary task is to sort through the lines and fields of information depicted as label , , sorting everything into \u2018good pairs\u2019 discussed earlier. This is one of the reasons that the word \u2018filter\u2019 is used, though it could also be called a Pair Manager Agent, for its role in managing an updated list of \u2018good pairs\u2019 operating in an ad hoc network. One embodiment of how exactly this Agent  sorts information and subsequently stores it is depicted as the \u2018new\u2019 database layout in the lower right of , labeled . This database itself is actually not \u2018new\u2019 only newly described now that we are at this level of granularity. Its initiation was during the previously described chatter sessions whereby the many \u2018good pairs\u2019 were found and recorded. It can be argued that this database more properly should be managed by the Grouping Agent  and that the Pair-Filtering Agent should simply be an agent which operates on the database\u2014which is exactly how this embodiment lays out the Packet Processing Agent  next to be described\u2014OR instead this embodiment posits that this database warrants its management by Agent .","The lay-out of database  is also flexible with one specific embodiment presented, with the fields also limited in the depicted graphic to some mainline actors. The overall structure of  consists of two larger row structures with potential double entry logging for fixed duplex node pairings and a second single entry logging for mobile nodes. The field layout and the ID sorting approach are generically labeled as  and this and subsequent paragraphs walk through these items. The basic concept is that the node shipping in the pung data will become ID1, while all the ID's it contains inside its pung packet will become \u2018possible\u2019 ID2's, after certain checks and filtering occurs. In practice, the filtering done by node  itself, its so-called \u2018don't care\u2019 or \u2018discard\u2019 list, is not perfect and it will very often be sending in ping datum received from nodes not currently within the \u2018good pairs\u2019 database . We can then view Agent 's task as first walking through its newly arrived pung packet and finding the sending node's ID (either the LBR ID and\/or the Agent ID, etc.) in the ID1 field, assuring that the sending node is at least part of one good pairing. We will come back to the case where the sending node's ID is not discovered anywhere in the ID1 field.","Depicted in  is the curved arrow  where in this scenario the pung-sending node's ID has been located in the ID1 field. We can imagine that a total of ten entries are found after the first entry at the end of the arrow , corresponding to the six green arrows of , and four more that are not depicted in  because they may not have received good packets from mobile device  which was the primary subject of that figure. The task of Agent  is now simply to add in the raw ping datum of the pung packet into the raw data fields, labeled as  in the figure. It is generally sufficient to only place the raw data into the fields associated with the pung-sender, but there are also practical reasons that suggest also placing this raw data into the raw data fields of the \u2018transmitting nodes\u2019 as well, labeled as  in the figure. This is a kind of double-entry logging so that any node participating in either a transmit or a receive ping can have access to all recent relevant raw data as purely a function of the ID1 field. Again, though, this is a convenience not a necessity.","Agent  sifts through each entry in the received pung packet, attempting to find \u2018good pair\u2019 matches, indicated by the second and subsequent lines in the database. Here as well, it may find fixed infrastructure node ID's that are not a part of the ID2 field and\/or it may have entries in the ID2 field where it is expecting to see some new raw data but finds none. Both cases are routinely encountered in practice. In both cases, the task of identifying and subsequently doing something about these situations can be negotiated between the Pairing Agent  and the Grouping Agent . In the earlier case where the sending node was not found in the ID1 field, and here in this paragraph's pointing out that sometimes good pairs find no new data and\/or possible new \u2018good pairings\u2019 are showing up, secondary processes can start either in  or  to monitor and change the current good pairing database. Usually, this entails a certain kind of thresholding and consistency checking that was part of the initial chatter calibration earlier described. Those practiced in the art of maintaining real-time databases which log current connections and the need to monitor the \u2018age\u2019 of those good connections, the need to purge entries if they go stale, create new entries if new valid ones are found, should use such practices in the building of database .","Depicted next in  is the curved arrow , indicating that Agent  will also be cycling through all ping datum in the pung packet that belong to mobile devices that were transmitting packets. New mobile device ID's will either be found or not found in the current database  ID2 field. Where found, Agent  provides the raw ping count values into the raw data fields, labeled as ; where not found,  or  may wish to kick off a \u2018is there a new unregistered mobile\u2019 message back to a store's app server for example, or similarly, \u2018we have found a new mobile ID, is your store policy to assume \u2018opt-out\u2019 first\u2019, with the response of \u2018yes\u2019 causing a broadcast to all infrastructure nodes in the store to place the newly discovered mobile ID onto their \u2018discard lists\u2019. Sections on privacy, opt-in, opt-out will all explore these topics further, but the point for the current scenario is that some events will always be happening (good pairings going stale, new good pairs, etc.), and that one of the tasks beyond filtering of either  or  will be to deal with these types of anomalous events by making corresponding updates to database .","The steps through and including label  can together be seen as database look-up and updating operations, keying in on sorting and storing the raw ping datum contained within ongoing floods of pung packets being sent in from deployed fixed-node Agents. Scalability of this capability is the very definition of the process depicted. Agent  is largely tasked with this filtering out of \u2018good pair\u2019 real-time data, with the dispatch of the anomalous situations also included. This is now a good time to introduce the MSO Packet Processing Agent (also labeled as the \u2018Pung Processing\u2019 agent),  and its activities alluded to by the two arrows labeled .","As has been typical of descriptions of the exact operations of various agents heretofore, the precise execution of the MSO Packet Processing Agent  has many variants. Its central task is to transform raw current ping data stored in the raw data field into current slope\/offset information existing between, generally, two fixed nodes in a \u2018good pair\u2019 duplex ping session.  illustrates aspects of an embodiment of this Median Slope Offset approach for transforming raw ping data. This approach comes from our observation that linear regression fitting of lines to sample data is sufficient in some cases to model ping data over time, yet empirical tuning with non-linear methods can provide better results. Depicted is one such \u2018empirically tunable\u2019 approach to finding slopes and offsets of sample distributions that are typical of Tx count v. Rx count plots between two fixed infrastructure nodes. If clocks\/counters were perfectly in synch and counting together (same slope and zero offset between counters), these plots would be very close to y=x lines, offset by distance between nodes. This is stated only to help understand the depicted plot and obviously never happens. Another typical sample distribution is Rx-Tx as a function of either Tx or Rx\u2014which tends to better intuit clock\/counter differences though is largely the same information as Tx v. Rx. The point of  is mainly to explain how \u2018MSO\u2019 (median-slope and offset) functions, where other sections in this disclosure and previous disclosures explain the numerous places where such an operator-on-data can be useful, noise tolerant and tuned.","While linear regression fitting of lines to sample plots is acceptable as well, the MSO approach depicted in  appears to be a bit better in practice (10 to 50 percent error reductions are not uncommon, usually in high distortion environments\u2014read high multi-path and delay-asymmetric instrumentation). Referring to , finding the median offset is essentially the same as finding the median slope, where the slope usually comes first, then the offset is found after subtracting the y=\u2018median slope\u2019*x line from the sample distribution, followed by the same sample splay operation depicted in the lower part of the graphic on the resulting y-values after the subtraction (replacing y\u2032=y\u2212\u2018median slope\u2019*x for the \u2018dy(a,b)\/dx(a,b)\u2019 in the figure, upper right). This is mathematical description of the transformation that agent  applies to clock\/counter data. As noted, other means for fitting the data to a model, such as fitting to a linear model by linear regression, are also possible.","Thus, a function of agent  is to process a given raw data column cell-entry that it is pointed at, by grabbing the last few seconds of Rx\/Tx count values and placing these median slope\/offset results into the adjacent database column. Other agents to be discussed further operate on those \u2018interim solutions\u2019. The \u2018pointing to which entry cell\u2019 is widely variable on how this happens: it can just do a common top to bottom cycling, it can be instructed to go to specific places by Agents  and\/or , or it can just follow its own logic of watching when sufficient raw data conditions are met (thresholds, etc.) in all the raw data entry cells and operate when they are met. Other options are possible as well. Those practiced in real-time updating of raw data feeds into databases structure cells, then transforming such raw data into steady processed results, can recognize the options available for agent .","Turning back to  then, the X-Y-[Z] solutions agent  can now be more properly introduced. [It was labeled  in , with a higher level description earlier]. This agent's function also can have the \u2018generality of approaches\u2019 description exactly as agent  described in the prior paragraph: the details of its implementation are quite flexible. In our current scenario, its primary focus is on the many mobile devices moving about the store and the global need for some agent to process MSO and raw-mobile-Tx data into X-Y-[Z] solutions. Again for a \u2018Tx-only\u2019 example of mobile devices which get located by simply transmitting packets, the task begins by searching the ID2 field for any specific mobile device wishing to be located, indicated generally by line , then noting ALL ID1 fields wherein the ID2 field has that given mobile device, THEN inquiring of either agent  of where all the \u2018good pairs\u2019 involving this new set of ID1 players (effectively trying to piece together the logical situation depicted in  and its associated text). Once the web of  is thus determined, the MSO results are fetched () from the solutions-field of database  and combined with raw ping data in the \u201cmobile as ID2\u201d part of the database (co-indicated by ), ultimately driving the several variants of final X-Y-[Z] solutions described in space time calibration patents incorporated herein, including the descriptions in the multipath oriented disclosures showing how the web-structure of  can be optimally exploited in a multipath-mitigation sense. See, e.g., Ser. No. 13\/187,723 filed Jul. 21, 2011, entitled MULTI-PATH-COMPENSATION METHODS FOR LOCATION-DETERMINATION OF MOBILE DEVICES, and 61\/613,915, filed Mar. 21, 2012, entitled Positioning Systems for Wireless Networks (now filed in non-provisional form as Ser. No. 13\/833,679), which are incorporated herein by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0139"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},"Concluding the discussion of  and of this section then, once given X-Y-[Z] solutions are determined for one or more mobile devices in the store, the solutions Agent  dutifully sends such solution(s)  to the LBR for whatever new flurry of activities this may instigate\u2014. As this disclosure transitions from plumbing-side descriptions of how location of devices is determined to market-side descriptions of tri-quads and location-based-markets, it will quickly be seen that the three lines labeled  are really just small matches which ignite several new and richly adaptable activities all with the end-goal of the far left side of : matching buyers and sellers.","Dynamic Topology and Grouping Agents: Mobile Device Movement, Channel Hopping and Topographic Ooze",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0141"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["350","352"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0144","num":"0142"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["480","480","480","480"]},"If we go back to  now, we see label  in the ID2 column near the bottom of its graphic depiction. This label  is within the \u2018mobile\u2019 section of the database, as depicted on the far left, labeled  well above. The point of label  is to say that much of the rest of  and its accompanying text description is just going on as usual: infrastructure devices in the store are simply sending in their pung packets, non-mobile \u2018good pairs\u2019 doing their normal thing, but as device  moves around the store, we find that the main changes behind the scenes are that now different nodes will be reporting pung packets which have transmissions from mobile device  showing up.","As the solutions Agent , , is asked to make a location determination for , it has access to this last five or ten or twenty seconds of pung data showing up in database . Naturally, the solutions-agent fully expects that different nodes will wind up having 480 show up in the ID2 field over this time period, and previous disclosures have delved into how a singular time-filtered and\/or Kalman-filtered determination of location can fall out from this short time period (e.g., five seconds) of Tx-Rx connections that have occurred between  and any infrastructure nodes. Solutions agent  thus collects all instances of  ping data as identified in the ID2 field and performs these mathematical operations accordingly.","As device  moves from A to B, the main action behind the scenes is that each second by second a changing set of nodes are actually hearing from , but all are still associated with AP  and hence on AP 's Wi-Fi channel. The nodes associated with AP  and on its channel are thus not hearing transmits from  and thus are not showing up in database . Next we turn to what happens when  moves from the part of the store where nodes generally associate with AP  to the part of the store where nodes are associated with AP .","As usual, there are several options for detailed treatment of this situation. Perhaps the easiest and now the most common is when a given mobile device simply goes through its normal \u2018re-association\u2019 process whereby the in-store Wi-Fi service simply figures out that 's signal quality\/strength is obviously and rapidly decreasing for AP , and a quick channel-hop procedure on the mobile device finds that there is a stronger-signal alternative in AP  and its channel. These procedures are well understood in mature Wi-Fi AP deployments and environments such as retail spaces. The most basic way of saying this is: mobile device  just switches over to AP  with the LBR infrastructure having nothing to do with it\u2014it just happens as a normal part of Wi-Fi operations.","For this simplest\/easiest case, then, the primary thing happening behind the scenes in LBR-space is that there is some \u2018coarse\u2019 instant in time where database  no longer finds  showing up in the ID2 field for all nodes associated with AP , and all of the sudden starts seeing  showing up in ID2 fields for nodes associated with AP . At the raw data level, it is as simple as that. It is then EITHER the Solution Agent's job to see that this wholesale switch of ID2 fields has occurred, notifying the Grouping Agent  of this change, OR, the Grouping Agent itself can have a low level process watching for this kind of channel hopping\/AP re-association by monitoring pung packets and making sure its tracked group relationships\u2014at the AP level\u2014are holding firm. Both approaches also can work, a form of redundancy.","However the re-association and channel hopping happens, from the solutions Agent 's perspective, it simply needs to take this switch into account during its calculations and blending together (usually in a Kalman filter way) of past, recently past and very current data into one singular estimate of location. In this case, the \u2018past\u2019 and \u2018recently past\u2019 data has come from AP  associated nodes, with the latest batch of data from -associated nodes. A couple seconds later, a hypothetical D not depicted, most data will now be coming exclusively from -associated nodes. This is a basic problem of solutions-blending across a boundary, where one side of the boundary has a discrete set of data providers and the other side has a different set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0151","num":"0149"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["350","352","350","352","350","352"]},"Returning to  then, we see that three green-circled nodes labeled , associated with AP  exclusively in previous figures, are all now doing this channel\/association switching between AP  and AP . Likewise, four red-circled nodes labeled  are doing the same. Further depicted are the newly-discovered Tx-Rx good connections that would not otherwise be there in the earlier singular-association scenario, with these new good connections labeled  and . As those practiced in GPS location measurement well know, new \u2018diversity\u2019 in solutions far outweighs halving of the raw data averaging, all leading to improvements in Dilution Of Precision (DOP is a term used in GPS literature and appropriate here).","In the case of fixed-node devices which do this routine channel switching, they would of course inform LBR-space of this behavior such that from the Agent Registry , , all the way through to the solutions Agent , , they all know to expect such behavior and exploit its properties accordingly (and mitigate its costs).","Retailers and Their Customers","Those who build, stock and operate retail locations naturally should be the ones who service the customers who are attracted to those locations.","The creation of these physical environments almost always includes a wireless signaling capability, typically wifi. By enabling indoor location capabilities within that signaling infrastructure, described in previous sections, the operators of the signaling network are the de facto initial owners of the location-based query traffic generated within their store (or mall). The primordial request \u2018where am I\u2019 implicitly generated by a customer's phone begets the response \u2018here, at this location in my store\u2019 courtesy of the store owner\/operator. This section continues the description of including more value to the customer beyond the baseline location information.","Retailers have been\u2014literally\u2014facilitating and mediating the relationship between shoppers and competing brands for ages, so the practice will naturally need to co-opt online services and smart phones. In pre-smartphone days not so long ago, a customer requiring assistance and\/or guidance could have their needs met through either employees or through signs, store maps, promotions, etc. In the 2012 era however, a battleground has developed between retailers and \u2018outside interests\u2019 over owning the service relationship mediated through a smartphone\u2014while the customer is in a Retailer's store. Things have gotten so ugly (from the Retailer's perspective) that customers can walk up to a product, look at its displayed price, find a cheaper offering of the identical product on some online service, then buy it from the service, right there in the store, with shipment the same day. \u201cThank you very much Mr. Store, you helped me buy that product and you don't see a dime, oh, and thanks for the chance to help me pick out exactly the thing I was looking for\u201d. It is unclear how such a retailing model can survive if the very idea of investment in a physical environment is not met with return on investment via on-site product purchase.","One of the inventions offers a classic solution to the Retailer's challenge described above. Win the customer's dollars by being the best to serve their needs. Assuming that providing in-store locating capabilities, along with rich and relevant location-tuned services, becomes a normal part of physical shopping over the decade of the 2010's, the ball is in the Retailer's court to optimize those services resulting in captured sales.","Inventions described in this document include systems and associated methods that enable retailers to proactively provide and mediate location services to customers in their store. In 2012 much of the buzz is about setting up location technologies inside a store\u2014then presumably leaving it up to the customer to wade through a cacophony of information spewed at them via their smart phone, based on locations inside a store. In one embodiment of our inventive system, the system enables the Retailer to control the in-store location-query traffic through its service-providing described in previous sections. At this point, the broader power of extensible data structures, such as tri-quads, can be discussed in their more market-transaction form. The Retailer is in a position to retain and enhance its relationship with its customers via this core location-service backbone. (And . . . it does not have to be the specific system described in previous sections alone, any locating capability that the retailer or mall owner sets up becomes a platform for answering much more that the query \u2018where am I\u2019, inherent in such a capability).","In one embodiment, an inventive step starts with the Retailer invoking some level of \u2018opt in\u2019 between themselves and their customers, if even that level is the baseline of the legal right of the store owner to monitor and track RF packet transmissions inside their own store. But the smart Retailers will be much more explicit with their valued customers than this baseline level of \u2018inherent opt in\u2019, they will engage their customers with educational materials, interactive sessions on their smart phones, etc. Value back to the customer will entice that customer to ever higher levels of \u2018opt in\u2019 for the store to provide them with location-relevant services.","On the plumbing side of things, an inventive step involves the de facto standardization of how identity, permission and query-data all begin to get associated with a single customer and their \u2018retail sessions\u2019 or \u2018shopping session\u2019 for lack of a better term. A systematic approach to establishing then populating such syntheses of data is not something that can be hand-waved as some kind of \u2018oh yeah the database takes care of that\u2019 thing. It is complicated, it does not exist in 2012, and it needs to be explicitly created. The state of the art today is associating a customer's entry into a store such as through services like ShopKick offers, then attempting to implement \u2018database associations\u2019 into point-of-sale networks which are indeed quite sophisticated in themselves. This is all a far cry from actively holding the hands of shoppers as they wander through a store. The routine and reliable helping of that customer as they walk through the Retailer's store involves well-designed plumbing level steps, both as previously described and as will be further described in tri-quads and their living, evolving forms.","Yet another inventive step is the crystal clear isolation and servicing of \u2018The Pipe\u2019 of active customers involved in shopping in one's store. In this powerful new system framework, a Retailer can yet again facilitate and mediate a win-win-win relationship between their customers and the brand owners who are populating their shelves.","In 2012, it is a profoundly novel notion that a store can now organize and coherently present actively shopping sales leads\u2014wallets and purses at the ready\u2014to a competitive but highly motivated sea of brand owners bidding to win the responses immediately presented to those shoppers. This generic notion is clearly driving much of the buzz today but the buzz is equally profoundly lacking in the details of how such a notion is implemented. It does not fall out of trees by piping text words into a Google search and splaying results onto a small screen. Coherent packaging of real-time location data packet traffic, managing dedicated cloud agents, Retailer's mediating what is finally sent to the screens of shoppers in their stores . . . this has to be specified, designed, coded, tested and ultimately trialed with real folks in real stores.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0161"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},"Retail Session Management Based on in-Store Location Technologies","A point deserves repetition with different nuanced angles. The Retailer, by establishing \u201cthe indoor GPS\u201d using pop vernacular with emphasis, has earned and must maximize the right to facilitate and mediate how their customers are served by the cloud in their store. The parts of the cloud the Retailer should most care about are the web sites and internet services supplied by their partner brands, those same brands populating their shelves with stuff to buy. In summary, retailers need to harness the cloud, not hate it; this document explains how location technology can form the foundation for this.","The Retailers that will survive and thrive after the next Darwinian churn will be the ones who do not just go out and procure \u2018the best interior positioning technology\u2019, they go out and transform the shopping experience with something that at least this document describes as myShopper, an integrated smart phone application program intimately familiar with the lay-out of the store, the quirks of whatever particular interior location technology is actually deployed (not necessarily the detailed one described in previous sections and previous filings of applicant), and most importantly, practicing the tri-quad-esque arts of this disclosure.","myShopper's heart and soul remains founded on trust, loyalty and retention of the customer, reflected in the plumbing by the permission fields and their storage in various agents and those agents' databases.","myShopper proceeds with establishment of a cloudside companion having two basic attributes: the \u2018loyalty program\u2019 continuous record of each and every customer (including new ones), and a shopping session instantiate companion fired up each time a customer returns to a given store (or store in a chain). (This particular \u2018companion\u2019 further breaks down into finer components as will be described).","myShopper then may, repeat, may, help the Shopper shop! What does this mean? Think Nordstrom's pioneering of the personal shopper concept: were these employees some disheveled technogeeks walking around with clients shoving crass nickel bargains in their faces, heck no. Quite the opposite, they were there to help the shopper cut through the noise and get exactly what they wanted. They embodied the win-win-win scenario where the client wins, the store wins, and the brand that was purchased wins. MyShopper's core job is to be part of the solution not a new problem . . . the observant and friendly assistant, there when you want them and sheltering you from the noise when you don't want them or the noise.","To the shopper, myShopper is just the store's very own, branded GPS on steroids: \u2018hey, hmmm, I can just quickly pull up and see where I am exactly in the store, relative to various stuff of interest to me\u2019. I can choose to use the more advanced features and the \u2018push\u2019 notifications and the turn by turn directions and the shovel-coupons-at-me modes, etc., or it can just be there when I need it, maybe even telling the store to leave me alone until I ask for help (a tri-quad permission state), whatever! I\u2032m in a store, I\u2032m here to buy stuff, help me in the way I want to be helped.","But back to the plumbing angle, myShopper is the exposed tip of the location-based-router(LBR)\/tri-quad iceberg. The very function of the interface between a customer and their smart phone shopping assistant is derived from the behind-the-scenes operation of the system. There is the store you are in, on your phone, a representation of exactly where you are in it, and as you proceed to walk around, your Retailer is eager to serve. The initial setting up of a network that can determine where a customer is, culminates in filtered and relevant offers showing up when requested. Enabling location (a store \u2018being\u2019 the indoor GPS) begets a more technically grounded form of location based services. For the Retailer, the cloud is no longer the enemy, it is the new lower cost-basis sales assistant replete with good metrics on point-of-sale success correlated to promotional service actions. Did the market side offer won by brand X in response to a query from a mobile device in the store generate a sale? These capabilities and many others are ultimately what LBR is enabling, a far cry from being just an indoor positioning technology.","Again, the technical crux of the matter is that the Retailer has invested in their own signaling infrastructure, they are allowing access to this signaling infrastructure to their customers, and they have made the decision to \u2018location enable\u2019 that signaling infrastructure. What this further means is that the retailer has either their own IT department individuals or contracted IT talent setting these systems up and doing the QA on the basic availability of an internet connection for their customers. The established art in such networks is that new customer devices entering a store go through a routine set of steps establishing a communication session with that infrastructure, often including matters of security\/encryption. It is at these simple network layers where the retailer \u2018owns the data packet traffic\u2019. The critical juncture here is then the difference between providing for a simple channel to the generic internet (the cloud), versus the offering up of explicit locating services. The former service has much to do with why Retailers are afraid of the cloud: a customer walks up to a printer and finds a better price online than the one listed on the shelf, pokes the buy button for the online one and leaves the store. The latter location service offered up retains ownership of the session traffic and so long as the Retailer follows the ancient laws of helping their customers rather than exploiting them, we arrive back at some important aspects of this disclosure: own the session, serve the session, make the sale in the store.","The following sections describe tri-quads in an implementation manner, ultimately illustrating how Retailers can \u2018shop out and\/or auction\u2019 query requests and responses as customers walk up and down their aisles\u2014always as regulated by the individual customer as they define their interests and service preferences. The theory here is simple: get the customer exactly what they want, when they want it, as they walk around your store, often co-opting those very \u2018outside interests\u2019 that theretofore were the threat. Let those outside interests\u2014especially the brand owners of the stocked products\u2014help the Retailers move the products.","All of this rests on owning the baseline location-query communication pipe to the user's mobile device. All of this rests on the idea that the question \u2018where am I\u2019 is almost always\u2014especially in a store\u2014connected to a richer form of search and response behavior; Behavior very often ending with cash or a credit card leaving somebody's purse\/wallet. The tri-quad concept and its programming implementation, critically including the regulating opt-in factors as controlled by customers, can enable the oldest retailing religious precept there is: move inventory.","Enter the Tri-Quad: Turning \u2018where am I\u2019 into a Tunable Stream of Location-Based Qualified Queries and Filtered Responses",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0174","num":"0172"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 and 3"},"Referring then to , the middle triangle contains the baseline query which is akin to a GPS receiver continuously asking itself \u2018where am I\u2019. With actual GPS, the timing and message structures of signals from satellites help it to answer its own question. Likewise, a customer with a smartphone who may \u2018opt-in\u2019 to a store's mobile shopper application may instruct their phone to do the same thing: accept location enablement from the store and thereby kick off a continuous process where the phone is effectively asking itself \u2018where am I in this store\u2019. The behind the scenes process of previous sections then go about continuously answering that question.","But it is this very behind-the-scenes answering of the location query which is the raw traffic for richer location-oriented queries. The first recommended technical step in this direction is to obtain explicit and\/or pre-set opt-in from a customer to extend the services provided to them. Smart phone users are already accustomed to an opt-in choice with respect to GPS-enabled location services, the same social convention can be applied to indoor shopping.","One of many examples of how to do this would be when a customer invokes a given store's smartphone application (e.g. Home Depot, or Walmart, or Old Navy, etc.), there is an initially unchecked box labeled \u2018Enable Query Streaming\u2019 there for the customer to check. In the very earliest implementations where such a concept has not yet been socialized, the curious \u2018early adopters\u2019 will undoubtedly first click on the link just below the check box labeled something like \u2018What is Query Streaming\u2019.","The answer they will find after following the link will be a high level, consumer-oriented description about how they are not only requesting in-store navigation maps and location capabilities, but they are allowing much more than this. As a baseline, they will be allowing access to a reasonably up-to-date map of the store replete with helpful product section overlays, on which their own current location can be displayed. But more importantly they will be enabling their location and proximity to items-of-interest to be part of an ongoing stream of latent queries packaged up in tri-quad form. Relative to , by accepting whatever high level description is provided to them concerning \u2018Query Streaming\u2019, they will begin the process of filling out certain information in the \u2018who am I\u2019 quadrant and the \u2018permissions\u2019 quadrant, all ultimately being data field items inside data packets. These events happen after they navigate back to the \u2018home app\u2019 with the check box accepting these services, upon the customer check the box.","Previous sections have already described in detail how the sheer act of setting up locating capabilities establishes the \u2018session backbone\u2019 which then enables the communication and storage (in some registry) of the services thus requested. After checking the \u2018enable query streaming\u2019 box, the extra data fields containing this new information can readily be acknowledged and acted upon by the very same packet-passing mechanisms described variously from  up through and including  (and obviously, their accompanying text).","But it is at this point we must go all the way back to the general situation depicted in . In analogy to a clock, this application has begun by describing the simplest of behaviors of clients\/handsets in the hours 9 to 12 quadrant, concentrating most on how the communication infrastructure nodes of hours quadrant 12 through 3 operate, with a modicum of description of how some of the registry and positioning agents of hours quadrant 3 through 6 behave and instantiate a session-based network servicing those clients of quadrant 9 through 12. These sections here and following are intrinsically saying to co-opt those previously described processes, importantly including the registry operations and storage, and use those same processes for implementing these more advanced location-query capabilities.","So, back to our example of the user checking the \u2018enable query streaming\u2019, a message is thus sent from a user's handset, through the store's own cloud-based service which has already begun servicing their customer, getting to the registry where an association is made between a theretofore fully anonymous handset and whatever data fields the store and their customer have seen fit to provide the registry. A recommended default condition is to remain largely anonymous and, unless explicitly instructed by customers in ways not yet described here but shortly will be, leave the identification fields associated with the handset to very generic data descriptions such as \u2018handset desires baseline query services\u2019 and implicitly has not yet enabled higher level data associations between their handset ID and for example, their male\/female identification, age, name, shopping preferences, etc. All of that is contained in more and more explicit opt-in levels as dictated by the customer.","The following sections begin the process of describing, with technical implementation details, how some of these market-enabling cloud-side agents function. The rudimentary operation of the packet exchanges and regulation of packet traffic by more plumbing-level agents remains a key ingredient to how these higher level agents work\u2014they rely on the dutiful message passing and information-storing operations of these previously described agents.","Your Cloud-Shadow Agents\u2014The Assistants in the Cloud","One of the most simple query-stream enablements that can be allowed by a customer is the setting up of one's own personalized shopping assistants \u2018in the cloud\u2019. The description of myShopper previously indicated how this can actually be two separate but intimately related \u2018threads\u2019 or agent-processes established in state-of-the-art cloud-base CPU's and memory, one thread intimately (securely) interacting with the mobile client app, and the second thread provided by a Retailer which mainly interacts with the first thread.","We now provide implementation detail of one layer deeper on how these two agents fire up after a mobile customer has requested such. From here forth, the agent closely associated with the client device will be referred to simply as the client-agent, and the one representing the retailer's interests will be called the concierge-agent. Without meaning to be too weird, they are the cloud-side equivalents of the shopper and the store's assistant assigned to that single shopper. The customer unequivocally \u2018trusts\u2019 their own client-agent so long as standard encryption protocols have been observed and password protected, and their \u2018trust\u2019 in the concierge-agent is a direct function of their loyalty relationship with the Retailer, itself being a function of past experience and the perceived quality of recent and current service from the Retailer.","We now describe a mechanism for firing up both agents in the cloud. As with smartphone applications such as ShopKick wherein the initial entrance of a shopper into a store triggers generic database activity and \u2018session constructs\u2019 behind the scenes, a generic triggering also happens in this embodiment only here we are explaining how the Retailer prepares to help the shopper shop as they explicitly walk around the store. It is also here where initial associations are made between a shopper's identity and the vast, pre-existing retail management databases, with a significant value add being point-of-sale logging, connecting customers with what they actually buy. This crown jewel remains the same for this embodiment, where herein the idea is to connect a whole bunch more dots (literally, paths through stores and scripts of shopping behaviors) to the primary big dot called sales fulfillment.","The technical underpinnings described in this section get back to the instantiation of the client-agent and the concierge-agent using the LBR packet passing procedures previously described. These agents typically have their own associated databases nearly identical to the RF-active agent processes. See, for example, the management of agents and agent registry depicted in  and accompanying text above.","To provide context for the detailed description of the operation of LBR embodiments, we provide some additional drawings depicting aspects of LBR implementation.  further illustrates the LBR's role in managing agents and interacting with positioning services to get X-Y-Z data and market services from which it gets offers and packages them with the position data.  depicts stages of instantiating an extensible data structure (e.g., TriQuad) corresponding to a mobile device query, and progressively populating it by various agents.  illustrates steps illustrating the initiation of a process of instantiating a session with a mobile device in a venue and establishing corresponding companion agents for the mobile device.  depicts an example of organizing location based queries in a venue into transaction opportunities that market side participants may bid for. It further shows the role of LBR and associated agents in constructing a detailed request by adding additional context to a device's query, and then filtering a response (e.g., detailed request progressively constructed for market side bidding progresses from generic request, to semi specific, and finally to detailed request based on activity of agents that determine opt in permissions, location, preferences, history, loyalty program information, etc.).  depicts a graphical construct in which a market side provider can purchase (or set the conditions for purchase or bidding for) responses to these types of detailed requests within venues in terms of various conditions discerned during a shopping session (such as opt in, correlation of current interest, location, pricing, user intent, history, loyalty program, etc.).  is a diagram further depicting roles of a cloud side companion agent corresponding to a mobile device session in terms of the construction of a fully loaded request to a market for services.  provides another depiction of an extensible data structure which is used to construct a detailed request, submit it for bidding on a market based exchange, and then attach one or more winning responses. All of these various elements and functions are described through detailed examples below.","The Retailer may or may not physically instantiate and facilitate the customer's client-agent, this is up to the client to decide. They may have chosen to use some highly personalized shopping service where they manage their own generic preferences, shopping habits, likes and dislikes, so that when they shop at whatever store they choose, their trusted client-agent goes with them and they expect the store to accept it. Alternatively, especially in \u2018early adopter days\u2019, these types of personalized shopping agent services will not have been established as independent businesses, and so the Retailer offers up \u2018secure\u2019 personalized client-agent services, similar at the philosophical level to the retaining of credit card numbers and other personal details \u2018on their databases\u2019. In lay terms: \u2018We can store and facilitate your client-agent and only you can access the sensitive data\u2019.","The setting up of these two cloud agents becomes a key event for setting up the whole scene for the stream of tri-quads about to happen. The first initial cloud-side sharing of shopper identity and intent with the store happens here. Another lay terminology way to phrase one central piece of this is: \u2018would you like us to walk around the store with you?\u2019 Inherent to this question is in-store location technology of any flavor, not necessarily just the RF ping\/pung approaches extensively described previously by applicant. Any location technology with any level of spatial accuracy granularity sufficient to tune proffered services as a function of location will do. Consumer satisfaction with such technologies (and their cost structures for the Retailers), will separate winners from losers. The main point here gets back to the lay question: \u2018would you like our help walking around the store?\u2019 A \u2018yes\u2019 means the Retailer has permission to \u2018own the session\u2019 and their subsequent quality of service will witness an outcome somewhere between the two poles of a closed sale and a frustrated customer who will never return . . . game on.","The process of subsequent \u2018walking around the store\u2019 gets back to the core of the LBR architectural mechanisms. The two agents have formed specific cross-references to each other via LBR packet exchanges. Jane's client-agent has contacted Nordstrom's concierge-agent and both agents have flipped their \u2018active and running\u2019 flags. Jane's agent informed the concierge agent that, why yes, she would like to be walked around the store. And, today she really does not want to be intruded upon too much so just provide data to indicate location of the mobile device on a store map, highlight where a desired product is on the map. In general, she's only seeking pretty low levels of service. She is tuning the permission fields that will be stored in both agents' databases and will become subsequent data fields in the stream of tri-quads she generates as she paces through the store. Perhaps a bit oddly put, her tri-quad stream becomes the source of the digital and located positions from which her device issued a query that she leaves as she walks around, with her own tuning of who acts upon those queries and how much \u2018service activity\u2019 she wants applied to them.","As Jane interacts with, typically, the Retailer's branded smartphone application and selects the \u2018yes\u2019 button on the box labeled \u2018use our store's GPS\u2019, the act of selecting sends an LBR-formatted packet to the LBR database that the store or one of its IT supplies has set up. This packet instructs the router to pass on the packet to both the client-agent and the concierge agent. Each of these agents cross-references the other agent. These agent's then become \u2018aware\u2019 that the lower plumbing level determination of X-Y-[Z] locations are about to commence if they haven't already. Most of the time, these agents will want to send their own packets to theses lower level position-determining agents, letting them know that they wish to become constant consumers of the spatial solutions that those lower level processes will start to continually stream forth. The preferred embodiment of this invention is that the initial tri-quad instantiations (the literal forming of a tri-quad data structure) be performed by the X-Y-Z collective agents, and minimally populated with realtime, specific data by those agents. The permission fields would typically be very primitive, such as, \u2018I have permission to send these spatial solution packets to the client's personal agent\u2019 and often the related permission \u201cI have permission to send these spatial solution packets to the Retailers anonymous smartphone tracking agent\u2019. It is then up to the client-agent and\/or the concierge-agent to begin to \u2018upgrade or modify\u2019 these primitive permission fields with more detailed permissions relative to what the shopper has input into their smartphone app. This is a simple example of how tri-quads grow and evolve, with various agents in charge of (and permitted to) edit, modify, extend, etc., tri-quad data fields.","Piping Tri-Quads into \u2018Classic\u2019 Search Engines and Query-Response Networks","This section describes the critical fork in the road where the Retailer begins to harness rather than fight \u2018the Cloud\u2019. From the retailer's perspective, the cloud has both positive and negative aspects: the positive aspect enables the retailer to enhance sales and its relationship with brands of products and services offered in its store, the negative aspect is the collective competing service providers (on line retailers, and on-line shopping assistants) seeking to divert sales away from the retailer.","But interact with the cloud the Retailer must. Few Retailers if any at all will want to build a monolithic product data server tuned to just their stores and constantly being maintained to keep up with ever changing inventories, trends, prices, placements, promotions, etc. No way. Having some core server with \u2018some\u2019 of these elements, yes, most notably with current promotional activity, but overall, the Retailer needs the content in the cloud, sub-most-notably and preferably sourced from their Brand partners, those parties most interested in helping them ring cash registers.","We have already introduced the higher level concept that the Retailer wishes to package up and present to the market some reasonably data-populated tri-quads. They also will obviously publish a concurrent inventory of potential \u2018leads\u2019 that are actively shopping in their stores, alerting competing brands of imminent opportunities to help peddle their wares. We now describe an example of an agent responsible for what is really a two-sided-coin task: task one is simply a Retailer-eyes-only raw inventory of smartphones roaming about their store, replete with full knowledge of their permission states, various levels of identification, i.e. all the data items that have already been described; and task two is the filtering and presentation at a very low level of specificity that \u2018leads\u2019 may be imminent for fuller presentment to the market. The reader can immediately appreciate that the sheer \u2018public\u2019 or even \u2018private but large\u2019 presentment of an inventory of active shoppers presents an enormous double edged sword to the Retailer, where on the one hand the Retailer's intent is to fetch the best content possible in order to help their customer, but on the other hand do not want to give away too much information to their own competitors (including the competing service providers from the negative cloud aspect) about the realtime numbers and habits of their all-important customers. This not-so-subtle point highlights yet another innovative requirement for any interior positioning system which streams third-party content to in-store shoppers: a strict and well-managed balance, in the forms of filters and data fields, is essential between too much information (and having one's competitors exploit your own system) and not enough information resulting in garbage coming back to one's in-store customers. The LBR architecture and the highly tunable tri-quad data structures are precisely the kinds of flexibility needed to implement such a balancing act.","Back to the details of \u2018presentment\u2019 of tri-quads to \u2018the market\u2019, the description thus far in the last few sections has outlined activities by and large occurring with the so-called firewall of the Retailer. A low detail level and highly filtered inventory of possible leads being \u2018published\u2019 has been touched upon. The drum roll begins as shoppers shop. The seeds of what the Retailer ultimately presents to the third-party cloud is contained in the client-agent\/concierge-agent pair. The negotiations that happened in the past, where the shopper either\/both has a long term profile on their preferences and general interests that helped populate data fields in each of these clients, and\/or, the shopper pro-actively modified at the instantiation of their current shopping session, usually if not always through the store's branded in-store smartphone app. The client-concierge agent pair then operate on this information, producing what ultimately will become the prescription for exactly what data is going to be contained in the presented tri-quads to the full cloud market. The extremes are the obvious ones: no presented tri-quads for this shopper ever, to \u2018throw every coupon in the book at me, my name is Jane, I make this much a year, and I\u2032m here to buy\u2019. Again, exaggerated extremes to make a general point. The specific point is that it is ultimately these two agent's cooperative job to first set then continue to tune the specific tri-quad data that eventually gets presented to certainly \u2018classic\u2019 search engines, but more importantly to query-response networks that are starting to, and will certainly evolve strongly toward, hone in on the in-store shopper and the servicing of their needs.","Thus, the \u2018piping to\u2019 of this section's title is essentially this queuing up and presentment of what eventually becomes streams of tri-quads from some carefully filtered list of active shoppers. One can easily envision\u2014and this disclosure explicitly here outlines\u2014a graphic agent assigned to making this inventory and presentment quite intuitive and natural. The Retailer has one inside-the-firewall view of its own active customer, with then a highly filtered and tri-quad-data-tuned version for the marketplace's consumption. The graphic agent can quite easily implement clickable metadata viewing of the active shoppers, again with inside-outside the firewall filtering. This graphic agent might present such realtime data for a variety of audiences: Retail Managers, IT proessionals, Service Assistants on the inside of the firewall; Brand owners, customer analytic engines, consumer service businesses on the outside of the firewall. This listing is short and exemplary and by no means exhaustive.","This section outlined how tri-quads can be packaged up and \u2018piped into\u2019 third party cloud processes, further sections will explain what can happen at those cloud-side destinations and how \u2018results\u2019 can eventually come back through the Retailer and ultimately to the shopper.","Shopping Session State and the Raw Tri-Quad Stream","This section explains further some of the various filtering mechanisms that can be applied to a shopping session once a given shopper has decided to opt in to a Retailer's location services, into their \u2018indoor GPS\u2019. The grounding of this discussion begins with a continued description of how the instantiated client-agent and concierge-agent, kicked off once a shopper has opted in, represent a classic state machine where in the case of providing mobile services, that state machine now will be moving around the floor of a virtual store as the shopper themselves move around the physical store. These two agents become the virtual shoppers, and as mentioned, one of their main shared tasks will be managing the relationship between the intent of the shopper and the bewildering cacophony of latent ads, promotions, glitter and gold-dust poised to be thrust at that shopper. Almost all shoppers do not want the cacophony, they just want to buy what they are looking for.","After the shopper has entered a store and opted in to \u2018the store's GPS\u2019 (or alternatively opted in to the proffered \u2018would you like us to walk around the store with you and assist\u2019; again, this disclosure highlights that the lay public really doesn't distinguish technical subtelties such as \u2018hey people, this really isn't GPS\u2019; tell that to Kleenex users reaching for a Sysco tissue!), the LBR mediated message packet sent to the Client-agent and the Concierge-agent have of course created a new database entry representing the initial \u2018state\u2019 of this shopper's opt in or initiation event. Clear cloud-side flurry activities that should be associated with this shopping session instantiation should be the most obvious first step: correlate this particular shopper with any information available on the Retailer's databases. Is this person a loyalty shopper with an existing ID? In most cases they will be. Other less obvious cloud-side flurry events should involve the refinement of the permission fields that will eventually be placed into both internal-firewall tri-quads as well as marketplace presented tri-quads. These \u2018flurries\u2019 are merely LBR-formatted packet exchanges between LBR agents and the existing databases maintained by the Retailer.","It is at this shopping session initiation point where other classic security protocols, privacy management and realtime interaction protocols are also established. This last phrase means that some form of communication interaction between the customer's smartphone and the Retailer's service can generically be specified at session initiation. An example would be that a shopper may pro-actively request aisle by aisle directions right away, where upon both the store and the shopper's smartphone are effectively agreeing to have second-by-second packet interchanges facilitating this realtime tracking, especially if the specific underlying locating methods call out for such constant communications (others, such as RF (wi fi Access Point signal) fingerprinting\/Received Signal Strength methods, may not, though the price paid is usually spatial resolution of knowing where on is at).","As mentioned earlier, a shopper's personalized client-agent, privy to that shopper's more private intentions, likes, preferences and whatnot, needs to \u2018negotiate\u2019 with the Retailer's concierge agent on what exactly is going to be allowed to happen in the upcoming shopping session. The customer might easily say \u2018same as the last 20 times\u2019 either explicitly or implicitly (be having default settings they created the very first time they opted in to the store's GPS). This negotiation can be as simple as a translation of human choices selected by the customer through their smartphone interface, to being as complicated as a generic permission from the customer for the store to \u2018analyze my last 20 shopping sessions and by all means serve up to me offers which you think I will be most interested in\u201d. Again, this is phrased as an English \u2018command\u2019 where those practiced in the arts of database management can readily see that this involves a series of cross-correlations often reaching out to several databases, all with the intent of fulfilling what the customer is expecting. The results of these cross-correlations begin to be stored in the ever-growing query-field database entries within both the client-agents and the concierge-agents for this particular shopping session. So not only are permission fields of tri-quads starting to populate data entries in these two agents, but query-field data as well.","At this point in the description we are still at the agent-instantiation point and we see that these flurries can be quite involved. All of this happens in the blink of an eye of course. The other \u2018process\u2019 that of course now begins to fire up is the core process of locating the customer! Whether it is the RF-packet based location methods outlined in immediately prior sections or not, the opting in of a customer into using the store's GPS obviously kicks off this creation process of the X-Y-[Z] raw values themselves (this can, in particular, be a result of opting in to a store's wi fi service, which also provides opt in to using the mobile device location, as determined by the wi-fi packets or other means accessible via the mobile device's location Application Programming Interface). This disclosure then states emphatically: These raw location datum can immediately be much more\u2014they can be minimally populated tri-quad structures instead, being populated by certainly the core X-Y-[Z] values but also with ever-changeable metadata fields as mediated by the client- and concierge-agents. To be very specific, instead of a location service just cranking out position data, that service produces tri-quads instead, with typical rates being one per second. Going back to the graphic-agents discussed above, one might imagine that the realtime floor-displayed dots on the store's floor plans depicted on the display screen of the mobile device now \u2018blink\u2019 once per second almost like a heartbeat. The blink would intuitively represent a newly minted tri-quad associated with a particular shopper, almost always having new X-Y-[Z] updates as they move around, and often having changes to the surrounding metadata fields as they proceed with their shopping, e.g., they just pushed a button that they want to comparison shop the four brands of dog food sitting right in front of them whereby tri-quad n\u22121 had no such indication in the query field, but tri-quad n now does have such an indication. The tri-quads are now a raw stream of query events inherently being produced by all shoppers who have opted into the store's GPS.","That transition from \u2018initiation\u2019 to \u2018now shopping\u2019 is reflected by the heartbeat of the raw spatial solutions firing up, producing tri-quad structures in the process, then populated by the client and concierge agents as defined by the initiation negotiation. A properly designed myShopper user interface will obviously include both high level menu choices as well as buried \u2018preferences\u2019 choices whereby the shopper can alter the client-concierge interactions at any time during their shopping session. A simple example here is that the shopper may have chosen to be amenable to seeing advertisements and offers as they start to shop, then after a few dozen poorly targeted advertisements and promotions show up, they realize most of it is garbage and they do a quick tuning of their settings. These coarser time scale events (as compared to the once per second X-Y-[Z] heartbeat) are the maintenance and constant updating of \u2018state\u2019 in the agents. A reflection of this cloud-side state can of course be communicated to the customer's smartphone itself, such that the User Interface (UI) of the smartphone can always be aware of the state of the cloud agents, often for the purpose of display to, audio presentation to, or change by the customer. So the overall \u2018shopping state\u2019 can be represented in numerous locations, often with pro-active communications going on between those locations so that the singular overall state for that shopper is kept synchronized and mutually up to date. So long as not too many agents are in the cloud all trying to service this one particular shopper, the bandwidth of these communications should be manageable. In cases where hundreds and thousands of shoppers are expected to start inundating some store, all expecting myShopper services, then backbone data traffic issues become a \u2018good problem\u2019 to have, where one of the core LBR innovations is then the replicability and arbitrary scalability of agents, including multiple cloudside instances of one particular type of agent. The store's specific data bandwidth backbone then needs to concentrate only on the AP to client smartphone traffic, largely driven by each smartphone's interactivity with their client-agents. For example, one shopper may be constantly interacting with their UI and always explicitly changing their interests and intentions, while others may do very little of that. The former will represent a higher draw on the store's baseline wifi packet traffic, while the later will represent very little. The cloud-side cross-agent flurries can all happen cloud-side, as it were, not impacting the Retailer's in-store IT systems.","Competition: Market-Making Agents, Information Brokers and Virtual Real Estate","The descriptions of the creation of raw streams of tri-quads, along with the descriptions of how such streams can be viewed both inside a firewall or their filtered versions presented to a third-party world outside of a firewall, all set the stage for the simple question \u2018so what?\u2019. This section answers one aspect of that question.","Well before the time when Google dominated the search universe, becoming the Kleenex of search as it were, back when there was a simpler need for many technology developers to at least agree on some core functional elements of data exchange between arbitrary parties, a variety of well-known ad hoc and eventually de jure standards were developed all for the purpose of growing a global capability and industry now represented by that heavily overloaded term \u2018the Internet\u2019. That's a mouthful, but the Kindergarten issue that this section wishes to explore and describe is that for this barely visible new industry (in 2012, anyhow), let's call it \u2018smartphone assisted shopping\u2019 for lack of a more elegant phrase, ad hoc \u2018standards\u2019 are the natural starting point for first building functionality, later to be followed by sink-or-swim usage and then IF \u2018swim\u2019 becomes the case, i.e. it is succeeding in the marketplace, de jure standards follow in the wake.","The raw tri-quads behind the Retailer firewalls and the filtered tri-quads presented by the Retailers to \u2018the cloud\u2019 are a simple and humble step in that standardization direction. It has to start somewhere. No doubt as more entities begin to eye then enter the indoor positioning and services market, they will develop the core notions of tri-quads using familiar earlier non-location-specific programming constructs, this is absolutely inevitable. As such, X-Y-[Z]information, and specifically the time-evolution of X-Y-[Z] as a shopper moves around a store, become a new exotic data field in both the packets and the databases of the tried-and-true baseline Internet and now \u2018Mobile\u2019 technical infrastructures.","This disclosure argues through design principles, however, with only 2030 hindsight as the ultimate arbitrator and judge, that the heartbeat-like production of X-Y-[Z] solutions emplaced in what is quite literally the mimicked virtual real estate of a store, becomes a new animal in the internet\/mobile infrastructure zoo. Yes, XML packaging constructs should be used, realtime service requests from smartphone users with interrupt driven cloud-side service engines responding to those requests should be used, this list of existing technology is as big and complicated as today's mobile\/internet merged industries. But the core point remains that this new animal has new dietary needs as well, should be recognized as a new animal, and maybe someday it will garner its own whole zoo section just like the primates and the reptiles do, once the wild families and genera of indoor GPS services are further fleshed out and implemented.","Enter the picture now what this disclosure will refer to as market-making agents, information brokers and the generic notion of virtual real estate, with the m\u00e9lange of these things trying to evolve the quaint settlement of geo-fencing one-story homes to the Manhattan of unfathomable interconnected commerce. How can the LBR architecture, the tri-quad corpuscles and the already crowded cage of agents start to spark this rather ambitious transformation?","For starters, the primordial elements of commerce still contain the critical notions of scalability as well as arbitrary third party interaction. Trust levels, marketable entities, matching buyers with sellers, how long could this sentence go on? Some of the deeper motivations behind the somewhat labored introduction of LBR, tri-quads and agents might be better appreciated as we ponder what a fuller indoor shopping Manhattan should look like. \u2018Ownership\u2019 has to force its way to the core topic of this section that keys in of these deeply cultural notions. Who owns the virtual real estate, who is allowed to build markets in and\/or around that real estate, how complicated will that market become? This disclosure's answer so far, expressed in LBR\/Tri-quad\/Agent terms is: as far as the mobile industry has come in just a short decade, open that whole world up to fully serviced physical commerce and get ready for, and most importantly facilitate, some crazier-still chapters ahead. Let's start by looking at what some simple agents might entail.","Market-Making and the Market-Making-Agent","This section introduces the Market-Making-Agent along with clear extensions of the core approach. This agent and related ones aim to cut to the bone of the challenge facing Retailers encapsulated in the \u2018harness\u2019 versus \u2018hate\u2019 commentary relative to a Retailer co-opting those vast Internet resources rather than being killed by them. Retailers such as Target, J.C. Penney and Saks Fifth Avenue are jumping on the free wifi bandwagon in late 2012. They are following other Retailers such as Macy's and Sam's Club, who themselves were later to the free wifi game than Nordstrom. What is the presumed (and verifiable if executives at these stores are to be believed) force behind allowing their customers access to the big devil in the cloud?: increased sales, what else. Apparently current studies are showing that customers who are provided high quality internet connections for their personal devices have meaningfully higher likelihoods of making a purchase. This despite the \u2018showrooming\u2019 problem as it has been termed, the earlier discussed phenomena where shoppers find better prices for an item on-line and simply purchase it from an online supplier instead of from the store.","So the investments are being made into the Retailer's own signaling environment. The proffering up of internet access to customers is happening. And as with Macy's very recently, the technically inaccurate \u201coffering interior GPS\u201d is also starting to happen, much as \u02dc5 year ago early filings predicted and described. The next step needs to be taken whereby a Retailer walks that fine line between servicing their in-store customers and trying to \u2018hoard\u2019 or \u2018walled garden\u2019 service their needs (all quite understandable, hugely expensive and very often resulting in poor service), versus packaging their customers' needs up into filtered marketplace triquads and letting the Internet marketplace have at them, may the highest bidder win the Goodies response to their customers.","These are fine high level marketing concepts, but they are steeped in challenging technical and business problems to implement.","Enter the market-making-agent as either a Retailer-controlled packet processing agent, or, more preferred, a trusted third party company specializing in matching sellers of \u2018live\u2019 prospects to brand owner buyers of those prospects. Possibly the most important business role this agent plays is the active filtering and obfuscation of competitively-sensitive data necessarily disclosed by the Retailer (how many shoppers, exactly, are in aisle 7 right now, talk about the family jewels), vis a vis the many brand owners (as well as competitors of a given Retailer) who necessarily need to know something about the quantity of sales prospects and the success rates of fulfilled sales based on what they have paid for (or plan to pay for) goodies-wise.","This description above is deliberately at a business level not a technical one. The technical point is, there needs to be some kind of trusted service buffering the presentment of tri-quads, along with their valuable gross and fine statistical information associated with dozens if not hundreds of active shoppers, to the eager bidders for servicing those triquads and attaching bid-won Goodies to them.","Again, the preferred approach is for a Retailer to find and contract with a third party who specializes in this activity, hence the old phrase \u2018market making\u2019 is used for the agent. As with all examples of market making in the past, of all types and flavors, challenges abound in the best way to set up markets, have them operate efficiently, monitor them for \u2018cheating\u2019 and internal\/external corruption, secure them at least at the transactional level, etc. and so forth. All these challenges remain in setting up a market-making-agent using LBR\/triquad principles, but the hope is that the LBR\/triquad approach is possibly the most robust possible in terms of dealing with these 100% expected real market challenges. The reason why a \u2018third party\u2019 entity is preferred in this invention is itself a function of competition: certain companies will become better and more trusted at providing these buyer-seller-matching services, and may the most excellent companies win, there is not too much more reason that this is the preferred approach than that. A second reason is of course that the Retailer should be aimed at servicing their customers, not at becoming an expert in millions-of-transactions-per-second market-making software operating in the cloud.","Previous sections have explained how shoppers walking around a Retailer's store produce a stream of individualized triquads unique to each shopper. The client-agent and the concierge agent are cooperatively managing this stream. As explained, some of these triquad streams will explicitly NOT want anything to do with the outside-the-firewall internet, as decided by the customer\/shopper. These triquads may never have a need for a \u2018marker-maker\u2019 attaching unsolicited goodies. Perhaps the Retailer just accesses a \u2018walled garden\u2019 promotion agent inside their own firewall and just serves up location-specific coupons or whatnot. This will no doubt become a highly nuanced art and business.","But other \u2018permission states\u2019 chosen by individual shoppers will effectively \u2018bring on the Goodies\u2019 market activity. The Retailer is now in the position to control the presentment of those tri-quad streams to the market.","The setting up of market-making-agents deserves some attention. The first obvious step is for a Retailer to make the business decision to either set up their own home-grown service or to choose a preferred supplier of such, then enter some kind of annual contract with such a service. Whether built internally (by IT departments or captured-IT-services), or whether implemented by a third party, basic rules need to be established on how the extreme details of tri-quad information, their sheer numbers, and the quality control on their flow and response is handled. These negotiated business rules become a guiding technical matter for how the internal registries of market-making agents will be initially populated, maintained, modified and very importantly, deleted as dictated by all these business rules. Example business terms, stated as business instructions from a Retailer to a Market-Maker might include: maintain and publish to successful bidders only the daily totals of shoppers who received Goodies packet  through N along with specific fulfilled sales percentages, then send back to us that the successful bidder acknowledged receipt of this report. There will be dozens if not hundreds of more nuanced business rules than this one humble example, but the point of this paragraph is that such instructions need to be translated into the operative registries of the market-making-agent, generally following standard LBR-packet protocols described extensively already.","Once the basic relationship between a Retailer's concierge agent and a market-making agent has been thus established, the same initiation and population of data fields has to happen on the buyer-side of the market. As per  of this disclosure, we come back to the \u2018flip-flop\u2019 notion presented in that figure whereby even though it \u2018looks\u2019 like the shoppers are the buyers and the Stores are the sellers, by the time a shoppers triquads show up at a market-maker, it is indeed the shopper\/Retailer combination that are now \u2018selling a qualified sales lead request\u2019 (the appropriately populated triquad) to the buyers wishing to own the servicing of the request. Not to put too fine a point on it: Google customers \u2018buy\u2019 the rights to steer presented results to Google-search-initiators, where those initiators are the \u2018sellers\u2019 of their \u2018qualified request\u2019; the same philosophical deal happens as the shopper walks around the store with the inherent \u2018sale\u2019 of their qualified requests. And as with Google searches, the customer will be the ultimate arbiter on who wins and who loses in terms of best serving their needs, where in a physical store setting the final purchase of a product is the immediate answer to who has won and who hasn't. In this profound sense, one of the oldest advertising problems in the book is hugely mitigated in that direct spend-and-measure economic loops, inside stores and within a specific shopping session, become possible.","The setting up of a relationship between brand owners wanting to purchase vast batches of \u2018statistical buys\u2019 against very finely tuned demographics also deserves some attention. The level of attention that brand owners will eventually put toward this area is radically beyond the capabilities of this disclosure to even attempt to describe, so we must do with describing the basic plumbing steps needed to facilitate what will obviously become a complicated market. An emphasis on this point is needed as well: this whole disclosure revolves around \u2018location\u201d, and inherently then \u2018paths in time\u2019, so these buyers must start tuning their business thinking well beyond \u2018text keywords\u2019 in the Google search paradigm. Alpo's marketing team and their advertiser team-mates now need to outsmart Purina's like team, thinking through the psychology of the in-store sell and how the demographics of their customers affect the exact criteria whereby they \u2018buy the rights\u2019 to attaching Goodies to shoppers at Retailer X, store Y and Chain Z. Geo-fencing constructs overlaid on store maps is certainly a starting point, but dynamism of shopping and overlays of shopper intent mixed with permissions become, again, the life blood of what is being purchased by the brand owners. Which batches of tri-quads will they bid on and which will they pass on.","Thus, this same \u2018setting up\u2019 of a relationship between the market-making agent and the brand buyers is a process of contacting the market-making agent through LBR-packet protocols. Only from the buy-side, new fields are generated in the market-making agent on the buy-side of the market, expressing intent of purchase in much more complicated ways that \u2018these many shares are no more than such-n-such a price\u2019 (a common stock-market example). Graphic and Map-making agents may come into play here, but more typical of \u2018batch purchases\u2019 will be higher level criteria on \u2018distance from my product\u2019 not needing too specific store-to-store differences in physical lay-outs or the need for buyers to become map and GIS experts in the process. Again, the complexity of these matters will be ludicrously more than this disclosure might attempt to describe, the plumbing level point is that just as the sell-side criteria for tri-quads to the market involved setting up registry fields inside the market-making agent, so does the buy-side initiation kick off creation of market-maker relationship identity fields, state fields, buy-order fields and the like. Inventor's view is that once the \u2018virtual real estate\u2019 angle and its GIS\/Geofence overlay is applied to the buy-side of a market-maker, complexity and evolution will be the new rule not an exception. And the smart virtual real estate buyers will of course become the new winners.","The realtime operation of the market-maker is also simple in its plumbing but downright expected to be complicated in the nuanced interactions of matching buyers and sellers (brand owners or others being buyers, Retailer triquad suppliers as the sellers). The plumbing simplicity is that Retailers send LBR-packets loaded with \u2018as best as possible filled-out triquads to the Market-Maker-Agent, that Agent then accesses its vast list of buyers and does its magic (its proprietary buy-sell matching algorithms) and determines the best bid for either each and every triquad packet, or, some batch of triquads with a \u2018counter\u2019 which attempts to count up until a given batch size has been met. The simplicity of this description is emphatic. Its complexity will be a function of how precisely a Market-Making-Agent decides to implement the matching, where bits and pieces of this disclosure and previous disclosures have provided \u2018recommended practices\u2019, certainly as mediated by now well-known geo-fencing constructs.","Evolution of a Tri-Quad from when a Customer Enters a Store to Post-Market-Maker-Processed Purchases","Much of the invention description contained in the last many sections has centered around the various agents and their interactions as mediated by an LBR core agent and packet-exchanges. This section takes an orthogonal view form this previous \u2018who's doing the work\u2019 to more of a \u2018what does the work look like along the way\u2019. This section will follow an exemplary case of a customer\/shopper getting out of their car outside of a store, all the way through to purchasing some small set of products\u2014some of which they intended to buy and others closer to impulse purchases but with an important twist to the classic notion of \u2018impulse purchases\u2019. One might imagine this whole section as describing one example of how a shopper's triquad stream initiates and evolves in the virtual real estate of the LBR cloud, driven by the physical path of the shopper as they walk through the physical store.","Following the triquad format set out in , that archetypical format is first repeated verbatim:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0225","num":"0223"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"TriQuad_ID = TriQuadStruct{"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"who"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},".data"]},{"entry":[{},".links"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"search"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},".data"]},{"entry":[{},".links"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"permissions"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},".data"]},{"entry":[{},".links"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"where"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},".data"]},{"entry":[{},".links"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"LBR"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},".data"]},{"entry":[{},".links"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Modern programming practices (e.g. XML, JSON, etc.) will of course utilize very particular programming constructs rather than this didactic form of the classic data structure.

This absolutely includes the very photons reflected off a shopper generated by the store's lighting and picked up by a store's cameras, itself a very active technical approach to \u2018locating\u2019 shoppers at some level of granularity. Likewise, any store which has devices transmitting \u2018public domain\u2019 signals can have those signals received by a shopper's own personal device, with a variety of technological approaches to locating themselves to a granularity finer than just \u2018inside the store\u2019, and thus a shopper's device can also create this basic form of populated triquad, with the who.data.Shopper field replaced by who.data.Store=\u2018Macy's\u2019. Of course, several steps need to occur before this baseline triquad can even be produced, but highlighting this lowest level form here was felt to be appropriate for setting up the ensuing vignette. In short: the raw location technology approach is immediately up-leveled to become a latent location-based query by wrapping location solutions inside a TriQuadStruct. Whereas much of this disclosure has concentrated on how a Retailer implements the processes which tee up and \u2018fill with X-Y-[Z] solutions\u2019 these triquads, we can see that a customer's local device (i.e. a smartphone, ipad, etc.) can also be the processing unit which forms a triquad each and every time it calculates a location for itself.","The natural starting point for the vignette of a customer departing their car then entering the store will center on the customer's device of choice sensing that the store is broadcasting the availability of a communication link, most often wifi. This vignette will follow the track where this particular customer is already an opted-in member of a \u2018loyalty program\u2019 with the Retailer whose store they are entering. They also have downloaded that Retailer's branded device \u2018app\u2019, an app which in the past has not offered them \u2018in-store GPS\u2019, but now when they walk into the store this time, the latest version of the Retailer's application includes this new feature and the very first thing the customer is asked, via that Retailer's app, is effectively \u201cwould you like to try the new indoor GPS\u201d, click here if so. This disclosure has already described how critical permissions get negotiated and invoked at this point. Here we will look deeper at what exactly is being done at the client-agent and concierge agent so that they can begin to set up the tri-quad stream for this new shopping session for an established customer.","So the customer begins to walk toward the store entrance and their device, in this case a smartphone, picks up the wifi availability of the store, associates with that wifi, and automatically kicks off the Retailer's branded app on that smartphone, resulting in the typical screen showing up on the smartphone welcoming the person to the store. Behind the scenes during this process, now that the store has decided to set up \u2018GPS on steroids\u2019 as the employees of the store like to call it, additional steps have occurred. During the step where the customer's smartphone sensed the store's wifi and requested association with that wifi, whereupon the store accepted that association and via MAC address identification or other such identification method determined that this device belongs to a \u2018loyalty customer\u2019 with a database entry associated with that existing customer, there is the additional step that a call is made to the main LBR network that the store has also set up via practices described earlier essentially indicating to the LBR network that there is now a new RF-active agent showing up that may or may not wish to be directly serviced via LBR activities (the \u2018GPS on steroids\u2019). Thus at the most baseline level, now that the store has set up for interior positioning services, that servicing network needs to be at lease alerted that a new RF-active agent has shown up on the premises and due to the \u2018opt-in\u2019 agreement that said customer signed up for many shopping sessions before, the \u2018permission state\u2019 initially associated with that new customer smartphone is upgraded from \u2018unknown\u2019 to \u2018basic loyalty customer agreement\u2019. In other words, somewhere along the line the Retailer has built in some form of explicit opt-in between that customer and themselves, which may or may not include the explicit permission to \u2018track\u2019 that customer in their store. By referencing the previous loyalty agreement, a baseline permission state is referencing whatever any given Retailer has already procured. This permission state is recorded in the appropriate LBR agent and registry, as chosen by the Retailer to either be fully controlled by the Retailer or administered by some third party, but in both cases fully behind so-called firewalls. This is clearly proprietarily sensitive information and should follow all appropriate security protocols accordingly.","The Retailer, by setting up an LBR network in the first place, has also set up a procedure of promotion for that \u201cindoor GPS\u201d service. One way or another their customers need to hear about this new service and how they can play with it if they want to. In the vignette here, the Retailer has set up a concierge agent with an associated registry and database. Generally speaking this is fully separate from the loyalty customer database they are already accustomed to, but a deeper relationship between the two can certainly be formed, e.g., the same supplier of the hardware and software basis for the loyalty data services can also supply the LBR services and these new concierge agent services, and certain aspects of the loyalty customer database can become \u2018mapped fields\u2019 into the concierge agent. This is an early example of what is referred to as \u2018links\u2019 wherein data may not necessarily be copied from one database to another, but, a simple link to that data is recorded in one database pointing to data in the other. As these link connections get further described, it will become clear that not only are links an economical tool but they also play a key role in security of information and the gating of which agents can have access to what information.","So back to the vignette, once the store recognizes the customer and has made the proper loyalty program associations, there is now an active agent registry entry of this particular shopper inside the store's concierge agent, with an initial \u2018state\u2019 entry of \u2018pending opt-in verification\u2019 or something to that effect. \u2018LBS opt-in status needed\u2019 might be an even more pro-active state, indicating that the concierge agent needs to search its own records or re-contact the loyalty database to inquire if this particular customer has been presented with the option to opt-in to the interior GPS capability. A branching of options occur at this juncture but nothing too complicated, e.g.: the concierge agent may find that this customer has never before been offered this service and the concierge then initiates a communication with the customer to alert them to its presence and follow whatever promotional sequence the Retailer has laid out, all with the design of convincing the customer to \u2018opt-in\u2019 to the service and probably to \u2018bias them\u2019 toward broader levels of permissions, harkening explanations in this disclosure on the various levels of permissions that are possible; the concierge agent may also find the opposite case, not only has this customer opted-in to whatever level of interior LBS services they may have chosen, but they have permitted a recurring population of their permission fields to \u2018go live\u2019 every time they walk into the Retailer's store. These permission states may be located at the loyalty database or may be in a separate longer-term storage at the concierge agent. Another branch is that a given customer has been offered interior positioning services in the past yet they declined, and the concierge may then be programmed to \u2018try again\u2019 and still ask the customer if they wish to reconsider. At the end of the day, all of these branching activities have at least one common goal which is to establish that, at least for the initiation of this particular customer's shopping session right now, what is the initial \u2018who\u2019 and \u2018permission\u2019 field data that will be stored inside the concierge agent as that customer begins their shopping session. The general goal is to fill these fields out as much as one can, all as regulated by the explicit opt-in interactions with the customer. So the vignette now witnesses the concierge agent creating new data fields in its database associated with this customer and filled in with the best possible \u2018who\u2019 and \u2018permissions\u2019 fields that will eventually go into the stream of tri-quads associated with this shopper. One might think of it as a cast for the ensuing tri-quad stamper, stamped out every time an X-Y-[Z] solution will be generated as the shopper begins to shop.","So a newly evolved virtual tri-quad, stored in the concierge agent for starters, might look like:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0234","num":"0232"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"FutureInstance = TriQuadStruct{"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"who"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},".data"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Shopper = \u2018Loyalty XYZ123\u2019;"]},{"entry":[{},"Age Range = 30-40;

Notice that this last example of a populated TriQuad has the word \u2018FutureInstance\u2019, where this is meant to clearly show that these fields are being set up inside the concierge agent's registry and database fields, and are not yet \u2018live tri-quads\u2019 as it were. As X-Y-[Z] solutions begin to fire up and start streaming, the tri-quads actually formed in these streams will access this stored information and become part of populated tri-quad data packets later.","Further rich branching of options can occur at this point in the vignette but for explanatory and \u2018initiation\u2019 purposes, we will concentrate on the case where a given customer has not yet been exposed to the full indoor-LBS opt-in choices, and now need to be so exposed.","Enter to the vignette, then, the client agent. As the concierge agent initiates the Retailer-directed promotion session with the customer, the concierge agent contacts the client-agent (with the litany of choices on where that agent physically lives and operates) and indicates that a loyalty customer has entered the store and that the client agent so instantiate a shopping instance for this customer and begin its own search for \u2018past sessions\u2019 or \u2018past permissions\u2019 based on at least the information contained in the tri-quad fields listed above \u2018FutureInstance\u2019.","In this vignette, the client agent finds no previous opt-in in its records, thus it responds to the concierge agent that it found no previous record but that it has dutifully entered a new active shopper in its registry, along with baseline populated data fields.","An important two-branch point comes here in further describing what the combination of the concierge agent and the client agent do next. Branch one involves a client agent which is designed and operated by the Retailer, and branch two involves a client agent which is completely \u2018third party\u2019 relative to the Retailer's concierge agent. This disclosure presumes that one over the other implementation is \u2018preferred\u2019 but instead wishes to state that both branches should be supported, where the marketplace will ultimately determine some ratio of preference between one and the other approach.","The option branch which posits that the client-agent is provided by the Retailer is the simpler case. Best practices might be to have such an agent be closely related to the loyalty programs and databases already in place surrounding repeat customers and the highly developed prior art. To the extent customers already trust a Retailer enough to keep their credit card on file and\/or details about who they are, what they have bought in the past, their implicit and explicit product preferences, etc., they will often be willing to trust that Retailer to perform detailed tracking of their shopping, shopping path histories, realtime serving of their location-tuned requests to the broader internet, etc. The client-agent in this case is an instantiated process in the LBR network which becomes assigned to that individual shopper for that individual shopping session, generally privy to all information that a customer considers sensitive or even fully private. Trusted encryption of communication with this agent is mandatory, and is part of the assumption made by the customer relative to their trust of the Retailer to keep that information private. Even the concierge agent is not allowed to see inside the client agent's data cache, where it is only customer-chosen information which is allowed to transfer from the client agent to the concierge-agent for some given shopping session. Again, for the option branch of the client agent being provided by the Retailer's network, a close association with the loyalty programs and database is highly encouraged, replete with following the same best practices for secure storage and secure communications with the customer that loyalty programs already have in place.","The option branch where some third party instantiates a geographically-savvy client-agent, outside of the Retailer's firewall, can be conceptually as simple as the previous branch, but its implementation and richer set of further options is more complicated. To begin with, data format compatibility and associated communications protocols all should be simple to understand but often are a source of implementation challenge especially in early ad hoc standard days. But the basic idea of a third party client agent is that some given individual shopper may not want to be that tuned in to the differences of how their individual floor-plan shopping assistants behave when they decide to shop at Target today as opposed to Walmart like they did the day before. They want to deal with one and only one \u2018client agent\u2019, their own personal shopping assistant. This agent can then adapt to the particular store (retailer) they choose for some given shopping session, generally as an interchange between that third party agent and the concierge agent of the current chosen store. Importantly, this involves access to varying floor-plans and \u2018virtual maps\u2019 and virtual real estate, as obviously each and every store will have their own. Indeed, the quality of service surrounding these virtual maps of stores will be a key differentiator from one Retailer to the next in terms of a customer's ultimate satisfaction of one Retailer's GPS experience versus another's. The winning Retailer will be the one that has paid a great deal of attention to their interior GIS system and its ability to be maintained and presented to the customer and their client agent.","The implementation of both branches of the client agent should ideally be quite similar if not exactly the same. This is one way to allow a customer to choose to have both forms of client agent, one session using the store's process and the next their own third-party generic one. This formalizes the necessity of the client agent and the concierge agent to have explicit \u2018negotiations\u2019, both when a customer enters a store then continuing as the customer shops, with the client agent always privy to the extreme details of the shoppers interests and sensitive data, and then selectively sharing (via a \u2018push\u2019 to the concierge agent, and\/or via a \u2018pull\u2019 from the concierge agent making queries to the client agent on their current interests and permissions) that data with the concierge agent. The initialization of interchange in the vignette, only as but one example, is that the concierge agent is charged with initially finding out which type of client agent the customer wishes to use and then to initiate a shared shopping session to be co-managed by both agents. Intuitively, the situation is no different than a live shopping assistant generally being the one to first ask the question \u2018may I assist\u2019. In the LBR context, this initial \u2018may I assist\u2019 question includes a back-and-forth determination of the customer's client agent with subsequent \u2018firing up\u2019 of that agent. From that point forward, the client agent is ultimately taking lead on the co-management of the shopping session. But even here it is instructive to liken the whole process to the live shopping assistant: a client agent can be bossy and very direct in looking for assistance, all the way to the client agent saying \u2018hey, show me around your store, I have no clue what I\u2032m looking for, so, you concierge-agent generally have lead on this shopping session\u2019. The broader point is that the customer chooses these intuitive modalities, including choosing which of the two companion agents initiates ongoing interactions between the two agents and ultimately the communications with the customer's device.","So back to the explicit vignette, we can keep things simple and describe how the Retailer has offered client-agent services to the customer and the customer has accepted those services. One immediate result of this choice will be the contacting of the Retailer's client-agent-server (usually closely associated with the loyalty program processes), that client agent acknowledging the instantiation and its implication of a subsequent co-management of a shopping session, and a copying of any and all pertinent data from the concierge agent to the client agent. This data transfer will include the proto-tri-quad data already described above.","The client agent now becomes in charge of interacting with the customer in order to fully configure and plan, to the fullest extent allowed by the customer, the shopping session ahead. The number of options for implementation of this step mushroom quite readily, but the main point is that the client agent is in charge of filling out at least their own version of the proto-tri-quad structure. How much information does the customer want to put into at least the client-agent-private \u2018who\u2019 fields? the permission fields? and ultimately, the never-ending possibilities for filling out the \u2018search\u2019 fields. As stated several times already, these are not yet the data items that will necessarily populated instant-by-instant tri-quad packets, this is the tri-quad template maintained by that customer's client agent. An important data item to fetch from the customer\u2014by the client agent\u2014is what permission state they wish to have even between that client agent and the concierge agent assigned to assist the client\/customer device pair. After the client agent fills out its own tri-quad fields accordingly, it then uses this \u2018permission to pass X tri-quad data to the concierge agent\u2019, where X<=Y, the full tri-quad data kept in the client agent. So, already permissions are being read and followed even at this very early stage. An example of what the client's tri-quad template might look like, and what the triquad template looks like AFTER the permissions on transfer have been followed, might be:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0245","num":"0243"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"FutureInstance_Client

two previous triquad templates walked a very fine line between being detailed enough to illustrate the basic job of the client agent to start to populate the proto-triquads with appropriate data, but not so detailed as eventual implementations will inevitably become (overwhelming the reader as well as applicant). Many key aspects of what has been called \u2018flurries\u2019 heretofore now find expression in these resultant tri-quad templates. Likewise, the process separation between an agent fully controlled by the customer and an agent representing the Retailer is highlighted. As indicated often, these interchanges would be using standard secure communications and storage in their execution, with \u2018open channel\u2019 publishing of data even to the concierge agent carefully managed.","Of many items to note in these triquad templates, a separation of the specificity of \u2018search\u2019 is already apparent between the view that the client agent has and the one the client agent shared with the concierge agent. Of equal note is the simple field within the concierge agent which is a direct way for the customer to indicate to the concierge agent that, at least for this particular pending shopping session, \u201cI will be looking to initiate the query process on what exactly I\u2032m interested in.\u201d The client agent could have equally just sent very detailed search instructions and data fields, which will often be the case in practice, but for our vignette where a patent application must necessarily describe implementation steps in the best discrete manner possible, this filling out of the co-managed \u2018search\u2019 fields will commence shortly.","These examples should also further explain why the \u2018data\u2019 and \u2018links\u2019 distinction were made very early on in the triquad disclosure sections. In short, certain types of information is best explicitly stored in active triquads and their templates, while other often equally important is best accessed through standard intranet and\/or internet reference, especially data which changes often or \u2018evolves\u2019 as an LBR network evolves.","Back to the specific vignette, we can see that the customer hasn't even gotten to the door yet (indicated by \u2018exterior\u2019 and the fact that no location solutions have fired up yet, only an association between the customer's device and the store's wifi system, which subsequently contacted the store's LBR network as described.","It is now time to contact the location agent and announce to it that a new customer has shown up and wishes to have interior location services activated for them. Most but not all location technologies, and certainly those of previous sections of this application, will have generic MAC address (or similar public domain identifications) identification and parsing routines such that probably even before the customer's device and the store finish their association ritual as described earlier, the location engine will already have noticed that a new MAC device was showing up on one or more access points or \u2018\u2019listeners\u2019. This will be the case where lists of received countstamps from ANY transmitting device, on the channel of the given listener, is routinely sent to the location engine without filtering by the listener. Each Retailer will choose their own policies on whether or not new, unknown devices will begin to be \u2018tracked\u2019 or not. For location technologies which do not key in on MAC addresses, similar types of \u2018early indications\u2019 that some client device has shown up on premises is possible. Yet other location technologies such as GPS itself will of course be occurring on the client's device itself, where this device-side formulation of location solutions represents an option branch to this particular vignette, where the following discussion would need to replace \u2018location agent\u2019 with \u2018customer device's location determination process\u2019 with most of the explanation still applicable.","In any event, the concierge agent contacts the location engine, informing that engine that MAC such and such should be showing up within the purview of its active clients, and the steps and processes that the location agent follows has previously been described. For the case of this vignette, we can leave it that the location agent can indeed begin to locate the new customer and sends back to the concierge agent an acknowledgement of such. The concierge agent has also sent a further filtered template of the triquad to the location agent, asking that agent to wrap a first spatial solution for the new customer inside this triquad

is more than a philosophical question on whether or not the location agent or the concierge agent actually \u2018creates\u2019 the first and subsequent live triquad and the triquad stream. Both are technically possible of course, where the concierge agent simply can ask the location agent for the current location of device with MAC address 12345678766 and then \u2018wrap\u2019 the answer in its own triquad template then \u2018ship it\u2019 somewhere. But the preferred embodiment is that the baseline act of creating triquads then filling them with the rawest levels of information\u2014most definitely including X-Y-[Z]\u2014should be performed by the location engine. The location engine, through the act of discretely determining the location of some given device, becomes the simple source of the stream. Never mind that this stream will be processed and filtered and cloned and broadcast and whatnot, it is best that the location engine simply begins best practices by wrapping X-Y-[Z] location data within appropriately populated ID structure and most critically permissions. Far too many market-fears have been expressed on the privacy and security aspects of the burgeoning location-services industry, so bring in privacy and security practices right at the same point where location is determined. In the case where the customer's device is the \u2018locating engine\u2019, the same practice should be followed even in the simplest case where a GPS process on a device sends a location message to a mapping GUI app on that very same device. Why? Because it is clear as day that the evolution of device-side processing will continue to equivocate as CPU's become more complicated and multi-threaded, and parallel cloud-side processing utilizing wireless channels continues on its swift pace. So even at the device level, this disclosure makes the argument to GPS hardware and software manufacturers that they should be wrapping X-Y-[Z] solution data inside a triquad like synthesis before shipping the results to anything outside of the core GPS solutions core.","Back to the vignette, the location agent has dutifully sent back its first triquad populated LBR packet back to the concierge agent and all is well. The location engine will continue to ship these packets to the concierge agent until told otherwise, incrementing the triquad label accordingly (1, 2, 3, etc.). This point in the vignette moves more strongly toward the all-important \u2018search\u2019 aspects of the invention and gives by way of example an explanation on how the past 20 years of prior art on text-based \u2018search\u2019 can be co-opted and expanded for the interior positioning evolution of the keyboard\/text search form.","The concierge agent, upon receiving an apparently valid and \u2018accurate\u2019 (to some level of granularity\/resolution\/accuracy associated with the actual location technology being employed) spatial solution from the location engine, can now switch gears from the plumbing level shopping initiation activities and begin the real \u2018services\u2019 aspect of the shopping session. A natural first question for it to ask, already alluded to many paragraphs ago, is: how may I help?","The first answer has already been transmitted by the client agent in the simple line: ConciergeState=\u201cConcierge to Initiate Search Session\u201d. The basic idea here is that the client agent has already provided the first clue to the concierge agent via the formatting of this \u2018state\u2019 for the concierge agent . . . to with, you tell me how you can help!","For the very first time user of the Retailer's indoor GPS network, no doubt the concierge agent will first look to its new-user tutorial sub-agents to figure out what to do next. For veteran users, a whole different set of \u2018next steps\u2019 will no doubt occur. A core point of the LBR\/agent is: the branching of options is fully expected to mushroom at this juncture, that is the whole point of LBR packets and agents. The vignette here will follow the tutorial branch and attempt to sprinkle in various aspects and choices encountered on other more \u2018normal experienced user\u2019 branches. The combination of the ConciergeState message and the LBR-Experience-Level: \u2018First Time User\u2019 data field indicates to the concierge agent that it is time to fire up the promotional and tutorial scripting agents that each Retailer will no doubt spend a fair amount of time and money creating, especially if those Retailers are so-called early adopters and pioneers in the creation and development of indoor positioning technology. This paragraph calls these \u2018scripting agents\u2019 but to the Retailer's marketing executives and advertising professionals, these will be the usual bewildering m\u00e9lange of pre-visit advertisements, in-store signs, additional \u2018screens and functions\u2019 built in to the update for the mobile application program that the customer has already downloaded, as well as cloud-side processes\/threads that can access some large cache of graphics, video clips, music . . . all the typical multimedia fare, hyper-charged now by mobile interaction and constant streaming of content to the customer's mobile device.

some basic fields are left out of this example but by and large the client agent simply needs to ask the customer if they want to fire off the first-time-user tutorial experience, which is mainly a command to the Retailer GUI\/app to present the user with this choice while at the same time instructing the GUI\/app to bring up a display of the store's floor map (if it has not done so already) and to then display the customer's current location on that displayed map.

In other words, a form of parallel background process of feeding current location to the customer's device is effectively fired up during this Newbie flurry about to happen]. The Retailer's GUI\/app duly presents the option to the new customer-user to \u2018test out and try\u2019 their Indoor navigator\/assistant, their GPS, their whatever-they-wan-to-brand-it-as.

The evolving triquad structures and their various instantiations will remain the backbone of the vignette.","The Retailer has determined that the best way to teach their customers how to use their new GPS services happens to be centered around helping them find, choose and buy some specific product or products that they are interested in for this very shopping session.

this triquad was wrapped into an LBR-formatted packet and sent to the LBR via the Retailer's wifi session management processes. Less convoluted pathways are eventually possible but for tutorial reasons we will keep explaining the current communication chain. The triquad shows up at the client agent, letting that agent know the customer is ready to play ball and be helped to go buy something they are interested in. The client agent notes the new field data entry of Client-Concierge access: \u201cAllow History Fetch\u201d, along with the shopping list in process note, and therefor determines via permission rules contained in its permission links that it cannot only pass on (to the concierge agent) certain \u2018semi-sensitive\u2019 past shopping history data it has but the concierge agent does not have, but also that via other rules existing at those permission links, the Retailer's own loyalty program processes and databases can also be contacted to fetch information about this particular customer and their past buying patterns. In other words, one way or another the customer has been informed\/educated that their past buying data will be securely fetched (kept inside the Retailer's firewalls) and then utilized in helping to create a shopping list for this shopping session. One way for the client agent to instigate these broader data fetching flurries is to just send a triquad back to the concierge agent and let it worry about loyalty program data access.

with past examples, this one contains some important new data fields and values to make note of. A primary one is that what was a \u2018tentative\u2019 shopping session is now a full blown session and thus the primary identification schema switches to this session ID, where copies of various other identification information is obviously stored inside one or more agents. Likewise, simple notions of how a client agent instructs a concierge agent to \u2018do something\u2019 is illustrated, and the same protocol can be used as concierge agents make \u2018humble requests\u2019 back to the client agent who is ultimately in charge. The permission fields are explicitly flagged for upgrade on permission states (still referring to links for detailed rule interpretation and low level code execution). A new link field has been introduced into the \u2018who\u2019 category as well, this time being a link to a just-beginning-to-grow list of participants in this session, a list generally fully controlled by the client agent but that agent can publish links to sub-sets of that list. That is, the client agent may send the link: \/\/local:session SWGD2145224894FRS.ParticipantsA to the concierge client, the link \/\/local:session SWGD2145224894FRS.ParticipantsB to the loyalty program processes where they may not need to know (or are actively excluded from knowing about) various participants. Finally, the \u2018where\u2019 data is changing, which starts to address broader issues of \u2018latency of response\u2019 and the need for various agents to make sure they are relatively up to date in terms of servicing the mobile and realtime demands of the customer. Once triquads start flying out into marketland, these latency issues enter more of the spotlight.","The concierge agent thus receiving the above the above triquad duly contacts its sister Loyalty program processes and databases and requests abridged lists and pointers to list of that particular customer's past purchases and any further information deemed relevant to generating shopping lists (past shared preferences, demographic information, etc.), but certainly including past purchases. In the meantime, the client agent is also fetching any information that it deems appropriate to the task of generating a shopping list for this particular customer. Needless to say, while all these activities are taking place in the blink of an eye in the cloud, the customer also is interacting with the Retailer's GUI\/app and may be simply typing in \u2018I just want dog food, that's it\u2019. These concurrent behaviors and processes are quite normal and much of the work done behind the scenes which is aiming to assist the customer can very quickly become obsolete with a single over-ride by the customer.","The vignette concludes by taking perhaps the shortest path between a customer indicating what they want to go buy and simply buying it. This application takes this route because there is an intractable array of options and variations in the shopping experience itself, and the point of teaching technical innovation is to concentrate on the core required technical steps underpinning that vast array of options, not to try to describe them all. The vignette scenario therefore posits that \u2018Jane\u2019 has indicated to her device with the prompting of Retailer's in-store GUI\/app that, now that she considers this new Indoor shopping navigation capability, she wants to keep things simple and just see how it does helping her buy the normal dog food she buys for her dog Rascal: Kibbles 'n Bits. So while the client agent and the concierge agent are off doing their job setting up for a more \u2018general\u2019 shopping session, Jane hits the pet food link and then the dog food link on her device (through the GUI\/app) which then prompts a form a LBR interrupt message first sent to her client agent. In her GUI\/app interaction, she also has pro-actively allowed the presentation of possible information about competing brands to Kibbles n' Bits as an adjunct operation, and indeed, has not even explicitly typed in her favorite brand. The new triquad that her device sends to the client agent might look like this, where we now have an M replace the N index since time has passed, and indeed she has moved a tiny

This is all a prelude to the concierge agent seeing the highly critical permission state \u2018enable market presentation\u2019: this permission state is one example, one of the main ones, that opens the floodgates to the external third party market of brands and advertisers of many types. Via rules existing at the various links on permissions, the concierge agent now knows that it has approximately a minute or so (the length of time it will take the client agent with the location agent's help to \u2018guide\u2019 Jane to the pet food section, even though she well knows how to get there, but she wanted to see how the indoor GPS worked in the first place) to present a highly filtered but highly qualified tri-quad out to a market making agent.

Starting with the \u2018where\u2019 item, the criticality of \u2018location\u2019 and the ability of the concierge agent to formulate such an assumption about time to purchase is huge. By knowing that the customer will take a minute or so to even get to the section, the marketplace flurry about to happen can qualify the lead by time to destination and respond accordingly. The permissions fields shared at least between the concierge agent and the market\u2014making\u2014agent (which may or may not be passed on and \u2018published\u2019 to market bidders for the \u2018Goodies\u2019 to be delivered if a bidder \u2018wins one of the top Goodies presentation slots\u2019) instruct what is permitted\u2014in this case a generic bid on dog food where it is revealed to the market-maker that this particular customer usually buys Kibbles n' bits along with the other who and search data. There is then the instruction to subject this information to the market maker's proprietary market matching algorithms (and existing \u2018book\u2019 of bidders for batch buys of Goodies-impressions and Goodies-offers), producing only 3 winners ranked one two and three for who paid the most to third most. The results are then only permitted to be sent back to the concierge agent, referencing the link in the \u2018search\u2019 field. In manners already described and also harkening the prior art of matching buying of search responses to \u2018searches\u2019, the Kibble's 'n Bits brand owners happen to be buy-side market participants (remember : the buyer's in this scenario are the brand owners wanting to feed \u2018Goodies\u2019 packets ultimately for impression on the customer's device, aiding them in finalizing their decision to buy their particular brand). They have set-up \u2018batch buy\u2019 conditions with the market-making-agent to bid X cents for up to 10,000 requests for generic dog food with Confidence levels 5-7, but Y=2\u00d7 cents if their own brand is an explicit part of the history of some random customer. They may also have specified further \u2018bid levels\u2019 based on the sex of the lead, age ranges, etc. BUT, so have all their brand competitors set up similar batch buy criteria. A critical location oriented parameter for buying ultimately boils into the fields such as \u2018imminent purchase choice\u2019 and the time frames involved, possibly even navigation paths (which are not part of the explicit triquad example above due to the fact it is already rather involved; Indeed, the \u2018path\u2019 knowledge that can be revealed from the concierge agent to the market-maker will become a powerful bid-buy criteria for brand owners as they become more geographically aware of realtime shopper habits and how to tune bid-by criteria to those physical path habits). But still keeping things simple for explaining how triquads work in the market, let us suppose that PetSmart is experimenting this month with a promotion campaign specifically aimed at stealing away customers from their own competitors, and they have made a batch-bid-buy with the market-maker letting the market-maker see if a brand field has been filled out with some other brand's name and they are actually bidding \u2018more\u2019 on that condition than the Kibble's 'n Bits marketing team has decided. Jam's is also a market-bid player and has their own complicated batch-buy choices they have made with the market-maker-agent. The market maker agent churns all these variables and spins their market-matching algorithm and determines that indeed PetSmart's existing batch-bid has \u2018won\u2019 this particular triquad \u2018Goodies response\u2019, Kibble's n' Bits came in second, and Jams third, with a dozen other brands missing the bid of the top three. The market-making agent ticks off a count on the bid-win counters it has for the various batch-bid players (including ticking off counters that the other brands missed out), then sends back to the concierge agent an LBR-wrapped triquad that might look like this:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0280","num":"0278"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"MarketGoodies372946 = TriQuadStruct{"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"who"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},".data"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"search"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},".data"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Winner1:"]},{"entry":[{},"Winner2:"]},{"entry":[{},"Winner3:"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},".links"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/http:ThisConciergeID;

Sure enough, she is intrigued and plops it in her basket not even noticing the Kibbles or Jams buttons, she heads to the check-out, PetSmart has one this little Geo-Battle for a new customer and even forgot about going back to her iPhone to see how the indoor GPS capability is doing, she doesn't care any more.","The vignette ends with Jane taking one more look at her iPhone as she approaches the cash register, realizes she found the in-store shopping assistance to be of some value and remarks to herself how interesting it is that she's walking out with PetSmart and not Kibbles, but other than that, she just shuts down the application as her sister is calling her.","Behind the scenes of course there are all these session agents waiting to serve, with the location agent dutifully serving up X-Y-[Z] core triquads assuming somebody wants to consume them (which is quite literally almost always going to happen with tracking agents allowed through the loyalty program and the \u2018loyalty discounts\u2019 shoppers enjoy by \u2018opting in\u2019 to these tracking and \u2018shopping metrics\u2019 and \u2018shopping analytics\u2019 engines.","At the cash register, the Retailer's loyalty programs now register that Jane has bought the Petsmart.
