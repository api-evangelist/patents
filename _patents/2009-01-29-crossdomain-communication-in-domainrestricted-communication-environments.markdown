title: Cross-domain communication in domain-restricted communication environments
abstract: A messaging frame can be used to allow different domains to communicate in an electronic environment that are otherwise prevented from directly communicating. A messaging frame or other communication element can be configured to receive messages or communications from any frame, object, or element in the same domain as the messaging frame. The messaging frame then can switch to a target domain in order to provide the message or communication to a frame, object, or element in the target domain. The messaging frame can include an interface definition that allows only approved messages to be passed between domains, such that the risk of malicious attack is minimized.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["As an increasing amount of information is being provided electronically, the number of sources providing such content is increasing as well. In many cases, a user browsing a Web page through a browser application, for example, might simultaneously view content from multiple sources, each of which might have a distinct domain, host address, or other such source identifier from which the content is provided. In many cases, the user will be unaware that the content is coming from multiple sources other than variations in aspects such as style or layout.","In order to enhance the user experience, many of these content providers would like to be able to communicate information back and forth such that a page displaying content from multiple providers and\/or multiple domains can provide a consistent experience based on user interaction. For example, a user viewing an item in an electronic marketplace might select to purchase an item using a \u201cbuy it\u201d option in a frame provided from a first domain. There might be other frames on the page corresponding to other domains that can benefit from knowledge that the user purchased the item. For example, if a second domain is advertising alternative items available, once an item is purchased that domain might instead desire to advertise accessories for the purchased item. In any case, it can be desirable to update content in certain domains in response to actions or occurrences in other domains.","Such an approach is not straightforward, however, as most existing browsers and other such applications impose restrictions on cross-domain requests and cross-site scripting (XSS). Thus, a frame on a Web page corresponding to a first domain cannot send information to a second frame on the page corresponding to a second domain. Further, various frames or elements from a common provider may still correspond to different domains, or switch between different domains, such as secure (e.g., using HTTPS) and non-secure (e.g., using HTTP) domains. Thus even pages from the same provider might be unable to determine information about a frame, object, or other element of the page if that element is from another domain.","Further still, for content providers such as electronic marketplaces or electronic retailers, if these providers take advantage of electronic payment cards (e.g., credit or debit cards), then the provider also must comply with payment card industry data security standards (such as PCI DSS). In order to maintain compliance, each of the providers for a Web site has to also be PCI compliant to avoid potential vulnerabilities in the site, which in many instances will not be practical. Thus, while it may be desirable to pull in content from third party providers and interact with that content via JavaScript or another appropriate language, such interaction would generally not comply with the PCI or other such standards. Many other such standards exist for types of content or interaction.","Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure may overcome one or more the aforementioned and other deficiencies experienced in conventional approaches to providing and managing content across multiple domains in an electronic environment. Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments provide for a communication element, such as a hidden messaging frame, that is able to switch or transition between domains in order to allow for the communication of content between elements of different domains. A page of content might include multiple such messaging frames, or can include logic that allows such a messaging frame to work with multiple domains for various portions of the page. Generally, a \u201cdomain\u201d refers to an organized collection of network devices, applications, and\/or services, which typically are identified using a domain \u201cname.\u201d Thus, a single content provider might utilize multiple domains for different purposes or having different aspects or capabilities. Further, different providers typically will utilize different domains. Although a common use of the word \u201cdomain\u201d in such a context often currently refers to Internet-based technology, it should be understood that domains can be used in any appropriate network setting, and that advantages of embodiments discussed and suggested herein can be applied to any of these networks as appropriate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106"]},"The illustrative environment includes at least one application server  and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers, layers, or other elements, processes, or components, which may be chained or otherwise configured, which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term \u201cdata store\u201d refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing, accessing, and retrieving data, which may include any combination and number of data servers, databases, data storage devices, and data storage media, in any standard, distributed, or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device, handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store, and is able to generate content such as text, graphics, audio, and\/or video to be transferred to the user, which may be served to the user by the Web server in the form of HTML, XML, or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses, as well as the delivery of content between the client device  and the application server , can be handled by the Web server. It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components, as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein. Further, the environment can be architected in such a way that a test automation framework can be provided as a service to which a user or application can subscribe. A test automation framework can be provided as an implementation of any of the various testing patterns discussed herein, although various other implementations can be used as well, as discussed or suggested herein.","The environment also includes a development and\/or testing side, which includes a user device  allowing a user such as a developer, data administrator, or tester to access the system. The user device  can be any appropriate device or machine, such as is described above with respect to the client device . The environment also includes a development server , which functions similar to the application server  but typically runs code during development and testing before the code is deployed and executed on the production side and is accessible to outside users, for example. In some embodiments, an application server can function as a development server, and separate production and testing storage may not be used.","The data store  can include several separate data tables, databases, or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example, the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing production data  and user information , which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store also is shown to include a mechanism for storing testing data , which can be used with the user information for the testing side. It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store, such as for page image information and access right information, which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store  is operable, through logic associated therewith, to receive instructions from the application server  or development server , and obtain, update, or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example, a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case, the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user, and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then can be returned to the user, such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.","Each server typically will include an operating system that provides executable program instructions for the general administration and operation of that server, and typically will include a computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor of the server, allow the server to perform its intended functions. Suitable implementations for the operating system and general functionality of the servers are known or commercially available, and are readily implemented by persons having ordinary skill in the art, particularly in light of the disclosure herein.","The environment in one embodiment is a distributed computing environment utilizing several computer systems and components that are interconnected via communication links, using one or more computer networks or direct connections. However, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that such a system could operate equally well in a system having fewer or a greater number of components than are illustrated in . Thus, the depiction of the system  in  should be taken as being illustrative in nature, and not limiting to the scope of the disclosure.","An environment such as that illustrated in  can be useful for a provider such as an electronic marketplace, wherein multiple sources might be used to provide content for different portions of a generated page. As discussed above, however, sometimes a provider such as an electronic marketplace might wish to generate pages that pull content from multiple domains, either from the same provider or from other providers. The electronic environment in such a case might include additional components and\/or other arrangements, such as those illustrated in the configuration  of . In this example, a user of a client device  might submit a request for content across a network  that is directed to at least one provider , . In order to respond to the request, such as by sending a reply page to be displayed on the client device , content might be provided by a Web server  of a first provider, which might utilize one or more application server ,  to pull content from one or more data repositories ,  and generate page content to be rendered by the client device . In some cases, each application server ,  for the provider might correspond to a different domain. For example, a first application server  might correspond to a non-secure domain, which provides content such as landing pages or static content pages. A second application server  might correspond to a secure domain, which might provide functionality such as virtual shopping carts, online payments, and other such secure operations.","In order to provide all necessary content for the page, at least a portion of the content also might be provided by at least one other provider . In this case, a Web server  might serve content from an application server  able to pull content from at least one repository , and the server  might send the content directly to the client device  across the network  or in some embodiments might send the content to the first provider  such that the first provider sends all page content together. In this example, the second provider  also might correspond to a separate domain. Although two content providers are shown, and the example is described with respect to three domains for a page, it should be understood that any of a number of providers and\/or domains could be used to provide content for a page as known or used in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3(","FIG. 2"],"i":"a","b":["300","302"]},"For example, ) illustrates a layout  indicating a domain corresponding to each frame shown in the example page of ). In this example, the overall page or site accessed by the user is provided from Domain A, which can correspond to a first provider of the site. In this case, frames corresponding to a title bar, a set of navigational links, and a link to a similar item are all provided from Domain A. Even though the overall marketplace is provided from Domain A, the display page providing information about the item being viewed comes from Domain B, as well as the ability to purchase the item. This might be due to the fact, for example, that the item is actually offered by, and purchased from, a separate provider. In other examples, this might be because the provider simply uses a different domain for content such as item information and purchasing.","As discussed, a potential problem with sourcing content from multiple domains is that one frame on a page cannot obtain information about another frame on a page, at least not without generating compliance issues in certain cases. Thus, if an item is purchased from Domain B, for example, there is no easy way to update the content of state of Domain A or any other domain for the page.","An approach in accordance with one embodiment addresses at least some of these and other such issues by taking advantage of a domain-variant communication element, here taking the form of a messaging frame . In this example, the frame is a \u201chidden\u201d frame that has a \u201chidden\u201d style with zero width and zero height, but still represented in the frameset of the page. The content of the messaging frame can be alternatively sourced from multiple domains, such that at any given time the messaging frame can be of the same domain as a desired frame of the page, whereby that frame can communicate with the messaging frame.","For example, as shown in the state  of ), a messaging frame is set to correspond to Domain B, allowing any frame  of the page also corresponding to Domain B to communicate with the messaging frame , such as by sending a hashed message as discussed elsewhere herein. After receiving the message, the messaging frame can switch to correspond to Domain A, as illustrated in the state  of ), whereby the messaging frame can communicate with any other frame  corresponding to Domain A. For example, the messaging frame can send a message conveying information originally sent from Domain B, and can receive a confirmation message from Domain A. The messaging frame  then can switch back to Domain B, as illustrated in the state  of ), and can send a confirmation message to Domain B that the message was received by Domain A. It should be understood that confirmation messages are not required, and any of a number of other or additional messages can be passed back and forth as desired. Thus, control and use of at least one messaging frame can provide for communication between domains without violating cross-domain restrictions or violating compliance standards.","As discussed, any frame on the page that is in the same domain as the messaging frame at a given time can communicate with the messaging frame. Thus, a common domain can modify the location and\/or hash specified to the messaging frame, and can set the location of the page corresponding to the messaging frame to be a page within the target domain for communication. For example, a frame can pass a call to the messaging frame such as:","go to domain.com\/blank#message&recipient=pagetype&host=\/\/www.foo.com\/blank","The example call above provides a target location and domain for the messaging window, here specifying a designated blank page of the \u201cdomain.com\u201d domain. The call also includes a message to be sent to that location, which can be specified in a hash, and can also include information about how the message should be processed. The call also includes a host name, to specify the location or page to which the messaging frame should return.","As discussed, a messaging frame can correspond to a frame having no width or height but that is still part of the frameset of the underlying page. The frame can have appropriate properties set, such as an index of a value such as \u221210 that will prevent a user from cycling to, or otherwise accessing, that frame in any way. As should be understood, even when the target of the frame switches domains, the hidden frame itself still remains part of the underlying document, the code of which is provided by the same provider and domain as the underlying page. Further, while a hidden frame is used for explanation purposes, it should be understood that any appropriate object or element can be used that enables communication with another element or object on a page, and that can switch domains to communicate with another element or object. Further, although many examples are given with respect to an Internet-inclusive environment, it should be understood that advantages and implementations can be obtained in other applications, such as any electronic environment wherein content is provided from multiple sources, and direct communication between those sources or that content is prohibited or restricted as discussed or suggested herein.","Such an approach allows a frame corresponding to a first domain to set the location of the messaging frame to another domain.  illustrates steps of an example process  for communicating across multiple domains in accordance with one embodiment. In this example, a page includes multiple frames of content, with at least two of those frames having content corresponding to different domains. A change of state is triggered for a frame corresponding to a first domain . As discussed above, this can correspond to a user initiating an action or any other appropriate occurrence. In one example, a page such as a detail page can include at least one frame having a state that can be manipulated by a user, such as by a user clicking an \u201cadd to cart\u201d or similar element. As the state changes, the displayed content can change as well.","As a result of the change in state, the first domain generates a message corresponding to the change in state , including appropriate state change information, and the message is received to a messaging frame  in the same domain. The message can be any appropriate message as discussed elsewhere herein, which can include information corresponding to the change in state as well as information indicating a domain to which the messaging frame should switch to deliver the communication. When a confirmation portion or layer loads, for example, a message can be sent to the messaging frame indicating that the messaging frame should switch to a specific domain with a specific message, indicating the updated state. As discussed, the message can be included in the hash or can be included in any other appropriate location, such as in the content, header, or tags of the page or location specified in the hash. In an application where a substantial amount of information is passed relatively infrequently, it might be desirable to pass information using the content of the page, etc.","In response to receiving the message, the messaging frame switches to the second domain  and delivers the message to the target . Once the messaging frame switches to the second domain, the first domain loses all control over, and access to, the messaging frame until the frame returns to the first domain. The second domain, however, is now able to receive the message from the messaging frame and otherwise communicate with the messaging frame. For example, the second domain can determine the location, parse the message in the hash, and process the message . The second domain then can send a message to the messaging frame  instructing the messaging frame to return to the first domain. As discussed, the return location or host address may have been specified in the initial message from the first domain. While in this example the messaging frame returns to the first domain , it should be understood that the messaging frame could be instructed to switch to a third domain corresponding to another frame on the page. The first domain then again is able to communicate with the messaging frame. Thus, rather than opening full JavaScript or similar access for aspects such as AJAX calls and framesets, such a communication approach allows for communication and actions based upon a pre-defined application programming interface (API) between the two consenting providers of the domains. Such an approach thus is relatively robust against attack, as an unintended third party can only cause actions to occur that are already approved actions.","The ability to communicate across multiple domains enables Web pages, Web sites, and other such elements to provide a consistent look and feel, and consistent performance, even when portions of those pages and\/or sites are provided from different domains. Further, such an approach allows content providers to provide content as services, subscriptions, portable pipelines, or other such elements that can be added to any page of any appropriate provider, and can allow communication between elements so that the content can be controlled or manipulated in accordance with other elements or actions with respect to the page. For example, a provider can create a portable checkout pipeline that can be added to any Web site to provide checkout and payment functionality, and the cross-domain communication allows the entire checkout process to be completed while appearing to be in a specific domain or from a specific provider. For example, if a user accesses an electronic marketplace to make a purchase, the user can have the impression that all functionality is provided by the electronic marketplace even if the checkout functionality is provided by another provider from another domain. Similar functionality can be used to provide advertisements or other content from other domains, provide for user authentication, etc., but have the same style and correspond to information currently being displayed to the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","606"]},"An approach in accordance with another embodiment can utilize a messaging queue to hold messages that are waiting for the messaging frame. There can be one queue for each domain that is able to receive and hold messages from that domain and then deliver the message when the messaging frame is in the respective domain. In such a situation, the messaging frame can be configured to check the queue when switching to another domain in order to pull any waiting message. In another embodiment, the messaging queue can periodically pole the messaging frame to determine when the messaging frame is in the same domain and is able to receive the message.","In some cases, a domain can engage in a polling or listening process to determine when the messaging frame is in the same domain. While the messaging frame is in a different domain, a permission denied or similar exception can be returned. Once the messaging frame transitions to the same domain, any message from another domain can be received and\/or processed, and a confirmation or other message can be sent to the messaging frame to be passed to another domain, or at least cause the messaging frame to transition to another domain.","In this example, once the messaging window receives the message from the first domain, the messaging window switches domains as specified by the message  and delivers the message to the target in the second domain . A response or other message may be received from the second domain once the second domain processes (or at least receives) the message. If a message is received , the messaging window switches to the domain specified by the message  and delivers the message to the target in that domain . This can be the first domain or another domain of the page.","If the messaging frame is configured to only switch domains when instructed, a problem can arise in that the messaging frame can get \u201cstuck\u201d in one domain unless that domain sends an instruction to switch domains. If another domain wishes to send a message using the messaging frame, there is no way for that other domain to contact the messaging frame in order to ask or instruct the messaging frame to switch domains while still preserving the messages currently being handled by the messaging frame. Some embodiments can utilize functionality such as hidden forms and anchor tags, or specific JavaScript, for example, to re-appropriate the messaging frame to a specific domain as needed. Unfortunately, such approaches are not able to maintain any state information or messages currently being stored by the messaging window. An alternative approach in accordance with one embodiment allows the messaging frame to include logic and\/or be configured such that each domain that might access the messaging frame is \u201cregistered\u201d with the messaging frame, and the messaging frame is able to switch to each of these domains at a specified interval when not being used by a current domain. Thus, the messaging frame will be able to receive messages from any of the domains without substantial delay or risk of the messaging frame getting stuck in one domain. Further, there is no loss of state or message information as a result of the domain transition. In cases where one or more domains will primarily be sending messages via the messaging frame, the messaging frame can be configured to switch to those domains more frequently than other domains which will not send messages as frequently. In some embodiments, each registered domain can have a time period, frequency, or other such parameter set to specify when the messaging frame should switch to that domain. Many other similar approaches should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings and suggestions contained herein.","In the present example, if a message is not received from the second domain then a determination is made as to whether a specified amount of time has elapsed . If not, the messaging window continues to wait for a message from the second domain. This can include listening, polling, or any other appropriate procedure. If the specified amount of time has elapsed, the messaging window can switch to a specified domain  in order to prevent the messaging window from getting stuck in a particular domain as discussed elsewhere herein. The process then can continue from either steps  or , waiting for either a change in state or a specified time to be exceeded, when the messaging window can again change state. As should be understood, the steps are examples and there can be a number of variations, additions, and\/or substations of steps in such a process, and the ordering of the steps can vary between embodiments.","Even though a messaging frame as discussed above can allow for communications between domains, and thus can provide an opportunity for a third party to manipulate the content, the risk from attack using such an approach is minimal. As discussed, even if one of the frames is compromised, or if a user is directed to a link or location that allows a third party to send unauthorized messages to the messaging frame, the messaging frame can correspond to an agreed-upon interface definition, such that the messaging frame can only cause a site or page to do something that the page is already authorized to do. For example, a messaging frame can be \u201chijacked\u201d such that the messaging frame continually instructs a frame in another domain to continually show a particular page, or have a particular state, and returns back to the hijacked domain. While this may provide for a poor user experience, as the style or content displayed may not correspond to the actual or intended state of a page, there is no risk of a third party redirecting the frame to an unauthorized domain, uploading malicious content, downloading information, or performing any other such malicious activity.","As discussed above, the various embodiments can be implemented in a wide variety of operating environments, which in some cases can include one or more user computers, computing devices, or processing devices which can be used to operate any of a number of applications. User or client devices can include any of a number of general purpose personal computers, such as desktop or laptop computers running a standard operating system, as well as cellular, wireless, and handheld devices running mobile software and capable of supporting a number of networking and messaging protocols. Such a system also can include a number of workstations running any of a variety of commercially-available operating systems and other known applications for purposes such as development and database management. These devices also can include other electronic devices, such as dummy terminals, thin-clients, gaming systems, and other devices capable of communicating via a network.","Various aspects also can be implemented as part of at least one service or Web service, such as may be part of a service-oriented architecture. Services such as Web services can communicate using any appropriate type of messaging, such as by using messages in extensible markup language (XML) format and exchanged using an appropriate protocol such as SOAP (derived from the \u201cSimple Object Access Protocol\u201d). Processes provided or executed by such services can be written in any appropriate language, such as the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). Using a language such as WSDL allows for functionality such as the automated generation of client-side code in various SOAP frameworks.","Most embodiments utilize at least one network that would be familiar to those skilled in the art for supporting communications using any of a variety of commercially-available protocols, such as TCP\/IP, OSI, FTP, UPnP, NFS, CIFS, and AppleTalk. The network can be, for example, a local area network, a wide-area network, a virtual private network, the Internet, an intranet, an extranet, a public switched telephone network, an infrared network, a wireless network, and any combination thereof.","In embodiments utilizing a Web server, the Web server can run any of a variety of server or mid-tier applications, including HTTP servers, FTP servers, CGI servers, data servers, Java servers, and business application servers. The server(s) also may be capable of executing programs or scripts in response requests from user devices, such as by executing one or more Web applications that may be implemented as one or more scripts or programs written in any programming language, such as Java\u00ae, C, C# or C++, or any scripting language, such as Perl, Python, or TCL, as well as combinations thereof. The server(s) may also include database servers, including without limitation those commercially available from Oracle\u00ae, Microsoft\u00ae, Sybase\u00ae, and IBM\u00ae.","The environment can include a variety of data stores and other memory and storage media as discussed above. These can reside in a variety of locations, such as on a storage medium local to (and\/or resident in) one or more of the computers or remote from any or all of the computers across the network. In a particular set of embodiments, the information may reside in a storage-area network (\u201cSAN\u201d) familiar to those skilled in the art. Similarly, any necessary files for performing the functions attributed to the computers, servers, or other network devices may be stored locally and\/or remotely, as appropriate. Where a system includes computerized devices, each such device can include hardware elements that may be electrically coupled via a bus, the elements including, for example, at least one central processing unit (CPU), at least one input device (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, controller, touch screen, or keypad), and at least one output device (e.g., a display device, printer, or speaker).","Such a system may also include one or more storage devices, such as disk drives, optical storage devices, and solid-state storage devices such as random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d) or read-only memory (\u201cROM\u201d), as well as removable media devices, memory cards, flash cards, etc.","Such devices also can include a computer-readable storage media reader, a communications device (e.g., a modem, a network card (wireless or wired), an infrared communication device, etc.), and working memory as described above. The computer-readable storage media reader can be connected with, or configured to receive, a computer-readable storage medium, representing remote, local, fixed, and\/or removable storage devices as well as storage media for temporarily and\/or more permanently containing, storing, transmitting, and retrieving computer-readable information. The system and various devices also typically will include a number of software applications, modules, services, or other elements located within at least one working memory device, including an operating system and application programs, such as a client application or Web browser. It should be appreciated that alternate embodiments may have numerous variations from that described above. For example, customized hardware might also be used and\/or particular elements might be implemented in hardware, software (including portable software, such as applets), or both. Further, connection to other computing devices such as network input\/output devices may be employed.","Storage media and computer readable media for containing code, or portions of code, can include any appropriate media known or used in the art, including storage media and communication media, such as but not limited to volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage and\/or transmission of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data, including RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disk (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the a system device. Based on the disclosure and teachings provided herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other ways and\/or methods to implement the various embodiments.","The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Various embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIGS. 3(","i":["a","b"],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIGS. 4(","i":["a","c"],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
