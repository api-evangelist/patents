title: System and method for media file synchronization
abstract: Media files are drop box-synchronized to limit the amount of new functionality to which a user must grow accustomed in order to synchronize the content of a media player with a remote server within a cloud computing network. Thusly, users are not required to change the way they use their media player(s), but rather are required to use the familiar drag and drop functionality of their native media player. The present invention contemplates automatic versus interval file synchronization between host and nodal processing units via a server within native media player formats. This is achieved through the creation of a media file play list folder that acts as a drop box into which the user drops the desired play list to synchronize with the server. Certain methodology enhances and supports the synchronization process, which methodology incorporates the use of signature waveform metrics.

No. 13\/134,044 ('044 Application), filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on 26 May 2011, now U.S. Pat No. 8,478,719 the specifications of which applications are hereby incorporated by reference thereto.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to system and method for media file synchronization. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for custom file matching and synchronization by way of drag and drop functionality as provided to the user upon a graphical user interface.","2. Brief Description of the Prior Art","Play list folders may be used to identify which play list will be synchronized with a cloud computing network. A system directory (i.e. folder) that is used to synchronize with a remote server or another computer is often called a drop box. From a consideration of the state of the art, it will be noted that the prior art appears to be silent on a technique for extracting summary data from audio file amplitude information comprising various characteristic matching metrics for providing distinct audio file signatures for significantly decreasing the time associated with proper file matching, which file matching methodology may be utilized to compare, identify, and synchronize media files by way of drop box synchronization. Accordingly, the prior art perceives a need for fast-match methodology of the foregoing type for enabling and supporting drop box-type, media file synchronization as described and\/or summarized in more detail hereinafter.","It is an object of the present invention to incorporate and\/or apply certain means for finding audio\/media file matches on different systems without the requirement of sending cumbersome loads of data or the audio\/media files themselves. It is a further object of the present invention to incorporate and\/or apply certain support means for determining which audio\/media files should be synchronized within a certain system, and which audio\/media files are already present within the systems and simply need to be referenced. Still further, it is an object of the present invention to incorporate and\/or apply certain means to effectively find and locate redundant files so as to reduce storage costs by eliminating redundant file storage.","Still further, it is a primary object of the so-called media file drop box synchronization methodology according to the present invention to limit the amount of new functionality to which a user must grow accustomed in order to synchronize the content of a media player with a remote server within a cloud computing network. In this regard, it is contemplated that user would not be required to change the way the user uses a media player, but rather be required to use the familiar drag and drop functionality of the native media player.","Further still, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide localized data as otherwise reflected\/stored on the remote server within the native media player for quick access for the purpose of audio\/media playback, audio\/media modification, etc. This is achieved through the creation of an audio\/media file play list folder that acts as a drop box into which the user drops the play list he or she desires to synchronize with the server. Notably, the play list folder drop box is not a system level directory but rather a grouping of play lists that only exists at the level of the media player.","A user can drag-and-drop play list(s) in and out of such a play list directory. Dragging a play list into the folder indicates to the 3party application according to the present invention that the user desires to synchronize that specific play list to the cloud. Removing a play list from this play list folder indicates that the user no longer desires to synchronize that specific play list with the cloud.","Accordingly, the system and method according to the present invention summarily comprises certain processing units within a cloud computing environment whereby a host processing unit or means communicates with nodal processing units or means via a remote server. Thus, the media file synchronization system preferably comprises certain communicating remote, host, and nodal processing means. The host processing unit is in communication with a user interface and comprises an application cooperable with the local media player operable via the host processing unit\/means.","The media player means comprise play list folder generation means for visually displaying a drop box-enabled play list folder upon the user interface. Folder populating means further operable via said host processing means selectively populate the play list folder with a dynamic media file play list and listed tracks associated with the media file play list. File transfer means operable via the host and remote processing means function to transfer media file data intermediate the remote and host processing means; and synchronization means operable via the host and remote processing means synchronize drag-and-dropped changes to the playlist folder(s).","The synchronization means further rely upon and\/or are supported by certain (1) data extraction means associated with the host processing means for enabling waveform data extraction from media file data; (2) summary statistic derivation means associated with the host processing means for deriving summary statistics from extracted waveform data; (3) custom marker generation means associated with the host processing means for generating a custom marker based on derived summary statistics; and (4) marker association means associated with the host processing means for respectively associating generated custom markers with the media file data for forming marked media file data.","Referring now to the drawings with more specificity, the present invention essentially concerns a system and method for media\/audio file synchronization among a number of linked processing units as linked via a centralized\/remote server. Rapid inter-component file data synchronization is enabled by way of (1) associating a uniquely constructed file-identifying fingerprint or marker with a media\/audio file ; (2) matching media\/audio files  by way of the uniquely constructed file-identifying markers or fingerprints; and (3) drag\/drop functionality of playlist changes upon a graphical user interface.","The present invention firstly contemplates a desktop application  operable by way of a user's graphical user interface  in communication with a host processing unit or means as diagrammatically depicted and referenced at . It is contemplated that the host processing means  are in communication with a cloud computing type network and thus certain nodal processing units or means as at  are in communication with the host processing means  via certain remote or server processing means as at .","It is contemplated that soon after the installation of the desktop application (as diagrammatically depicted and referenced at ) is complete the user may preferably be visually prompted upon the graphical user interface  to select one or more drop box(es) as at  to synchronize with a local or host media player application as diagrammatically depicted and referenced at . If there are no drop boxes , the user may be prompted to create a new drop box  via the desktop application .","If the user decides to create a new drop box , the desktop application  comprises certain play list folder generation means for enabling the user to create a new play list folder or drop box  in local media player  via an application programming interface (API)  associated with the player . If the user decides to synchronize an existing drop box as at  located at the remote processing means or server , then the desktop application  may create a new play list folder or drop box  in the local media player  via the player's API .","The desktop application  further preferably comprises certain folder population means for populating the generated play list folder(s) or drop box(es)  with play lists  and their respective tracks , and initially drives\/creates URL streams \/ for media files  stored at the remote processing means . Any tickets related to the action are preferably removed.","If the user elects to store the copies of the media files  for the drop box  on the host processing means , the desktop application  initiates the transfer (download) of media file data from the remote processing means . When the media file data transfer is complete, the URL stream(s) \/ are preferably replaced with standard track(s)  referencing the local file(s) as at .","When the user wishes to make any changes to the play list status or structure, the desktop application  (automatically) initiates the synchronization process. In this regard, the application  contemplates certain play list surveillance means  for monitoring the play list status and comparing the play list status against an index of the play list folder or drop box  of the desktop application . It is contemplated that the surveillance means  are preferably and essentially background routines\/processes that are executed every few minutes by way of the API  of the local or host media player .","Should the user elect to drag-and-drop a play list  into a drop box-enabled play list folder or drop box , the dragged\/dropped play list  is broken down into track-based waveform data  and analyzed for rendering respective media file signatures for the individual files\/tracks  of the play list . Certain data extraction means , as exemplified by an audio analysis plugin , are associated with the host processing means  for enabling waveform data extraction from the waveform media file data . The process of extracting waveform data provides signature values , which may then be further processed via certain metric derivation means  for rendering or deriving matching metrics .","For example, when wave form data  are analyzed by the audio analysis plugin , various values  may be rendered or output  from the wave form audio file data . The values  may then be processed via certain metric derivation means  for deriving or rendering the so-called matching metrics .","In this regard, the reader will note from  a generic sinusoidal wave  positioned adjacent baseline  in which waveform amplitude data (e.g. decibel level) are portrayed along the Y-axis  as a function of time as portrayed along the X-axis . It will be understood that wave form data (as at ) as mapped and positioned adjacent a baseline (as at ) may thus render various values .","The various values  are contemplated to include, but not be limited to: a trough height or trough-to-baseline distance or length segment as at ; a peak height or peak-to-baseline distance or length segment as at ; a vertical peak-to (rightly adjacent)-trough distance or length segment as at ; a horizontal peak-to (rightly adjacent)-trough distance or length segment s at  (defining a certain time segment or \u0394t); and a peak-to-trough hypotenuse length segment (joining length segments  and , and having a certain slope) as at .","Further, the various values  are contemplated to include, but not be limited to: a vertical trough-to (rightly adjacent)-peak distance or length segment as at ; a horizontal trough-to (rightly adjacent)-peak distance or length segment as at  (defining a certain time segment or \u0394t); a trough-to-peak hypotenuse length (joining length segments  and , and having a certain slope) as at ; a peak-to-peak distance  (defining a certain time segment or \u0394t); and a trough-to-trough distance  (i.e. defining a certain time segment or \u0394t).","The values extracted from the wave form media file data  may thus be subjected to various statistical analyses for providing the matching metrics . By way of example, given a continuous waveform or wave form media file data , a number of trough-to-baseline distances or length segments  may be ascertained extending across a range of values with a certain arithmetic average and having certain variability associated therewith.","Thus, it is contemplated that various statistical values including but not limited to the mean, range, and standard deviation values may be calculated for the trough-to-baseline distances or length segments (as at ) of certain given audio file waveform data . In this regard, the mean may be defined by as an arithmetic average of the trough-to-baseline length segments  of the values . To find a mean, scores or distances or length segment values may be summed and divided by the number of scores, distances, or length segment values per the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":["X","_"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03a3","X"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mi":"N"}}}},"br":{},"o":"X"},"\u03a3=an instruction to add or sum","X=the numbers or values symbolized by X","N=the number of X's","It will be seen that three (3) successive trough-to-baseline distances or length segments have been depicted and referenced at , , and . The mean of the trough-to-baseline distances or length segment values may thus be exemplified by the trough-to-baseline distances or length segment values depicted and referenced at , , and . If the values are added\/summed and divided by three, for example, an arithmetic average or mean is provided.","In other words, If trough-to-baseline distance or length segment has a value of two (2); trough-to-baseline distance or length segment has a value of four (4); and trough-to-baseline distance or length segment has a value of six (6); the mean may be calculated to have a value of four (4) since the sum of the values is twelve (12), and the number of values is three (3) (twelve (12) divided by three (3) equals four (4)).","Similar calculations may be carried out for (1) the peak-to-baseline distances or length segments , , and ; (2) the vertical peak-to-(rightly adjacent)-trough distances or length segments , , and ; (3) the horizontal peak-to-(rightly adjacent)-trough distances or length segments , , and ; and (4) the peak-to-trough hypotenuse length segment , , and ","The reader is further directed to (5) the vertical trough-to-(rightly adjacent)-peak distances or length segments and ; (6) the horizontal trough-to-(rightly adjacent)-peak distances or length segments and ; (7) the trough-to-peak hypotenuse length segment and ; (8) the peak-to-peak distances or length segments and ; and (9) the trough-to-trough distances or length segments and ","Each respective set of length segment values may thus be summed and the resulting sum sets divided by the number of values in each set to render an arithmetic mean for the respective set. In addition to the means, range values and standard deviation values for each given set may also be calculated to provide additional and characteristic statistical signatures for the wave form data . All statistical metrics can then be utilized to provide a robust file-identifying marker or fingerprint for the given wave form data  of a media\/audio file .","With regard to the range, the same may be defined as the upper limit of the trough-to-baseline distance or length segment  with the greatest magnitude (i.e. the highest score or value) minus the lower limit of the trough-to-baseline distance or length segment with the lowest magnitude (i.e. the lowest score) as per the following equation:\n\nrange=\n\nwhere X=upper limit of the highest or greatest trough-to-baseline distance; and\n","X=lower limit of the lowest or least trough-to-baseline distance.","Three (3) successive trough-to-baseline distances or length segments have been depicted and referenced at segments , , and . In this example, length segment would appear to represent the trough-to-baseline distance or length segment having least magnitude or value, and length segment would appear to represent the trough-to-baseline distance or length segment of greatest magnitude. If trough-to-baseline distance or length segment were assigned a value of 2 and the trough-to-baseline distance or length segment were assigned a value of 6, the range might then be calculated to have a value of 5 (since the lower limit of 2 in this example is 1.5 and the upper limit of 6 in this example is 6.5).","With regard to the parameter\/statistic of standard deviation, it is noted that the same is a measure of variability of a given set of scores such as distances, length segments, or values, and may be given by the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03c3","or","S"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]},"mo":"=","msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03a3","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"X","mn":"2"}},"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03a3","X"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mn":"2"},"mi":"N"}},"mi":"N"}}}}},"br":{}},"S=standard deviation of a sample","N=number of deviations (or number of scores\/distances\/values)","\u03a3X=sum of the squared scores\/distances\/values","(\u03a3X)=square of the sum of the raw scores\/distances\/values","When auditory amplitude data (e.g. intensity) are mapped as a function of time, the resulting data may define a signature waveform. Rather than extracting all the auditory amplitude data from the waveform, the present invention extracts key values, and derives file-matching metrics from the values as exemplified by the foregoing values  to provide a signature or fingerprint or custom marker for the respective audio file data  so as to quicken the overall matching process without sacrificing accuracy.","It is contemplated that the foregoing are but examples of the types of data that may be extracted from a given waveform. Other statistical features and\/or values may be extracted so as to render the custom marker for insertion and\/or association with the respective media\/audio file . For example, peak-to (rightly adjacent)-trough arc length (or portion(s) thereof) values as at  and\/or trough-to (rightly adjacent)-peak arc length (or portion(s) thereof) value as at  could also be extracted, and statistical values derived therefor.","Further, suppose an auditory signal has a certain amplitude magnitude A at time tand a certain amplitude magnitude A at time t. The average amplitude magnitude \u0100of the audio signal may be defined as the change in amplitude \u0394a, divided by the time interval \u0394t during which that change occurred as per the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":["A","_"]},"mi":"x"},"mo":"\u2261","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u0394","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["a","x"]}},{"mi":["\u0394","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["a","xf"]},{"mi":["a","xi"]}],"mo":"-"},{"msub":[{"mi":["t","f"]},{"mi":["t","i"]}],"mo":"-"}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["x ","x "],"b":["102","103","104"]},"Notably, the value of the average amplitude magnitude \u0100may be different over different time intervals. It is therefore useful to define the instantaneous amplitude magnitude as the limit of the average amplitude magnitude as \u0394t approaches zero. If point  is brought closer to point , and the limit of \u0394a_x\/\u0394t is taken as \u0394t approaches zero, the instantaneous amplitude magnitude (or slope) may be found as at . In other words, it is contemplated that the slope (as at ) of the waveform data at any given time may also be extracted and utilized to provide a file-identifying fingerprint or marker for the audio file waveform data .","It will thus be understood from an inspection of the various figures that the values at , , , and  are static length segment values based on instantaneous time selections; the values , , , and  may be viewed as either static length time segment values or time segment values; and the values  and  may be viewed as length segment values or time-based derivative values dependent upon select choice of the \u0394t component. In this regard, it is contemplated that in some situations, the slope values may significantly differ over different time intervals, and thus it may thus be useful to define the instantaneous slope as a limit of the average slope as \u0394t approaches zero.","It will thus be seen that the data extraction means  according to the present invention may well function to render certain amplitude values , from which values  certain summary statistics or metrics  may be derived and thus the present system and method contemplate that the data extraction means  may well support certain statistic\/metric derivation means  as provided by way of certain proprietary testing\/software designed to render the matching metrics  as exemplified by the foregoing statistics\/parameters.","To further bolster the accuracy of the matching metrics , it is contemplated that values for each of the distances, length segments and\/or slopes may be summarized by a set of summary statistics inclusive of the mean values, range values, and standard deviation values otherwise calculated for the values . In other words, the arithmetic average (i.e. the mean) of all the means for the various amplitude aspects could conceivably be calculated and included as a matching metric to bolster the accuracy of the signature or fingerprint or marker.","Still further, in addition to extraction of values  and matching metrics  from the wave form audio file data , it is contemplated that an audio file duration parameter\/statistic or metric may be included among the matching metrics  to further bolster signature accuracy. In other words, respective media\/audio files  necessarily comprise a signature duration, and the duration aspect or feature of the respective media\/audio files  may thus contribute to the authenticity or accuracy of a giveri file marker.","In this last regard, it is contemplated that the resulting summary statistics or matching metrics  may then be inserted into or otherwise embedded in the metadata  of the media\/audio file  using a custom file-identifying fingerprint or marker such as an (extended) ID3 tag. It is noted that tags of this type offer, provide, or enable relatively rapid file matching via file comparison means or operators. Thus, the ID3 tag or similar other custom marker, can be accessed very quickly when trying to find a possible match.","The media file matching metrics  are extracted and sent along with the play list data (comprising certain play list identification(s) ) to the remote processing means as at . The file matching metrics  are compared against a database of file metrics stored at the remote processing means  whereafter any matches are identified and a list of all non-matching, missing files is created and communicated back to the desktop application  at the host processing means . The desktop application  then starts transferring (e.g. uploading) all non-matching, missing files.","In this last regard, it is contemplated that it would be possible (depending on user bandwidth) to communicate directly with nodal processing means  instead of via the remote processing means  if a given desktop application were in place to determine both the external IP and internal IP, and enable file streaming from the host processing means  during file\/data transfer. Further, streaming from the network application and any networked device would be possible, if local media player means were able to play URL streams.","The transferred (e.g. uploaded) play list  is then re-created on the remote processing means  via certain play list re-creation means using the data sent from the host processing means  and all the media files  located at the remote processing means  (that have been matched with local files via the fast match process (described hereinabove)) are referenced within the tracks .","It is contemplated that tracks  with missing files could be disabled and the user provided with visually highlighted reference to the disabled status (e.g. track titles could be italicized on the remote processing instance of the play list drop box ). The otherwise disabled tracks  are enabled once the synchronizing data transfer or upload from the host processing means  is complete. The remote processing instance of the play list  is held within the remote processing instance of a drop-box, which drop box may be accessed through a network application  hosted at the remote processing means .","A global identification  is preferably generated at the remote processing means  linking all local instances of the play list or drop box  and the remote processing instance  by creating a relationship between local play list identification(s)  and the generated global identification . As stated, once the data transfer\/upload is complete, the tracks are enabled at the remote processing means , and all nodal processing means  are sent data to re-create the play list or drop box  and find possible matching local files .","The play list drop boxes  are created by the desktop application(s)  via the API  of the media player means  and the tracks  are initially created as URL streams \/. A given local play list identification  is returned to the remote processing means  in order to link the new local play list drop box  to the remote processing instance . Any tickets related to the action are removed.","Should the user elect to store the media files for the drop box  on the local processing means  in addition to storing the files with the remote processing means , the matching metrics  that were sent are used to locate any possible matching files . This task is completed exclusively by the desktop application , which application which maintains a repository of the matching metrics  for the files  referenced in the media player .","References to the local matching files  then replace the URL streams \/ within the play list drop box , and the data transfer (e.g. download) of all missing files is then initiated. Once the transfer\/download of media file data is completed, the URL stream is replaced with a standard track  having a reference to the local file .","Synchronization conflicts will typically be resolved by timestamp precedence whereby the later changes are given precedence. A noted exception to the conflict resolution scheme is in a synchronization scenario requiring that a file be replaced by another that is smaller in size. In said scenario, it is contemplated that the user may be preferably prompted either reverse the changes or continue.","Given a synchronization scenario in which one of the synchronized devices or nodal processing units  is unavailable, it is contemplated that the remote processing means  will create a ticket for the specified action. Upon availability of the nodal processing unit  (e.g. at start up), the local desktop application  will retrieve the ticket for the specified action. All conflicting tickets will be resolved as described with regard to synchronization conflicts hereinabove.","Should the user elect to create a new play list  within an existing play list folder drop box , the application  will either receive an event notification concerning a play list  being created, or the application  will detect a change in the content of the play list folder\/drop box  by comparing it content against an index of the play list folder drop box  that is held on the local desktop application . As earlier described, this would be done through a background process run every few minutes using the local media players API .","The new play list title and it local identification  are transferred to the remote processing unit or means  via the desktop application . A remote processing instance of the play list drop box is created  and a global identification  is generated linking\/communicating the newly created local play list drop box  and the remote processing instance of the play list drop box .","Media file data are sent to all the nodal processing units or means  to re-create the play list  and\/or drop box .

Once the tracks  are re-ordered, the action is reported back to the server  and any tickets related to the action are preferably removed. All synchronization conflicts are resolved and all unavailable devices are treated as heretofore described.","Should the user elect to create, delete, remove, or add a track  via drag-and-drop functionality\/methodology, the methodology will be performed in the same manner as play list  creation, deletion, removal, or addition. The only difference is that local track  and its identification  would replace the play list  and its identification ; and the play list server instance  and its identification  would be replaced by the track server instance  and its identification . The data transmitted will be substantially different, but there would be no difference in process (i.e. the difference between the routines is not a difference in process but data).","In order to maintain control of media files and stream files on authorized devices one would need to imbed a unique identification (ID) that would identify the desktop application that created the URL stream. That desktop application would report the external Internet Protocol (IP) of the local computer consistently. If the external IP address of the device that is attempting to stream a song does not match the external IP of the desktop application the file is not served.","It is further contemplated that so-called \u201csmart\u201d play lists would incorporate the use of query logic instead of full length track synchronization. In this regard, the \u201csmart\u201d play lists would be handled in all cases like standard play lists except that instead of the tracks from the \u201csmart\u201d play list being synchronized, the query logic is stored. The smart play list will then use that query logic to run a query on the server  generating a play list consisting of files  held on the server  which are then streamed to the local media player  or downloaded via the desktop app . The play list is created on the local media player via the player API .","The user can also select to generate a smart play list from other users which the user adds to their account as a \u201cfriend\u201d). Initially, the libraries of all \u201cfriends\u201d are equally weighted in the query, but with time as the user rates the media to which he or she attends, the ratings that they provide will help weight the source libraries, to create a more effective smart play list. These media files are also stored on the server  but are associated with a different user account.","The so-called \u201cfriend\u201d media files will be streamed in the same way as a simple smart play-list, it being noted that licensing agreements testifying to, or supporting the may well be conditions precedent to the methodology. It is very likely that these types of smart play lists will only be available for streaming. These rating can also be used to suggest music for purchase, based on the correlation between the user and \u201cfriends\u201d music preferences.","It is noted that certain media players comprise application programming interfaces that are sensitive to mixed media\/metadata and thus only provide partial support for URL track metadata (e.g. iTunes API). Accordingly, in certain API's (i.e. a mixed media\/metadata-sensitive API as at \u2032), there is a need to work around or bypass the mixed media\/metadata-sensitive API \u2032 to support full metadata synchronization. In order to associate the metadata  with such mixed media\/metadata sensitive API \u2032, the actual media\/audio file is utilized.","To avoid storing unique files for each user's distinct metadata  (i.e. in order to continue file matching as substantially set forth in the '044 Application), it is contemplated that the media file data  must be separated from the metadata . To achieve this separation, two separate files are created when uploading files for URL stream as at \u2032. The first file is one containing no metadata as at media-only file . The second file is a file with no media and metadata  only as at metadata-only file . It is contemplated that a file type for storing media duration data  and metadata  in the file header  may be preferably utilized (e.g. Apple Lossless audio codec).","In order to support full metadata support, the present invention contemplates two different synchronization processes, one that is automatic (a background process, that would synchronize playlist name, location, item deletion, track addition, etc. as generally depicted in ), and one that is user-initiated hereinafter referred to as interval synchronization as generally depicted in ). The interval synchronization process would require that the media player means \u2032 (having mixed media\/metadata-sensitive API \u2032) be minimized.","Once the user initiates interval synchronization, the desktop application  notifies (as at ) the server  that the client  is in interval sync. The server  will then re-direct the URL  from the media-only files  to the metadata-only files . The redirect  works by referencing a client ID stored within the URL field  of mixed media\/metadata-sensitive URL stream tracks . If the state of the client  as stored in a database field  on the server  and referenced by the client ID indicates that interval synchronization is proper, the server  then redirects as at  to the metadata-only files . In order for this to work the media-only files  must have the same file extension as the metadata-only files .","It is contemplated that the default state of the URL  references the media-only files . In so doing, every time the user plays media the metadata  will not be pushed into the mixed media\/metadata sensitive medial player \u2032, and thus will not replace possible user modifications. Once the URL  pointing to the media files has redirected, a temporary synchronization playlist is created consisting of all the tracks  that require synchronization (via the API \u2032). The first track is then played via the API \u2032. Given that these files contain no media data, and are relatively small, it takes less than a second to play through each track  (without an audible component).","When a file is played, the media player \u2032 imports the metadata  and duration data  of the file first and then proceeds to play the media. By creating metadata-only files  files that contain only metadata , the interval synchronization process can quickly push metadata  modifications without playing the audio. This effectively separates the metadata  and the media\/audio data, allowing the application to continue file matching and maintain full metadata support.","The file synchronization system and methodology, according to the present invention thus contemplate a certain flow of events as generally depicted in . The desktop application , when started as at  begins a file synchronization process as at . A query as at  is made as to whether the client requires interval file synchronization or whether automatic file synchronization is more proper. If automatic file synchronization is more proper, the application  completes automatic file synchronization as at  and terminates as at .","If the client requires interval file synchronization, the user initiates as at  interval file synchronization, whereafter the application  notifies as at  the server  that the client is an interval file synchronization client. A client ID, stored within the URL field  of URL stream tracks , is referenced at , and a query as at  is made as to whether the client is interval file synchronization or an automatic file synchronization client. If the client is interval file synchronization client, the server  will redirect as at  the URL  from the media-only files  to the metadata-only files .","A temporary synchronization playlist (consisting of all the tracks  that require synchronization via the API \u2032) is created as at . The first track is then played as at  via the API \u2032. The media player \u2032 imports as at  the metadata  and duration data , and then proceeds to play as at  the media whereafter the file matching routine and maintenance of full metadata support may continue as at  before termination as at .","While the foregoing specifications set forth much specificity, the same should not be construed as setting forth limits to the invention but rather as setting forth certain preferred embodiments and features. For example, as prefaced hereinabove, it is contemplated that the present inventive system and methodology essentially provide an audio or media file synchronization system for synchronizing audio\/media files.","The audio\/media file synchronization system according to the present invention is believed to essentially comprise certain remote processing means; certain host processing means; certain user interface means; certain media player means; certain play list surveillance means for monitoring play list changes and initiating file data synchronization; certain folder populating means; certain file transfer means; and certain file synchronization means.","The host processing means are in communication with the remote processing means, and the graphical user interface means are in communication with, and operable via said host processing means as are the media player means. The media player means comprise or cooperate with certain play list folder generation means for generating and\/or visually displaying a drop box-enabled play list folder as at  upon the graphical user interface.","The folder populating means are operable via said host processing means for selectively populating said play list folder with (1) a dynamic audio\/media file play list and (2) listed audio\/media tracks associated with said audio\/media file play list. The file transfer means are operable via the host processing means for transferring audio\/media file data intermediate the remote and host processing means. The file synchronization means are operable via the host and remote processing means for synchronizing changes to the playlist folder with the remote processing means. Play list changes are believed preferably made via interface-enabled drag-and-drop functionality.","The synchronization means preferably comprise certain data extraction means associated with the host processing means for enabling waveform data extraction from audio\/media file data; certain summary statistic derivation means associated with the host processing means for deriving summary statistics from extracted waveform data; certain custom marker generation means associated with the host processing means for generating a custom marker based on derived summary statistics; and certain marker association means associated with the host processing means for respectively associating generated custom markers with the audio\/media file data for forming marked audio\/media file data.","The audio\/media file synchronization system further preferably comprise certain file storage means in communication with the host processing means for storing transferred audio\/media file data; and certain data comparison means associated with the host processing means for comparing unmarked audio\/media files to stored\/marked audio\/media files. The data comparison means may well function to access the custom markers when comparing unmarked audio\/media file data with marked audio\/media file data for outputting file match status.","The audio\/media file synchronization may preferably further comprise certain nodal processing means in communication with the host processing means via the remote processing means such that the remote processing means enable updated play list synchronization with the nodal processing means. Certain conflict resolution means resolve by timestamp precedence any synchronization conflicts.","The audio\/media file synchronization methodology for synchronizing audio\/media files according to the present invention are believed to essentially comprise the steps of: monitoring audio\/media file play list status within a drop box-enabled play list folder via host processing means; altering audio\/media file play list status within said drop box-enabled play list folder; and comparing altered audio\/media file play list status with monitored audio\/media file play list status via synchronization means during a comparison inquiry.","Non-matching audio\/media file data, as determined by the comparison inquiry, are then transferred to the remote processing means, wherafter an updated audio\/media file play list is re-created at the remote processing means and a global identification is generated via the remote processing means thereby linking the remote processing means with the host processing means and nodal processing means. Audio\/media file data are then transferred to the nodal processing means via the remote processing and synchronization means for synchronizing audio\/media file data between the host and nodal processing means.","The comparison inquiry notably comprises the steps of: analyzing an audio\/media file via analysis means, the audio\/media file having a series of wave properties, the wave properties each having a calculable wave value; calculating wave values from the wave properties via the analysis means, the wave values comprising length segment values; calculating mean, range, and standard deviation values for the length segment values; generating an array of values based on the calculated mean, range, and standard deviation values; generating a file-identifying fingerprint based on the array of values; and associating the file-identifying fingerprint with the audio\/media file for enabling subsequent file matching.","Accordingly, although the present invention has been described by reference to certain preferred systemic arrangements and certain methodologies, it is not intended that the novel arrangements and methods be limited thereby, but that modifications thereof are intended to be included as falling within the broad scope and spirit of the foregoing disclosures and the appended drawings."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other features of our invention will become more evident from a consideration of the following brief descriptions of patent drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 18(","i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 18(","i":"b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 22"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
