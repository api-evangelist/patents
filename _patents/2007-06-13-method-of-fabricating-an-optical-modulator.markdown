title: Method of fabricating an optical modulator
abstract: A method of fabricating an optical modulator on a silicon substrate, comprising: forming a silicon nitride layer on the silicon substrate; forming a first polycrystalline silicon layer (PSL) on the silicon nitride layer; patterning the first PSL; forming a first silicon dioxide layer (SDL) on the first patterned PSL; patterning the first SDL; forming a second PSL on the first patterned SDL; patterning the second PSL; forming a second SDL on the second patterned PSL; patterning the second SDL; forming a third PSL on the second patterned SDL; patterning the third PSL; forming a metal layer on the third patterned PSL; patterning the metal layer; removing the first and second SDLs to effect release of first and second side reflectors; forming an active layer on the metal layer; and patterning the active layer or stack to form a base reflector and associated conductive traces for biasing.

An incident light ray upon the corner cube reflector  from direction A will be reflected back in direction A, i.e., toward the source, if it reflects off the three plano-reflective surfaces , , and . Corner cube reflectors  with a movable base mirror , as shown in , show promise as optical modulators. However, achieving proper alignment and planarity of the base mirror  during the fabrication process has proved challenging. Furthermore, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) require hermetic packaging to avoid stiction and other reliability problems.

Examples include scratch drive actuators using microelectromechanical structures as practiced in the art of microassembly. Similarly, piezoelectric transducers as practiced in the art could be integrated to self-assemble the corner cube following fabrication. Other materials, biasing sources, and layers can be used in the optical modulator, but the simplest embodiments were described to convey the operational concept. For example, the reflective components , , and  of  may use aluminum, gold, silver or metallic alloys or multi-layers or dielectric reflective layers to optimize reflection based on the wavelengths desired for operation and anticipated incident angles. Also, more than one reflector may be biased to modulate the reflected electromagnetic intensity. Finally, a variety of sensors may be employed, either identical or different, in a system configuration and operatively coupled to the optical modulator.","Described herein is a method for making the new optical modulator, a system incorporating the new optical modulator, and a method for using the new optical modulator, The optical modulator uses a corner cube concept to redirect the optical energy back in the direction of the source of the light, and can therefore be interrogated by a remote source. Coupling of the corner cube reflector of the optical modulator to a sensor enables a very low power method of transmitting information from the sensor to a remote source. An advantage of the optical modulator described herein is the elimination of moving parts associated with the prior art. Moving parts cause problems associated with release etches during fabrication, and reliability of the miniature membranes due to stiction and mechanical stresses. These latter problems in reality are daunting, and have only partially been overcome using expensive hermetic packaging technologies.","Clearly, many modifications and variations of the optical modulator are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the optical modulator may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the optical modulator, reference is now made to the following detailed description of the embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A to 7G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
