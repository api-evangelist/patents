The voltage change generated on the carrier at this time was monitored, and a value for [a total electrical charge (\u03bcC) after 90 seconds)\/amount (g) of toner aspirated] was defined as triboelectric charges (\u03bcC\/g). A ratio between triboelectric charges after a mixing time of 180 seconds and triboelectric charges after a mixing time of 1,200 seconds, i.e. triboelectric charges after a mixing time of 1,200 seconds\/triboelectric charges after a mixing time of 180 seconds, was calculated, and triboelectric stability was evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation criteria.

During the course of printing, black solid images were printed for every 500 sheets, and the presence or absence of the lines on the formed images was confirmed. At the point where the generation of the lines was confirmed, printing was stopped. The test was conducted up to 5,000 sheets at the maximum. Durability was evaluated by defining the number of printed sheets at the point where the generation of lines was visually confirmed on the images as the number of sheets at which lines were generated by fusion or fixing of toner on a developer roller, in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. In other words, it can be judged that the larger the number of sheets without generation of lines, the higher the durability of toner.
