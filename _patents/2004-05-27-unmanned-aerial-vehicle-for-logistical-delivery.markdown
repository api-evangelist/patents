title: Unmanned aerial vehicle for logistical delivery
abstract: A hollow elliptical-cylindrical hull conformingly houses a hollow rectangular-prismatic cabin whereby the four longitudinal parallel outside edges of the latter make contact with the inside surface of the former. The fully constructed aircraft (either non-powered or powered) includes the integral hull-plus-cabin structure along with nose, tail and airfoil structures that are coupled therewith. The cabin conformingly accommodates hollow rectangular-prismatic modules useful for cargo storage. While the nose and/or tail structure is uncoupled from the integral hull-plus-cabin structure, the modules are inserted into the cabin and the cabin is sealed. The aircraft is lifted (e.g., via airplane, helicopter, rocket or balloon) to a particular elevation and released, whereupon the two wings fully emerge and the aircraft effects controlled flight until reaching its destination. After landing, the nose and/or tail structure is uncoupled from the integral hull-plus-cabin structure, the cabin is unsealed, and the modules are removed from the cabin.

No. 60\/479,847, filed 20 Jun. 2003, inventors David W. Byers, Gary A. Hall, Graham D. Hunter, Colen G. Kennell, Aleksander B. Macander, Judah H. Milgram and Jason D. Strickland, entitled \u201cUnmanned Aerial Vehicle for Logistical Delivery,\u201d incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to unmanned vehicles and to methods and systems utilizing unmanned vehicles, more particularly to same involving air transportation.","The United States Navy desires that its forces have a logistics sustainment projection power of up to 200 nautical miles, which is the typical distance from a ship launch point to the preplanned delivery or receipt point on land. Logistics presently available to U.S. forces operating in the littoral and more inland regions of the world depend on supplies being shipped in a conventional manner using existing air-based, ship-based or land-based assets. These methods of delivery, generally encompassed by what is referred to as the \u201ciron mountain\u201d approach, are ponderous. The iron mountain approach to cargo transport is constantly at risk of attack, is inherently expensive and requires considerable distribution logistics.","Various U.S. Department of Defense troop components (e.g., the Marine Corps and the US Army Special Operations units) are actively pursuing advanced parachute and airdrop technologies such as high altitude, deployable, precision airdrop systems for payload weights in the range of 200 to 40,000 pounds. High altitude delivery significantly reduces but does not eliminate aircraft vulnerability. Moreover, considerable cost is associated with dedicated manned missions of this kind. Although aircraft risk and loss may be minimized or limited, cost remains a critical consideration.","An unmanned vehicle is an autonomous or semi-autonomous craft that performs one or more functions as if one or more persons were aboard. In recent years developmental interest in unmanned land, sea, air and space vehicles and vehicle systems has increased for a variety of military and civilian applications. Unmanned vehicle use has potential economic and risk benefits. Especially attractive is the ability of unmanned vehicles to perform dangerous or hazardous tasks without risk to humans. \u201cUnmanned aerial vehicles\u201d (abbreviated \u201cUAVs\u201d) are also referred to as \u201cunpiloted aircraft\u201d or \u201cflying drones.\u201d","The following U.S. patent documents, incorporated herein by reference, are informative about unmanned aerial vehicles or control systems pertaining thereto: Grieser U.S. Pat.

Jun. 3\u20135, 1997 pages 224\u2013253, American Institute of Aeronautics and Aeronautics, Inc. 1997.","In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a methodology for effecting military logistical payload delivery in a safe, reliable, effective and economical manner.","The present invention provides method, apparatus and system suitable for meeting logistics delivery requirements of the U.S. Navy. The inventive methodology is based on the launching of a gliding vehicle (e.g., \u201cglider\u201d) from a land-based, sea-based or air-based platform. As contemplated by the inventors, typically the launch platform will be located far offshore, wherein the unmanned payload vehicles will be launched from any of a variety of non-dedicated air and naval platforms operating at risk-free standoff distances from hostile shores. The present invention represents a supply-and-distribution approach for payload delivery to small operational troop units on an as-needed basis, using inexpensive, autonomous, un-powered, quiet, unmanned payload vehicles.","Typical embodiments of the inventive apparatus are suitable for inclusion by an air transport vehicle. The inventive apparatus comprises a hollow cylinder, a plurality of minor boxes for containing cargo, and a major box for containing the minor boxes. The hollow cylinder and the major box are joined so that the major box has four parallel edges touching the hollow cylinder. The minor boxes each fit within the major box and are capable of introduction and withdrawal with respect to the major box.","A typical cargo conveyance system in accordance with the present invention comprises an unmanned aerial vehicle and launching means. The unmanned aerial vehicle includes a hollow cylinder, a major box and a plurality of minor boxes. The major box is for containing the minor boxes. The minor boxes are for containing cargo. The hollow cylinder and the major box are joined so that the major box has four parallel edges touching the hollow cylinder. Each minor box fits within the major box and is capable of introduction and withdrawal with respect to the major box. The launching means is for moving (e.g., elevating or boosting) the unmanned aerial vehicle to a selected altitude, and typically to a selected position (e.g., geographic location) as well. The unmanned aerial vehicle and the launching means are separable when the unmanned aerial vehicle reaches the selected altitude. According to usual inventive practice, the launching means includes an airplane, a helicopter, a rocket or a balloon.","A typical inventive method for conveying cargo comprises: providing a fuselage section including a hollow cylinder and a major box, the hollow cylinder and the major box being joined so that the major box has four parallel edges touching the hollow cylinder; depositing cargo inside at least one minor box that fits inside said major box; placing at least one minor box inside the major box; uniting the fuselage section, a nose section, a tail section and plural airfoils, thereby forming at least a portion of an aerial vehicle; and, causing the aerial vehicle to be airborne while carrying the cargo. Many preferred inventive embodiments provide for an aerial vehicle that is an unmanned aerial vehicle. The moving of the unmanned aerial vehicle to a selected altitude and\/or position (e.g., longitudinal and\/or latitudinal position) includes the causing of the unmanned aerial vehicle to be airborne and the separating of the unmanned aerial vehicle and the moving means when the unmanned aerial vehicle reaches the selected altitude and\/or position.","The present invention's system, which the inventors style the \u201cAdvanced Logistics Delivery System\u201d (acronymously designated \u201cALDS\u201d), supports the need to deliver supplies to dispersed U.S. special operational units located in rear offshore locations, and supports the need to do so reliably, on demand, twenty-fours hours a day and independently of environmental conditions. Of primary import to inventive practice, the inventive ALDS uses a low cost, disposable, unmanned, autonomous and un-powered aerial vehicle that can be operated off of a variety of launch platforms. It is anticipated that, as typically embodied if adopted by the U.S. Navy, the inventive ALDS will be capable of meeting long distance delivery goals (e.g., delivering up to 1,000 pounds or more of payload over a distance of up to 200 nautical miles) at low cost.","For most applications, the inventive UAV is preferably a glider. A glider is an un-powered vehicle (for which no fuel is required), the flight of which is based essentially on gravity and aerodynamics. A powered vehicle advantageously affords greater range as compared with a glider. However, unlike a glider, a powered vehicle is a potential source of an acoustic (e.g., noise) and\/or infrared signature. Moreover, generally speaking, powered aircraft are more expensive than un-powered aircraft to develop and manufacture. Nevertheless, both powered aircraft, and glider aircraft will have a visual signature. In addition, in contrast to un-powered flight, powered flight might involve sacrifice of some storage space, due to the necessary accommodation of aircraft engines and other machinery related to powering the vehicle.","For most applications, the present invention's unmanned payload-carrying vehicle includes a body and a pair of wings. The inventive glider's body includes a nose, a fuselage (to be utilized for carrying a payload) and an empennage (i.e., a tail). The wings include port and starboard aerodynamic surfaces and are characterized by port and starboard airfoils. The inventive glider represents a unique carrier that lends itself to inexpensive construction and is thus disposable on landing. The inventive glider preferably includes a low-cost, rigid, composite sandwich construction for the fuselage and empennage, and a low-cost energy-absorbent composite foam construction for the nose. The fuselage structure, the empennage structure and the nose structure are each characterized by adequate aerodynamic strength and rigidity. The inventive glider's wings, which are initially stowed inside or adjacent to the fuselage, deploy to full extension (e.g., full inflation or full unfolding) when, post launch, the glider reaches a predetermined elevation (e.g., apogee) and position (e.g., geographic location). The stiffened inflatable wings are deployed \u201con demand\u201d while in flight at the selected elevation pursuant to preprogrammed criteria.","According to current logistics practices, the \u201ciron mountain\u201d approach is followed for purposes of re-supplying troops in the field. Basically, the iron mountain approach implies that there is one large central deposit of supplies, that these supplies are originally brought in by ship or heavy air transport, and that these supplies are then distributed to smaller Special Operations (\u201cSpec Ops\u201d) troop units operating far afield. Dedicated transport by air (e.g., helicopter, etc.) or by land (e.g., truck, pack mule, etc.) is required to accomplish the distribution and breakdown of these smaller amounts of supplies, thereby putting personnel operating these transport vehicles in harm's way. In addition to carrying a considerable personal risk, the iron mountain distribution system is economically inefficient, since personnel and equipment are better used for fighting rather than for transporting goods.","In contrast, the present invention's ALDS implements unmanned aero-glide, un-powered, autonomous payload vehicles that can carry smaller amounts of supplies for delivery to Spec Ops troops in the field. The inventive supply approach is essentially characterized by low risk to personnel because they will tend to be out of harm's way. The inventive system can be practiced at a fraction of the cost that would obtain if the delivery vehicle were manned. The inventive ALDS is based on an un-powered, expendable delivery UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) that is noiseless and hence more suitable for covert operations than is a powered vehicle.","The inventive system will not only be capable of achieving Spec Ops cargo delivery, but will also be capable of performing tactical surveillance and monitoring of any ground activity of interest in real time, via simple onboard video telemetry, as the unmanned vehicle glides in to target. The inventive system's vehicle configuration, its dimensional characteristics and\/or its payload capacity (currently envisioned to be approximately 1,000 pounds) can be designed to suit requirements of multifarious civilian and\/or military applications such as those involving humanitarian missions.","Various aspects of the present invention are disclosed by the following paper, incorporated herein by reference: Judah Milgram, Jason Strickland, Alexander Macander and Graham Hunter, \u201cAutonomous Glider Systems for Logistics Delivery,\u201d presented at the AUVSI (Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International) 2003 Unmanned Systems Symposium and Exposition, Baltimore Convention Center, Baltimore, Md., Jul. 15\u201317, 2003. This paper, coauthored by four of the present inventors, is included pre-presentation as \u201cAppendix A\u201d (15 pages) in the aforementioned U.S. Provisional application. In addition, future publication is planned of a U.S. Navy technical report, to be published by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, 9500 MacArthur Boulevard, West Bethesda, Md., 20817-5700.","Other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Referring now to  through , inventive glider  is an unmanned, disposable, mass-producible, structural vehicle. At least substantially made of composite materials, inventive glider  is relatively lightweight, yet is sufficiently robust to withstand loads associated with launch (especially, rocket launch), flight, landing and carrying cargo. Inventive glider  is sufficiently versatile to accommodate different launch methodologies. It can support two-hundred-mile military logistics missions, and allows for range variations.","Inventive glider  includes a body  and a pair of wings (airfoils) , viz., port wing and starboard wing . Body  includes three body sections, viz., a nose , a fuselage  and a tail . Fuselage  is attached flush to rounded nose  at the front end  of fuselage , and is attached flush to tail  at the back end  of fuselage . Tail , the entire empennage assembly, includes casing  and three stabilizers , and , circumferentially arranged at 120 degrees of separation as shown in . Wings  can also include control surfaces such as a pair of flaps and\/or a pair of ailerons. Tail  can also include control surfaces such as a rudder or a pair of elevators.","Reference is now made to  and , which pertain to an inventive embodiment having a geometry that differs from that shown in  through . In inventive practice, the stabilizers  need not be arranged 120 degrees apart such as shown in , representative of a \u201crocket\/missile-style\u201d stabilizer arrangement which is especially suitable for inventive ALDS embodiments involving a rocket  launch of glider . Instead, for instance, stabilizers and can be horizontal stabilizers while stabilizer (similarly as shown in ) is a vertical stabilizer. Particularly significant among the vehicle design (e.g., configurational and aerodynamic) characteristics presented in  are the gross weight, the wingspan and the aspect ratio. The rate of descent at best glide speed may be less critical than some other design characteristics in inventive practice. According to many inventive embodiments, these and other characteristics will to some degree be similar to those of many recreational sailplanes. The inventive glider  shown in  has an overall length of about 13.5 feet, based on a fuselage length of about 9 feet, a nose length of about 1.5 feet, and a tail length of about 3 feet. As distinguished from the inventive glider  shown in , the inventive glider  shown in  through  features a more slender wing design. A typical embodiment of the inventive glider depicted in  through  will have a span of 36 feet, a length of 13 feet, a gross weight of 1,500 pounds, a wing area of 118.4 square feet, and an aspect ratio of 11.","Sailplanes have been manufactured with aspect ratios roughly varying between about eight and about forty, some even higher. Generally speaking, higher aspect ratios will tend to improve gliding capabilities (e.g., gliding distances), especially by reducing induced drag associated with wing tip vortices. The aspect ratio of 9.9, indicated in , is consistent with an aspect ratio on the order of ten, a minimum value characterizing some sailplanes. Known in the art are the important design considerations for glider aircraft, such as taught by the following definitive textbook (translated by joint inventor Judah H. Milgram), incorporated herein by reference: Fred Thomas, , Judah Milgram, translator, 3edition, College Park Press, College Park, Md., 01 Sep. 1999. In the light of the instant disclosure, known glider design principles such as disclosed by Thomas can be successfully brought to bear in a variety of contexts by the ordinarily skilled artisan who seeks to practice the present invention.","With reference to  through , fuselage  includes a hollow cylindrical shell  and a hollow box-shaped storage container . The geometric shape defined by the exterior surface  of container  can be synonymously described as a rectangular prism or a rectangular parallelepiped. The exterior surface  and the interior surface  of fuselage shell  each describe a cylindrical geometric shape. The interior surface  of fuselage shell  circumscribes the interior void  of fuselage shell , the shell void  running axially-longitudinally through the interior of fuselage shell . The interior surface  of container  can describe a rectangular prism (rectangular parallelepiped) shape (e.g., as shown in ) or another shape such as a regular trapezoidal prism shape (e.g., as shown in ). According to inventive principles, the design of fuselage shell  will entail consideration mainly of its aerodynamic purpose and its structural purpose. That is, shell  not only constitutes an aerodynamic fairing for container , but also constitutes a structural component that, in combination with container , results in a fuselage  having a requisite degree of structural integrity.","The terms \u201ccylinder,\u201d \u201ccylindrical,\u201d \u201ccone\u201d and \u201cconical,\u201d as used herein, are defined herein in accordance with their broadest accepted meanings. The terms \u201ccylinder\u201d and \u201ccylindrical\u201d refer to any geometric surface generated by a straight line (\u201cgeneratrix\u201d) moving parallel to a fixed straight line and intersecting a fixed closed plane curve (\u201cdirectrix\u201d), wherein the fixed straight line is neither on nor parallel to the plane of the directrix. Otherwise expressed, a cylindrical surface is traced out by the generatrix, which moves parallel to itself and always passes through the directrix. The terms \u201ccone\u201d and \u201cconical,\u201d as used herein, refer to any geometric surface generated by a straight line (\u201cgeneratrix\u201d) passing through a fixed point (\u201cvertex\u201d) and intersecting a fixed closed plane curve (\u201cdirectrix\u201d), wherein the fixed point is not on nor parallel to the plane of the directrix.","The terms \u201cellipse\u201d and \u201celliptical\u201d are intended herein to be descriptive in an approximative and inclusive geometric sense rather than in the strictest geometric sense. The terms \u201cellipse and elliptical,\u201d as used herein, refer to any closed plane curve wherein the sum of the distances of each point on the closed plane curve from two fixed points (the \u201cfoci\u201d) is the same constant, or is approximately, generally or nearly so. As defined herein, the terms \u201cellipse\u201d and \u201celliptical\u201d subsume circularity. Technically speaking, the terms \u201ccircle\u201d and \u201ccircular\u201d denote equidistance everywhere of a closed plane curve from a fixed point (the \u201ccenter\u201d). As intended herein, a circle is a type of ellipse wherein the two foci are practically coincident, thus effectively representing a \u201ccenter.\u201d In other words, an \u201cellipse\u201d as intended herein can be essentially characterized by \u201croundness\u201d (having a shape like a circle) or by \u201covalness\u201d (having a shape like a stretched circle). Of course, ellipses and circles meeting their strict mathematical definitions necessarily meet the less strict definition of \u201cellipse\u201d adopted herein. The term \u201cellipsoid\u201d refers herein to a closed three-dimensional geometric surface all of the plane sections of which are \u201cellipses\u201d as defined herein.","According to usual inventive practice, the directrix of the cylindrical fuselage shell  describes a shape\u2014whether circular or noncircular, elliptical or non-elliptical\u2014that is characterized by symmetry either with respect to the center point of the closed planar curve, or with respect to a line bisecting the center point of the closed planar curve. The cylinder can be a \u201cright\u201d cylinder (i.e., the cylindrical shape is a \u201cright\u201d cylindrical shape), referring to the movement of the directrix so as to be perpendicular to the plane of the directrix; or, the cylinder can be an \u201coblique\u201d cylinder (i.e., the cylindrical shape is an \u201coblique\u201d cylindrical shape), referring to the movement of the directrix so as to be oblique (non-perpendicular) with respect to the plane of the directrix.","According to typical inventive practice, the directrix describes an elliptical shape, either circular or non-circular. A non-circular elliptical cylindrical fuselage shell  has an elliptical cross-section, such as shown in , , , ,  and . Fuselage shell  is shown in the figures herein to describe a hollow, open-ended elliptical cylinder. The exterior surface  and the interior surface  of fuselage shell  each describe a cylindrical geometric shape that is non-circularly elliptical, the respective outer and inner elliptical shapes being geometrically similar to each other. Fuselage shell  is symmetrical about longitudinal geometric axis a, the imaginary axis of symmetry generally described by body . Fuselage shell  is open at both of its longitudinal ends  and . In the light of the instant disclosure, the ordinarily skilled artisan will readily envision the endless possibilities for the cross-sectional shape, circular and non-circular, of elliptically cylindrical fuselage shell .","As shown in , nose  has a non-circular elliptical cross-section. Nose  describes the shape of an extreme three-dimensional section of an ellipsoid. Nose  is symmetrical about longitudinal geometric axis a. In the light of the instant disclosure, the ordinarily skilled artisan will readily envision the endless possibilities for the cross-sectional shape, circular and non-circular, of sectionally ellipsoidal nose . Some inventive embodiments provide for a less rounded shape of nose  than that shown in , e.g., a more pointed shape akin to that of a rocket's or missile's \u201cnose cone. In fact, it is possible to practice the present invention so that nose  has a conical or near-conical shape closely resembling that of many rockets or missiles.","As shown in , casing  of tail  has the shape of a non-extreme three-dimensional section of an elliptical cone, casing  as shown having a non-circular elliptical cross-section. Tail casing  is shown in  to have a cone shape. Tail casing  is symmetrical about longitudinal geometric axis a. In the light of the instant disclosure, the ordinarily skilled artisan will readily envision the endless possibilities for the cross-sectional shape, circular and non-circular, of a conical or sectionally elliptically conical tail casing .","As illustrated in , , ,  and , in the fully assembled fuselage , fuselage shell  is coupled with and encloses storage container , which is situated in the interior void  of fuselage shell . Fuselage shell  represents a kind of aerodynamic \u201cfairing\u201d for storage container . Fuselage shell  and storage container  are each symmetrical with respect to the same longitudinal geometric axis a. The horizontal long diameter of the shell  elliptical cross-section coincides with the horizontal long bisector of the container  rectangular cross-section; the vertical short diameter of the shell  elliptical cross-section coincides with the vertical short bisector of the container  rectangular cross-section.","Shell  and container  together represent an integral structure. Storage container  has twelve exterior edges including four longitudinal edges, viz., , , and . Fuselage shell  encloses storage container  so that the four longitudinal edges  of storage container  are contiguous with the interior surface  of fuselage shell , storage container  thereby lending a significant degree of structural support to fuselage shell . For the vast majority of inventive embodiments, the combination of shell  and container  will be structurally \u201cfixed\u201d by virtue of the interrelationship of their respective geometries. A notable exception to this generalization is the combination of a circularly cross-sectioned shell  and a squarely cross-sectioned container , a combination that would possibly lend itself to relative rotation of shell  and container  about the longitudinal geometric axis of symmetry a.","Fuselage shell  and storage container  are shown herein to be longitudinally coextensive; that is, the front end  and the back end  of fuselage shell  are even, respectively, with the front end face and the back end face (or the front end face and the back end face ) of storage container . Nevertheless, in accordance with inventive principles, it is neither essential that shell  and container  have equal lengths, nor essential that one or both ends of fuselage  be characterized by evenness of shell  and container . Depending on the inventive embodiment, storage container  can be shorter than, equal to, or greater than fuselage shell . According to most inventive embodiments, storage container  will be equal in length or shorter than fuselage , and will fall within the length of the fuselage shell . Nevertheless, according to some inventive embodiments, container  will be longer than shell , and\/or will protrude from at least one end of shell .","Fabrication of fuselage  can involve the use of any of various known techniques for making composite structures. For instance, shell  and container  can be separately manufactured to suitable tolerances, and then coupled by fitting container  inside of shell . Shell  can be made using composite manufacture techniques such as filament winding or extrusion. Container  can be made using composite manufacture techniques such as resin transfer molding (RTM). It is also possible to create shell  directly around container , such as by providing four removable mandrel sections and placing them adjacent to container side (lengthwise) faces , , , (thereby forming the desired inside cylindrical shape of the shell ), filament winding composite material around the crafted mandrel, and removing the four mandrel sections.","Storage container  thus has two primary functions. Firstly, storage container  is suitable for containing cargo\u2014i.e., any of a variety of objects. Secondly, storage container  lends structural strength to fuselage  specifically and to inventive glider  generally. The container's propitious structural influence on the fuselage's structure strength may be furthered as the cross-sectional shape of the shell more closely approximates a \u201cpurely\u201d circular or \u201cpurely\u201d elliptical shape (\u201cpurely\u201d in terms of their strict mathematical definitions), as the structural engineering associated with the symmetrical balance drawn between the shell and the container may tend to be more favorable as the shell's cross-sectional shape approaches circular or elliptical purity. In addition, the container's augmentation of the fuselage's structural strength may be enhanced by the presence of cargo within storage container , especially when the cargo includes modules such as box-shaped (rectangular prism or rectangular parallelepiped) storage compartments , particularly well shown in  and  through .","Storage compartments  are conformal with respect to the interior surface  of storage container . As shown in  through , each storage compartment  has an interior storage space  and, on the exterior, is dimensionally and geometrically compatible with storage container . By virtue of this configurational concordance, a compartment  that is introduced within container space  (i.e., inside interior container surface ) will directly lend structural strength to storage container , and hence will indirectly lend structural strength to fuselage . The imparting by the compartments  of structural strength will tend to increase in accordance with increasing numbers of compartments  and increasing extents to which compartments  fill or occupy container space . Optimal contribution of structural strength by compartments  may occur when compartments  are stacked end-to-end (between front end  and back end ) within container space  so as to completely or nearly completely occupy container space . Furthermore, this kind of structural enhancement by the compartments  may be especially manifest when the compartments  themselves are stuffed with cargo (and hence strengthened thereby) within their respective compartment spaces .","Storage container , exteriorly shaped like a rectangular parallelepiped or rectangular prism, is a six-faced (six-sided) box-like structure that forms a closed figure on five exterior faces, viz., container side faces , , , and container end face . Each edge  is the junction formed by two adjacent faces . In addition to the integral portion formed by faces , , , and , storage container  has an attachable (installable) and detachable (un-installable) sixth face, viz., container end face . According to inventive practice, the attachable\/detachable container end face can be positioned at either the front longitudinal end  or the back longitudinal end  of fuselage . Particularly referring to , the attachable\/detachable container end face is an independent piece that can be secured to the integral main portion  of container  and removed therefrom, using various techniques such as those implementing screws, bolts, clips, latches or adhesives. Some inventive embodiments provide for an attachable\/detachable container end face that is not completely separable from the integral main portion  of container , but remains associated (e.g., via a hinge in a manner such as shown for compartment  in ) and is fastenable or otherwise securable. Some inventive embodiments provide for two attachable\/detachable container end faces (e.g., end faces and ), one at each end of container .","The interior space  of container  is useful for housing one or more compartments . Container  can be opened via removal of its end face , then totally or partially filled inside its space  with modular compartments  containing supplies, and then closed (sealed) via replacement of its end face . Spacing, separating or insulating members such as partition  can be suitably utilized for filling, distributing or protecting the cargo. Partition  is shown to have a rectangular box shape analogous to that of the compartments . The entire interior space  of storage container  can be filled with storage  compartments (or with some combination of storage compartments  and partitions ) that are longitudinally stacked in such a way as to effectively constitute an integral structure that furthers the structural enhancement that storage compartment  affords fuselage shell . In such a manner, container  can be \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d so as to hold diverse entities such as munitions, food, water and fuel. The partitions  can be used for separating adjacent dissimilar compartments  for sanitary or other reasons (e.g., to separate food from fuel).","Each individual compartment  is a robust rectangular box (shaped like a rectangular parallelepiped or rectangular prism) that can be opened, filled with objects (e.g., supplies), and closed. Compartments  each have an exterior compartment surface  that is compatible with the interior container surface . Many inventive embodiments provide for compartments  made of strong yet light composite material. It may be more efficient in some inventive applications to prepackage the compartments . As exemplified in , a compartment  can be a six-faced (six-sided) box structure, similar to a cigar box, which forms a closed figure on five faces (, , , , ) and has a sixth face, lid , that is pivotable, rotatable or swingable such as via hinge . The six faces  define exterior compartment surface  on the outside and interior compartment surface  on the inside. No elaborate latching mechanism for compartments  would be required according to most inventive embodiments.","The modularity of compartments  is geometrically illustrated in  through  by the \u00bd-foot-by-\u00bd-foot geometric cubical regions that form the storage space  of a storage container  having the dimensions of length=9 feet, width=2 feet, and height=1 foot. As shown in , and similarly as shown in , container space  is occupied by nine compartments , longitudinally stacked, each compartment  having the dimensions of length=1 foot, width=2 feet, and height=1 foot. However, the dimensions of compartments  can be varied and still afford modularity for a given container space ; for instance, 1 ft\u00d71 ft\u00d71 ft compartments , and\/or 2 ft\u00d71 ft compartments , and\/or 1 ft\u00d72 ft\u00d71 ft compartments , etc., can be used in various combinations. In the light of the instant disclosure, the diverse geometric strategies for achieving the \u201cmodularization\u201d of container  and the compartments  contained thereby will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.","As shown in , the interior surface  of container  has a regular trapezoidal prism shape that differs from the rectangular prism shape of the exterior surface  of container . In , interior space  of container  has a regular trapezoidal cross-section. In a manner analogous to the opening and closing of a kitchen drawer, compartments  can be moved into and out of the fuselage chamber using a railing mechanism , which includes skids, rails and\/or rollers. A simpler container shape is depicted in , in which the interior surface  of container  has a rectangular prism shape similar to that of the exterior surface  of container . As shown in , interior space  of container  has a rectangular cross-section. The rectangular box-shaped compartments  and rectangular box-shaped partitions  can be moved into and out of the interior space  of container , with mechanical assistance, by means of sliding along the flat bottom portion of the interior surface  of container . As compared with a sliding system such as shown in , a railing system such as shown in  may make for easier loading of compartments  inside container . An important consideration for inventive practice generally is the size of the interior storage space  of container . For many inventive applications, it is desirable to maximize or nearly maximize storage space  of container . A larger storage space  will permit situation of larger sized compartments  inside storage space . Space optimization can be inventively achieved, for example, by providing a container  that is relatively thin-walled and yet retains requisite structural integrity.","At least one of the non-fuselage components (i.e., either tail  or nose ) must be separated from fuselage  in order to permit the loading and sealing (via installation in container  of attachable\/detachable container end face ) of container . In other words, it is possible to load and seal container  while neither or one, but not both, of tail  and nose  are attached to fuselage . Once the attachable\/detachable container end face is secured with respect to the rest of container , assembly of glider body  can be completed.","Tail  via casing  (at front tail end ) is attached to fuselage  (at back fuselage end ), thereby forming back junction . At junction , tail casing  and fuselage shell  define approximately equal elliptical cross-sectional shapes, as they should establish a flush connection. Nose  (at back nose surface ) is attached to fuselage  via cylindrical shell  (at front fuselage end ), thereby forming front junction . At junction , tail casing  and fuselage shell  define approximately equal elliptical cross-sectional shapes, as they should establish a flush connection. Typically according to the present invention, the attachments of tail  and nose  to fuselage  will be effected entirely with respect to the cylindrical shell  component of fuselage ; however, some inventive embodiments may prescribe involvement of container  in these couplings.","Nose  is a solid piece having an essentially flat back surface  that, as is shown in  and , abuts the front end face of container  when nose  is attached to fuselage . Nose  includes a high-density foam core  (a solid block of foam) and a composite outer skin (skin overlay)  made of a fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP), such as a graphite-epoxy, characterized by multidimensional fibers. Having a construction analogous to that of a pilot flight helmet having one or more crushable, energy-absorbing foam linings, nose  is designed to insulate glider  and its contents from significant damage by acting as a buffer or shock absorber. In particular, nose  is designed to mitigate shock such as might be associated with the landing of glider  upon a ground surface. As illustrated in , the nose's outer skin , which surrounds the rigid (inflexible) foam core , is shaped like a truncated extreme portion of a three-dimensional ellipsoid. The roundedness of nose skin  not only contributes to a protective (e.g., impact-resistive) function of nose  but also serves to divert airflow around fuselage . Some inventive embodiments may provide for a less than completely solid nose  having a hollow area inside foam core , such as cavity  shown in , for holding electronic apparatus such as relating to command and control.","Like fuselage  and nose , tail  is a rigid structure. Tail  includes a casing , three tail aerodynamic surfaces , and an essentially flat walling structure such as bulkhead , located at the fore end  of tail . There are two basic design directions for tail , namely, open-back or closed-back. An open-back tail  has a tail opening  that is bounded by casing  and bulkhead , located at tail front . A closed-back tail  has a tail opening  that is additionally bounded by an essentially flat walling structure such as panel , located at the back end  of tail . According to typical inventive embodiments providing a closed-back tail , tail opening  is suitable for holding electronic equipment such as actuators. A tail  having a conical casing  such as shown in  is intrinsically closed-back, since it tapers to the vertex of the cone. According to typical inventive embodiments providing an open-back tail , tail opening  is suitable for housing propulsion means such as rocket motor  shown in .","Tail  shown in  is configured along the lines of a rocket or missile, with a view toward use in rocket launch modes of the inventive ALDS. The symmetry characterizing the casing  and the three tail stabilizers  (spaced 120\u00b0 apart) is intended to benefit vertical rocket launch. As illustrated in , tail casing  is shaped like a truncated non-extreme portion of a three-dimensional elliptical cone. Contrastingly, tail casing  shown in  is shaped like a cone. The diameter of tail casing  gradually decreases in the rearward direction; that is, casing  is tapered from tail front end  to tail back end . Tail bulkhead , located at tail front , abuts the back end face of container  when tail  is attached to fuselage . Hence, back nose surface  and bulkhead  abut the opposite longitudinal end faces and , respectively, of container . In conjunction, nose surface  and bulkhead  help to hold container  and compartments  in place in response to anticipated loadings associated with any and all phases of flight of the fully assembled glider .","In accordance with the present invention, the two wings and will typically be extendable, either inflatedly extendable or unfoldingly extendable. Inflatable wings  may be more frequently employed in inventive practice than will be foldable fixed extendable wings . A foldable fixed extendable wing is advantageous in its capacity to include ailerons or other flaps or control surfaces; hence, as distinguished from inflatable wings, active control of foldable fixed extendable wings (e.g., using ailerons or other flaps or control surfaces) is feasible. Because an inflatable wing will tend to be simpler and less expensive to implement, an inflatable wing may be the preferred mode for many inventive embodiments. A disadvantage of an inflatable wing is that it cannot be provided with any control surfaces (at least, not without great difficulty); hence, control of an inflatable wing will usually be accomplished exclusively by control surfaces (e.g., rudders) in the tail section, since the inflatable wing will have no control surfaces, essentially being a mere lifting device.","Particularly with reference to , aerodynamic surfaces (such as control surfaces, airbrakes, etc.) will normally be necessary in inventive practice in order to control the flight of glider  so that it suitably glides toward and lands at the destination. The various aerodynamic surfaces shown in  (and ) are shown for illustrative purposes, only, of the various kinds of aerodynamic surfaces that can be used in inventive practice.  herein is not intended to suggest that all of the aerodynamics surfaces are necessarily recommended in inventive practice, or that the present invention is recommended to be practiced with individual surfaces exactly as shown. Of particular note, inflatable wings  as inventively practiced will generally not have any aerodynamic surfaces other than the wings themselves; unfoldable wings  as inventively practiced may similarly lack such auxiliary surfaces due to expenses or impracticalities of providing same. If wings  do include auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces, wings  for instance can include one or two pairs of flaps\/ailerons and , and perhaps a pair of spoilers and ; tail  can include a pair of elevators and , and a rudder . It may be preferred in inventive practice to provide a single elevator  across the port and starboard sides in tail . It may also be preferred in inventive practice to provide just outboard ailerons and , in the absence of inboard flaps and . Some inventive embodiments may provide a single aileron or . In the light of the instant disclosure, the ordinarily skilled artisan will be capable, in inventive practice, of effectuating auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces such as flaps\/ailerons , spoilers  and elevators  shown in , and\/or rudder  shown in .","As noted hereinabove, when the present invention is practiced so as to involve inflatable wings , there will usually be no auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces associated with inflatable wings ; such will frequently be the case for unfoldable wings , as well. In the many inventive embodiments for which there are no auxiliary surfaces in the wings , inventive glider  can be flown solely using aerodynamic surfaces in the tail . This is comparable to model airplanes that are flown \u201crudder only, \u201d relying on \u201cdihedral\u201d to effect roll control. Even in the absence of auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces in wings , the ordinarily skilled artisan who reads the instant disclosure will be capable, in inventive practice, of controlling flight by only using aerodynamic surfaces in tail . In this regard, the aforementioned book Fred Thomas, , will be instructive, especially its section entitled \u201cEmpennage and Controls.\u201d Other inventive embodiments may provide for rotatability of wings  for contributing toward control of inventive glider , albeit such wings  would lack auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces.","Haggard U.S. Pat.

As illustrated in , the port and starboard inflatable wings and each include a cloth outer covering  (including fabric mesh outer skin and a rubber, e.g., neoprene, inner lining), non-rigid (flexible) foam , and plural inflatable tubular spars  surrounded by the foam  and running span-wise through the wing . The inflatable spars  are made of a similar type of cloth material including fabric mesh outside and rubber (e.g., neoprene) inside. The inflatable wing  is configured toward inflatability to a pre-designed shape. Each inflatable wing  inflates by means of inflation of the spars. That is, the wing does not inflate in its entirety; rather, only the spars  inflate. When in a deflated condition, the two wings and are \u201cpacked\u201d (e.g., fan-folded or accordion-folded) against their respective sides of the fuselage ; alternatively, the two wings and can be temporarily confined to enclosing (e.g., shell-like) structures on the sides of fuselage . When the spars are pressurized (e.g., maximally inflated), this results in a high bending modulus (high resistance to bending) of the wing, thereby contributing to the imposition of a desired shape of the fully and rigidly deployed wing.","Among the manufacturers of inflatable wings is Vertigo Inc. (mailing address P.O. Box 117, Lake Elsinore, Calif. 92531-0117; shipping address 29885 2nd Street, Suite N, Lake Elsinore, Calif. 92532; phone 909-674-0604; fax 909-674-5461; website http:\/\/www.vertigo-inc.com\/home.html). The Vertigo Inc. web page on inflatable wings, http:\/\/www.vertigo-inc.com\/Aeronautical_Systems\/GLOV\/GLOV.html, includes a series of photographs illustrating the wing deployment sequence. It is stated therein that the Vertigo Inc.'s inflatable \u201cwing consists of foam wrapped over inflatable spars and covered with cloth. The spars are inflated through a common manifold. The structural integrity of the wing comes from the series of inflatable spars in the wing. These spars are made of a flexible composite. The composite consists of a urethane gas barrier wrapped with a high strength fiber braid in a thermoplastic adhesive matrix. The wing spars are made in several different diameters (the largest being around \u00be\u201d) to give the airfoil shape to the wing. The wing spars are covered with open cell foam and a nylon fabric shell to form the smooth wing surfaces. The working pressure of the wing spars is 300 psi, which makes them very rigid. There are spar caps on the top and the bottom of the wing spars which give even more g-loading capability.\u201d","Frequent inventive practice will provide for gaseous inflatability of the wing spars. Nevertheless, it may be advantageous to use a liquid rather than a gas to inflate an inflatable wing spar (e.g., a spar  shown in ). Using liquid instead of gas may prove especially effective in inventive embodiments in which a particular liquid (e.g., potable water, orange juice, cleaner, fuel, etc.) needs to be carried onboard anyway, and hence can be at least partially contained as the inflating fluid. Use of liquid instead of gas may afford benefits aside from considerations of cargo-carrying efficiency. Firstly, distributing the mass of a liquid along the wingspan may be structurally favorable, as compared with gas, because the liquid reduces wing bending moments (i.e., reduces concentrated loads). Furthermore, use of liquid (instead of gas) may reduce energy requirements to inflate the spar. Once the spar is fully inflated to zero gauge pressure, it will take much less work to pump it up to full structural pressure if the fluid is incompressible (or nearly so). To illustrate this point with a limiting case, for an ideally incompressible fluid in an infinitely stiff spar, the work required would be zero, while the work required to bring a gas-filled spar up to pressure would still be finite. Moreover, use of liquid (instead of gas) may simplify the problem of maintaining pressure in the spar following inflation.","Reference is now made to  through , which give examples of the kinds and configurations of composite materials that can be used for making an inventive glider . The material compositions set forth in  pertain to: the outer skin  of nose ; the extreme (\u201csandwiching\u201d) layers and of the sandwich composite shell  of fuselage ; and, the extreme (\u201csandwiching\u201d) layers and of the sandwich composite casing  of tail . The material compositions set forth in  pertain to: the foam core  of nose ; the intermediate (\u201csandwiched\u201d) foam layer  of the sandwich composite shell  of fuselage ; and, the intermediate (\u201csandwiched\u201d) foam layer  of the sandwich composite casing  of tail . With a view toward manufacture of a prototypical inventive glider , the inventors tentatively prefer the material compositions set forth in the rightmost column of  (i.e., the graphite fiber reinforced epoxy resin matrix material, which has a density of 0.057) and the leftmost column of  (i.e., the foam that has a density of 3 pounds per cubic foot). Many kinds and combinations of composite materials other than those set forth in  and  can be used in inventive practice for various parts of glider . For instance, useful for imparting robustness to a composite that includes fiber-reinforced matrix material are commercially available fibers characterized by a high degree of tensile strength, modulus, toughness, dimensional stability and cut resistance, such as Spectra\u00ae (a polyethylene fiber manufactured by Allied Signal) and Kevlar\u00ae (an aramid fiber manufactured by Dupont).","Now referring to  through , many embodiments of the present invention's ALDS use a non-powered aircraft such as glider , thus relying on the aircraft's glide path to reach the destination target. Illustrated in  are four start-to-finish flight paths, viz., the \u201cbaseline\u201d and three variations thereof (numbered \u201c, \u201d \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201d).  demonstrates the versatility of inventive practice in terms of various parameters (including launch distances, launch altitudes and gliding distances) in the context of the entire logistical delivery process from start to finish. The variability of such parameters will to some extent depend upon which mode of launch (e.g., boost, lift, etc.) is employed, for instance, via rocket  (such as shown in ), helicopter  (such as shown in ), airplane  (such as shown in ), or balloon  (such as shown in ).","Each launch mode has its advantages and disadvantages. For instance, as distinguished from helicopter launch and airplane launch, rocket launch and balloon launch not put aircrew at risk. A rocket is potentially hazardous to ground personnel. An airplane may be capable of achieving greater geographical distances than can a helicopter. With people present in a launch vehicle (e.g., a helicopter or airplane), the greater element of human control may be beneficial. A rocket may be capable of achieving higher altitudes, as compared with other launching modes, for releasing the inventive glider . Other considerations pertinent to selection and design of the launch mode include the expense involved, the signature (e.g., acoustic, radar, etc.) of the launching vehicle, and the signature (e.g., acoustic, radar, etc.) of the inventive glider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 24","FIG. 26","FIG. 26"],"b":["40","50","120","50","109","50","40","120","44","44","40","40","146","146","40","44","40"],"i":["p ","s "]},"The more usual inventive embodiments, as emphasized herein, will involve the landing of inventive glider  at the target location. Other inventive embodiments, such as depicted in  and , will involve some kind of parachuting during the flight of glider  at a point that glider  is at an appropriate parachute-deployment height and has reached its destination. As to whether glider landing or parachute landing is preferable, the effects (either upon glider  or container ) of topography and existing obstacles on landing are among the factors to be considered. In any event, inventive practice will generally provide for the necessary survivability of the payload, albeit typical embodiments will call for the expendability of inventive glider .","Shown in  and  are two inventive embodiments implementing parachute ejection mechanism, wherein parachute  is deployed while inventive glider  is approximately directly over the target location but still at an appreciable parachute-capable altitude.  illustrates an inventive embodiment involving parachute drop of inventive glider .  illustrates an inventive embodiment involving parachute drop of the payload container  from inventive glider . With regard to inventive embodiments such as shown in , inventive glider  can be designed, for example, so that fuselage  can be controllably disintegrated in such a way as to discharge container  intact.","For many military applications, the present invention's Advanced Logistics Delivery System (ALDS) represents a simple, effective and affordable system of delivering moderate payloads (e.g., around , pounds) to troops operating far inland by means of autonomous, unmanned, quiet, un-powered vehicles (such as glider ) launched from existing platforms (especially, air-based or sea-based platforms). The inventive ALDS affords unmanned, long distance logistics support at low cost. The present invention's ALDS unites at least three main elements. The most significant element of the inventive ALDS is the inventive UAV, an unmanned and un-powered payload vehicle (such as glider ) that is inexpensive to fabricate and is thus disposable on landing. Other elements of the inventive ALDS are a preprogrammed autonomous flight avionics suite and a multi-variant launch platform.","The present invention's avionics suite will typically include an integrated GPS-based preprogrammed guidance, navigation and control system software that will allow the inventive UAV to be autonomous in flight while being capable of precise landing on target. Preferably, all of these guidance components will be off-the-shelf, low-cost items. The inventive system's multi-variant launch capability will inure from the inventive UAV's admissibility of being launched from a variety of non-dedicated air-based (helicopter, fixed wing transport, etc.), land-based (rocket boost, etc.) or ship-based (rocket boost, helicopter, etc.) platforms. Thus, the inventive ALDS will be able to take advantage of whatever launch facility is available (e.g., in time of need). This launch flexibility characterizing the inventive ALDS is expected to satisfy the logistic demands of delivering Spec Ops payloads under many different launch scenarios.","Other embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this specification or practice of the invention disclosed herein.
