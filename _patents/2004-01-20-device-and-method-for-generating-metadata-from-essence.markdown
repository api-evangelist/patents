title: Device and method for generating metadata from essence
abstract: The generation of metadata shall be simplified. Therefore, a method is presented in which a metadata-template is filled with selected essence and MD-links obtained from a list of links to essence and/or a list of current metadata. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain the MD-links from further metadata or essences directly or indirectly linked with the selected essence.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119 of EPO Application No. 03001175.3 filed on Jan. 21, 2003.","The present invention relates to a method for processing multimedia data including the step of providing at least one selected essence data, wherein essence data represents information being directly perceptible by a user. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a corresponding device for processing multimedia data.","Multimedia data may include metadata being data about data. Metadata is a special kind of data, which is linked to other data called essence. Metadata is typically used as index message for essence. Essence is the basic data, such as text essence, picture essence, video essence, or audio essence.","The metadata structure is essentially characterized by two parts: metadata-essence (MD-essence) and metadata-link (MD-link). MD-essence is part of a metadata, which is designed to be human-perceptible, and which serves as the proxy by which the metadata will be presented to the user in any user interface of systems employing metadata. MD-link is part of the metadata, which links to any kind of essence.","A way how to generate efficient metadata is always an important issue for metadata applications. A possible way for generating metadata is to convert essence into metadata. In practice, some essence, such as text essence or thumbnail picture essence, contains a lot of compact information which can be utilized for metadata. Usually, content of essence can be converted directly into metadata essence. However, it is a problem to generate MD-link data conveniently in case of conversion of essence into metadata.","In view of that it is the object of the present invention to provide a device and a method for conveniently generating MD-link data, while generating metadata from essence.","According to the present invention this object is solved by a method for processing multimedia data including the steps of providing at least one selected essence data, wherein essence data represents information being directly perceptible by a user, providing a metadata template to be used to form at least a first metadata, providing a list of links to a plurality of second essence data and\/or a list of a plurality of second metadata and forming said at least first metadata on the basis of said at least one selected essence data and said list of links and\/or said list of second metadata by applying said metadata template.","Furthermore, according to the present invention there is provided a device for processing multimedia data including first storing means for providing at least one selected essence data, wherein essence data represents information being directly perceptible by a user, second storing means for providing a metadata-template to be used to form at least a first metadata, third storing means for providing a list of links to a plurality of second essence data and\/or a list of a plurality of second metadata and processing means connected to that first, second and third storing means for forming said at least first metadata on the basis of said at least one selected essence data and said list of links and\/or said list of second metadata by applying said metadata-template.","Accordingly, there is provided a basic method and device for conversion of essence into metadata for users with pre-knowledge for generating MD-links. Additionally, there may be provided an advanced method for convertion of essence into metadata based on a relationship-chain between essence and metadata, wherein the user may be without any pre-knowledge for generating MD-links efficiently. In other words, the user is given an intelligent metadata editing method or an assistant tool for metadata editing.","Preferably, second metadata linked with the at least one selected essence data is used for forming the first metadata. This is an essential help for the user to edit the first metadata. He does not have to look through the whole list of current metadata to find content-related further information. Instead of this, the user obtains a valuable hint to closely content correlated essence from the second metadata. Thus he does not have to go through the whole list of current metadata but highly relevant essence data are proposed automatically.","The at least first metadata may be formed by taking over the at least one selected essence into a MD-essence space of the metadata-template. This means, that the essence data or part of essence data are simply transferred to the metadata-template without any transformation.","The at least first metadata is advantageously formed by adding one or more MD-links of the second metadata into a MD-link space of the metadata-template. This means, that the MD-links are simply formed by transferring the MD-links from other metadata into the new metadata without transformation.","Third metadata and\/or third essence data linked with MD-links of the second metadata may be used for forming the MD-essence and\/or metadata-links of the first metadata. Therefore, a relation-chain of links having any length may be used to automatically propose a convenient metadata.","Fortunately, a forming or editing process of the metadata is performed with the help of a graphic user interface (GUI). Such a GUI represents a comfortable assistance tool for editing metadata.","For conversion of essence into metadata, essence data can be directly converted into MD-essence. The problem is how to conveniently generate a meaningful MD-link for it. To solve this problem, a basic and an advanced method are described in the following, which utilize the relationship between existing essence and metadata to generate a significant MD-link.","A basic method, which converts an essence into metadata and utilizes other existing essence or metadata to set up metadata references is composed as following:","I. Basic Method:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["a) As shown in , the task of this basic method is to combine a selected essence  with a provided metadata template . The metadata template  includes a MD-essence  and MD-link(s) .","b) As further shown in , a graphic user interface (GUI)  can browse or operate the following components: the selected essence , the metadata template , a list of links to existing essences  and a list of current existing metadata .","c) Using a GUI  operation, the user may convert the selected essence  into metadata  through taking over essence  into MD-essence . The essence  can be a text, a picture (such as a thumbnail picture), an audio or a video-clip. If the MD-essence  contains a picture, an audio or a video clip, the metadata  is a kind of rich metadata.","d) After converting essence  into MD-essence , it still needs to generate the MD-link(s). Without MD-link(s) information, metadata are meaningless. In this basic method, the user may browse a list of links to existing essences  and a list of existing metadata  with the GUI . The user may select desired links to the present essence from the list of links to essence  and add the selected links to MD-link . Furthermore, the user may select metadata from the metadata list  and generate a link information to the selected metadata, and add the generated link to MD-link .","e) After above editing process, a new metadata is generated, which is based on the metadata template . Its MD-essence  is taken over from selected essence  and its MD-link(s)  is generated from list of links of existing essence  and metadata ."]}}}},"According to this basic method, a selected essence  is converted into a new metadata , wherein the user has to do most of the work of finding or generating the new MD-link(s) . The user must generate a metadata link according to his own pre-knowledge or understanding. He sets up MD-link  through selecting and generating a link message from existing essence and metadata. In this procedure, the user cannot use any assistant information to simplify his selection and judgment process. However, in a lot of cases it is difficult to generate efficient and correct MD-link by only using above basic method. Therefore, an advanced method is proposed here, which can make use of associated reference information to help the user to select efficient and significant MD-link(s) for the new metadata:","II. Advanced Method:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["a) As shown in , the advanced method includes all functions and components of the basic method as described above in I. (a)-(e).","b) As alternative way to the basic method, in the advanced method, the user may search in a metadata database for all metadata , which are linked to the selected essence . The metadata  have their own MD-essences  and MD-links . Each MD-link  directs to essence .","c) The metadata  can be viewed and operated by GUI .","d) The MD-essence  of metadata  can be used as additional reference material for editing MD-essence  of metadata . For example, the user may take the MD-essence  to improve MD-essence .","e) The metadata  provides useful hints for users. Based on metadata , the user may generate improved reference link data for the new generated metadata . For example, besides MD-link , the metadata  may include an other MD-link , which links to another metadata or essence . Within metadata  all MD-links ,  are content associated. Therefore, metadata\/essence  and essence  are closely content-related entities. Thus, metadata\/essence  is a good reference candidate for the new metadata . In this case, metadata  should have a reference link, which directs to the metadata\/essence . If the user decides to take over the MD-link(s)  as reference link into metadata , he can simply add the MD-link(s)  to MD-link(s) of metadata .","f) Further, the user may make use of the hint of metadata  to find further content-related entities of essence , or reference link data of metadata . For example, the user may look for interested reference information in metadata\/essence  and generate MD-link to metadata . Thereby the user may find other associated metadata\/essence  and generate a possible MD-link for metadata  on the basis of metadata\/essence .","g) The user completes all above steps under GUI  operation."]}}}},"In . entities , , ,  . . . form of a kind of relationship-hint-chain. This relationship-hint-chain makes it possible to let the user easily find out associated reference links for the new metadata . This is a fast way to get desired entities from hundreds and thousands of candidates.","The basic method and the advanced method for converting essence into metadata may be employed in parallel. If the user has enough pre-knowledge for generating reference link data, the user may use the basic method described above in (I), otherwise, the user may use the advanced method described in (II) and based on the relationship-hint-chain to generate a significant metadata link.","For better understanding of the above methods the following application examples are given:\n\n","As can be seen from the above examples, both methods provide a comfortable assistant tool for metadata editing."],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will now be described in more detail in connection with the attached drawings, showing in:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
