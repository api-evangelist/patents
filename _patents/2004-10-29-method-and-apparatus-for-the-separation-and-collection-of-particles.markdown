title: Method and apparatus for the separation and collection of particles
abstract: A separation operation for particles includes loading particles of various sizes and responsive to electromagnetic forces into a starting position upon a separation collection component, sending a first current through a first set of conductors in a first direction drawing a subset of larger particles toward a first adjacent position to the starting position and sending successively lower currents compared to the first current through a second set of conductors in the first direction drawing a subset of smaller particles toward a second adjacent position to the starting position. A collection operation includes sending a lower current through a first set of conductors near a subset of smaller particles that forces the smaller particles into a first particle collection point and sending a higher current through the second set of conductors to collect a subset of larger particles into a second particle collection point.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is generally directed to separating particles used in scientific procedures. In the past, laboratories have used centrifuges to separate target materials based on mass and\/or filtration systems to separate them based on size. While these separation methods worked well in some cases, they were not suitable for high throughput testing required in biotechnology and other fields as they were time consuming and complex in their implementation. A third approach to separation uses magnetic flux to separate these target materials by way of specially formulated magnetic particles.","Small particles having either magnetic or paramagnetic qualities are used by a growing number of laboratories to perform separation in experiments and procedures. Unlike the purely magnetic particles, the paramagnetic type particles are responsive to magnetic and electromagnetic fields yet tend not to retain magnetic qualities outside the presence of these fields. This allows particles to be manipulated by magnetic fields yet not suffer from packing and particle aggregation over time. For purposes of discussion, reference to particles includes those considered magnetic, paramagnetic as well as super-paramagnetic.","The particles are typically sphere-like in shape and due to the nanometer radii they possess are particularly useful in nanotechnology and biotechnology applications. While these sphere-like particles are the most prevalent, the shape and size of the particle may vary depending on the experiment being performed and the particles available or suitable for the experiment or procedure. Consequently, a wide range of particle sizes are being manufactured to accommodate the various types of experiments and procedures.","In one implementation, particles are functionalized through a coating of magnetite or other magnetically responsive material along with potentially one or more recognition molecules or substances to be used in a particular experiment. The core of these magnetically coated particles can be non-magnetic if desired. Alternatively, the functionalized particles can include a magnetic core while the coating is of a non-magnetic material such as gold (Au).","The recognition molecule on the particle reacts with and captures a target in a given sample. Magnets attract the particles along with the target in the given sample while the unbound non-reactive portion of the sample is washed away or collected for other subsequent procedures. For example, functionalized magnetic microspheres have been used in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) related procedures to accurately manipulate small sample sizes and otherwise help reduce the time spent performing experimental and often complex procedures.","To maintain consistent and reliable results in the laboratory, it is important that the particles are extremely close in size. Manufacturers are therefore required to create particles that are close in size or fit within a small range or degree of tolerance. Unfortunately, obtaining particle uniformity during manufacture is very time consuming and greatly increases costs. As a second measure, manufacturers have attempted to separate the particles by size using filtration thus ensuring the particles are no larger than a predetermined upper threshold. Additional techniques met with limited success have employed kinetic-magnetic washing to further refine the particle size into more specific categories. Once again, this latter methodology is time consuming and difficult to produce consistent results.","Laboratories need particles that are extremely close in size yet cost-effective for use in large-scale ongoing and automated experiments. For example, even particles described as ranging several microns in size with a small percentage of variability may not be sufficient for certain laboratories to use if reliable experimental and procedural results are expected. As much as possible, these particles need to be identified by their size and not just a threshold size they are alleged not to exceed.","One aspect of the present invention features a method of separating particles by size. The separation operation includes loading a set of particles of various sizes and responsive to electromagnetic forces into a starting position upon a separation collection component, wherein the separation collection component has a plurality of conductors each coupled to a current source, sending a first current through a first set of conductors in a first direction drawing a subset of larger particles from the set of particles toward a first adjacent position to the starting position on the separation collection component and sending one or more successively lower currents compared to the first current through a second set of conductors in the first direction drawing a subset of smaller particles from the set of particles toward a second adjacent position to the starting position on the separation collection component.","Another aspect of the present invention features a method of collecting particles by size. The collection operation includes sending a lower current through a first set of conductors associated with a separation collection component near a subset of smaller particles that forces the smaller particles into a first particle collection point, determining if a subset of larger particles near a second set of conductors on the separation collection component needs to be collected and sending a higher current through the second set of conductors associated with the separation collection component to collect the subset of larger particles into a second particle collection point in response to the determination.","The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","In one implementation, a grid of conductors arranged in rows and columns is used to separate particles into different sizes and then collect them in containers. Different amounts of current are run through the row and column conductors in the grid creating different strength electromagnetic fields. Each electromagnetic field tends to attract different size particles until all the particles have been separated. Another current applied to the rows and columns of the grid creates an electromagnetic force causing the particles to be collected in one or more particle collectors or containers.","Aspects of the present invention have one or more of the following advantages. Particles can be sorted more accurately by size rather than only a threshold level. The size of the particles is determined by the accuracy of the current source and the gradient of current applied to the conductors. Smaller particles can be separated from the larger particles by applying increasingly smaller amounts of current.","This separation method can be implemented with relatively low costs and with a high degree of repeatability. In one implementation, a grid used to separate the particles can be created using technology similar to that used in semi-conductor fabrication. Each grid can be used to separate and collect a wide range of particle sizes. This allows the grid to be used by a different manufacturers and laboratories without significant modification or customization.","A computer system can be programmed to control the grid used for separating the particles. This increases the reproducibility of the separation operation and eliminates human error that might take place using other more mechanical or manual methods. Software can also be used to integrate the separation process into other automated experiments and procedures used in laboratories performing biotechnology and other types of research.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","106","108","110","110","110"],"i":"n "},"Computer  can be a general purpose personal computer (PC) or specialized hardware embedded with processors designed specifically to control separation collection component  and overall operation of system . Functionally, controller  exchanges control sequences and data between separation collection component  and computer  over any combination of one or more hardware, software, communication technologies and protocols including: FireWire, Universal Serial Bus, conventional serial or parallel communication, SCSI, HPIB (Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus)\/GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus)\/IEEE-488, TCPIP, as well as other related, compatible or derivative technologies.","In addition, controller  provides one or more accurate current sources to drive the various conductors embedded in separation collection component . It is contemplated that each conductor can have a separate current source or alternatively share a current source through one or more switches or devices that allow the current source to be shared by one or more of the conductors. As will be described later herein, these current sources create electromagnetic fields of different strengths and orientations that enables accurate separation of particles  and their collection in a set of particle collectors , , through . Alternatively, the accurate current sources described previously can be integrated into separation collection component  or provided through yet another component dedicated to providing highly accurate and variable current source. Yet another alternative implementation integrates controller , separation collection component  and one or more highly accurate current sources into a single integrated device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","208","210","208","210","208","210","208","210"]},"As illustrated in this implementation, insulators  and  sandwich row conductors  and separate them from column conductors , which are sandwiched instead by insulators  and . Insulators ,  and  can be manufactured from any number of non-conductive materials including Aluminum Oxide, Silicon Dioxide and Aluminum Nitride. Various semiconductor manufacturing processes can be used to assemble and create the insulators and cross-point assembly of conductors thus any dimensions depicted in , B and C are only demonstrative; actual dimensions will be determined by the design requirements and various manufacturing processes utilized. For example, it is desirable to make insulators ,  and  thin so as to promote higher sensitivity and control over the particles during the separation and collection operations performed in accordance with implementations of the present invention.","In operation, a relatively high current is supplied in a first direction through a subset of row conductors  and column conductors  causing a correspondingly strong electromagnetic force to be applied to the particles in the direction of the arrows. In this example, the initial operation is designed to collect particles of all sizes into position A in the vicinity of row conductor Ras preparation for the subsequent steps used to separate the particles into smaller and smaller sizes. Alternatively, the particles can be collected in any arbitrary position on the grid by applying various combinations of current to a different set of row and column conductors. The strength of the electromagnetic force in this initial operation interacts with the magnetic, paramagnetic or superparamagnetic characteristics associated with the particles and overcomes any gravitational or other resistive forces until they are moved into the desired position A. It is important to select a sufficiently high current in this step as weaker electromagnetic forces generated through lower currents may not be sufficient to move all of the particles into position A.","In particular,  is another schematic diagram illustrating the position of the particles after successively lower currents are applied through another subset of row conductors  and column conductors  in accordance with one implementation of the present invention. This portion of the separation operation applies the successively lower currents in a substantially opposite direction (i.e., compared with the initial high current previously described) along the subset of row conductors  and column conductors  to create an opposing electromagnetic force that places the particles into position B. A first lower current monotonically lower than the higher current applied in reference to  is applied causing only the smaller of the particles to move slightly away from the vicinity of row conductor Rand towards row conductors Rthrough R. Once again, an alternate implementation could move the smaller particles to any arbitrary position on the grid by applying various combinations of current to a different set of row conductors  and column conductors . This leaves the largest of the particles in place as the resulting electromagnetic force associated with the first lower current is not sufficient to move the largest of the particles. By repeatedly applying successively lower currents along row conductors  and column conductors , the particles are separated into position B by size at or near the row conductors Rthrough Ras illustrated diagrammatically in . Once again, this position of the particles is for illustration and the particles need not be aligned with any of row conductors  or column conductors  on the grid. It is contemplated that various implementations of the present invention can separate the particles into more homogenous groupings with smaller size differentials by increasing the number of row conductors  and column conductors  in addition to improving both the accuracy and control over the current source levels being applied.","Implementations of the present invention collect the particles once the separation operation has been completed.  is a schematic diagram of the collection operation performed on particles separated by a separation collection component designed in accordance with one implementation of the present invention. For example, the collection operation can be performed by applying various levels of current along the column conductors  in sequence. Starting with the smallest particles, an initial collection current applied along column conductors Cto Ccreates an electromagnetic field that moves the particles in the direction of the arrow towards a particle collection point and into some type of collector. The initial collection current is small enough to move the smallest particles in the vicinity of row conductor Rbut not move particles awaiting collection on any other portion of separation collection component . Monotonically larger currents are applied in succession causing correspondingly larger electromagnetic fields capable of moving the larger set of particles towards their respective collection points and collectors. Of course, if the particle collection point were not aligned along a row or column as illustrated in  then the currents would be applied along different combination of row and column conductors of the grid to move the particles toward the desired collection point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","306","302","308","310","308","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"402"},"Particles are generally already coated with magnetite or other magnetically responsive material. They also may have a magnetic core and a non-magnetic coating as previously described. Either arrangement gives the particles magnetic, paramagnetic or superparamagnetic qualities as needed and appropriate for the particular application. In one implementation, the particles can already be functionalized and therefore coated in advance with one or more recognition molecules designed to react with and capture a target from a given sample in an experiment or procedure. Alternatively, the particles can instead be functionalized later by coating the particles with recognition molecules subsequent to the separation and collection operations performed in accordance with implementations of the present invention.","As one option to starting the collection operation, one implementation of the present invention initially applies a higher current in a first direction through a first set conductors thus placing the particles into one area. This draws the set of particles towards the starting position on the separation collection component (). The high current level creates a strong enough electromagnetic field to draw the largest particles to the starting position for the subsequent separation steps. The starting position can be an arbitrary position on the separation collection component or can intersect with one or more conductors aligned along a row, a column or a row and column of the separation collection component. Smaller particles are also drawn to the starting position as they are smaller in mass and have less gravitational and other forces to keep them in place. In this implementation, grouping particles of different sizes together is a precursor to the subsequent separation operations. However, an alternative implementation skips the above step by physically loading the particles as a group onto this starting area or working with particles already positioned otherwise in the desired area. For example, particles could be positioned in the desired starting area as a by-product of a preceding experiment, process or other event.","Next, implementations of the present invention send a lower current through a second set of conductors in a second direction. This draws a subset of smaller particles toward an adjacent position on the separation collection component (). This adjacent position can be adjacent to the starting position or any arbitrary position on the separation collection component. By reversing or changing the direction of the current, the particles are now drawn away from the area in which they were initially grouped. Furthermore, the lower current creates a weaker electromagnetic field and only draws those particles smaller in size and mass rather than all the particles. Precise determination of the lower current can be done either experimentally or through various calculations based on the electrical and physical properties of the particles, the current source, the conductive materials used to create the separation collection component of the present invention and any other parts of the overall system. As previously described, the granularity and accuracy of the separation operation depends largely upon the number of conductors and the current differential applied between the conductors used by the separation collection component of the present invention. For example, smaller current gradients applied between a larger number of conductors leads to a finer separation of particle size.","Implementations of the present invention then determine if there are smaller particles to be extracted from the remaining set particles in the group (). This generally depends on whether all the conductors have already been used to separate the particle sizes. If all the conductors have already been used, the separation process has been completed and implementations of the present invention instead prepare to collect the different particles separated by size along the collection points near the conductors ().","If more conductors are available for particle separation, implementations of the present invention reduce the current to be sent through another set of conductors below the lower current level (). Typically, the current level is reduced monotonically to a set of predetermined current levels to provide consistency in the separation operation. Successively reducing the current level again, leaves the larger particles in place and draws away only the smaller particles of a lesser mass. One or more of the above operations are repeated until the desired particle separation is achieved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","508"]},"If there are larger particles remaining on the separation collection component, the collection operation continues using higher currents and electromagnetic forces. In particular, one implementation of the present invention increase the current to be sent through the set of conductors above the previous lower current level () and the collection operation repeats (). As previously described, the current level selected creates a strong enough electromagnetic force to collect all of larger particles of one size and group but not large enough to disturb the other adjacent or nearby particles. Alternatively, if the physical separation between the particles is great enough then a larger current can be used to collect particles of different sizes as the distance between the particles would prevent mixing different sized particles. For example, this would enable the particles to be collected into their respective collectors in a parallel or in a simultaneous manner. Yet another implementation would involve physically sweeping or moving the particles into their respective collectors by way of a shunt or other appropriate type of device,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","604","606","602","608","610","612","614","616","600","600"]},"In one implementation, memory  includes a particle separation module , a particle collection module , a separation collection application programming interface (API) module , and a run-time module  that manages system resources used when processing one or more of the above components on system .

For example, this includes determining the timing and current levels to apply to the various conductors of the separation collector component. Similarly, particle collection module  provides routines, calculations and control sequences to S-C component driver  but the information is used to instead collect the particles in accordance with implementations of the present invention.
