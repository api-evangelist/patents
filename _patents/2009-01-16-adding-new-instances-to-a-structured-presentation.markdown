No. 12\/355,103, all of which are filed on the same day as the present disclosure and the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","This specification relates to the addition of new instances to a structured presentation by retrieving and displaying information from an unstructured electronic document collection.","An electronic document is a collection of machine-readable data. Electronic documents are generally individual files and are formatted in accordance with a defined format (e.g., PDF, TIFF, HTML, ASCII, MS Word, PCL, PostScript, or the like). Electronic documents can be electronically stored and disseminated. In some cases, electronic documents include audio content, visual content, and other information, as well as text and links to other electronic documents.","Electronic document can be collected into electronic document collections. Electronic document collections can either be unstructured or structured. The formatting of the documents in an unstructured electronic document collection is not constrained to conform with a predetermined structure and can evolve in often unforeseen ways. In other words, the formatting of individual documents in an unstructured electronic document collection is neither restrictive nor permanent across the entire document collection. Further, in an unstructured electronic document collection, there are no mechanisms for ensuring that new documents adhere to a format or that changes to a format are applied to previously existing documents. Thus, the documents in an unstructured electronic document collection cannot be expected to share a common structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. Examples of unstructured electronic document collections include the documents available on the Internet, collections of resumes, collections of journal articles, and collections of news articles. Documents in some unstructured electronic document collections are not prohibited from including links to other documents inside and outside of the collection.","In contrast, the documents in structured electronic document collections generally conform with formats that can be both restrictive and permanent. The formats imposed on documents in structured electronic document collections can be restrictive in that common formats are applied to all of the documents in the collections, even when the applied formats are not completely appropriate. The formats can be permanent in that an upfront commitment to a particular format by the party who assembles the structured electronic document collection is generally required. Further, users of the collections\u2014in particular, programs that use the documents in the collection\u2014rely on the documents' having the expected format. As a result, format changes can be difficult to implement. Structured electronic document collections are best suited to applications where the information content lends itself to simple and stable categorizations. Thus, the documents in a structured electronic document collection generally share a common structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. Examples of structured electronic document collections include databases that are organized and viewed through a database management system (DBMS) in accordance with hierarchical and relational data models, as well as a collections of electronic documents that are created by a single entity for presenting information consistently. For example, a collection of web pages that are provided by an online bookseller to present information about individual books can form a structured electronic document collection. As another example, a collection of web pages that is created by server-side scripts and viewed through an application server can form a structured electronic document collection. Thus, one or more structured electronic document collections can each be a subset of an unstructured electronic document collection.","This specification describes technologies relating to retrieval and display of information from an unstructured electronic document collection, for example, the electronic documents available on the Internet. Although an electronic document collection may be unstructured, the information content of the unstructured electronic document collection can be displayed in a structured presentation. In particular, the information content of an unstructured electronic document collection can be used not only to determine the values of attributes but also to identify, select, and name attributes and instances in a structured presentation. Such structured presentations can present information in a coherent manner to a user despite the diversity in sources. Examples of structured presentations include tables and other collections of records.","In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in machine-implemented methods that include the actions of receiving description data describing a preexisting structured presentation, comparing characteristics of the preexisting structured presentation with content of electronic documents in an unstructured collection of electronic documents to locate electronic documents that identify a new instance that is relevant to the preexisting structured presentation, adding an identifier of the new instance to the preexisting structured presentation to form an expanded structured presentation, and outputting instructions for presenting the expanded structured presentation. A visual presentation of the preexisting structured presentation visually presenting information in a systematic arrangement that conforms with a structured design. The structured presentation associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values in a visual presentation of the structured presentation.","This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. Adding the identifier of the new instance can include formulating a collection of instance suggestions, providing the instance suggestion collection to a user, and receiving a user selection of the new instance, wherein the new instance is in the collection of instance suggestions. Comparing the characteristics of the preexisting structured presentation with the content of the electronic documents can include identifying documents in the electronic document collection that include structured components related to instances identified in the preexisting structured presentation.","Formulating the collection of instance suggestions can include identifying a first document in the electronic document collection that includes an identifier of an instance identified in the preexisting structured presentation and that is arranged in accordance with a template, identifying a second document that is arranged in accordance with the template but relevant to a second instance, and including the second instance in the instance suggestion collection.","Comparing the characteristics of the preexisting structured presentation with the content of the electronic documents can include one or more of the following: identifying documents in the electronic document collection that include information regarding one or more instances in the preexisting structured presentation, locating the new instance in a stored collection of associations of instances with attributes, comparing the characteristics of the preexisting structured presentation with the attributes characterized in the preexisting structured presentation, comparing the attributes used to characterize instances in the preexisting structured presentation with the content of the electronic documents, comparing the value of attributes used to characterize instances in the preexisting structured presentation with the content of the electronic documents, and comparing a category of instances that includes instances in the preexisting structured presentation with the content of the electronic documents.","The collection of electronic documents can include the electronic documents available on the Internet. The electronic documents can include web pages. The expanded structured presentation can include a table or a collection of cards. The method can include visually displaying the expanded structured presentation on a display screen, including physically transforming one or more elements of the display screen.","Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on computer storage devices, each configured to perform the operations of the methods.","Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in apparatuses that include one or more machine-readable data storage media storing instructions operable to cause one or more data processing machines to perform operations. The operations include formulating a collection of instance suggestions based on content of two or more documents in an unstructured electronic document collection, providing the instance suggestion collection to a user, receiving a user selection of a first instance in the collection of instance suggestions, and adding an identifier of the first instance suggestion to a structured presentation. The electronic document collection is unstructured in that the format of the electronic documents in the electronic document collection is neither restrictive nor permanent. A visual presentation of the structured presentation visually presents information in an organized arrangement. The structured presentation denotes associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values in the visual presentation of the structured presentation.","This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. Formulating the collection of instance suggestions can include one or more of the following: comparing characteristics of a preexisting structured presentation with content of electronic documents in the electronic document collection; identifying documents in the electronic document collection that include structured components related to instances identified in the preexisting structured presentation; identifying a first document in the electronic document collection that is relevant to an instance identified in the preexisting structured presentation and that is arranged in accordance with a template, identifying a second document that is arranged in accordance with the template but relevant to the a second instance, and including the second instance in the instance suggestion collection; identifying documents in the electronic document collection that include identifiers of one or more instances in the preexisting structured presentation, identifying additional attributes used to characterize instances in the preexisting structured presentation; comparing values of attributes used to characterize instances in the preexisting structured presentation with values of the instance suggestions; identifying a category of instances that includes instances in the preexisting structured presentation and formulating the collection of instance suggestions using instances in the category of instances; identifying the instance suggestions in a stored collection of associations of instances with attributes; and comparing the attributes characterized in the preexisting structured presentation with the content of the documents in the unstructured electronic document collection.","The collection of electronic documents can include the documents available on the Internet. The electronic documents can include web pages. The structured presentation can include a table or a collection of cards.","Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding systems, apparatus, and methods.","Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system that includes a client device and one or more computers programmed to interact with the client device and to perform operations. The operations include receiving description data describing a preexisting structured presentation, comparing characteristics of the preexisting structured presentation with content of electronic documents in an unstructured collection of electronic documents to locate electronic documents that identify a new instance that is relevant to the preexisting structured presentation, adding an identifier of the new instance to the preexisting structured presentation to form an expanded structured presentation, and outputting instructions for presenting the expanded structured presentation on a display device coupled in data communication with the client device. A visual presentation of the preexisting structured presentation visually presenting information in a systematic arrangement that conforms with a structured design. The structured presentation denoting associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values in a visual presentation of the structured presentation.","Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer program products, apparatus, and methods.","Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a system that includes a client device and one or more computers programmed to interact with the client device and to perform operations. The operations include formulating a collection of instance suggestions based on content of two or more documents in an unstructured electronic document collection, providing the instance suggestion collection to a user using the client device, receiving a user selection of a first instance in the collection of instance suggestions, and adding an identifier of the first instance suggestion to a structured presentation presented on a display device coupled in data communication with the client device, wherein a visual presentation of the structured presentation visually presents information in an organized arrangement. The electronic document collection is unstructured in that the format of the electronic documents in the electronic document collection is neither restrictive nor permanent. The structured presentation denotes associations between an instance and values that characterize attributes of the instance by virtue of an arrangement of an identifier of the instance and the values in the visual presentation of the structured presentation.","This and other aspects can include one or more of the following features. The one or more computers can include a server operable to interact with the client device through a data communication network. The client device can be operable to interact with the server as a client. The client device can include a personal computer running a web browser. The personal computer can include the display device.","Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer program products, apparatus, and methods.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","106","102","100","104","108","100","102","106","104"]},"Electronic document collection  is unstructured in that the organization of information within individual documents in electronic document collection  need not conform with a predetermined structure that can be exploited in the extraction of information. For example, consider three electronic documents in electronic document collection , namely, electronic documents , , . Documents , ,  were added to collection  by three different users who organize the content of their respective electronic documents differently. The users need not collaborate to ensure that information within documents , ,  is in a particular format. Moreover, if one user wishes to change the format of document , the user can do so without regard for the format of the documents added by the other users. There is no need for the user to inform the other users of the change. Indeed, in some cases, documents can be added to collection  by entities who not only fail to collaborate but who are also competitors who are adverse to one another, such as three different car manufacturers or three different sellers of digital cameras. Regardless of the particular alignment of the entities who add documents to collection , no mechanism (e.g., formatting software component or filtering software) is associated with collection  that ensures that the information in documents is similarly organized within the documents. Further, no mechanism is associated with collection  that ensures that the organization of information in each of each document in collection  remains unchanged.","In contrast, structured presentation  is structured and presents information drawn from documents in collection  in an organized, systematic arrangement. Thus, the grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in structured presentation  conforms with a structured design even when the information in the presentation is drawn from different contexts in a diverse set of documents in collection . Further, changes to any aspect of the design of structured presentation  can be propagated throughout structured presentation .","Examples of structured presentations include spreadsheet tables, collections of structured cards or other records, and other structured presentation formats. Such structured presentations can also conform with rules that specify the spatial arrangement of information in the displays, the positioning and identification of various organizational and informational aspects (e.g., column headers, row headers, unit identifiers, and the like) of the structured presentations, the graphical representation of values, and other characteristics.","The structuring of information in structured presentations generally facilitates the understanding of the information by a viewer. For example, a viewer can discern the nature of the information contained within the structured presentation by reading headers. A viewer of can easily identify and compare values presented in the structured presentation based on the arrangement and positioning of those values in the display. For example, a user can easily ascertain that certain values in a structured presentation all relate to attributes (i.e., characteristics) of different cars and can easily compare those values.","System  is not limited to merely populating structured presentation  with values drawn from documents in collection . Instead, in many implementations, system  can determine entities (i.e., \u201cinstances\u201d) that are to be described in structured presentation , values that characterize the attributes of those instances, as well as an appropriate structuring of structured presentation . Such determinations can be based on information drawn from different documents in collection  that are not restricted to having a specific format, a permanent format, or both. For example, the attributes that appear in structured presentation  can be based on the attributes used in documents in collection  to characterize certain instances, as discussed further below. As another example, the units of the values (e.g., meters, feet, inches, miles) that appear in structured presentation  can be based on the units of the values that appear in documents in collection . As another example, the instances that appear in structured presentation  can be determined based on instances that appear in documents in collection .","Further, in many implementations, such information can be drawn from previously unspecified documents in collection . For example, a search query can be used to identify documents in collection  and the information can be drawn from these documents. There need not be preexisting limits on the identity or type of documents from which information can be drawn. For example, the identified documents need not be limited to being associated with the account of a particular individual or originating from a particular retailer. Instead, the information can be drawn from previously unspecified documents.","System  can thus exploit the diverse information content of documents in collection  in a variety of different ways to present a structured presentation to a user. In cases where electronic document collection  includes a large number of documents, the amount of information that can be exploited can be very large. Moreover, in many cases, this can be done automatically or with a relatively small amount of human interaction, as discussed further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","102","106","200","108","102","104","202","204","208","210"]},"Search engine  can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at one or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine-readable instructions for searching unstructured electronic document collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of search engine .","Crawler  can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at more or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine-readable instructions for crawling unstructured electronic document collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of crawler .","Compressing, indexing, and ranking modules  can be implemented on one or more computers deployed at more or more geographical locations that are programmed with one or more sets of machine-readable instructions for compressing, indexing, and ranking documents in collection . Other functionality can be implemented on the one or more computers in addition to the functionality of compressing, indexing, and ranking modules . The data center  stores information characterizing electronic documents in electronic document collection . The information characterizing such electronic documents can be stored in the form of an indexed database that includes indexed keywords and the locations of documents in collection  where the keywords can be found. The indexed database can be formed, e.g., by crawler .","In some implementations, the information stored in data center  can itself be organized to facilitate presentation of structured presentation  to a user. For example, information can be organized by crawler  and compressing, indexing and ranking modules  in anticipation of the need to present structured presentations  that are relevant to certain topics. The structure of information in data center  can facilitate the grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in structured presentations . This organization can be based on a variety of different factors. For example, an ontology can be used to organize information stored in data center . As another example, a historical record of previous structured presentations  can be used to organize information stored in data center . As another example, the data tables described in this specification can be used to organize information stored in data center .","As shown, system  includes multiple display screens  that can present structured presentations in accordance with machine-readable instructions. Display screens  can include, e.g., cathode ray tubes (CRT's), light emitting diode (LED) screens, liquid crystal displays (LCD's), gas-plasma displays, and the like. Display screens  can be an integral part of a self-contained data processing system, such as a personal data assistant (PDA) , a desktop computer , or a mobile telephone. In general, instructions for presenting structured presentations are modified to the particularities of a display screen  after receipt by such a self-contained data processing system. However, this is not always the case. For example, display screens  can also be part of more disperse systems where the processing of instructions for presenting a structured presentation is completed before the instructions are received at display screen . For example, display screens  can be incorporated into \u201cdumb\u201d devices, such as television sets or computer monitors, that receive instructions for presenting structured presentation  from a local or remote source.","In operation, system  can transform the unstructured information in collection  into structured presentation , which can be presented to a viewer. Such transformations can be performed in the context of web search in which a search engine receives and responds to information requests based on information extracted from the electronic documents in collection .","For example, personal digital assistant (PDA)  or desktop computer  can interact with a user and thereby receive a search query, e.g., by way of a web browser application. A description  of the query can be transmitted over a wireless data link  and\/or a wired data link  to search engine . In response, search engine  can use query description  to identify information in data center  that can be used in presenting structured presentation  on display screen . The identified information can be drawn from two or more unspecified electronic documents in unstructured electronic document collection . In some instances, query description  can include search terms that are used by search engine  to retrieve information for presenting a structured presentation  to a user. For example, search terms in query description  can be used to identify, in data center , a collection of related instances, attributes that characterize such instances, value that characterize the individual instances, and\/or other aspects of structured presentation .","The search engine  can also generate a response  to query description . The response  can be used to present structured presentation  for a user. In general, response  includes machine readable-instructions that can be interpreted by a data processing device in systems ,  to present structured presentation . For example, response  can be coded in HTML to specify the characteristics and content of structured presentation . In other implementations, response  can include text snippets or other information from data center  that is used in presenting structured presentation . For example, response  can include a collection of values, the name of a new attribute, or an estimate of the likelihood that a value to be displayed in structured presentation  is correct, as discussed further below.","In many cases, system  uses the information stored in data center  to identify the location of one or more documents that are relevant to the query described in query description . For example, search engine  can compare the keywords in query description  to an index of keywords stored in data center . The comparison can be used to identify documents in collection  that are relevant to query description . The locations of such identified documents can be included in responses , e.g., as a hyperlink to the documents that are that are responsive to the described query.","In some implementations, the system  can store attributes and\/or their respective values in a manner that facilitates the grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in structured presentations . For example, collections of instances, their attributes, and their values can be stored in data center  as structured presentations  are amended and changed by users interacting with client systems such as systems , . For example, instances, attributes, and values in one structured presentation  presented to a first viewer can be stored in the data center  and used in providing subsequent structured presentations  to other viewers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["106","300","300"]},"The attributes of an instance can be characterized by values. The values of a particular attribute of a particular instance thus characterize that particular instance. For example, the name of an individual can have the value \u201cTom,\u201d the population of a city can have the value \u201c4 million,\u201d and the model name of a product can have the value \u201cWrangler.\u201d In some implementations, structured presentations such as table  can also include identifiers of attributes, as well as identifiers of the units in which values are expressed.","The grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in table  can be selected to facilitate understanding of the information by a user. In this regard, table  includes a collection of rows . Each row  includes an instance identifier  and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values  and instance identifiers  in rows  thus graphically represents the associations between them. For example, a user can discern the association between attribute values  and the instance identifier  that is found in the same row .","Table  also includes a collection of columns . Each column  includes an attribute identifier  and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values  and attribute identifier  in columns  thus graphically represent the associations between them. For example, a user can discern the association between attribute values  and the attribute identifier  that is found in the same column  based on their alignment.","Each row  is a structured record  in that each row  associates a single instance identifier  with a collection of associated attribute values . Further, the arrangement and positioning used to denote these associations in one structured record  is reproduced in other structured records  (i.e., in other rows ). Indeed, in many cases, all of the structured records  in a structured presentation  are restricted to having the same arrangement and positioning of information. For example, values  of the attribute \u201cATTR2\u201d are restricted to appearing in the same column  in all rows . As another example, attribute identifiers  all bear the same spatial relationship to the values  appearing in the same column . Moreover, changes to the arrangement and positioning of information in one structured record  are generally propagated to other structured record  in the structured presentation . For example, if a new attribute value  that characterizes a new attribute (e.g., \u201cATTR2\u00be\u201d) is added to one structured record , then a new column  is added to structured presentation  so that the values of attribute \u201cATTR2\u00be\u201d of all instances can be added to structured presentation .","In some implementations, values  in table  can be presented in certain units of measure. Examples of units of measure include feet, yards, inches, miles, seconds, gallons, liters, degrees Celsius, and the like. In some instances, the units of measure in which values  are presented are indicated by unit identifiers . Unit identifiers  can appear, e.g., beside values  and\/or beside relevant attribute identifiers . The association between unit identifiers  and the values  whose units of measure are indicated is indicated to a viewer by such positioning. In many cases, all of the values  associated with a single attribute (e.g., all of the values  in a single column ) are restricted to being presented in the same unit of measure.","The information extracted from electronic document collection  by systems ,  can impact the presentation of table  to a user in a variety of different ways. For example, the information extracted from electronic document collection  can be used to determine values  for populating table . As another example, the information extracted from electronic document collection  can be used to suggest new attributes and\/or new instances for addition to table .","In some implementations, instance identifiers  can be selected based on one or more search strings. For example, if the search string \u201chybrid vehicles\u201d is received from a user by search engine , systems such as system  can generate and populate table  based on information extracted from electronic document collection  using the search string. For example, system  can access data center , identify instance identifiers  in the electronic documents that are relevant to the search string, determine a set of common attributes for the identified instances\u2014as well as identifiers  of those attributes and values  for those attributes. In effect, system  can determine instance identifiers , attribute identifiers , as well as the associated values  based on the received search string.","In some implementations, one or more attribute identifiers , instance identifiers , and\/or values  can be received from a user for whom table  is to be displayed. As discussed further below, systems such as system  can generate and populate table  based on information extracted from electronic document collection  using one or more received attribute identifiers , instance identifiers , and\/or values . In effect, system  can formulate new instance identifiers , attribute identifiers , as well as the associated values  based on the received attribute identifiers , instance identifiers , and\/or values .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","308","306","307","309","302","304","400","400","405","410","415","420"]},"Instance selection widgets  are user interface components that allow a user to select structured records  in table . For example, instance selection widgets  can be a collection of one or more clickable checkboxes that are associated with a particular structured record  by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . Instance selection widgets  are \u201cclickable\u201d in that a user can interact with widgets  using a mouse (e.g., hovering over the component and clicking a particular mouse button), a stylus (e.g., pressing a user interface component displayed on a touch screen with the stylus), a keyboard, or other input device to invoke the functionality provided by that component.","Action triggers  are user interface components that allow a user to trigger the performance of an action on one or more structured records  in table  selected using instance selection widgets . For example, action triggers  can be clickable text phrases, each of which can be used by a user to trigger an action described in the phrase. For example, a \u201ckeep and remove others\u201d action trigger  triggers the removal of structured records  that are not selected using instance selection widgets  from the display of table . As another example, a \u201cremove selected\u201d action trigger  triggers the removal of structured records  that are selected using instance selection widgets  from the display of table . As yet another example, a \u201cshow on map\u201d action trigger  triggers display of the position of structured records  that are selected using instance selection widgets  on a geographic map. For example, if a selected instance is a car, locations of car dealerships that sell the selected car can be displayed on a map. As another example, if the selected instances are vacation destinations, these destinations can be displayed on a map.","Column action trigger widgets  are user interface components that allow a user to apply an action to all of the cells within a single column . When a user interacts with the clickable \u2018+\u2019 sign, a further user interface component is displayed which offers to the user a set of possible actions to be performed. The actions in this set can include, e.g., removing the entire column  from the structured presentation  or searching to find values for all the cells in column  which are currently blank.","Notes column  is a user interface component that allows a user to associate information with an instance identifier . In particular, notes column  includes one or more notes  that are each associated with a structured record  by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . The information content of notes  is unrestricted in that, unlike columns , notes  are not required to be values of any particular attribute. Instead, the information in notes  can characterize unrelated aspects of the instance identified in structured record .","In some implementations, table  can include additional information other than values of any particular attribute. For example, table  can include a collection of images  that are associated with the instance identified in a structured record  by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record . As another example, table  can include a collection of text snippets  extracted from electronic documents in collection . The sources of the snippets can be highly ranked results in searches conducted using instance identifiers  as a search string. Text snippets  are associated with the instance identified in a structured record  by virtue of arrangement and positioning relative to that structured record .","As another example, table  can include one or more hypertext links  to individual electronic documents in collection . For example, the linked documents can be highly ranked results in searches conducted using instance identifiers  as a search string. As another example, the linked documents can be source of a value  that was extracted to populate table . In some instances, interaction with hypertext link  can trigger navigation to the source electronic document based on information embedded in hypertext link  (e.g., a web site address).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","500"]},"The grouping, segmentation, and arrangement of information in card collection  can be selected to facilitate an understanding of the information by a user. In this regard, card collection  includes a collection of cards . Each card  includes an instance identifier  and a collection of associated attribute values . The arrangement and positioning of attribute values  and instance identifiers  in cards  thus graphically represents the associations between them. For example, a user can discern the association between attribute values  and the instance identifier  that is found on the same card .","In the illustrated implementation, cards  in card collection  also include a collection of attribute identifiers . Attribute identifiers  are organized in a column  and attribute values  are organized in a column . Columns ,  are positioned adjacent one another and aligned so that individual attribute identifiers  are positioned next to the attribute value  that characterizes that identified attribute. This positioning and arrangement allows a viewer to discern the association between attribute identifiers  and the attribute values  that characterize those attributes.","Each card  is a structured record  in that each card  associates a single instance identifier  with a collection of associated attribute values . Further, the arrangement and positioning used to denote these associations in one card  is reproduced in other cards . Indeed, in many cases, all of the cards  are restricted to having the same arrangement and positioning of information. For example, the value  that characterizes the attribute \u201cATTR1\u201d is restricted to bearing the same spatial relationship to instance identifiers  in all cards . As another example, the order and positioning of attribute identifiers  in all of the cards  is the same.","Moreover, changes to the arrangement and positioning of information in one card  are generally propagated to other cards  in card collection .

Upon review of an instance and attribute collection  such as table  (), the system can suggest the instances \u201cINSTANCE1\u201d and \u201cINSTANCE2\u201d based on the same attributes \u201cATTR3\u201d and \u201cATTR5\u201d being used to characterize those instances in records , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 2","FIG. 15","FIG. 10","FIGS. 11"],"b":["1800","915","106","1800","200","1800","1800","1500","1800","1010","1000","1100","1300","1700","13","17","1800","200","1800","202"]},"The system performing process  can identify one or more authoritative sources regarding one or more specified instance (step ). For example, the system can access a collection of authoritative sources of documents in electronic document collection  that has been assembled, e.g., by a programmer.","As another example, the system can receive user-specific input identifying one or more authoritative sources of documents in electronic document collection  as \u201cauthoritative\u201d in the view of that user. For example, a display screen  that displays a preexisting structured presentation  can include a GUI component that allows a viewer to specify authoritative sources of documents. The identification of an authoritative source can be received in conjunction with receipt of a search query. For example, a viewer can identify JD POWER AND ASSOCIATES, AMAZON.COM, and MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL as authoritative sources of the documents found at http:\/\/www.jdpower.com\/, http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/, and http:\/\/www.mlb.com\/, respectively. In some implementations, the user-specific input can identify the subject mater on which a source is authoritative. For example, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL may be identified as an authoritative source for baseball statistics, but may not be considered an authoritative source for information regarding drug testing.","As yet another example, the system performing process  can analyze a collection of user-specific input identifying authoritative sources from multiple users to assemble a \u201cgeneric\u201d collection of authoritative sources. For example, a large number of users may identify the AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION (AAA) as authoritative. Based on a statistical analysis of these identifications, the AAA can then be added to a collection of authoritative sources.","The system performing process  can determine additional attributes from the authoritative sources for instances that are specified in the preexisting structured presentation (step ). For example, the system can access documents provided by an authoritative source and identify one or more documents that characterize specified instances using one or more attributes. The system can extract attribute identifiers from these documents using a parser or other string comparison techniques.","As another example, the system can access a data collection that associates attributes and instances, such as such as table  (). The system can filter records such as records , , ,  , ,  based on both the instances identified in the preexisting structured presentation and whether or not the documents whose location is identified in records , , ,  , ,  originated from an authoritative source. For example, if AMAZON.COM is an authoritative source, a collection that associates attributes and instances can be scanned to identify documents with the http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/domain.","The system performing process  can compare these additional attributes with attributes in an instance and attribute collection such as such as table  () (step ). For example, the system can use string comparisons, or other comparison techniques, to compare the additional attributes with attributes stored in the instance and attribute collection.","The system performing process  can identify an instance in the instance and attribute collection based on the results of these comparisons (step ). For example, the system can determine the number of attributes that are used to characterize instances in documents from an authoritative source and the attributes that are associated with other instances in the instance and attribute collection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 2","FIG. 15","FIG. 10","FIGS. 11"],"b":["1900","915","106","1900","200","1900","1900","1500","1900","1010","1000","1100","1300","1700","1800","13","17","18","1900","200","1900","202"]},"The system performing process  can identify one or more relevant instances based on attribute values of the instances specified in a preexisting structured presentation. For example, the system can identify relevant instances by comparing attribute values of specified instances with attribute values of other instances to determine if the other instances are suitable suggestions. Such comparisons can require, e.g., that the attribute values be identical or that the attribute values fall within a certain range. Such a range can be determined, e.g., based on the range of attribute values that are specified by a user over an interactive element or that already characterize instances in a preexisting structured presentation.","In some implementations, the system performing process  can convert attribute values into a common unit of measurement prior to comparing the attribute values. For example, if the specified unit of measurement is in feet, but one or more extracted attribute values is in meters, the system can convert the values in meters into feet using conventional techniques. A schematic representation of one such approach is described in more detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0167"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 15"],"b":["2000","2000","2000","1510","2000","102","2000","208"]},"Table  includes a collection of records , , ,  , , , each of which associates an identifier of an instance with descriptions of a document location, attributes that characterize the identified instances in those documents, and values that characterize those attributes in those documents.

Column  can include a description of the location of an electronic document that includes the instance identified in column . Columns ,  can identify attributes that characterize the instances identified in column  in the document whose location is described in column . Columns ,  can include values that characterize the attributes identified in columns , .","In the illustrated example, each record , , ,  , ,  relates to a different instance (e.g., INSTANCE10 to INSTANCE_N). Each of the instances is characterized in at least one document by attribute identifiers ATTR3, ATTR6. As such, if instance suggestions were formulated based solely on the attributes that could be used to characterize INSTANCE10 to INSTANCE_N, every INSTANCE10 to INSTANCE_N could be suggested to a user.","In many circumstances, this is unacceptable. For example, it is likely that many of the same attributes (e.g., number of students, student\/teacher ratio, location, etc.) of every college or university in the world is characterized in some electronic document available on the Internet. However, a list if suggestions that includes every college or university is of little assistance to a student who is looking for a school to attend.","Accordingly, as discussed above in process  (), relevant instances can be identified by comparing the attribute values of the instances specified in a preexisting structured presentation with the attribute values of other instances. For example, if a specified instance in a structured presentation characterizes attribute \u201cATTR3\u201d of an instance with value \u201cVAL3\u201d in units \u201cunit_a\u201d and attribute \u201cATTR6\u201d of an instance with value \u201cVAL6\u201d in units \u201cunit_c,\u201d then a system such as search engine  can identify that the instances identified in records ,  (i.e., \u201cINSTANCE10\u201d and \u201cINSTANCE12\u201d) can be suggested to a user based on their common values (albeit in different units). Thus, a system can convert the values in cells ,  and ,  into a common unit of measurement and compare those values to determine that they are similar. Thus, like instances can be selected even if the units in which those values are expressed are different.","Furthermore, although the instance identified in record  (i.e., INSTANCE13) shares a common value of attribute \u201cATTR3\u201d with a specified instance in a structured presentation, the instance identified in record  need not be suggested to a user. In particular, the value that characterizes attribute \u201cATTR6\u201d of this instance is value \u201cVAL8,\u201d which differs from the value which characterizes this attribute of a specified instance in a structured presentation. On the basis of this difference, the instance identified in record  can be excluded from a list if suggested instances.","Different criteria for including and excluding instances from a list of suggested instances can be used. For example, the number of attribute values that must be similar can differ. As another example, in some implementations, a user can specify the number and\/or the nature of the attribute values that are considered in formulating a list of suggested instances. As yet another example, instances can be ranked based on the correspondence between their attribute values and the attribute values of one or more specified instances in a preexisting structured presentation. As yet another example, a range of values can be determined based on the values of characterizes the attributes of one or more instance specified in a structured presentation, and this range can be used to identify relevant instances for inclusion in a list of suggested instances.","As discussed in the disclosure entitled \u201cRETRIEVING AND DISPLAYING INFORMATION FROM AN UNSTRUCTURED ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT COLLECTION,\u201d Ser.
