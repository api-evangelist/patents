title: Piecewise-linear and piecewise-affine subspace transformations for high dimensional touchpad (HDTP) output decoupling and corrections
abstract: Methods for piecewise-linear and piecewise-affine transformations parameter decoupling in High Dimensional Touchpad (HDTP) user touch interfaces including those with multitouch capabilities are described. A calculation chain provides a first-order calculation of a subset of a collection of touch parameters (including for example left-right, front-back, downward pressure, roll angle, pitch angle, yaw angle) responsive in real-time to user touch on a touch-responsive sensor array. A piecewise-affine transformation is applied to these first-order calculations to produce parameter decoupling. The piecewise-affine transformation can be structured to depend only on current numerical values from the first-order calculation. Alternatively, the piecewise-affine transformation can be structured to additionally depend on the positive or negative direction of change over time of at least one numerical value from the first-order calculation, thereby providing a correction for hysteresis effects.

The array of sensors is used to create a tactile image of a type associated with the type of sensor and method of contact by the human hand.","In one embodiment, the individual sensors in the sensor array are pressure sensors and a direct pressure-sensing tactile image is generated by the sensor array.","In another embodiment, the individual sensors in the sensor array are proximity sensors and a direct proximity tactile image is generated by the sensor array. Since the contacting surfaces of the finger or hand tissue contacting a surface typically increasingly deforms as pressure is applied, the sensor array comprised of proximity sensors also provides an indirect pressure-sensing tactile image.","In another embodiment, the individual sensors in the sensor array can be optical sensors. In one variation of this, an optical image is generated and an indirect proximity tactile image is generated by the sensor array. In another variation, the optical image can be observed through a transparent or translucent rigid material and, as the contacting surfaces of the finger or hand tissue contacting a surface typically increasingly deforms as pressure is applied, the optical sensor array also provides an indirect pressure-sensing tactile image.","In some embodiments, the array of sensors can be transparent or translucent and can be provided with an underlying visual display element such as an alphanumeric, graphics, or image display. The underlying visual display can comprise, for example, an LED array display, a backlit LCD, etc. Such an underlying display can be used to render geometric boundaries or labels for soft-key functionality implemented with the tactile sensor array, to display status information, etc. Tactile array sensors implemented as transparent touchscreens are taught in the 1999 filings of issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078 and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/761,978.","In an embodiment, the touchpad or touchscreen can comprise a tactile sensor array obtains or provides individual measurements in every enabled cell in the sensor array that provides these as numerical values. The numerical values can be communicated in a numerical data array, as a sequential data stream, or in other ways. When regarded as a numerical data array with row and column ordering that can be associated with the geometric layout of the individual cells of the sensor array, the numerical data array can be regarded as representing a tactile image. The only tactile sensor array requirement to obtain the full functionality of the HDTP is that the tactile sensor array produce a multi-level gradient measurement image as a finger, part of hand, or other pliable object varies is proximity in the immediate area of the sensor surface.","Such a tactile sensor array should not be confused with the \u201cnull\/contact\u201d touchpad which, in normal operation, acts as a pair of orthogonally responsive potentiometers. These \u201cnull\/contact\u201d touchpads do not produce pressure images, proximity images, or other image data but rather, in normal operation, two voltages linearly corresponding to the location of a left-right edge and forward-back edge of a single area of contact. Such \u201cnull\/contact\u201d touchpads, which are universally found in existing laptop computers, are discussed and differentiated from tactile sensor arrays in issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078 and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/761,978. Before leaving this topic, it is pointed out that these the \u201cnull\/contact\u201d touchpads nonetheless can be inexpensively adapted with simple analog electronics to provide at least primitive multi-touch capabilities as taught in issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078 and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/761,978 (pre-grant publication U.S. 2007\/0229477 and therein, paragraphs [0022]-[0029], for example).","More specifically,  (adapted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605) illustrates the side view of a finger  lightly touching the surface  of a tactile sensor array. In this example, the finger  contacts the tactile sensor surface in a relatively small area . In this situation, on either side the finger curves away from the region of contact , where the non-contacting yet proximate portions of the finger grow increasingly far , , , from the surface of the sensor . These variations in physical proximity of portions of the finger with respect to the sensor surface should cause each sensor element in the tactile proximity sensor array to provide a corresponding proximity measurement varying responsively to the proximity, separation distance, etc. The tactile proximity sensor array advantageously comprises enough spatial resolution to provide a plurality of sensors within the area occupied by the finger (for example, the area comprising width ). In this case, as the finger is pressed down, the region of contact  grows as the more and more of the pliable surface of the finger conforms to the tactile sensor array surface , and the distances , , , contract. If the finger is tilted, for example by rolling in the user viewpoint counterclockwise (which in the depicted end-of-finger viewpoint clockwise ) the separation distances on one side of the finger , will contract while the separation distances on one side of the finger , will lengthen. Similarly if the finger is tilted, for example by rolling in the user viewpoint clockwise (which in the depicted end-of-finger viewpoint counterclockwise ) the separation distances on the side of the finger , will contract while the separation distances on the side of the finger , will lengthen.","In many various embodiments, the tactile sensor array can be connected to interface hardware that sends numerical data responsive to tactile information captured by the tactile sensor array to a processor. In various embodiments, this processor will process the data captured by the tactile sensor array and transform it various ways, for example into a collection of simplified data, or into a sequence of tactile image \u201cframes\u201d (this sequence akin to a video stream), or into highly refined information responsive to the position and movement of one or more fingers and other parts of the hand.","As to further detail of the latter example, a \u201cframe\u201d can refer to a 2-dimensional list, number of rows by number of columns, of tactile measurement value of every pixel in a tactile sensor array at a given instance. The time interval between one frame and the next one depends on the frame rate of the system and the number of frames in a unit time (usually frames per second). However, these features are and are not firmly required. For example, in some embodiments a tactile sensor array can not be structured as a 2-dimensional array but rather as row-aggregate and column-aggregate measurements (for example row sums and columns sums as in the tactile sensor of year 2003-2006 Apple Powerbooks, row and column interference measurement data as can be provided by a surface acoustic wave or optical transmission modulation sensor as discussed later in the context of , etc.). Additionally, the frame rate can be adaptively-variable rather than fixed, or the frame can be segregated into a plurality regions each of which are scanned in parallel or conditionally (as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078 and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605), etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0112"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0113"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Types of Tactile Sensor Arrays","The tactile sensor array employed by HDTP technology can be implemented by a wide variety of means, for example:\n\n","Below a few specific examples of the above are provided by way of illustration; however these are by no means limiting. The examples include:\n\n","An example implementation of a tactile sensor array is a pressure sensor array. Pressure sensor arrays discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078 and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/761,978.  depicts a pressure sensor array arrangement comprising a rectangular array of isolated individual two-terminal pressure sensor elements. Such two-terminal pressure sensor elements typically operate by measuring changes in electrical (resistive, capacitive) or optical properties of an elastic material as the material is compressed. In typical embodiment, each sensor element in the sensor array can be individually accessed via multiplexing arrangement, for example as shown in , although other arrangements are possible and provided for by the invention. Examples of prominent manufacturers and suppliers of pressure sensor arrays include Tekscan, Inc. (307 West First Street., South Boston, Mass., 02127, www.tekscan.com), Pressure Profile Systems (5757 Century Boulevard, Suite 600, Los Angeles, Calif. 90045, www.pressureprofile.com), Sensor Products, Inc.

Prominent manufacturers and suppliers of such sensors, both in the form of opaque touchpads and transparent touch screens, include Balda AG (Bergkirchener Str. 228, 32549 Bad Oeynhausen, Del., www.balda.de), Cypress (198 Champion Ct., San Jose, Calif. 95134, www.cypress.com), and Synaptics (2381 Bering Dr., San Jose, Calif. 95131, www.synaptics.com). In such sensors, the region of finger contact is detected by variations in localized capacitance resulting from capacitive proximity effects induced by an overlapping or otherwise nearly-adjacent finger. More specifically, the electrical field at the intersection of orthogonally-aligned conductive buses is influenced by the vertical distance or gap between the surface of the sensor array and the skin surface of the finger. Such capacitive proximity sensor technology is low-cost, reliable, long-life, stable, and can readily be made transparent.  (adapted from http:\/\/www.veritasetvisus.com\/VVTP-12,%20Walker.pdf with slightly more functional detail added) shows a popularly accepted view of a typical cell phone or PDA capacitive proximity sensor implementation. Capacitive sensor arrays of this type can be highly susceptible to noise and various shielding and noise-suppression electronics and systems techniques can need to be employed for adequate stability, reliability, and performance in various electric field and electromagnetically-noisy environments. In some embodiments of an HDTP, the present invention can use the same spatial resolution as current capacitive proximity touchscreen sensor arrays. In other embodiments of the present invention, a higher spatial resolution is advantageous.","Forrest M. Mims is credited as showing that an LED can be used as a light detector as well as a light emitter. Recently, light-emitting diodes have been used as a tactile proximity sensor array (for example, as depicted in the video available at http:\/\/cs.nyu.edu\/\u02dcjhan\/ledtouch\/index.html). Such tactile proximity array implementations typically need to be operated in a darkened environment (as seen in the video in the above web link). In one embodiment provided for by the invention, each LED in an array of LEDs can be used as a photodetector as well as a light emitter, although a single LED can either transmit or receive information at one time. Each LED in the array can sequentially be selected to be set to be in receiving mode while others adjacent to it are placed in light emitting mode. A particular LED in receiving mode can pick up reflected light from the finger, provided by said neighboring illuminating-mode LEDs.  depicts an implementation. The invention provides for additional systems and methods for not requiring darkness in the user environment in order to operate the LED array as a tactile proximity sensor. In one embodiment, potential interference from ambient light in the surrounding user environment can be limited by using an opaque pliable or elastically deformable surface covering the LED array that is appropriately reflective (directionally, amorphously, etc. as can be advantageous in a particular design) on the side facing the LED array. Such a system and method can be readily implemented in a wide variety of ways as is clear to one skilled in the art. In another embodiment, potential interference from ambient light in the surrounding user environment can be limited by employing amplitude, phase, or pulse width modulated circuitry or software to control the underlying light emission and receiving process. For example, in an implementation the LED array can be configured to emit modulated light modulated at a particular carrier frequency or variational waveform and respond to only modulated light signal components extracted from the received light signals comprising that same carrier frequency or variational waveform. Such a system and method can be readily implemented in a wide variety of ways as is clear to one skilled in the art.","Use of video cameras for gathering control information from the human hand in various ways is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078 and Pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/683,915. Here the camera image array is employed as an HDTP tactile sensor array. Images of the human hand as captured by video cameras can be used as an enhanced multiple-parameter interface responsive to hand positions and gestures, for example as taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/683,915 Pre-Grant-Publication 2004\/0118268 (paragraphs [314], [321]-[332], [411], [653], both stand-alone and in view of [325], as well as [241]-[263]). depict single camera implementations, while depicts a two camera implementation. As taught in the aforementioned references, a wide range of relative camera sizes and positions with respect to the hand are provided for, considerably generalizing the arrangements shown in ","In another video camera tactile controller embodiment, a flat or curved transparent or translucent surface or panel can be used as sensor surface. When a finger is placed on the transparent or translucent surface or panel, light applied to the opposite side of the surface or panel reflects light in a distinctly different manner than in other regions where there is no finger or other tactile contact. The image captured by an associated video camera will provide gradient information responsive to the contact and proximity of the finger with respect to the surface of the translucent panel. For example, the parts of the finger that are in contact with the surface will provide the greatest degree of reflection while parts of the finger that curve away from the surface of the sensor provide less reflection of the light. Gradients of the reflected light captured by the video camera can be arranged to produce a gradient image that appears similar to the multilevel quantized image captured by a pressure sensor. By comparing changes in gradient, changes in the position of the finger and pressure applied by the finger can be detected.  depicts an implementation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0133"},"figref":["FIGS. 12-12","FIG. 12","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0134"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},"Compensation for Non-Ideal Behavior of Tactile Sensor Arrays","Individual sensor elements in a tactile sensor array produce measurements that vary sensor-by-sensor when presented with the same stimulus. Inherent statistical averaging of the algorithmic mathematics can damp out much of this, but for small image sizes (for example, as rendered by a small finger or light contact), as well as in cases where there are extremely large variances in sensor element behavior from sensor to sensor, the invention provides for each sensor to be individually calibrated in implementations where that can be advantageous. Sensor-by-sensor measurement value scaling, offset, and nonlinear warpings can be invoked for all or selected sensor elements during data acquisition scans. Similarly, the invention provides for individual noisy or defective sensors can be tagged for omission during data acquisition scans.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0137"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0138"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},"Additionally, the macroscopic arrangement of sensor elements can introduce nonlinear spatial warping effects. As an example, various manufacturer implementations of capacitive proximity sensor arrays and associated interface electronics are known to comprise often dramatic nonlinear spatial warping effects.  (adapted from http:\/\/labs.moto.com\/diy-touchscreen-analysis\/) depicts the comparative performance of a group of contemporary handheld devices wherein straight lines were entered using the surface of the respective touchscreens. A common drawing program was used on each device, with widely-varying type and degrees of nonlinear spatial warping effects clearly resulting. For simple gestures such as selections, finger-flicks, drags, spreads, etc., such nonlinear spatial warping effects introduce little consequence. For more precision applications, such nonlinear spatial warping effects introduce unacceptable performance. Close study of  shows different types of responses to tactile stimulus in the direct neighborhood of the relatively widely-spaced capacitive sensing nodes versus tactile stimulus in the boundary regions between capacitive sensing nodes. Increasing the number of capacitive sensing nodes per unit area can reduce this, as can adjustments to the geometry of the capacitive sensing node conductors. In many cases improved performance can be obtained by introducing or more carefully implementing interpolation mathematics.","Types of Hand Contact Measurements and Features Provided by HDTP Technology",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0141"},"figref":["FIGS. 17-17","FIGS. 17-17","FIG. 17","FIGS. 17-17"]},"Each of the six parameters listed above can be obtained from operations on a collection of sums involving the geometric location and tactile measurement value of each tactile measurement sensor. Of the six parameters, the left-right geometric center, forward-back geometric center, and clockwise-counterclockwise yaw rotation can be obtained from binary threshold image data. The average downward pressure, roll, and pitch parameters are in some embodiments beneficially calculated from gradient (multi-level) image data. One remark is that because binary threshold image data is sufficient for the left-right geometric center, forward-back geometric center, and clockwise-counterclockwise yaw rotation parameters, these also can be discerned for flat regions of rigid non-pliable objects, and thus the HDTP technology thus can be adapted to discern these three parameters from flat regions with striations or indentations of rigid non-pliable objects.","These \u2018Position Displacement\u2019 parameters can be realized by various types of unweighted averages computed across the blob of one or more of each the geometric location and tactile measurement value of each above-threshold measurement in the tactile sensor image. The pivoting rotation can be calculated from a least-squares slope which in turn involves sums taken across the blob of one or more of each the geometric location and the tactile measurement value of each active cell in the image; alternatively a high-performance adapted eigenvector method taught in co-pending provisional patent application U.S. Ser.

HTDP technology can also be configured to recognize and measure postures and gestures involving three or more fingers, various parts of the hand, the entire hand, multiple hands, etc. Accordingly, the HDTP technology can be configured to measure areas of contact separately, recognize shapes, fuse measures or pre-measurement data so as to create aggregated measurements, and other operations.","By way of example,  (adapted from U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078) illustrates the pressure profiles for a number of example hand contacts with a pressure-sensor array. In the case  of a finger's end, pressure on the touch pad pressure-sensor array can be limited to the finger tip, resulting in a spatial pressure distribution profile ; this shape does not change much as a function of pressure. Alternatively, the finger can contact the pad with its flat region, resulting in light pressure profiles  which are smaller in size than heavier pressure profiles . In the case  where the entire finger touches the pad, a three-segment pattern (, , ) will result under many conditions; under light pressure a two segment pattern (or missing) could result. In all but the lightest pressures the thumb makes a somewhat discernible shape  as do the wrist , edge-of-hand \u201ccuff\u201d , and palm ; at light pressures these patterns thin and can also break into disconnected regions. Whole hand patterns such the fist  and flat hand  have more complex shapes. In the case of the fist , a degree of curl can be discerned from the relative geometry and separation of sub-regions (here depicted, as an example, as , , and ). In the case of the whole flat hand , there can be two or more sub-regions which can be in fact joined (as within ) or disconnected (as an example, as and are); the whole hand also affords individual measurement of separation \u201cangles\u201d among the digits and thumb (, , , ) which can easily be varied by the user.","HDTP technology robustly provides feature-rich capability for tactile sensor array contact with two or more fingers, with other parts of the hand, or with other pliable (and for some parameters, non-pliable) objects. In one embodiment, one finger on each of two different hands can be used together to at least double number of parameters that can be provided. Additionally, new parameters particular to specific hand contact configurations and postures can also be obtained. By way of example,  (adapted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605 and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078) depicts one of a wide range of tactile sensor images that can be measured by using more of the human hand. U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,078 and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/761,978 provide additional detail on use of other parts of hand. Within the context of the example of :\n\n","Other HDTP Processing, Signal Flows, and Operations","In order to accomplish this range of capabilities, HDTP technologies must be able to parse tactile images and perform operations based on the parsing. In general, contact between the tactile-sensor array and multiple parts of the same hand forfeits some degrees of freedom but introduces others. For example, if the end joints of two fingers are pressed against the sensor array as in , it will be difficult or impossible to induce variations in the image of one of the end joints in six different dimensions while keeping the image of the other end joints fixed. However, there are other parameters that can be varied, such as the angle between two fingers, the difference in coordinates of the finger tips, and the differences in pressure applied by each finger.","In general, compound images can be adapted to provide control over many more parameters than a single contiguous image can. For example, the two-finger postures considered above can readily pro-vide a nine-parameter set relating to the pair of fingers as a separate composite object adjustable within an ergonomically comfortable range. One example nine-parameter set the two-finger postures consider above is:","composite average x position;","inter-finger differential x position;","composite average y position;","inter-finger differential y position;","composite average pressure;","inter-finger differential pressure;","composite roll;","composite pitch;","composite yaw.","As another example, by using the whole hand pressed flat against the sensor array including the palm and wrist, it is readily possible to vary as many as sixteen or more parameters independently of one another. A single hand held in any of a variety of arched or partially-arched postures provides a very wide range of postures that can be recognized and parameters that can be calculated.","When interpreted as a compound image, extracted parameters such as geometric center, average downward pressure, tilt (pitch and roll), and pivot (yaw) can be calculated for the entirety of the asterism or constellation of smaller blobs. Additionally, other parameters associated with the asterism or constellation can be calculated as well, such as the aforementioned angle of separation between the fingers. Other examples include the difference in downward pressure applied by the two fingers, the difference between the left-right (\u201cx\u201d) centers of the two fingertips, and the difference between the two forward-back (\u201cy\u201d) centers of the two fingertips. Other compound image parameters are possible and are provided by HDTP technology.","There are number of ways for implementing the handling of compound posture data images. Two contrasting examples are depicted in (adapted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605) although many other possibilities exist and are provided for by the invention. In the embodiment of , tactile image data is examined for the number \u201cM\u201d of isolated blobs (\u201cregions\u201d) and the primitive running sums are calculated for each blob. This can be done, for example, with the algorithms described earlier. Post-scan calculations can then be performed for each blob, each of these producing an extracted parameter set (for example, x position, y position, average pressure, roll, pitch, yaw) uniquely associated with each of the M blobs (\u201cregions\u201d). The total number of blobs and the extracted parameter sets are directed to a compound image parameter mapping function to produce various types of outputs, including:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0173"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 22"],"i":"a.

As the rotation angle increases in magnitude, the range of tilting motion decreases as mobile range of human wrists gets restricted. The invention provides for compensation for the expected tilt range variation as a function of measured yaw rotation angle. An embodiment is depicted in the middle portion of  (adapted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605). As another example of user-experience correction of calculated parameters, the user and application can interpret the tilt measurement in a variety of ways. In one variation for this example, tilting the finger can be interpreted as changing an angle of an object, control dial, etc. in an application. In another variation for this example, tilting the finger can be interpreted by an application as changing the position of an object within a plane, shifting the position of one or more control sliders, etc. Typically each of these interpretations would require the application of at least linear, and typically nonlinear, mathematical transformations so as to obtain a matched user experience for the selected metaphor interpretation of tilt. In one embodiment, these mathematical transformations can be performed as illustrated in the lower portion of . The invention provides for embodiments with no, one, or a plurality of such metaphor interpretation of tilt.","As the finger is tilted to the left or right, the shape of the area of contact becomes narrower and shifts away from the center to the left or right. Similarly as the finger is tilted forward or backward, the shape of the area of contact becomes shorter and shifts away from the center forward or backward. For a better user experience, the invention provides for embodiments to include systems and methods to compensate for these effects (i.e. for shifts in blob size, shape, and center) as part of the tilt measurement portions of the implementation. Additionally, the raw tilt measures can also typically be improved by additional processing. (adapted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605) depicts an embodiment wherein the raw tilt measurement is used to make corrections to the geometric center measurement under at least conditions of varying the tilt of the finger. Additionally, the invention provides for yaw angle compensation for systems and situations wherein the yaw measurement is sufficiently affected by tilting of the finger.

For example, in a computer-based application, a measurement training procedure will prompt a user to move their finger around within a number of different positions while it records the shapes, patterns, or data derived from it for later use specifically for that user.","Typically most finger postures make a distinctive pattern. In one embodiment, a user-measurement training procedure could involve having the user prompted to touch the tactile sensor array in a number of different positions, for example as depicted in (adapted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605). In some embodiments only representative extreme positions are recorded, such as the nine postures -. In yet other embodiments, or cases wherein a particular user does not provide sufficient variation in image shape, additional postures can be included in the measurement training procedure, for example as depicted in (adapted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605). In some embodiments, trajectories of hand motion as hand contact postures are changed can be recorded as part of the measurement training procedure, for example the eight radial trajectories as depicted in , the boundary-tracing trajectories of (adapted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/418,605), as well as others that would be clear to one skilled in the art.

It can either be done with a timer, where the computer will prompt user to move his finger from position  to position , and the tactile image imprinted by the finger will be recorded at points ., . and .. Another way would be for the computer to query user to tilt their finger a portion of the way, for example \u201cTilt your finger \u2154 of the full range\u201d and record that imprint. Other methods are clear to one skilled in the art and are provided for by the invention.","Additionally, this training procedure allows other types of shapes and hand postures to be trained into the system as well.

This data can be previously preprocessed (for example, using one or more of compensation, filtering, thresholding, and other operations) as shown in the figure, or can be presented directly from the sensor array or other form of sensor. In some implementations, operations such as compensation, thresholding, and filtering can be implemented as part of such a blob allocation step. In some implementations, the blob allocation step provides one or more of a data record for each blob comprising a plurality of running sum quantities derived from blob measurements, the number of blobs, a list of blob indices, shape information about blobs, the list of sensor element addresses in the blob, actual measurement values for the relevant sensor elements, and other information. A blob classification step can include for example shape information and can also include information regarding individual noncontiguous blobs that can or should be merged (for example, blobs representing separate segments of a finger, blobs representing two or more fingers or parts of the hand that are in at least a particular instance are to be treated as a common blob or otherwise to be associated with one another, blobs representing separate portions of a hand, etc.). A blob aggregation step can include any resultant aggregation operations including, for example, the association or merging of blob records, associated calculations, etc. Ultimately a final collection of blob records are produced and applied to calculation and refinement steps used to produce user interface parameter vectors. The elements of such user interface parameter vectors can comprise values responsive to one or more of forward-back position, left-right position, downward pressure, roll angle, pitch angle, yaw angle, etc from the associated region of hand input and can also comprise other parameters including rates of change of there or other parameters, spread of fingers, pressure differences or proximity differences among fingers, etc. Additionally there can be interactions between refinement stages and calculation stages, reflecting, for example, the kinds of operations described earlier in conjunction with , and ","The resulting parameter vectors can be provided to applications, mappings to applications, window systems, operating systems, as well as to further HDTP processing. For example, the resulting parameter vectors can be further processed to obtain symbols, provide additional mappings, etc. In this arrangement, depending on the number of points of contact and how they are interpreted and grouped, one or more shapes and constellations can be identified, counted, and listed, and one or more associated parameter vectors can be produced. The parameter vectors can comprise, for example, one or more of forward-back, left-right, downward pressure, roll, pitch, and yaw associated with a point of contact. In the case of a constellation, for example, other types of data can be in the parameter vector, for example inter-fingertip separation differences, differential pressures, etc.","Example First-Level Measurement Calculation Chain","Attention is now directed to particulars of roll and pitch measurements of postures and gestures. depicts a side view of an exemplary finger and illustrating the variations in the pitch angle. depict exemplary tactile image measurements (proximity sensing, pressure sensing, contact sensing, etc.) as a finger in contact with the touch sensor array is positioned at various pitch angles with respect to the surface of the sensor. In these, the small black dot denotes the geometric center corresponding to the finger pitch angle associated with . As the finger pitch angle is varied, it can be seen that:\n\n","From the user experience viewpoint, however, the user would not feel that a change in the front-back component of the finger's contact with the touch sensor array has changed. This implies the front-back component (\u201cy\u201d) of the geometric center of contact shape as measured by the touch sensor array should be corrected responsive to the measured pitch angle. This suggests a final or near-final measured pitch angle value should be calculated first and used to correct the final value of the measured front-back component (\u201cy\u201d) of the geometric center of contact shape.","Additionally, depict the effect of increased downward pressure on the respective contact shapes of . More specifically, the top row of are the respective contact shapes of , and the bottom row show the effect of increased downward pressure. In each case the oval shape expands in area (via an observable expansion in at least one dimension of the oval) which could thus shift the final value of the measured front-back component (\u201cy\u201d). (It is noted that for the case of a pressure sensor array, the measured pressure values measured by most or all of the sensors in the contact area would also increase accordingly.)","These and previous considerations imply:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0192","num":"0247"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIGS. 34-34","FIG. 34"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0030","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0030-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0031","list-style":"none"},"li":["The eccentricity of the oval shape changes;","The position of the oval shape migrates and in the cases of and have a geometric center shifted from that of , and in the cases of the oval shape migrates enough to no longer even overlap the geometric center of \n\nFrom the user experience, however, the user would not feel that the left-right component of the finger's contact with the touch sensor array has changed. This implies the left-right component (\u201cx\u201d) of the geometric center of contact shape as measured by the touch sensor array should be corrected responsive to the measured roll angle. This suggests a final or near-final measured roll angle value should be calculated first and used to correct the final value of the measured left-right component (\u201cx\u201d) of the geometric center of contact shape.\n"]}}}},"As with measurement of the finger pitch angle, increasing downward pressure applied by the finger can also invoke variations in contact shape involved in roll angle measurement, but typically these variations are minor and less significant for roll measurements than they are for pitch measurements. Accordingly, at least to a first level of approximation, effects of increasing the downward pressure can be neglected in calculation of roll angle.","Depending on the method used in calculating the pitch and roll angles, it is typically advantageous to first correct for yaw angle before calculating the pitch and roll angles. One source reason for this is that (dictated by hand and wrist physiology) from the user experience a finger at some non-zero yaw angle with respect to the natural rest-alignment of the finger would impart intended roll and pitch postures or gestures from the vantage point of the yawed finger position. Without a yaw-angle correction somewhere, the roll and pitch postures and movements of the finger would resolve into rotated components. As an extreme example of this, if the finger were yawed at a 90-degree angle with respect to a natural rest-alignment, roll postures and movements would measure as pitch postures and movements while pitch postures and movements would measure as roll postures and movements. As a second example of this, if the finger were yawed at a 45-degree angle, each roll and pitch posture and movement would case both roll and pitch measurement components. Additionally, some methods for calculating the pitch and roll angles (such as curve fitting and polynomial regression methods as taught in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/038,372) work better if the blob data on which they operate is not rotated by a yaw angle. This suggests that a final or near-final measured yaw angle value should be calculated first and used in a yaw-angle rotation correction to the blob data applied to calculation of roll and pitch angles.","Regarding other calculations, at least to a first level of approximation downward pressure measurement in principle should not be affected by yaw angle. Also at least to a first level of approximation, for geometric center calculations sufficiently corrected for roll and pitch effects in principle should not be affected by yaw angle. (In practice there can be at least minor effects, to be considered and addressed later).","The example working first level of approximation conclusions together suggest a causal chain of calculation such as that depicted in .  depicts a utilization of this causal chain as a sequence flow of calculation blocks.  does not, however, represent a data flow since calculations in subsequent blocks depend on blob data in ways other than as calculated in preceding blocks.

Approximations of the full needed range of yaw angle values (for example from nearly \u221290 degrees through zero to nearly +90 degrees, or in a more restricted system from nearly \u221245 degrees through zero to nearly +45 degrees) can therefore not be realistically approximated by a linear function.

the previous construction, in principle, one could gather a large collection of data points and solve for all of the unknowns that includes 36 unknown elements (d variables) in the D matrix and 30 unknown elements (c variables) over the six classes of ambient vectors. However those equations are not linear because there are cross products between unknown variables in the matrix D (d variables) and unknown c variables in the six classes of ambient vectors.","In an embodiment, a simplifying approximation is employed wherein the distorted vector data chosen can be of a within a limited region R of variation of the ambient vector parameters represented by z, and the c values can be approximated by the average of the data for that element in the ambient vector class. This approach removes 30 unknown (c variables) elements over the six classes of ambient vectors and also makes the equations linear with respect to those 36 unknown elements.","In one approach provided for by the invention, the 36 unknown elements in the D matrix are solved for using linear methods.

As the transformations discussed are intended to allow each of the z values to vary within the region R, a specific associated numerical value for each of the z values can be chosen within the region Rthat allows for both:","the matrix comprised of c values and z values to be non-singular","the resulting D matrix thus determined to also be non-singular","This Dmatrix can be used to introduce a regionally-defined decoupling of the six intended HDTP parameter values from the six measured HDTP as described in the opening of this section.","The aforementioned, as well as other variations, can be implemented as an algorithm on a digital computer, embedded processor, signal processor, or combination of two or more of these.","In an embodiment, the measured parameter values determine a parameter space region Rwhich in turn determines an associated linear or affine transformation used to improve the decoupling within that region of parameter space. As the measured parameter values change in such a way so that the cross into another parameter space region R, another associated linear transformation used to improve the decoupling within that region of parameter space.","In an embodiment, should the measured parameter values lie at a boundary shared by parameter space region Rand parameter space region R, the two aforementioned associated linear or affine transformations can be selected to that the decoupled parameter values agree no matter which of the two associated linear transformations is used. In this manner, there is no \u201cjump\u201d as transformations change at the condition boundary.","Other arrangements can be used to obtain smooth transitions between associated linear transformations when crossing boundaries within regions, for example, an interpolation between the linear transformations in the neighborhood surrounding the boundary between the two bordering regions.","The terms \u201ccertain embodiments\u201d, \u201can embodiment\u201d, \u201cembodiment\u201d, \u201cembodiments\u201d, \u201cthe embodiment\u201d, \u201cthe embodiments\u201d, \u201cone or more embodiments\u201d, \u201csome embodiments\u201d, and \u201cone embodiment\u201d mean one or more (but not all) embodiments unless expressly specified otherwise.
