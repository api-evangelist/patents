No. 12\/079,063, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,020,505, hereby incorporated by reference, entitled, \u201cProbe Receiver Device for Recovering Surface Water Vessels,\u201d filed Mar. 3, 2008.","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/268,656, filed May 19, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy, and, thus the claimed invention may be manufactured, used, licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.","The following description relates generally to an apparatus for fueling a surface water vessel, and in particular, an arrangement for latching and fueling a surface water vessel at a floating station that is remote from a parent ship.","The recovery of smaller surface water vessels, such as manned or unmanned surface water vessels (USVs), by larger parent ships is an emerging technology. Once recovered by the parent ship, servicing operations such as fueling may be performed. Typically, the recovery of a smaller vessel is accomplished by driving the smaller vessel alongside a stationary parent ship and lifted by davit into the ship. Alternatively, the smaller water vessel may be driven up a ramp into the larger ship.","Traditional methods of capturing smaller surface water vessels can cause damage to the hull of the smaller vessel. For example, some USVs weigh about 20,000 lbs and are made from materials such as aluminum. A capturing method that for example, requires the USV to be driven into a parent ship or be lifted and dropped onto the parent ship can cause damage to the aluminum hull, resulting in expensive repairs. The prior art does not teach a method and apparatus that captures the smaller vessel in a controlled manner away from the parent ship in order to perform servicing operations such as fueling.","In one aspect, the invention is a fueling system for securing and fueling a water vessel at a floating station. The fueling system includes a parent ship having a fuel supply and a pump for delivering fuel from the fuel supply. The fueling system also includes a floating station remote from the parent ship. In this aspect, the floating station includes a tow opening, a fuel-delivering arrangement connected to the fuel supply of the parent ship. The fuel-delivering arrangement includes a hose, and a hose feeder for feeding the hose. The fueling system further includes a water vessel having a bow end and a stern end. The water vessel has a latching probe extending from the bow end, releasably latched within the tow opening of the floating station, and a fueling port for receiving fuel via the fuel-delivering arrangement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","200","300","101","101","100","300","300","100","300","100","200","301","101","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["300","203","200","310","310","200","300","310","312","210","200","312","210","300","300","200","201"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1A"],"b":["300","100","120","130","100","301","300","130","100","300","200","100","150","130","155","150","130","150","300","130","140","300","140","130","200","210","310","200","300"],"sub":"1 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","200","101","200","201","203","200","210","201","210","201","310","200","300","310","315","210","310","315"]},"As shown in , the water vessel  further includes a fueling port  for receiving fuel from the parent ship , via the floating station .

Thereafter, the funnel actuator  moves the funnel  to a forward-most position, so that the funnel  is adjacent to the receiver flap . The funnel sensor , such as a photo sensor, may be used to detect when the funnel  is adjacent to the deployed receiver flap , thereby creating a continuous hose-feeding path. The continuous hose-feeding path allows the hose  to be fed from the funnel  of the fuel-delivering arrangement  through the deployed flap opening  of the water vessel . It should be noted that with the exception of the capturing of the probe  within the funnel , all aspects of the fueling operation between water vessel  and the floating station  are equally applicable to the fueling operations between the water vessel  and the floating station .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","401","401","100","401","255","315","335","355","401","410","400","401","155","225","265","340","360","401","100"]},"The operation of the system  is hereby outlined. As shown in , the fueling system  includes a parent ship , a floating station  that is remote from the parent ship , and a water vessel . As noted above, water vessel  may be alternatively used in the system . The floating station  receives fuel from the parent ship  via the conduit . This fuel may be delivered to the water vessel (, ) through the hose  located at the floating station. In operation, the water vessel (, ) approaches the floating station  in the direction Xto be latched therein, where servicing operations, such as fueling may commence. The water vessel (, ) is latched to the floating station  when the probe  at the hull of the vessel is fully inserted into the tow opening  of the latching device , and properly clamped within the latching arrangement . The latching of the probe  within the latching device  serves to vertically align the funnel  with either the probe  (of vessel ) or the deployed receiver flap  (of vessel ). Alternatively, the funnel may be vertically adjustable, if desired.","The latch sensor  detects the proper latching of the probe  in the latching device , and transmits a signal to the controller  indicating that the water vessel (, ) is properly secured to the floating station. The sensor  may be a movable mechanical arm or poppet that is pushed in a predetermined direction only when the probe  is securely clamped in the latching arrangement. If fueling is desired, a user may input a \u201cfuel\u201d command signal via the input device  initiating the fueling process. The user may enter this command before or after the water vessel (, ) has been secured at the floating station. However, fueling would only be initiated after the controller  receives a signal indicating that the vessel is properly secured.","In response to the user input and the signal from sensor , the controller initiates the funnel actuator  which moves the funnel  in the direction Xto an extended position. In the embodiment in which water vessel  is employed, as the funnel moves in direction X, the funnel  captures the hollow port probe  within, as shown in . As stated above, the funnel sensor , which may be a photosensor, detects when the hollow port probe  is fully captured within the funnel . When the hollow port probe  is fully captured, a continuous hose passage is formed between the funnel  and the fueling port , allowing for the smooth feeding of the hose  from fuel-delivering arrangement  to the water vessel . In response to a \u201cfully captured\u201d signal by the funnel sensor , the controller  initiates the hose drive  which then feeds the hose  from around the hose reel  through the funnel  into the fueling port , i.e., through the hollow port probe  and the conduit relay , into the fuel tank  of the water vessel .","Alternatively, in the embodiment in which water vessel  is employed, when fueling is initiated, the funnel  moves in direction X, towards the receiver flap  of the vessel ; to position the funnel  adjacent to the receiver flap . Before the funnel  is moved to the forward in direction X, the receiver flap  may be pivoted to the deployed position in response to either the controller  or the user input via device . The funnel sensor , which may be a photosensor, detects when the funnel  is positioned adjacent to the deployed receiver flap , thereby creating a continuous hose path formed between the funnel  and the flap , allowing for the smooth feeding of the hose  from fuel-delivering arrangement  to the water vessel . When the funnel sensor  signals that funnel  has attained a working position adjacent to the flap , the controller  initiates the hose drive  which then feeds the hose  from around the hose reel  through the funnel  into the fueling port  and into the fuel tank  of the water vessel .","In all system embodiments, i.e., employing either water vessel  or water vessel , the hose  is fed only to a predetermined length, i.e., a length that enables the hose  to reach the fuel tank  and to properly fill the tank with the fuel. As stated above, the hose reel  includes a hose reel sensor , which may be a ball clamp in combination with one or more electrical contacts. The ball clamp may be positioned so that when the predetermined length of hose  is dispensed, the ball clamp trips the one or more contacts, thereby producing the desired signal terminating the feeding of the hose . As shown in , water vessels  and  may each include one or more piping valves . Thus, when piping valves are included, the controller opens these one or more valves to allow the hose  into the respective fueling ports.","In response to the termination of the feeding of the hose , the controller  actuates the pump  on the parent ship . As stated above, the pump  may be a 1.5 HP high head centrifugal pump capable of supplying about 27 gallons per minute at about 65 psi. The pump begins pumping fuel from the parent ship tank  to the floating station , which is received by the fuel-delivering arrangement . The fuel is then fed through the hose  to the fuel tank  in water vessel (, ). As stated above, the hose  may include a delivery valve that opens at a predetermined supply pressure of about 5 psi.","The fuel level sensor  detects when the fuel level in the tank  reaches a \u201cfull\u201d level, and transmits to the controller  a signal indicating that the tank  is full. In response to this signal, the controller  cuts off the pump and terminates the delivery of fuel. Additionally, the controller  actuates the hose drive , which reverses rotation direction and pulls the hose  from the fueling port (, ). The hose is thus rewound about the hose reel . This ends the fueling operation, after which the water vessel (, ) may be retained for towing or for further servicing operations, or the alternatively, the water vessel (, ) may be released by unlatching and withdrawing the probe  from the latching device .","What has been described and illustrated herein are preferred embodiments of the invention along with some variations.
