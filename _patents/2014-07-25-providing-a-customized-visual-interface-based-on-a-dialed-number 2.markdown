title: Providing a customized visual interface based on a dialed number
abstract: A system may be configured to receive an indication that a call has been placed (e.g., to a call center), and may provide a customized visual interface. The customized visual interface may include information that is potentially relevant to a user who has placed the call, and may be based on, for example, a user profile or history information, a purchase history of goods or services offered by an entity associated with the called party. The customized visual interface may allow the user to more quickly satisfy the purposes of his or her call than through traditional audio or touchtone menus.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of, and is a continuation-in-part of, presently pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14\/185,812, titled \u201cPROVIDING A VISUAL INTERFACE BASED ON A DIALED NUMBER,\u201d filed on Feb. 20, 2014, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.","Companies often use interactive voice response (\u201cIVR\u201d) systems to route telephone calls from customers to representatives that are relevant to customers' needs. IVR systems may make use of automated messages played back to users to represent menus and menu options, and may allow users to navigate the menus by providing vocal feedback and\/or by pressing keys on a number pad.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Companies often use call centers to handle calls from customers. Such calls may correspond to requests to purchase goods or services, obtain customer service, or the like. As smart phone become more and more common, the proportion of calls to companies' call centers from smart phones, compared to landline phones, increases. Calls from smart phones are typically handled the same way as calls from landline phones, even though smart phones often have the capability for richer, more efficient user interaction than landline phones. For example, smart phones generally have the capability of visually displaying information.","Some implementations, described herein, allow for the presentation of visual interfaces in response to certain telephone calls, such as a call directed to a call center of a company. These visual interfaces may allow for an enhanced user experience, as a user may be able to more quickly achieve the user's goals (e.g., obtain information, purchase goods or services, solve a problem, etc.) using a visual interface than would be possible through a purely voice-based system. As described below, in some implementations, the visual interfaces may be customized based on user information, in order to further enhance the user's experience. Further, a company that offers the visual interface may save resources (e.g., telephony resources, human resources, etc.) that would be expended by a purely voice-based system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-4","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","1","1"]},"For example, the VI application may request (at arrow \u201c\u201d) a visual interface from a VI server. The VI server may provide (at arrow \u201c\u201d) a visual interface (and\/or a link to the visual interface) that corresponds to the dialed number. The VI application may output (at arrow \u201c\u201d) a VI notification, which may cause the user device to alert the user that a visual interface has been provided. For example, the alert may include an audio alert, requesting that the user interface direct his or her attention to a display screen of the user device. Additionally or alternatively, the alert may include a haptic alert, notifying the user to direct his or her attention to a display screen of the user device. As further shown, the visual interface may be presented (at \u201c\u201d), via the display screen of the user device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As indicated by the bold and shading in the figure, assume that the user has selected the \u201cPurchase tickets for events near you\u201d option.  illustrates an example visual interface that may be provided based on the selection of the \u201cPurchase tickets for events near you\u201d option. As shown, the visual interface may provide options to purchase tickets for upcoming events at venues that are near the user's location, as well as an option to speak to an agent. As shown, assume that the user has selected the \u201cSpeak to an agent\u201d option.","As shown in , and based on the selection of this option, the VI application may call a call center (e.g., the call center initially dialed in , and\/or a different call center). As described below, this call may be placed based on the selections made by the user in the visual interface. For example, a call to a telephone number may be placed directly to an agent who assists users in selecting an event for which to purchase tickets. This telephone number may be different than the telephone number initially dialed (in ). Additionally, or alternatively, the dialed call center may receive information regarding selections made by the user, so that an agent at the call center may be able to provide assistance to the user without requiring the user to provide information regarding the user's desires that the user has already provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","505","510","515","520","525","530"]},"The quantity of devices and\/or networks, illustrated in , is provided for explanatory purposes only. In practice, environment  may include additional devices and\/or networks; fewer devices and\/or networks; different devices and\/or networks; or differently arranged devices and\/or networks than illustrated in . Alternatively, or additionally, one or more of the devices of environment  may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more of the devices of environments . Devices of environment  may interconnect with each other and\/or other devices via wired connections, wireless connections, or a combination of wired and wireless connections.","User device  may include any computation and communication device, such as a wireless mobile communication device that is capable of communicating with one or more networks (e.g., network ). For example, user device  may include a radiotelephone; a personal communications system (\u201cPCS\u201d) terminal (e.g., a device that combines a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities); a personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d) (e.g., that can include a radiotelephone, a pager, Internet\/intranet access, etc.); a smart phone; a laptop computer; a tablet computer; a camera; a set-top device (\u201cSTD\u201d), a personal gaming system, a wearable device, and\/or another type of mobile computation and communication device. , described below, illustrates an example of user device , according to some implementations.","VI server  may include a server device, or a collection of server devices, that maintains information that correlates contact information (e.g., telephone numbers) to visual interfaces. For example, as described below with respect to , VI server  may store information that correlates telephone numbers to links (e.g., Uniform Resource Locators (\u201cURLs\u201d)) associated with corresponding visual interfaces. VI server  may receive an indication (e.g., from a user device, from a particular call center , and\/or from another source) that a particular call center  has been dialed, and may provide a URL for a corresponding visual interface. As described below, the URL may correspond to content served by, for example, content provider . In some implementations, VI server  may deliver content (e.g., visual interface content) in lieu of providing a link to the content.","Content provider  may include a server device, or a collection of server devices, that store and\/or provide content, such as web content, to user device . Content provider  may, for instance, include a web server that provides stored content in response to requests for the content. The requests may, for example, include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d) requests. For instance, these requests may be based on URLs provided to user device  by VI server . Content provider  may, in some implementations, output requested content using HTTP, Short Message Service (\u201cSMS\u201d), Multimedia Messaging Service (\u201cMMS\u201d), HTML5 WebSocket, WebRTC Data Channel, and\/or another protocol or technique. The content, provided by content provider , may correspond to, for example, visual interfaces in accordance with implementations described herein. In some implementations, VI server  and content provider  may be implemented together as a single device or a single collection of devices.","IVR server  may include a server device, or a collection of server devices, that identifies options, in an IVR menu, that correspond to user input (e.g., as received via a visual interface provided by content provider ). For instance, as described below with respect to , IVR server  may store information regarding options in an IVR menu, such as an IVR menu associated with a call center. IVR server  may use this information to identify IVR menu options that correspond to user input, in order to effectively allow the user to select IVR menu options without necessarily having to listen to audio playback that indicates the IVR menu options. IVR server  may also place calls according to the IVR menu options. These calls may be, for example, calls to telephone numbers associated with the menu options, which may be different from a telephone number initially placed to a call center associated with the IVR menu. For instance, while the initially-placed telephone number may be a number associated with a customer service department of the company, the call placed by IVR server , based on the selection of a particular IVR menu options, may be placed to a particular department of the customer service department of the company. In some implementations, IVR server  may provide content to user device . For example, IVR server  may provide content for user device  to display while user device  is \u201con hold\u201d during a call.","Call center  may include a set of devices that receive calls (e.g., customer service calls) from user device  and\/or from IVR server . Call center  may be attended to by one or more agents (e.g., operators) that receive the calls and assist users who call call center . Call center  may include, for example, telephone devices (e.g., landline telephone devices, Voice over Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) devices, etc.), workstations (e.g., desktop computers, laptop computers, etc.), tablets, wearable computers, server devices, and\/or other types of devices.","Network  may include one or more networks, via which user device , VI server , content provider , IVR server , and\/or call center  may communicate. For example, network  may include an evolved packet system (\u201cEPS\u201d) that includes a Long Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) network and\/or an evolved packet core (\u201cEPC\u201d) network that operate based on a third generation partnership project (\u201c3GPP\u201d) wireless communication standard. The LTE network may be, or may include, a radio access network (\u201cRAN\u201d) that includes one or more base stations, some or all of which may take the form of an eNodeB (\u201ceNB\u201d), via which user device  and\/or another device may communicate with the EPC network. The EPC network may include one or more serving gateways (\u201cSGWs\u201d), mobility management entities (\u201cMMEs\u201d), and\/or packet data network (\u201cPDN\u201d) gateways (\u201cPGWs\u201d), and may enable user device  to communicate with a PDN (e.g., the Internet) and\/or an IP Multimedia Subsystem (\u201cIMS\u201d) core network. The IMS core network may manage authentication, session initiation, account information, a user profile, etc. associated with user device .","Network  may additionally, or alternatively, include the Public Switched Telephone Network (\u201cPSTN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), a metropolitan area network (\u201cMAN\u201d), the Internet, a fiber optic-based network, and\/or a combination of these or other types of networks. Network  may include one or more wireless networks in addition to, or in lieu of, an LTE network. For example, network  may include a Code Division Multiple Access (\u201cCDMA\u201d) 2000 lx network, a second generation (\u201c2G\u201d) wireless network, a third generation (\u201c3G\u201d) wireless network, a fourth generation (\u201c4G\u201d) wireless network, a fifth generation (\u201c5G\u201d) wireless network, a \u201cWi-Fi\u201d wireless network (e.g., a network that operates according to an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (\u201cIEEE\u201d) 802.11 standard), and\/or another wireless network. In some implementations, network  may include, and\/or be communicatively coupled to, one or more other networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["600","600","505","600","605","610","615","620","600"]},"I\/O module  may receive user input, such as dialed numbers and\/or input received via a visual interface. The user input may correspond to, for example, the actuation of \u201chard\u201d buttons (e.g. physical buttons on device ) and\/or soft buttons (e.g., buttons presented via a touchscreen of device ). I\/O module  may also present visual interfaces via a display screen of device , and\/or may audibly present notifications and\/or other sounds associated with visual interfaces, in accordance with some implementations.","VI application  may determine whether a dialed number corresponds to a call center, for which a visual interface is available. For example, VI application  may compare a dialed number to information stored by VI correlation information module  (described below), and\/or may query VI server  regarding the dialed number. For example, VI correlation information module  and\/or VI server  may store contact information (e.g., a list of telephone numbers) that correspond to call centers with which a visual interface is associated.","VI application  may intercept calls (e.g., corresponding to numbers dialed via I\/O module ) that correspond to call centers with which a visual interface is stored. For example, in lieu of allowing the call to go through to a particular call center (e.g., in lieu of allowing a call to be placed via voice call module ), VI application  may retrieve a visual interface (and\/or a link to a visual interface), associated with the call center, from VI server  and\/or content provider , and may cause the visual interface to be presented via I\/O module .","In some implementations, VI application  may place calls, via voice call module . The calls, placed by VI application , may correspond to user input received via a particular visual interface. For example, VI application  may store an event log (e.g., as described below with respect to ) that corresponds to user input received via the user interface, and may place a call (e.g., to IVR server  and\/or to call center ) according to the user input. For example, VI application  may output some, or all, of the event log to IVR server , and\/or may make selections, associated with an IVR menu, based on the information stored in the event log.","In some implementations, VI application  may receive \u201con hold\u201d content to present, while device  is presently engaged on a telephone call with a particular call center . For example, VI application  may receive the \u201con hold\u201d content from IVR server , based on event log information provided by VI application . As described below (e.g., with respect to ), the \u201con hold\u201d content may include content that may be relevant to the user's selections, such as merchandise or information associated with the user's selections, \u201con hold\u201d music associated with the user's selections, etc.","VI correlation information module  may, as described above, store contact information that corresponds to visual interfaces, in accordance with some implementations. For example, as mentioned above, VI correlation information module  may store a list of telephone numbers that are associated with particular call centers . The information, stored by VI correlation information module , may be provided by administrators associated with content provider , IVR server , and\/or call centers . Additionally, or alternatively, the information, stored by VI correlation information module , may be provided by a telecommunications service provider associated with device . In some implementations, device  may not include VI correlation information module . In some such implementations, VI application  may, as mentioned above, query VI server  regarding dialed numbers, in order to determine whether the dialed numbers correspond to call centers for which visual interfaces are available.","Voice call module  may, as described above, be used to place calls (e.g., voice calls). Voice call module  may include, for example, software and\/or hardware circuitry that allows device  to place calls via a wireless telecommunications network (e.g., a cellular network), the Internet (e.g., using VoIP), the PSTN, etc. Additionally or alternatively, voice calls may be placed via the Internet using WebRTC. For instance, voice call module  may receive a set of dialed digits (e.g., from I\/O module  and\/or from VI application ) that correspond to a telephone number, and may place a call based on the dialed digits.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","510","610","700"]},"For example, a particular example telephone number \u201c800-555-5555\u201d may be associated with a visual interface located at the URL \u201chttp:\/\/www.foo.com\/VI.html.\u201d VI server  may use this information to provide the visual interface to user device . For example, VI server  may receive an indication that the telephone number \u201c800-555-5555\u201d was dialed by a user of user device . As mentioned above, VI application  may have intercepted the call, and requested visual interface information from VI server .

Memory  may include any type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution by processor , and\/or any type of non-volatile storage device that may store information for use by processor .","Input component  may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information to device , such as a keyboard, a keypad, a microphone, a camera, a gesture sensor, a button, a switch, etc. Output component  may include a mechanism that outputs information to the operator, such as a display, a speaker, haptics, one or more light emitting diodes (\u201cLEDs\u201d), etc.","Communication interface  may include any transceiver-like mechanism that enables device  to communicate with other devices and\/or systems. For example, communication interface  may include an Ethernet interface, an optical interface, a coaxial interface, or the like. Communication interface  may include a wireless communication device, such as an infrared (\u201cIR\u201d) receiver, a Bluetooth\u00ae radio, a near-field communications (\u201cNFC\u201d) radio, or the like. The wireless communication device may be coupled to an external device, such as a remote control, a wireless keyboard, a mobile telephone, etc. Communication interface  may utilize a microphone and speaker for audio-based communications and\/or display and camera for visual communications. In some embodiments, device  may include more than one communication interface . For instance, device  may include an optical interface and an Ethernet interface.","Device  may perform certain operations relating to one or more processes described above. Device  may perform these operations in response to processor  executing software instructions stored in a computer-readable medium, such as memory . A computer-readable medium may be defined as a non-transitory memory device. A memory device may include space within a single physical memory device or spread across multiple physical memory devices. The software instructions may be read into memory  from another computer-readable medium or from another device. The software instructions stored in memory  may cause processor  to perform processes described herein. Alternatively, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes described herein. Thus, implementations described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The foregoing description of implementations provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the possible implementations to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above disclosure or may be acquired from practice of the implementations. For example, while series of blocks have been described with regard to , the order of the blocks may be modified in other implementations. Further, non-dependent blocks may be performed in parallel.","Additionally, while example data structures are illustrated in  as including certain types of information, in practice, these data structures may store additional, fewer, different, or differently arranged types of information than shown in these figures. Furthermore, while these data structures are shown as tables, in practice, these data structures may take the form of any other type of data structure, such as an array, a linked list, a hash table, a tree, and\/or any other type of data structure.","Furthermore, while some examples are described separately, concepts from some example implementations can be combined with concepts from other example implementations, even if not explicitly described herein. For instance, while  is described in the context of a call being placed to a call center and a visual interface request being provided by the call center, in some implementations, similar concepts as those described in  may apply. For example, a user device may include a CVI application (which may be similar, in some aspects, to the above-described VI application), which may intercept the call to the call center. For instance, the CVI application may notify the CVI server that a call has been attempted to be placed to the call center, and the CVI server may generate a customized visual interface based on the notification, and may provide the customized visual interface to the user device (e.g., by sending a message, such as an application-directed SMS message, to the CVI application). The user device may then present the customized visual interface via the CVI application.","To the extent the aforementioned embodiments collect, store or employ personal information provided by individuals, it should be understood that such information shall be used in accordance with all applicable laws concerning protection of personal information. Additionally, the collection, storage and use of such information may be subject to consent of the individual to such activity, for example, through well known \u201copt-in\u201d or \u201copt-out\u201d processes as may be appropriate for the situation and type of information. Storage and use of personal information may be in an appropriately secure manner reflective of the type of information, for example, through various encryption and anonymization techniques for particularly sensitive information.","The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement an embodiment is not limiting of the embodiment. Thus, the operation and behavior of the embodiment has been described without reference to the specific software code, it being understood that software and control hardware may be designed based on the description herein.","Even though particular combinations of features are recited in the claims and\/or disclosed in the specification, these combinations are not intended to limit the disclosure of the possible implementations. In fact, many of these features may be combined in ways not specifically recited in the claims and\/or disclosed in the specification. Although each dependent claim listed below may directly depend on only one other claim, the disclosure of the possible implementations includes each dependent claim in combination with every other claim in the claim set.","No element, act, or instruction used in the present application should be construed as critical or essential unless explicitly described as such. Also, as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d is intended to include one or more items, and may be used interchangeably with the phrase \u201cone or more.\u201d Where only one item is intended, the term \u201cone\u201d or similar language is used.
