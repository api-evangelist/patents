title: Web access to secure data
abstract: Controlling access to secure data and services by versatile computers outside a secure environment, which communicates with limited dedicated devices such as game consoles, over a secure network such as a virtual private network. The versatile computing devices obtain access over an insecure network, such as the Internet, through a trusted partner Web site that authenticates users of the site and relays requests to the secure environment. The Web site uses a certificate for a predefined level of secure access to the secure environment. A link is established between a user's Web ID authenticated by the Web site and a gamer tag used within the secure environment. Access is limited as a function of the Web ID, gamer tag, and a Web site partner ID. A Web cache stores and provides some secure data, minimizing disruption to the secure environment's primary function to service the dedicated devices.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to controlling access to data and services of a secure computing environment; and more specifically, pertains to controlling access by versatile and convenient computing devices through a trusted partner Web site to a secure computing environment that primarily provides services over a secure network to dedicated devices having access only to the secure computing environment.","The popularity of multiplayer online games on the Internet has exploded in recent years. Unlike conventional single player electronic games, multiplayer online games enable a player to participate in games with other players, either as an individual or as a team member. The multiplayer aspect of these games adds to the players' gaming experience by offering new gaming considerations, including strategy, teamwork, and rivalries.","In order to enable playing of a multiplayer online game, host services must be provided by either an individual or a third-party host. Host services are typically executed on a host computer or server that determines who the game participants are, and whether new players may be added to each game session.","Examples of multiplayer online games that are hosted by third-party providers can be found at many gaming Web sites, including Microsoft Corporation's Internet Game Zone, which provides a myriad of single player and multiplayer online games that are played by over a half-million users daily. In order to play most of the games on such a gaming site, it is necessary for users to download (or separately procure) a copy of the game the user wishes to play. Some of these games may typically be downloaded for free, while others must be purchased, either online, or at a retail outlet. In addition, many gaming sites offer \u201cpremium\u201d games that can only be accessed if the user has paid a membership fee to play the games, or has agreed to pay a usage fee (e.g., an hourly, daily, or monthly fee).","In contrast to Internet gaming Web sites that are broadly accessible over the Internet using a conventional browser executing on a conventional computer, a more secure and limited access gaming environment is provided by a gaming service such as Microsoft Corporation's XBOX LIVE\u2122, which is dedicated specifically to enabling players to connect only with dedicated XBOX\u2122 game consoles using a broadband Internet connection, so that users of the XBOX game console can participate in multiplayer games within the XBOX LIVE gaming environment. Only those who have paid an annual fee and have registered their game console with the XBOX LIVE gaming service when signing up for the online gaming service are able to participate in such games. Although the connection between the participants' XBOX game consoles and the gaming service is over the Internet, this communication uses virtual private network (VPN) tunnels to ensure security and employs the user datagram protocol (UDP) instead of the more common transmission control protocol\/internet protocol (TCP\/IP) for the communication of data packets.","These measures provide secure communication with the gaming service by the dedicated game consoles, however, this security inherently prevents communication with the gaming service through computing devices that are more versatile and convenient to use for some functions, such as entering text. Dedicated game consoles are designed for use with game controllers that are optimized for playing games, and are not designed for use in entering text, and carrying out other functions more easily done with a computer keyboard. Also, game consoles are often not readily available in offices, libraries, and other places where access to a personal computer (PC) is commonly provided. Further, requiring secure communication through a VPN tunnel is less convenient than enabling general communication over a conventional network such as over the Internet via the World Wide Web (WWW). However, for many reasons, it is desirable to access data within the gaming service through a conventional network with a versatile computer such as a PC, to check the status of games, verify billing records, enter messages to other users, control game use by a minor child, and carry out a variety of other functions.","Of course, it is possible to modify the gaming service to allow access through insecure communication networks, e.g. using a browser program running on a PC. However, permitting less secure access would inherently subject the gaming service to attacks, excessive traffic, and additional costs associated with maintaining an open, publicly accessible gaming service. These dangers would likely degrade the service provided to game participants and require increased fees to the participants. Another alternative is to modify the game consoles to enable use of a keyboard, rendering of Web pages, and other increased functionality, so that the game console has much the same ability to access Web sites on the Internet as general purpose computing devices. However, such changes would likely increase costs of the game consoles to game participants, reduce the security of the gaming system and gaming environment, and reduce the market competitiveness of such modified game consoles.","Instead, it is desirable to minimize costs by maintaining the more dedicated functionality of the game consoles (or other devices that are dedicated to a primary function, such as playing games). It is also desirable to maintain high speed communication and the least amount of traffic with the gaming service (or other secure service), and to ensure the security of the system by continuing to require VPN communication between the dedicated game consoles and the secure gaming service. Thus, an ideal solution to this problem will permit controlled access to the secure gaming service with a conventional and convenient computing device, without jeopardizing the security of the gaming service.","The present invention provides a method and system for controlling access to secure data and secure data services within a secure data service environment from outside the secure data service environment. The secure data service environment communicates with dedicated devices, such as game consoles, over a secure network, such as through a VPN tunnel. The secure data service environment strictly controls access and is not open to general access by users of more versatile computing devices, such as general purpose PCs. Instead, the present invention enables controlled access by more versatile computing devices through an insecure network connection. As used herein, the term \u201cinsecure network\u201d refers to communication over a network such as the Internet using conventional TCP\/IP or the like, and without using techniques such as VPN tunnels (other than secure socket layer (SSL) certificates and authentication), to prevent the communication from being intercepted by a third party. Controlled access is provided through one or more trusted partner Web sites that authenticate users of the versatile computing devices and relay requests to the secure data service environment.","The present invention establishes a link between a user's account identifier that is associated with the trusted partner Web site, referred to as a user-partner identifier, and the user's account identifier, which is associated with the secure data service environment and is referred to as a user-service identifier. The user-partner identifier is used by the partner Web site to authenticate the user who is communicating with the Web site over the insecure network from a versatile computing device, e.g., a general purpose PC. The user-service identifier is used to identify the user who has registered with the secure data service environment that provides secure data and services and maintains the secure communication network to access the dedicated devices. Preferably, the user-service identifier comprises an internal private portion known only to the secure data service environment, and a corresponding public portion, such as a name tag, by which the user is known to other users of the secure data service environment. The user provides private information, such as a credit card number, to the secure data service environment when establishing the user-service identifier. The user provides the same private information to the partner Web site. The partner Web site communicates the private information to the secure data service environment when a link is to be established between the user-partner identifier and the user-service identifier.","The secure data service environment determines whether a request for access to the secure data service environment is authentic when the request is received from the partner Web site on behalf of the user of the versatile computing device. The request is assumed to be authentic if received from a partner Web site that also provides a valid digital certificate and\/or other data defining data access limitations. If the request is authentic, the secure data service environment provides the requested access to the secure data and services over the insecure network to the partner Web site, and thus to the versatile computing device. The request includes the user-partner identifier, which is linked to the user-service identifier. Thus, the access is limited by permission settings for the user-service identifier. The request also identifies the partner Web site with a partner identifier, which is preferably encrypted in the digital certificate obtained prior to allowing communication between the partner Web site and the secure data service environment. When the partner applies for the digital certificate, the partner identifier is associated with a level of access authority that applies to any requests from the partner Web site.","The secure data service environment preferably uses a public Web security gateway to perform public\/private key authentication of a request from a partner Web site. Authenticated requests are then decrypted and communicated over a dedicated, but insecure communication channel to a Web cache. The Web cache determines other access limitations as a function of the partner identifier, the user-partner identifier, and the user-service identifier. The Web cache also stores in memory a large amount of frequently accessed secure data and recently accessed secure data, which can be quickly returned to the requesting partner Web site for use by the user of the versatile computing device. If the requested secure data is not available in the memory of the Web cache, the requested secure data or secure service is accessed from a core portion of the secure data service environment whose primary function is to provide secure data services to the dedicated devices through the secure communication network. In any case, any data returned to the requesting partner Web site is preferably formatted according to standard specifications of a markup language for data transfer (e.g., SOAP). Preferably the partner Web site will transform this data (e.g., into HTML) for display in a Web page rendered by a browser executing on the user's versatile computing device.","Examples of secure data and services include a leaderboard of game player rankings, statistics regarding games or other services provided by the secure data service environment, a friends list for communicating with other users associated with the user of the versatile computing device, account status and settings, a tournaments service for creating and managing game tournaments, a team management service for managing a group of users, a user control service such as a parental control service for selectively controlling a child's access to secure data and services, a download service for selectively obtaining secure data and services from the secure data service environment, and a variety of other data and functions related to the secure data service environment.","Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method and system for securely communicating unencrypted messages that were originally received in encrypted form from a partner network service over an insecure communication channel. An initially encrypted message associated with a certificate is decrypted the partner identifier and communication port identifier of the partner network service are determined. These data are added to a header of the message to form a modified message. The modified message is communicated over the insecure communication channel without encryption. Without the encryption, the messages can be communicated more quickly. A further aspect of the invention is directed to a memory medium on which are stored machine instructions for carrying out the steps of the method described above.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention is now described with regard to an exemplary application in providing access to secure data and services of a secure online electronic gaming environment that is accessible using dedicated game consoles, through secure communications between the dedicated game consoles (such as Microsoft Corporation's XBOX\u2122 game consoles) and the online electronic gaming environment (such as Microsoft Corporation's XBOX LIVE\u2122). Because these dedicated game consoles have limitations on data entry, data display, printing, and other functional aspects, access to the secure data and services is provided to more versatile computing devices only through partner Web sites that communicate over an insecure network as authorized intermediaries between the secure online electronic gaming environment and the versatile computing devices.","Exemplary Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing steps of the present invention with regard to a secure server, a public Web server, or a client computing device includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a conventional PC . PC  is provided with a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus . The system bus couples various system components, including the system memory, to processing unit  and may be any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read-only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output (BIOS) system , containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the PC , such as during start up, is stored in ROM .","The PC  further includes a hard disk drive  for reading from and writing to a hard disk (not shown), a magnetic disk drive  for reading from or writing to a removable magnetic disk , and an optical disc drive  for reading from or writing to a removable optical disc , such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. Hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disc drive  are connected to system bus  by a hard disk drive interface , a magnetic disk drive interface , and an optical disc drive interface , respectively. The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer-readable machine instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for PC . Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk , and a removable optical disc , it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer-readable media, which can store data that are accessible by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video discs, Bernoulli cartridges, random access memories (RAMs), ROMs, and the like, may also be used in the exemplary operating environment. A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk, magnetic disk , optical disc , ROM  or RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data .","A user may enter commands and information into PC  through input devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, digital camera, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to processing unit  through an input\/output (I\/O) device interface  that is coupled to the system bus. Output devices, such as a printer (not shown), may also be connected to processing unit  through I\/O device interface  that is coupled to the system bus. The term IPO device interface is intended to encompass each interface specifically used for a serial port, a parallel port, a game port, a keyboard port, a PS\/2 port, a USB port and\/or other communication port. Similarly, a monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to system bus  via an appropriate interface, such as a video adapter , and is usable to display graphical user interfaces, Web pages, and\/or other information. In addition to the monitor, PCs are often coupled to other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers (through a sound card or other audio interface\u2014not shown).","PC  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote sources, such as a remote computer . Remote computer  may be another PC, a server (which is typically generally configured much like PC ), a router, a network PC, a peer device, a satellite, or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above in connection with PC , although only an external memory storage device  has been illustrated in . In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to PC , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote external memory storage device. The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , such as the Internet. Such networking environments are common in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, PC  is connected to LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, PC  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over WAN , which is an insecure public network. Modem , which may be internal or external, is typically coupled directly to the system bus via an internal slot, coupled to the bus via I\/O device interface , or coupled to the bus via network interface . For example, modem  may be a broadband modem, such as an asynchronous digital subscriber line (ADSL) modem, that is coupled to the system bus via a USB interface. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used, such as wireless communication and wide band network links.","Exemplary Dedicated Gaming Device","As shown in , an exemplary dedicated electronic gaming system  that is suitable for secure interaction with the secure online electronic gaming environment includes a game console  and support for up to four user input devices, such as controllers and Game console  is equipped with an internal hard disk drive (not shown in this Figure) and a portable media drive  that supports various forms of portable optical storage media, as represented by an optical storage disc . Examples of suitable portable storage media include DVD discs and CD-ROM discs. In this gaming system, game programs are preferably distributed for use with the game console on DVD discs, but it is also contemplated that other storage media might instead be used on this or other types of systems that employ the present invention. Game programs can also be downloaded to dedicated electronic gaming system  through secure communication with the secure online electronic gaming environment.","On a front face of game console  are four slots  for connection to supported controllers, although the number and arrangement of slots may be modified. A power button , and an eject button  are also positioned on the front face of game console . Power button  controls application of electrical power to the game console, and eject button  alternately opens and closes a tray (not shown) of portable media drive  to enable insertion and extraction of storage disc , so that the digital data on it can be read for use by the game console.","Game console  connects to a television or other display monitor or screen (not shown) via audio\/visual (A\/V) interface cables . Such displays typically have limited capabilities for displaying text. A power cable plug  conveys electrical power to the game console when connected to a conventional alternating current line source (not shown). Game console  includes an Ethernet data connector  to transfer and receive data over a network (e.g., through a connection to a hub or a switch\u2014not shown), or over the Internet, for example, through a connection to an xDSL interface, a cable modem, or other broadband interface (not shown). However, interfacing with the secure electronic gaming environment is generally performed through secure communications. Other types of game consoles that implement the present invention may be coupled together or to a remote server, by communicating using a conventional telephone modem.","Each controller and is coupled to game console  via a lead (or alternatively through a wireless interface). In the illustrated implementation, the controllers are universal serial bus (USB) compatible and are connected to game console  via USB cables . Game console  may be equipped with any of a wide variety of user devices for interacting with and controlling the game software. As illustrated in , each controller and is equipped with two thumbsticks and , a D-pad , buttons , and two triggers . These controllers are merely representative, and other gaming input and control devices may be substituted for or added to those shown in  for use with game console . However, each controller and has limited capability for entering and manipulating text, navigating menus, and other functions not primarily associated with interacting with games.","A removable function unit  can optionally be inserted into controller  to provide additional features and functions. For example, a portable memory unit ( enables users to store game parameters and port them for play on other game consoles, by inserting the portable MU into a controller connected to the other game console. Another removable functional unit comprises a voice communication unit that enables a user to verbally communicate with other users locally and\/or over a network. Connected to the voice communication unit is a headset , which includes a boom microphone . In the described implementation, each controller is configured to accommodate two removable function units, although more or fewer than two removable function units or modules may instead be employed.","Gaming system  is capable of playing, for example, games, music, and videos. It is contemplated that other functions can be implemented using digital data stored on the hard disk drive or read from optical storage disc  in drive , or using digital data obtained from an online source, or from functional unit . For example, gaming system  is potentially capable of playing:\n\n","It is contemplated that other functions can be implemented by gaming system  using digital data stored on the hard disk drive or read from optical storage disc  in drive , or from an online source, or from a function unit or module.","Although gaming system  is capable of the above and various other functions, it must be emphasized that, as supplied, gaming system  is still a device dedicated to a limited set of functions, primarily those related to playing games, listening to music, and viewing video and other graphic images. As supplied, gaming system  is incapable of printing, browsing the Internet, or connecting to Web addresses that display Web pages defined by any form of HTML. Instead, it can only connect to a dedicated gaming service that has been setup to communicate with the game console over the Internet and to facilitate multiplayer games by subscribers to the service who connect through game consoles that are registered with the gaming service. Each connection over the Internet is through a VPN tunnel, so that the communications between the game console and the gaming service are secure. The game console is not currently provided with a conventional keyboard, so that entry of text messages or other text input is possible only by selecting one alphanumeric character at a time from a display using one of the controllers. The game consoles do not have direct communication with parties outside of the secure online gaming environment (other than by a direct connection to another game console) for playing multiplayer games. Further, data controlled by the secure online gaming environment is not directly accessible to anyone who has not connected with the gaming environment using a game console. The present invention addresses this issue by providing access to secure data and services of the secure gaming environment through trusted partners for users of versatile computing devices who are not connected to the secure gaming environment through a game console.","Network System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","100","100","310","302","310","302","52","302","302","302"],"i":["a, ","n "]},"Network gaming environment  also employs a key distribution center  that plays a role in authenticating individual players and\/or gaming systems . . . for interconnection to one another, as well as to secure gaming environment . Distribution center  distributes keys and service tickets to valid participants, which may then be used to form game playing groups that include multiple players, or to purchase services from secure gaming environment . Network gaming environment  further includes a developer service  with which developers can produce media effects, updated media data, game code, and other services. Such services can be distributed between secure gaming environment  and the producers of games for the gaming systems, and between other devices within, and outside of Network gaming environment .","Dedicated gaming systems , . . . communicate with secure gaming environment  through a VPN security gateway , which is preferably a server that is generally configured much like PC  of . VPN security gateway  of  authenticates, encrypts, decrypts, and otherwise controls communications between gaming systems , . . . and services of secure gaming environment , which are preferably in communication with VPN security gateway  via an intranet . Secure gaming environment  provides various services for users of gaming systems , . . . such as serving and\/or hosting online games, serving downloadable music or video files, hosting gaming competitions, serving streaming audio\/visual files, enabling exchange of email or other media communications, and the like. Secure gaming environment  also provides another memory source available to individual gaming systems , . . . i.e., online storage. In addition to accessing data on optical storage disc , hard disk drive , and in MU(s), gaming system can also access data files available at remote storage locations via VPN network , as exemplified by remote storage  at online service .","Users of dedicated gaming systems , . . . can also access and\/or enter billing data , profile data  about themselves and lists of friends, game and user statistics , presence information  that indicates the status and communication accessibility of other users within secure gaming environment , information on game tournaments , and can access other services. However, accessing and entering such information through dedicated gaming systems , . . . is often cumbersome, because the corresponding user interfaces comprising the controllers supplied with the gaming systems are less capable than those of more versatile general computing devices, such as PC . For instance, as discussed above, it is more difficult to enter text through controller  than through a keyboard.","To improve data access and entry to secure environment , a public Web security gateway  is provided to enable more versatile computing devices, such as PCs, to communicate through insecure pubic WAN  to one or more authorized Web partners. Public Web security gateway  is a server configured much like PC , but includes one network interface to public WAN  and another network interface to a Web cache . Public Web security gateway authenticates requests for access to, or entry of secure data to databases within secure gaming environment . After authenticating a certificate from an authorized Web partner, public Web security gateway  relays a request to Web cache . Web cache  is in communication with intranet  and determines data access limitations based on the identity of the authorized Web partner and on the identity of the user making the request through the authorized Web partner. Web cache  also stores in memory a large amount of commonly requested secure data and recently requested secure data, thereby minimizing the load and data access delays imposed on secure gaming environment , and to enable it to carry out its primary purpose of providing services to dedicated gaming systems , . . . To further enhance security, public Web security gateway  and Web cache  are preferably located in different physical locations than other devices of secure gaming environment . However, Web cache  communicates with the other devices of secure gaming environment  via dedicated secure communication lines.","Authorized Web partners obtain a digital certificate from secure gaming environment  or other trusted certificate authority sources, such as VERISIGN\u2122, to enable bidirectional certificate authorization between Web partner Web sites and secure gaming environment . Users who are registered with an authorized Web partner can access and enter secure data within secure gaming environment  through the authorized Web partner's Web site with versatile computing devices such as PCs -a PDA , a cell phone , or other computing device that a user finds more convenient to use than a dedicated gaming device. Web sites of authorized Web partners can be assigned varying levels of authorization for corresponding levels of access to the secure data. For example, a highly trusted Web site  such as Microsoft Corporation's www.xbox.com, Web site, has a high level authorization, to enable registered users of that Web site to access secure data of Microsoft Corporation's XBOX LIVE\u2122 secure gaming environment. An intermediate level authorization is provided to Web sites that are less closely related. For example, a moderately trusted Web site  such as a game publisher Web site, can be authorized to enable registered users of its Web site to access only that secure data of Microsoft Corporation's XBOX LIVE\u2122 secure gaming environment that is related to games produced\/published by the game publisher. Least authorized partner Web sites can be limited to accessing or modifying data that are considered public by the secure gaming environment. For example, registered users of a fairly trusted Web site  such as a fan club Web site, can be limited to accessing only leaderboard data. Further details regarding secure data access, entry, and other such functions are described below.","Exemplary Logic Processes","The following describes exemplary logic processes performed primarily by the Web cache and the public Web security gateway in communication with a Web partner Web site.  is a flow diagram illustrating logic of an exemplary overall process of a preferred embodiment for controlling access to secure data and services within the secure gaming environment. A set of one time processes  is performed to authenticate a Web partner and link a user's name tag used within the secure gaming environment to the user's identifier while connected to the Web partner's Web site. More specifically, at a step , a Web partner obtains a digital certificate from the operators of the secure environment or from a trusted third party. Preferably, the digital certificate comprises a public\/private key certificate. This certificate will be used to authenticate requests originated from the Web partner's Web site.","At a step , a user, such as a game console player, establishes a secure account with the secure environment and supplies private information that is specific to the user. For example, the user can provide the secure environment with a credit card number, a bank number, or other billing information known privately by the user. In establishing the account, the user also selects a name tag, such as a gamer tag, that will identify the user to other users in the secure environment. Preferably, the user provides the private information and selects the name tag with the dedicated device in communication over the VPN to the secure environment. As indicated above, the dedicated device has limited capabilities, and the secure environment expects the user to use the dedicated device for interacting with primary services within the secure environment. Thus, for initial account setup, use of the secure network and dedicated device can provide a higher level of trust in the information provided and verify that the user has access to at least one dedicated device for primary interaction with the secure environment. For added security, the dedicated device can be serialized so that it is uniquely identifiable and can be verified as having an expected configuration for use in connecting securely with the secure environment.","After entering the private information and selecting a name tag, the secure environment establishes an account internal ID, at a step , which is associated with the selected name tag. The internal ID is preferably not known to the user, but rather is used as an internal identifier by the secure environment to correlate other information related to the user's selected name tag. Additional internal IDs can also be associated with the user's selected name tag and with a password selected by the user. For example, if a minor child establishes an account with the secure environment, a internal ID will be associated with the child's selected name tag. In addition, another internal ID will be established for a corresponding parent of the child. The child's internal ID can have a bit set to indicate that the child has limited access to secure data and services, while the parent's internal ID can be used to indicate full access to the secure data and services. However, both internal IDs are associated with the same name tag, so that the parent can control aspects of the child's use of the secure environment. Conversely, multiple name tags can be associated with a single internal ID (or multiple internal IDs). A internal ID can comprise an encoded form of the selected name tag, a sequential number, or any other unique and secure identifier such as Microsoft Corporation's XBOX\u2122 universal ID (XUID).","Having established a secure account with the secure environment, the user also establishes a user Web ID by registering with a Web partner's Web site, at a step . In this case, the user accesses the Web partner's Web site with a versatile computing device via the public WAN, such as the Internet. The user Web ID associates the user with the Web partner's Web site, which is authorized with a certificate to communicate with the secure environment. This user Web ID is distinct from the internal ID that was established when the user obtained a secure account with the secure environment. The user Web ID is maintained by the Web partner's Web site and used to authenticate the user when the user communicates with the Web partner's Web site. The user's Web ID can also be associated with a particular authentication system that may be used by more than one Web partner Web site. For example, if a Web partner's Web site uses a well-known authentication system, such as Microsoft Corporation's PASSPORT\u2122 authentication system, the same user Web ID can be used to access the secure environment through each Web partner Web site that relies upon the same user authentication system. The user authentication system is identified as a credential type. The credential type is associated with the user's Web ID in any communication between a Web partner Web site and the secure environment. Thus, the same user Web ID, such as a single PASSPORT\u2122 unique ID (PUID), can be used with multiple Web partner Web sites that rely upon the same user authentication system. Web partner Web sites that use a different user authentication system will be identified by a different credential type.","At a step , the user initiates a linking process through an authorized Web partner's Web site to link the user's Web ID(s) to the user's name tag(s) and corresponding internal ID(s). This linking process is performed for each user Web ID that has a unique credential type. Thus, the linking process need not occur for each Web partner Web site if the Web partner Web sites use the same user authentication system (i.e., have the same credential type). The linking process is performed by the Web cache, so that the secure environment can correlate external user Web IDs with internal name tags and internal IDs. Further details regarding this linking process are described below with regard to .","Having established a link between an external user Web ID and an internal name tag and internal ID, the user can access and enter data to the secure environment with a versatile computing device through a Web partner Web site over the public WAN. At a step , the user requests a service related to secure data via the Web partner's Web site. Communication between the user's versatile computing device and the Web partner's Web site can be a secure or an insecure communication, but the user must have been authenticated by the Web partner's Web site. The Web partner's Web site preferably sends the user's request to the public Web security gateway as an encrypted simple object access protocol (SOAP) message. SSL communication is used to send the encrypted SOAP request to the public Web's security gateway along with the Web partner's certificate, the user Web ID, and any other data provided with the request. At a step the public Web security gateway authenticates the Web partner's certificate, decrypts the request, and relays the unencrypted request to the Web cache. Further details regarding step are described below with regard to .","At a step the Web cache determines data accessibility limits based on the sending Web partner and the user Web ID. At a step , the Web cache either returns a denial message or processes the request based on the accessibility limits. For example, as suggested above, the Web cache may return public leaderboard information to a Web user that is not registered with the secure environment as long as the Web user submitted a request for the public information from at least a minimally authorized Web partner's Web site. Conversely, the Web cache can return detailed billing information if the Web user is a registered user of the secure environment and submitted the request from at least a minimally authorized Web partner. Return communication goes through the public Web security gateway according to bidirectional certificate authorization with the Web partner Web site. Further details regarding determining data accessibility limits and processing requests are described below with regard to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["420","422"]},"At a step the public Web security gateway performs authentication and decryption steps before relaying the linking request to the Web cache. More specifically, at a step , the public Web security gateway authenticates the Web partner based on the certificate. If the request was submitted by an unauthorized Web partner, the public Web security gateway denies a connection to the public Web security gateway. However, if the linking request was submitted from an authorized Web partner Web site, the public Web security gateway decrypts the link request at a step . Further details regarding the decrypting step are described below with regard to . At a step , the public Web security gateway relays the decrypted request along with the credential type, user Web ID, name tag, owner flag, and private information to the Web cache. The above three steps are generally performed on any request that is submitted, including the linking request.","At a step the Web cache determines data accessibility limits based on the user Web ID and Web partner. At a decision step , the Web cache determines whether the submitted private information corresponds to a valid name tag previously registered in the secure environment. If the private information does not correspond to a valid name tag, the Web cache returns an error message, at a step . If a match is found with a valid name tag in the secure environment, the Web cache associates the user Web ID with the internal ID corresponding to the valid name tag, at a step . At a step , the Web cache sets access limitations based on the owner flag and\/or other attributes associated with the name tag, such as whether the name tag is currently sanctioned in some way. Access limitations based on the Web partner are set separately when the Web partner obtains a certificate. At a step , the Web cache returns a message indicating a successful link.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["440","442","444"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["450","452","454","456","454","458","459"]},"For more privately held data, the Web cache determines, at a decision step , whether the user Web ID is linked to a valid internal ID (and\/or a corresponding name tag). If the Web ID is not valid or the internal ID is not valid, indicating that a link was not previously defined, the Web cache returns a \u201cuser denied\u201d message at a step . The Web cache can optionally also invite the user to join the secure environment or recommend other courses of action, at a step . However, if a valid user Web ID is linked to a valid internal ID, the Web cache notifies the secure environment of the user Web ID's presence, at a step . This notification enables the secure environment to determine associated internal IDs of users who may be listed as friends or have other relationships to the user corresponding to the user Web ID. For example, the friends can be notified of the user's current communication with the secure environment via an instant message, audio indicator, visual indicator, or other indicator. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other automated processes can be performed by the secure environment when the user's presence is detected.","At a decision step , the Web cache determines whether the submitted request is allowed for the corresponding user Web ID. If the user Web ID is prohibited from making the submitted request, the Web cache issues a \u201crequest denied\u201d message at a step . For example, parental controls, current penalties associated with the internal ID, or other limitations may be in force, prohibiting the secure environment from satisfying the request for the user. However, if the request is allowed for the user Web ID, the Web cache initiates the corresponding process to perform the requested service or access the requested data, at a step . For example, the Web cache may launch an API that shows waiting messages, an API that shows billing information, an API that enables the user to set up a game tournament, an API that enables the user to download replays or upgraded game modules, an API that accesses the user's friends list, an API that enables the user to manage a team, or APIs that enable the user to obtain a variety of other services. Many of these APIs involve transforming and\/or formatting secure data for display in a Web page rendered by a browser executing on a versatile computing device. Some examples of theses services are described below. Once the requested service is initiated, or one of the denied messages is issued, control returns to the controlling module to await another request, or simply ends.","Exemplary Services",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 8A","b":["500","500","502","504","502","506"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 8B","b":["510","510","512","514","516","510","517","510","518"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 9A","FIG. 9A"],"b":["520","522","524","520","526"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 9B","b":["530","530","532","534","530","536","530"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 10A","b":["540","540","542","544"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 10B","b":["550","552","554"]},"Although the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred form of practicing it and modifications thereto, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that many other modifications can be made to the present invention within the scope of the claims that follow.
