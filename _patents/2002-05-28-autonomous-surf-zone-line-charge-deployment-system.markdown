{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to clearing mines and other obstacles from an area. More particularly, this invention is to an autonomous system deploying at least one line charge to clear an approach lane.","Access to regions held by hostile forces could require an amphibious assault through an approach lane that extends from the sea and across a beach. Prior to the amphibious assault, mines and obstacles should be cleared from the approach lane so that landing craft can safely make the assault. A more challenging part of this task is the clearance of the surf zone portion of the lane (from 10 to 0 feet of water depth) because of highly dynamic and unforgiving wave action, currents, etc.","Divers in demolition\/assault teams have performed this task but they must bring in a substantial amount of explosive charges. By itself carrying in this load is formidable, however, the significant hazards in the dynamic surf zone additionally must be dealt with. During deployment, the demolition teams and the explosive charges often are in exposed positions. This could attract unwanted attention and draw concentrated defensive fires from entrenched, determined defenders. The extreme peril created during manned clearing operations usually means that casualties may have to be sustained among the members of these highly trained teams, and even at this cost, the success of such missions may still be in doubt.","Rocket deployed line charges have been used with some success. But, they usually are launched from exposed positions adjacent to a target area, and neutralization of all mines and obstacles in an area is not assured since the rocket deployed line charges do not always accurately and uniformly cover a designated area satisfactorily.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for an autonomous method and means for clearing mines and other obstacles from an approach lane that reduces the hazards to personnel yet assures successful completion of the mission.","An object of the invention is to provide an autonomous system to deploy at least one explosive line charge to neutralize mines and obstacles in an approach lane.","Another object of the invention is to provide an autonomous system to deploy at least one explosive line charge to neutralize mines and obstacles in an approach lane extending through the surf zone and partially onto the beach.","Another object of the invention is to provide an autonomous system to neutralize mines and obstacles in an approach lane that reduces the exposure of personnel to danger.","Another object of the invention is to provide an autonomous system to neutralize mines and obstacles in an approach lane to reduce the exposure of personnel to danger and using at least one line charge that can be partially deployed, further deployed, and detonated in a spacedapart sequence.","Another object of the invention is to provide an autonomous system to neutralize mines and obstacles in an approach lane having a buoyancy means on line charges to aid deployment through the surf zone and partially onto the beach.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is to an autonomous system and method for deployment of a line charge extending through a surf zone and\/or partially across a beach to clear mines and obstacles from an approach lane. A ship is distantly located from an approach lane spanning a surf zone and a beach portion, and the ship has software of an operator control station in an onboard computer. At least one system delivery vehicle having a storage bay and propulsion means transits from the ship to the approach lane in response to first instructions from the operator control station. A line charge is disposed in each bay and has one end coupled to the system delivery vehicle. A line charge delivery vehicle in each bay is connected to another end of the line charge to pull the line charge from the bay and emplace it in a straight path in the approach lane in response to second instructions from the operator control system. Explosives in all line charges are detonated to clear the approach lane.","Referring to , an autonomous line charge deployment system  of the invention has the capability to be deployed from over-the-horizon to where an amphibious assault can be made. The goal of most amphibious assaults is to gain a beachhead on a landmass and go through what is called an approach lane . Approach lane  can include a surf zone  under water  (from ten to zero feet of water depth), shoreline , and beach portion  of sand, sediment, dirt, etc. Conducting a successful amphibious assault usually requires clearance of obstacles  and mines  from both surf zone  and beach portion  of approach lane  to allow safe passage of personnel, materials, and vehicles.","Autonomous deployment system  has an over-the-horizon support ship , at least one system delivery vehicle (SYSDV) , at least one line charge , and at least one line charge delivery vehicle (LCDV) . Autonomous deployment system  of the invention allows selective, controlled clearing of an area, or approach lane  with at least one line charge . Only one SYSDV , line charge , and LCDV  are shown in , it being understood that many of these combinations, to be described, may be needed to clear a wider approach lane . Autonomous deployment system  reduces casualties during placement and detonation of line charge  by keeping personnel out of a possibly hotly contested beach region and instead, using their talents at a safer remote location on ship , possibly over-the-horizon to plan and execute clearing operations.","Support ship  is the staging area of system  and has a software control package, or operator control station (OCS)  running on laptop computer . OCS  is used to plan and execute line deployment missions and allows an operator at a distant command station or at ship  to analyze the information of latitudes\/longitudes representing the area to be cleared and monitor system status and progress. In accordance with software package of OCS  laptop computer  can display maps of the area indicating the lane to be cleared in order to confirm the information provided by the operator. Software of OCS  on laptop  tells the operator the number of SYSDV s and LCDV s pulling line charges  that must be deployed in order to clear the area of approach lane .","Next, the software of OCS  will initialize each SYSDV  and LCDV  and provide first instructions , or software on a first single board computer  in each SYSDV  and second instructions , or software on a second single board computer  in each LCDV . First instructions  in first computer  in each SYSDV  effect responsive operation of that SYSDV . For example, first instructions  from OCS  can control where each SYSDV  should deploy its associated LCDV . Second instructions  in second computer  in each LCDV  effect operation of that LCDV  in response to second instructions . For example, second instructions  can control the elongate path each LCDV  should traverse to emplace its interconnected line charge  along that path ","From laptop computer  in ship  first and second instructions ,  in first and second computers ,  make each SYSDV  and its associated LCDV  autonomous by providing destination\/path and obstacle avoidance instructions. First and second instructions ,  can also tell each SYSDV  where the deployment destination of line charge  by each LCDV  is and where each LCDV 's path through approach lane  is. Accordingly, after each SYSDV  is launched, it automatically proceeds to the designated area for deployment of its payload, (LCDV  and its line charge ), and completion of the mission.","At least one SYSDV  and LCDV  can have a remote control capability responsive to, for example, electromagnetic control signals and\/or acoustic control signals b transmitted from ship , or another remote station to allow remote control of SYSDV  and LCDV . Additional communications capabilities can be included in communication\/control modules  and modules of navigational equipment  that interface with antennas , and transducers , for SYSDV  and LCDV , respectively. The remote control capability can be a desirable feature when tactical scenarios change.","SYSDV  of autonomous deployment system  can be deployed many miles from ship  to the seaward edge of surf zone  where at least one line charge  is to be deployed. SYSDV  can have one or more propulsion means having propeller\/control fin structures  as a swimmer delivery vehicle and\/or having several tracked crawler assemblies  as a ground crawler vehicle similar to a heavy equipment, earth moving vehicle to propel and steer SYSDV  through water  from ship . Propeller\/control fin structures  are more likely to be selected for guided propulsion of SYSDV  over long distances or rough marine topography.","Each SYSDV  can be relatively large since it must transport considerable equipment and a bulky and heavy payload (LCDV  and line charge ). SYSDV  has propulsion and guidance motors  and fuel and\/or battery supply  for propeller\/control fin structures  and tracked ground crawler assemblies . Communications\/control modules  are connected to structures  and assemblies  via motors  and are connected to single board computer . Single board computer  can have the capacity of a desktop computer and has software  that is responsive to OCS  when each computer  of each SYSDV  is coupled to laptop computer  aboard ship . This responsive software  entered into computer  allows it to generate proper control signals for communications\/control modules  to get SYSDV  to its intended destination while avoiding any obstacles that might be encountered during the transit. En route to the intended destination, corrections and\/or changes in course can be made via communications\/control modules . Modules  additionally have a navigational payload system to receive electromagnetic signals via antenna from the global positioning system (GPS, DGPS, GPS with WAAS) and\/or a long baseline acoustic navigational system to receive acoustic signals via acoustic transducers and generate appropriate control signals to keep SYSDV  on course or change to a different destination as a tactical situation changes.","Each SYSDV  has a spacious storage bay  that can be selectably opened and closed by a hinged cover a. Storage bay  contains a high-capacity reel  having a line charge  coiled on it and a line charge delivery vehicle (LCDV) . Optionally, when a system delivery vehicle is to be used to designate an approach lane  (such as designator SYSDVs , to be described), bay  can contain a low-observable float  having a tether  coiled on a spool . Cover can be opened, bay  flooded, and tether  paid-out as float  is buoyed to surface of water  as described below.","Typically, line charge  can be a series of explosive charges  connected together in a spaced-apart relationship from one another by flexible cord-like strength members . Strength members  hold line explosive charges  as an elongate unit as it is deployed. A firing means, such as an elongate flexible detonating cord  may coextend with strength members  to explosive charges  to detonate them after line charge  has been deployed.","A firing device  can be connected to detonating cord  and communication\/control modules  to initiate detonation of line charge at the proper time. Firing device  can be located in the components of reel  inside storage bay  of SYSDV . Optionally, line charge  can include a redundant firing device located in LCDV  (not shown) that could be actuated by radio frequency, acoustic, or other signals and used in the event the primary firing device fails. The redundant firing device located on LCDV  can be used in the event there is unused line charge  remaining on reel after the deployment process is complete, which will prevent premature severing of detonation cord  at reel  when the excess line charge detonates.","Line charge  has an elongate sac  defining an air plenum that can surround and be connected to explosive charges , strength members , and detonating cord . Elongate sac  makes line charge  only slightly negatively buoyant when it is in salt water . Small flotation blocks (not shown) could be spaced among explosive charges  for buoyancy instead of elongate sac . The buoyancy feature of elongate sac  is important because without it, LCDV  may not have sufficient power\/traction to drag line charge  from reel  on SYSDV  and pay it out from reel  all to way through surf zone  and onto beach portion . One option is to have each LCDV  bring its interconnected line charge  to water's edge at low tide, then later at high tide move onto beach portion  that is underwater at high tide. Later when the tide recedes to the next low tide condition, the part of beach portion  that is now not underwater can be cleared by detonation of each line charge . As a further option each LCDV  may be made more powerful to be able to drag each line charge  through surf zone  and across beach , but the more powerful LCDVs  might have to be larger and consequently may compromise covertness.","LCDV  is an autonomous vehicle that will automatically navigate its way from SYSDV , through surf zone , shoreline  and onto beach portion  (or close to the beach) using a path that can be made perpendicular to shoreline . LCDV  has several tracked crawler assemblies  mounted on it and driving means  are coupled to tracked crawler assemblies  to impart crawling motion to LCDV  as it crawls along exposed floor, or bottom under water  in surf zone  and surface of beach portion . Driving means  can be functionally the same as motors , fuel and\/or batteries  and communication\/control modules  of SYSDV . However, since the distance LCDV  has to travel is less than the distance SYSDV  must travel, less fuel or electrical power is required.","LCDV  additionally has navigation equipment  to successfully navigate through surf zone  and beach portion  while maintaining the desired path to ensure that line charge  is properly deployed. Navigation equipment  of LCDV  includes computer  and modules that provide at least the functional equivalent of communication\/control modules  of SYSDV , and an acoustic long baseline receiver is coupled to an acoustic transducer in addition to a compass, gyroscopes, etc. In addition to receiving second instructions  on second computer  for a mission from OCS  of laptop computer  on ship , second computer  of LCDV  runs a Kalman filter to calculate position and heading accurately based on information from these sensors. An antenna can be connected to equipment  to provide a means of receiving electromagnetic control signals, for example, signals from ship . Transducer provides the capability not only to transmit acoustic signals, but also to receive acoustic control signals and other signals, such as LBL navigation signals from transmitter .","Components and connections for modules of communication\/control modules  and modules for navigational equipment  and their appropriate interconnection to responsive machinery are well known in the art. Considerable numbers of off-the-shelf units have long been available for model aircraft and boats, unmanned reconnaissance and drone craft, and full-scale marine and aircraft systems. These applications routinely rely on interfacing with numerous navigational aids, such as GPS and acoustic signals to steer a given course to a preset destination. Therefore, having this disclosure before him, one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains is free to choose and appropriately interconnect suitable components freely available in the art.","Line charge  is attached at one end to reel  and at its opposite end to LCDV . Since reel  is connected to SYSDV , when LCDV  leaves bay  and exerts a pulling force on line charge , line charge  is uncoiled from reel  and is pulled straight. LCDV  proceeds on its way and may stop in surf zone  or extend through it and onto beach portion . Line charge  is pulled straight and trails behind to extend along the distance traveled by LCDV . Once LCDV  reaches a desired depth in surf zone  or the desired distance from SYSDV  to shoreline or somewhere on beach portion , reel  on SYSDV  locks and LCDV  continues to drive forward until a predetermined tension is created on line charge . Once this predetermined tension pulls line charge  to a desired degree of tightness, it is straightened out and further progress of LCDV  is arrested. SYSDV  and LCDV  serve as anchors to hold line charge  in place along path until the time it is detonated.","Referring additionally to , to operationally deploy system  an operator, user or planner onboard ship  designates a particular approach lane  that is to be cleared of obstacles  and mines . First and a second designator SYSDVs , are used to place acoustic transmitters , which serve as part of the acoustic LBL system and can optionally serve as a repeater for acoustic communications. The designator SYSDVs , are like SYSDV  but do not transport a line charge  or LCDV . OCS  instructs designator SYSDVs , where to place the acoustic LBL navigation transmitters . This deployment of transmitters  has operator on ship  entering appropriate first instructions  from OCS  into single board computers in SYSDVs , . These transmitters  are to be placed at seaward corner positions seaward of outer corners of surf zone . of, approach lane .","The primary purpose of the two transmitters  that are placed at the seaward corner positions near seaward edge of surf zone  (depicted in ) is to serve as part of an acoustic long baseline navigation system for the SYSDVs  and LCDVs . The communications capability of transmitters  is also used to relay the results of the transmitter survey (described below) back to ship . A secondary purpose would be to use them as a relay\/repeater for data communications between the vehicles and the ship and\/or as lane markers.","The basic principle of a standard passive acoustic LBL system is as follows:","SYSDVs , LCDVs  and the two acoustic transmitters  are time synchronized, and each contains a highly accurate clock, which minimizes clock drift. The two transmitters  are deployed (as shown in ) and surveyed using GPS. This task can be accomplished using either divers or the designator SYSDVs , . Latitude\/longitude pairs for the position of each transmitter  are acoustically transmitted back to ship  from designator SYSDVs , or if divers are used to deploy the system, the position information is radioed from the divers to ship . The position of each LBL navigation transmitter is then provided to each SYSDV  and LCDV  as part of first instruction  and second instruction . Each LBL transmission of each transmitter  will \u201cchirp\u201d at different intervals (e.g. one transmitter  will chirp one second and the other transmitter  will chirp the next second, and so on). SYSDVs  and LCDVs  using the LBL system \u201clisten\u201d for the chirps, and when a chirp is detected the vehicle takes note of the time it was received. The SYSDVs  and LCDVs  using the LBL system know at what times each transmitter  will chirp, so using this information in combination with the time the chirp arrived, the \u201ctime of flight\u201d for the chirp can be determined. So, for example, if SYSDV  or LCDV  knows that one of transmitters  was supposed to transmit at time 2025 seconds and it received the chirp at 2025.5 seconds, the time of flight would then be 0.5 seconds. By using the time of flight for the chirps received from each transmitter  and the speed of sound in water equation, which is also dependent on water temperature (a temperature sensor is a component of the LBL receiver located in each SYSDV  and LCDV ), each of SYSDVs  and LCDVs  can determine its distance from each transmitter . Since the position of each transmitter  has been surveyed, and the distance from each of these two points is known, each of SYSDVs  and LCDVs  can then determine both their relative and absolute positions using simple trigonometry.","Designator SYSDVs , leave ship  and autonomously transit to the seaward edge of surf zone  of approach lane  in accordance with instructions on their first computers . Near seaward edge , each SYSDV , floods ballast tanks and sinks to the bottom to each deploy a long baseline acoustic transmitter  and a low-observable float  at seaward corner positions located just outside of outer corners of surf zone  of approach lane .","Each float  is buoyed upward and has depth sensor  and a GPS receiver  mounted on it to float at surface . Tether  is paidout from spool  on each SYSDV , at seaward corner positions until each depth sensor  detects that float  has reached surface . Spool  is rotated to reduce the slack in tether , to reduce error that might be attributed to watch circle. GPS receiver  on float  integrates its position for a given length of time to improve the accuracy of the position survey.","After gathering the needed data, each float is retracted below surface to maintain covertness. The position data for each acoustic LBL navigation transmitter  located at each seaward corner position is acoustically transmitted via transmitters  back to ship  and to any additional SYSDVs  or LCDVs  currently in the water. The transmitted data can be incorporated into OCS  in computer  and included as part of instructions  and  for other SYSDVs  and their associated LCDVs  that will require these coordinates to utilize the LBL navigational system to accurately emplace several line charges .","Next, the operator on ship  enters two latitude\/longitude pairs indicating the position of each acoustic LBL transmitter  located in designator SYSDVs , and four additional coordinates representing the corners of approach lane  to be cleared into OCS . OCS  displays a map of the area of approach lane  and requests that the user confirms the field layout of approach lane .","Another way to get the needed data is contrary to the autonomous procedure described above. Transmitters  are deployed using divers that are sent out from ship . Divers make their way to the deployment position (seaward corner positions ), they survey their positions using the global positioning system (GPS), and relay the GPS coordinates of each acoustic LBL navigation transmitter  to ship . The GPS coordinates are entered into OCS  on computer  on ship  to initialize SYSDVs  and LCDVs  for clearing of approach lane .","Actual clearing of approach lane  can now begin in earnest. Computer  on ship  is coupled to first and second computers ,  on SYSDVs  and LCDVs , respectively. OCS  on computer  initializes first and second computers ,  on SYSDVs  and LCDVs , providing them with first and second instructions ,  containing the field information necessary for them to complete their mission.","SYSDVs  which contain explosive line charges , LCDVs , and other system components needed to deploy line charges , are deployed, or launched from ship . Since each of SYSDVs  has different first instructions  in their first computers , each of SYSDVs  transits to arrive at different designated base positions  spaced apart from one another in a side-by-side relationship along seaward edge of surf zone  and approach lane  to be cleared, see .","At positions  first computers  of SYSDVs  initiate flooding of one or more internal compartments and SYSDVs  sink through water  to bottom of water . At a predetermined time that is in accordance with first instructions  in first computers , covers a are rotated open, and bays  of SYSDVs  are flooded. In accordance with the different second instructions  in second computers  of each LCDV , tracked crawler assemblies  of LCDVs  in flooded bays  are activated and proceed to crawl over opened covers and onto bottom . Each LCDV  pulls on an interconnected line charge  that is each wrapped about reel  and rotates reel  as it drags part of line charge  behind. Each reel  in each SYSDV  continues to rotate as each LCDV  unwraps and pulls more and more of its interconnected line charge  from its position of coiled stowage. Different second instructions  in second computers  in each of LCDVs  guide each LCDV  along a different path that are parallel and equal distantly spaced from each other. As each LCDV  crawls, or progresses along bottom in surf zone , each line charge  is dragged along and pulled straight to space and emplace explosive charges  apart in their predetermined parallel separation in paths . Elongate sac  on each line charge  partially buoys at least part of the load of line charge  upward in surf zone  to reduce part of the entrained load created by each line charge , and the amount of force exerted by crawler assemblies .","When only surf zone  of approach lane  is to be cleared, line charges  in paths do not have to extend onto beach portion  and can be detonated entirely in surf zone . First instructions  control SYSDVs  to allow LCDVs  to reach a predetermined destination (e. g. shoreline ) or depth in surf zone . At this predetermined destination, their interconnected reels  in SYSDVs  are locked to prevent further outward travel of LCDVs  that are connected to the opposite ends of line charges . Each of these locked-in-place line charges  are stretched tight and each interconnected SYSDV  and LCDV  serve as anchors to hold the stretched line charges  in place along paths ","Once line charges SO are appropriately stretched along paths , LCDVs  can be inactivated to allow line charges to remain in place. Line charges  emplaced in surf zone  can be detonated now or later to clear surf zone .","In response to a tactical situation, line charges  emplaced in surf zone  as described above can remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. Later, coiled portions of line charges  remaining on reels  in SYSDVs  can be utilized to enable extension of line charges  so that they can additionally reach across part of beach portion  of approach lane .","In accordance with a sequence preprogrammed in first instructions , the passage of time, or a remote acoustic signal , first instructions  can unlock SYSDVs  to release reels  to unwind more of line charges  that are still coiled on them. Second instructions  reactivate LCDVs  to pull line charges  to further extend in paths parallel with respect to one another across shoreline  and partially onto beach portion . Line charges  extend paths equally spaced apart from and parallel with each other throughout surf zone  and beach portion  of approach lane . Detonation of extended line charges  can be made in sequences or simultaneously via each firing device .","Line charges  also can be emplaced throughout surf zone  and part of beach portion  of approach lane in a single uninterrupted sequence. Emplacement of the entire lengths of line charges  need not have a period of time elapse while parts of line charges  are extended in surf zone . This uninterrupted, continuous sequence can include tightening of emplaced line charges  that extend from SYSDVs  at seaward base positions  at seaward edge to LCDVs  where they have progressed to inland positions  at the inland edge of approach lane .","First and second instructions  and  control emplacement of line charges  in parallel equally spaced apart distributions of explosive charges  of line charges  in surf zone  and beach portion . The separations between distributions and the spacing between explosive charges  assure the creation of an aggregate intense explosive effect to neutralize obstacles  and mines  (usually by destruction) within approach lane  and make approach lane  safe for transit of personnel, materials, and vehicles.","In these or other deployment sequences the locations and paths of SYSDVs  and LCDVs  can be different. The payloads of line charges  can be different to include one or more larger explosive charges or instrumentation packages to accomplish some other desired tactical result. Irrespective of the exact configuration of the constituents of system  of the invention, it is a covert and fully autonomous means of clearing obstacles and mines in approach lane  that is capable of being safely deployed from over-the-horizon and keeping personnel away from danger.","SYSDV  could use tracked crawler assemblies  in a crawler mode that allow SYSDV  to crawl on bottom of water  to deliver LCDVs  and line charges . SYSDV  could use propeller\/fin arrangement  in the swimmer-delivery mode that propels SYSDV  through water  above bottom and through water  to deliver LCDVs  and line charges . Both delivery capabilities are schematically depicted for SYSDV  and could be used alone or in combination depending on what is found to be the most effective way to successfully complete the mission.","A swimmer-type vehicle could be used instead of a crawler type LCDV , but this might limit deployment of line charges  to only part of surf zone . The clock of GPS could be used to synchronize a passive acoustic LBL navigational system, such as described above to simplify the synchronization process.","Another option is to have all of the navigation components installed only on LCDVs  instead of on both LCDVs  and SYSDVs . The navigation data from such LCDVs  would be shared with SYSDVs  for use during transit of SYSDVs  from ship  to approach lane  through a temporary umbilical connected to LCDVs  in storage bays . Having all of the navigational components in LCDVs  reduces the overall system cost since all SYSDVs  and LCDVs  are destroyed at the time of detonation of their emplaced line charges .","Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of autonomous system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Its uncomplicated, compact design incorporates structures and technologies long proven to operate successfully in the hostile marine environment. Autonomous system  lends itself to numerous modifications to permit its reliable use in different ways for different purposes in hostile and demanding environments both on open water and over many different types of land mass, including but not limited to beaches, hard-pack, soft mud, marsh, tidal flats etc. Autonomous system  of the invention can be made larger or smaller in different shapes and fabricated from a wide variety of materials to assure resistance to corrosion, sufficient strength for heavy loads, and long-term reliable operation under a multitude of different operational requirements.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Autonomous system  provides a multipurpose and capable means of emplacing elongates line charges  to assure neutralization of obstacles and mines irrespective of ambient conditions and terrain. Therefore, autonomous system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["3","3","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
