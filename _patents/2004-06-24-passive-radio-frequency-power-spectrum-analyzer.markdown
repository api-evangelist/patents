{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to devices and methods for analyzing an electromagnetic signal and, more particularly, to devices and methods of analyzing an electromagnetic signal power spectrum.","2. Related Art","Spectrum analyzers for use in analyzing signals at radio frequencies are available. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,392,397 to Thomas describes a spectrum analyzer that includes a frequency converter for converting, at each of a series of frequency settings, a received radio frequency signal into an intermediate frequency signal, each intermediate frequency signal being derivable from more than one nominal received radio frequency signals. The converter includes a frequency synthesizer for synthesizing the frequencies of the frequency settings and a mixer for mixing each synthesized frequency with the received radio frequency signal in a complex manner such that the candidate frequency intervals corresponding to an arbitrary frequency interval Fare given by N.F\u00b1F, where N is any positive integer and Fis the synthesized frequency.","In operation, the spectrum analyzer carries out a frequency analysis of each intermediate frequency signal to produce a power spectrum thereof and constructs a composite received radio frequency signal power spectrum corresponding to each intermediate frequency signal power spectrum. The composite radio frequency signal power spectrums are then operated on by the spectrum analyzer to provide the actual power spectrum of the received radio frequency signal.","Such a power spectrum analyzer suffers from the drawback of high cost and complexity resulting from extensive circuitry including filters, dividers, clocks, etc.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a spectrum analyzer comprises a resonator board that in turn comprises a substrate and a plurality of resonators. Each resonator may comprise a first segment that comprises a first segment discontinuity and that may also define a boundary and a second segment that comprises a second segment discontinuity. The second segment may be spaced from the first segment and wherein the second segment is disposed within the boundary defined by the first segment. The resonator board may also comprise a plurality of wires each of which may be generally parallel to each other and having a resonator interposed therebetween.","One embodiment of the present invention concerns a device and a method for analyzing an electromagnetic power spectrum preferably in the radio frequency (RF) range. The device is lightweight and simple as compared with prior devices and methods and may comprise a matrix of resonators and wires configured to focus a particular wavelength of a signal at a particular angle. An array of detectors may be spaced from the resonators, e.g., split ring resonators, to indicate a particular wavelength based on the angle at which the signal is focused.","Referring now to , a power spectrum analyzer in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated generally at . In this embodiment, the power spectrum analyzer  comprises a resonator assembly or board  and an array of detectors .","The resonator board  may comprise a substrate , wires  and resonators . The substrate  comprises a dielectric material such as PTFE or FR-4 and is more preferably a ceramic material manufactured by the Rogers Corporation of Rogers, Conn.","The wires  may comprise a metallic substance such as copper (Cu), Tin (Sn), aluminum (Al), Silver (Ag) or Gold (Au) and may be deposited on the substrate via, e.g., chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or formed via photolithography. The wires  are preferably deposited in such a manner that they are generally parallel to one another and in combination with the resonators  comprise a periodic matrix of resonators and parallel wires. The wires  are preferably located midway between the between the resonators  and such that the spacing between each of the wires and each of the resonators is generally equivalent. The wires  may comprise a thickness that is approximately five to ten times the skin depth. For example, at about 10 GHz, the skin depth of a copper wire may be approximately 670 nanometers and, accordingly, the thickness may be approximately 6700 nanometers or about 0.275 mils.","The resonators  may form rows and\/or columns and in combination with the generally parallel wires  are believed to form a \u201cleft-handed\u201d material at microwave frequencies. A left-handed material may be generally defined as possessing a negative index of refraction, n, where, both the electrical permittivity (\u03b5) and the magnetic permeability (\u03bc) are simultaneously negative. The wires  may provide a negative permittivity aspect by acting on an electrical component of an electromagnetic field. The resonators  may provide a negative permeability effect by acting on a magnetic component of an electromagnetic wave. Also, the resonator board  is shown for illustrational purposes as comprising a two by four matrix of resonators , although, it will be understood that merely a plurality of resonators may be employed in the practice of the invention.","Referring now to , each resonator  may comprise a pair of segments ,  comprising a metallic substance such as copper (Cu), Tin (Sn), aluminum (Al), Silver (Ag) or Gold (Au). Similar to wires , the segments ,  may be deposited or formed on the substrate . The segments ,  preferably comprise rings as shown, although, it will be understood that other geometrical shapes such as squares, rectangles and combinations thereof may be employed. The segments ,  comprise splits or discontinuities  that may function to decrease the resonant frequency of the segment and thereby substantially reduce the dimension of the segments for a given wavelength. The segments , , as shown on the substrate  (), together generally define a single plane, although, it will be appreciated that other configurations such as that defining multiple planes may be utilized.","For analyzing a power spectrum of radio frequency signals, the segments ,  may be separated as shown by the dimension (d) that may be within the range of between approximately 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm. Each segment ,  may have a thickness (c) that is within the range of between approximately 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm. Segment  may have an inner radius (r) that may be within the range of between approximately 15 mm and 1.5 mm and segment  may have an inner radius (r) that may be within the range of between approximately 12 mm and 1.2 mm. The foregoing dimensions are provided for illustrational purposes only and, it will be recognized that, each of the dimensions depend on the center frequency or wavelength that is to be analyzed. For example, for the separation dimension (d) of segments  and , 1 mm would be suitable for a few GHz whereas 0.1 mm would be more appropriate for 10 GHz.","Referring again to , the array of detectors  may be mounted on a support (not shown) that extends in a linear direction that may be generally perpendicular to a plane defined by the resonator assembly . Each detector may comprise an active device with gain such as a microwave transistor for increased sensitivity or a passive device such as a bolometer.","During operation of the power spectrum analyzer , an electromagnetic signal, represented by arrows  is passed through a collimator that provides for parallel rays and restricts a portion of the electromagnetic signal as shown at . The electromagnetic signal then passes through the resonator board  whereby, because of the matrix of wires  and resonators  the signal is focused to a particular location depending upon its wavelength (see solid, dashed and dotted lines ,  and ). More specifically, it is believed that when an electromagnetic signal enters the resonator board , the signal encounters negative values of permeability (\u03bc) and permittivity (\u03b5), as described above, whereby the signal may suffer from chromatic aberrations. That is, different wavelengths come to a focus at different distances from the resonator board . Accordingly, the detectors  may be spaced linearly away from the resonator board  to thereby measure an amplitude for each wavelength whereby a frequency spectrum of the signal may be found. The detectors  may be located at a particular distance via calibration depending upon a desired wavelength or frequency.","Although not shown, it will be understood that several resonator boards  with wires  and resonators  of different dimensions (c, r and r) and separations (d) may be combined to cover a broad frequency in accordance with the present invention. In such an arrangement, the electromagnetic signal would pass through the boards with the larger dimensions first, then progressively smaller dimensions. That way, in the initial resonator board , the longer wavelengths would be focused while the shorter wavelengths may pass through, relatively unaffected, to the next resonator board which would focus increasingly shorter wavelengths, and so on.","Another embodiment of a power spectrum analyzer in accordance with the present invention is shown generally at  in . The power spectrum analyzer  may be generally similar to that described above in , and corresponding components are labeled correspondingly, although, preceded by a one. Reference for the particular aspects and functions of each component may be had above.","A difference in the power spectrum analyzer  from that of the power spectrum analyzer  is that the resonator board  is operated, as shown, in a reflective mode rather than a transmissive mode. In this way, it will be appreciated that electromagnetic signals will be reflected and focused for receipt by a particular detector in the array of detectors  in accordance with wavelength. Thereafter, the amplitude of each wavelength may be measured to provide a power spectrum analysis for the electromagnetic signal . it will be recognized that at higher frequencies, the reflective mode may be preferable to the transmissive mode because it should suffer much lower losses.","While the present invention has been described in connection with what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to these herein disclosed embodiments. Rather, the present invention is intended to cover all of the various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The following detailed description is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
