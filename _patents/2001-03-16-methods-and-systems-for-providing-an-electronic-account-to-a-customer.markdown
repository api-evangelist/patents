DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/189,983 with a filing date of Mar. 17, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference.","A. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to systems and methods for providing electronic communications to a customer. More particularly, the invention relates to systems and methods for providing an electronic account and other services to a customer by linking the customer's electronic address to a physical address where the customer receives physical mail.","B. Description of the Related Art","The United States Postal Service (USPS) is an independent government agency that provides mail delivery and other services to the public. The USPS is widely recognized as a safe and reliable means for sending and receiving mail. With the steady growth of electronic communication and commerce, consumers and businesses need a secure way to communicate and conduct business electronically. Without trustworthy channels of communication, many potential participants in electronic commerce are unwilling to send sensitive information, e.g., credit card numbers, electronically, thus limiting the utility of electronic commerce to all individuals.","Electronic mail, or e-mail, is a well-known means of communication for individuals and businesses with access to computers and Internet connections. When a user establishes an account with an e-mail service provider, e.g., America Online\u2122 or Hotmail\u2122, the user is assigned a unique e-mail address, e.g. joesmith@aol.com. Another individual can send a message to the user by entering the user's e-mail address along with the message and sending it via the Internet. E-mail can provide almost instant message delivery among individuals and businesses over vast distances for very little or no cost. E-mail also presents an opportunity for businesses to advertise to potential customers in a new way, e.g., by sending bulk advertisements via e-mail.","Despite the advantages of e-mail, there are several drawbacks. Because e-mail is received and viewed electronically, e-mail does not reach those who are not \u201conline.\u201d In this way, e-mail contributes to the so-called \u201ctechnology gap\u201d between individuals with access to computers and computer technology and individuals who cannot afford or who do not understand computers and computer technology.","Additionally, the simplicity and low cost of e-mail make it an easy vehicle for unwanted messages, e.g., unsolicited advertisements or \u201cspam.\u201d Both individuals and businesses demand the capability to inhibit the receipt of unwanted e-mail.","Furthermore, e-mail messages are also insecure, and can be intercepted en route by unknown third parties. Businesses and consumers who communicate electronically need to know that their messages are private, and that they can rely on the address to correctly identify the sender and\/or recipient.","Therefore, it is desirable to provide a system for communicating electronically that is available to everyone, that gives consumers control over the content of communications received, and that provides a secure and reliable way to conduct transactions electronically.","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention overcome the shortcomings of conventional systems by establishing an electronic account for a customer on a network, where the customer's electronic address is linked to the customer's physical address. As with a conventional electronic account, a customer is able to send and receive e-mail, as well as conduct electronic transactions. However, the electronic account ensures flexible and secure communications by linking a customer's electronic address to the customer's physical address. Systems and methods consistent with the present invention may be implemented by the USPS. Moreover, such a USPS electronic account may provide electronic access to all persons, i.e., a person with a USPS physical address may also have a USPS electronic account.","A method consistent with the present invention establishing an electronic account over a network. When a request is received from a user to initiate an electronic account over the network, a physical address of the user is matched from an address database, the physical address corresponding to a location where the user receives mail. The electronic account is linked to the physical address.","Another method consistent with the present invention establishes electronic mail services over a network using an electronic account by receiving a request for electronic mail services from a user, the request including a physical address of the user. An electronic address for the user is generated so that the user can receive electronic mail at the electronic address. An electronic account is initiated over the network for the user, wherein the electronic account has a unique electronic customer account number corresponding to the user, and the physical address is linked to the electronic address using the electronic account.","Another method consistent with the present invention processes electronic mail services over a network using an electronic account by linking the electronic account to a physical address of a user and an electronic address of the user. A request is received from a service to access the electronic account over the network, and a request is received from the user to access the service over the network via the electronic account.","Another method consistent with the present invention delivers mail. Mail is received for delivery to a customer with an electronic account. The electronic account has both an electronic address for the customer and a physical address for the customer, and both the electronic address and the physical address are linked by the electronic account. The mail is then delivered to the customer.","Another method consistent with the present invention delivers a message to a user with an electronic account by receiving the message directed to the user with the electronic account, where the message includes an electronic address and an incomplete physical address of the user. A complete physical address of the user is determined from the electronic address using an address database and the message is delivered to the user.","Another method consistent with the present invention delivers a message to a user with an electronic account when the electronic account includes a preferred delivery address. A temporary delivery address for the user and a time period corresponding to the temporary delivery address are received. When a message directed to the preferred delivery address is received during the time period, the message is sent to the temporary delivery address.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.","A. Introduction","Systems and methods consistent with the present invention provide an electronic account for a customer on a network, where the customer's electronic address is linked to the customer's physical address. As with a conventional electronic account, a customer is able to send and receive e-mail as well as conduct electronic transactions. Additionally, an electronic account consistent with the present invention ensures flexible and secure communications by linking a customer's electronic address to the customer's physical address.","Embodiments described herein include systems and methods for providing an electronic account to a customer, linking a customer's electronic address to a physical address of the customer, establishing an electronic account using an Internet Customer Registration System, providing a secure electronic mailbox, and providing a certificate authority for proofing identities.","B. Providing an Electronic Account to a Customer",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","104","100"]},"When electronic account  is established, it is linked to a physical address of customer . Typically, the physical address corresponds to a location where the user receives physical mail, such as via the USPS or other entity. In this way, anyone who receives mail at a physical address can establish an electronic account consistent with the present invention. The physical address can be a home address, Post Office box, business address, etc. Electronic account  can also include an electronic address, such as an e-mail address, for customer .","To provide electronic services to customer , a service provider can communicate with customer  via electronic account . If electronic account  is linked to customer 's physical address and e-mail address, the service provider can send a communication to electronic account  and request delivery to either the physical address or the e-mail address, or both. If such a communication directed to customer  contains an incomplete address, the complete address can be determined using electronic account . As an added service, the sender, i.e., the service provider, could be informed of the complete address as part of an address correction service.","Electronic account  can allow customer  to receive an electronic message in physical form at a physical address. In this way, the present invention makes e-mail available even to people without regular access to a computer. For example, a customer could use a public computer, e.g., at a public library, to establish an electronic account and obtain a vanity e-mail address. Thereafter, any messages sent to the e-mail address would be received at the electronic account and could be printed and delivered to the physical address linked to the electronic account. The USPS or another company could offer this service to help bridge the technology gap.","Customer  can also link a temporary address, either physical or electronic, to electronic account  to request that messages be delivered to the temporary address for a given period of time. For example, a businessman might have an electronic account with preferred e-mail and physical addresses at his office. When he takes a two-week business trip, he can use his electronic account to have his messages delivered to a new, temporary address, such as a cellular phone or a computer in a hotel. Service providers sending the messages to the businessman would not need to know about his temporary address. All communications would still be directed to the electronic account.","C. Linking an Electronic Address to a Physical Address of a Customer",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","104","202","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["204","302","104","302","104","302","304","306","304","306","306"]},"When the customer provides the physical address, the electronic account system can submit it to an address matching engine that communicates with an address database. The address matching engine submits the address as a query to the address database, which returns a standardized physical address to be linked to the electronic account. In one embodiment, the standardized physical address conforms to a pre-approved format and includes a nine-digit ZIP code. In this way, the physical address linked to the electronic account is as complete and correct as possible, even if the customer submitted only a partial address (e.g., only a 5-digit ZIP code). This address matching process is described in detail below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["402","402","404","406","406","402","404","404","402"]},"A service  can leverage the electronic account to send a message to a plurality of customers. For example, a marketing firm could submit a physical mailpiece, e.g., a brochure, to the electronic account system along with a mailing list of physical addresses for a group of customers having electronic accounts. The electronic account system can create a mailing list of e-mail addresses corresponding to the physical addresses using each customer's electronic account. The mailpiece can be scanned or otherwise converted into electronic format and delivered to the customers' e-mail addresses. Alternatively, the message could be delivered to a different electronic address, such as a facsimile number or telephone number. This type of service is described below with reference to .","D. Establishing an Electronic Account using an Internet Customer Registration System (ICRS)","1. Customer Registration Process",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 5A","b":["502","504","506","504","506"]},"After customer  provides registration information to registration system , a mailpiece , such as a confirmation letter, is created and sent to the user at a physical address. The physical address can be one provided by the customer with the registration information. Mailpiece  contains an identity validation (IDV) form , described with regard to  below. To complete the registration process, customer  takes IDV form  to a registration office, such as a local Post Office. There, a clerk verifies the customer's identity and uses IDV form  to send identification verification information to registration system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["508","510","506","510","506"]},"As shown in , IDV form  can include the customer's physical address, the customer's e-mail address, the location of the nearest registration office, and a date by which the customer must go to the registration office. IDV form  can also include a list of identity validation documents that the customer must present at the registration office, such as a driver's license, birth certificate, or utility bill. In one embodiment, the customer can select the identity validation documents when submitting registration information to registration system .","IDV form  can include a confirmation bar code. The confirmation bar code can be created by the registration system  and linked to the electronic account when IDV form  is created. Once a clerk validates the customer's identity, for example, by examining the identity validation documents, the clerk can scan the confirmation bar code and send it electronically to registration system . When registration system  receives the scanned confirmation bar code, the customer's electronic account can be activated. Activation can occur, for example, by sending a digital certificate, password, or other notification to the customer.","In one embodiment of the present invention, two copies of IDV form  are sent to the customer: one copy for the customer to take to the registration office and another copy for the customer to retain for his records. IDV form  can include a set of instructions and a customer care telephone number that the customer can call if he has any problems. IDV form  can also include a signature and date block for the customer to execute as part of the identification validation process at the registration office.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 7"],"b":["502","506","504","506","602","604","606","602","506","602","604","502","602","606"]},"Database server  processes all communications with an Internet Customer Registration System (ICRS) database . In one embodiment, ICRS database  consists of two logical components: a customer name database  and a customer address database . Customer name database  stores the registration information provided by a customer along with an electronic account number assigned to the customer. Customer address database  stores the customer's physical address. In this embodiment, the physical address is stored separately from the customer's name and other information to protect the security of the customer. To create a high level of security, packet filter access can be installed between customer name database  and customer address database . Consistent with the present invention, the ICRS database could be maintained as a single database.","When registration system  receives registration information from customer , it stores the registration information in ICRS database  as described above. An identification verification (IDV) form generator  then extracts data from ICRS database  and passes the data to a print and insertion function  that generates mailpiece  containing IDV form . Alternatively, IDV form generator  and print and insertion function  can be a single process. In one embodiment, the IDV form and mailpiece are generated within  hours after the customer's registration information is stored in ICRS database .","As described above, customer  takes IDV form  to a registration office where a clerk verifies, or \u201cproofs,\u201d the customer's identity. The identity proofing can include comparing a photo ID to the customer in person. When the customer's identity is successfully proofed, the clerk scans a confirmation bar code from IDV form  and transmits the scanned bar code to registration system  via a delivery confirmation host . In one embodiment, IDV form generator  can send a notification to delivery confirmation host  when IDV form  is created. When this notification is received, delivery confirmation host  can communicate with application server  to provide notice that identification verification information is soon to be received. When the scanned bar code is sent to delivery confirmation host , application server  retrieves this identification verification information from delivery confirmation host .","Once the identification verification information is received by application server , a request is generated and sent to a digital certificate authority , such as, for example, the Certificate Authority (CA) described below with reference to . The request can direct digital certificate authority  to generate a digital certificate for customer . The request can include, for example, a public key and information provided by customer  during the registration process.","A digital certificate is a well-known tool for sending secure messages. A CA issues an encrypted digital certificate containing a customer's public key and a variety of other identification information. The Certificate Authority makes its own public key available through print or perhaps on the Internet. The recipient of an encrypted message uses the CA's public key to decode the digital certificate attached to the message, verifies the digital certificate as issued by the CA, and then obtains the sender's public key and identification information held within the certificate. With this information, the recipient can send an encrypted reply.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["602","702","704","706","602","506","702","708","708","702","702","708"]},"Certificate software  is an application programming interface (API)\u2014a tool enabling one piece of software to communicate with another piece of software.

Mail Database  is a storage location for the messages of the SEM. An eAddress Management component  manages a customer's electronic address books, which can be stored in an Address Database .","An electronic postmark (EPM) system  can be used to enable the customer to attach a time and date seal (e.g., an EPM) to a message and to detect when a message with a time and date seal (e.g., an EPM) has been tampered with. A Sign and Encrypt component  can be used to enable a customer to digitally sign messages.","3. Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment","A secure electronic mailbox consistent with the present invention supports many services in addition to electronic message handling. A customer with an electronic account can use an electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service to receive and pay bills electronically. Billers, such as utility companies or credit card companies, can join the EBPP system and submit bills, bill summaries, bill histories, etc. to the customer (i.e., the payer) using the electronic account and SEM systems. An EBPP system consistent with the present invention improves upon conventional electronic bill payment systems in several ways. First, the present invention uses an EBPP system to improve communication and feedback between a biller and a payer. Second, an EBPP system consistent with the present invention is linked to a physical address of the payer enabling flexible communications including physical and electronic mail. Third, because an EBPP system consistent with the present invention is linked to a payer's electronic account, the biller knows that the identity of the payer was verified in person and therefore can be more confident in sending bills and receiving payment via the EBPP system. Fourth, bills from several sources can be consolidated for viewing seamlessly, i.e., without indicating the source of the bill. Payment can be provided to the appropriate biller seamlessly, i.e., without indicating the payment destination to the customer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0153","num":"0152"},"figref":"FIG. 23","b":["2302","2304","2306","2308","2310"]},"In an alternative embodiment, the enrollment request can also be initiated by a biller. For example, a payer could sign up for the EBPP system at a biller's web site. The biller-initiated enrollment request would then be sent from the biller to the EBPP system (step ) and the biller-initiated enrollment status can be returned to the biller (step ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0154"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["2402","2404","2406","2408","2410","2412","2414","2416","2418"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0155"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["2502","2504","2506"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["2602","2604","2606","2608","2610"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0157"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":["2702","2704","2706","2708","2710","2712"]},"There are many alternative embodiments for storing and presenting bill information to the payer. The electronic account system can store all bill information in the EBPP system (e.g., to bill for SEM services). Alternatively, the EBPP system may store only bill summary information and the payer can communicate directly with a biller to obtain bill details. In another embodiment, the EBPP system may be provided by a third party and offered to the payer via the electronic account system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0159"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["2802","2804","2806","2808","2810"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0160"},"figref":"FIG. 29","b":["2902","2904","2906","2908","2910"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0162","num":"0161"},"figref":"FIG. 30","b":["3001","3002","3004","3006","3008","3010"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0162"},"figref":"FIG. 31","b":["3102","3104","3106","3108","3110","3112","3114"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0163"},"figref":"FIG. 32","b":["3202","3204","3206","3208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":"FIG. 33","b":["3302","3304","3306","3308"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"figref":"FIG. 34","b":["3402","3404","3405","3406","3408","3409","3410","3404","3405","3406","3408","3408"]},"F.
