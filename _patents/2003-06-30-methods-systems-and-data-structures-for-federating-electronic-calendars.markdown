The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software and data as described below and in any drawings hereto: Copyright \u00a9 2003, Novell, Inc., All Rights Reserved.","The invention relates to techniques for federating electronic calendars. More specifically, the invention relates to federating a plurality of selective information associated acquired from disparate electronic calendaring systems into composite calendaring systems and composite calendars.","Individuals are becoming increasingly dependent on electronic calendaring systems to keep up with their fast paced lives. This dependency has become more prominent in recent years with the advent of personal digital assistants (PDAs). In fact, the primary use of a PDA appears to be for purposes of staying in synch with one's calendar of events.","However, as society becomes increasingly mobile and dependent on electronic communications, calendaring systems have only marginally changed to accommodate trends and needs. For instance, a conventional calendaring system does not collaborate with different calendaring systems. As a result, an individual that needs to track and integrate with a variety of disparate calendaring systems is out of luck. But, individuals often have a variety of calendars that they maintain, such as work calendars, social calendars, religious calendars, association calendars, each of which may be associated with a different calendaring system.","Moreover, there is not just a need for one individual to integrate with his\/her own calendaring systems, because in many circumstances there is a need to collaborate with calendaring systems of different individuals (e.g., husband with his wife or vice versa).","There have been some advancements in integrating electronic mail systems, but little attempt has been made to improve the integration of disparate calendaring systems. In fact, the trend has been to force individuals to use a generic calendaring system of the same type, if collaboration or integration is desired (e.g., a centralized World Wide Web (WWW) browser-based calendaring system). Yet with this technique, individuals are forced to adapt to yet another calendaring system, and this does not address the real issue of integrating disparate calendaring systems, which is often the practical reality that individuals are faced with today.","Thus, improved techniques for federating (collaborating and integrating) electronic calendaring systems into a composite calendaring system are needed.","In various embodiments of the invention, disparate calendaring systems are federated into a composite calendaring system. Disparate first and second calendars are selectively identified and a bridging communication established between the calendars. A composite calendaring system permits selective information from the first and second calendaring systems to be viewed within a composite calendar of a composite calendaring system.","More specifically, and in one embodiment of the invention, a method to federate calendaring systems is described. First and second calendaring systems are identified. The first and second calendaring systems are disparate from one another. Moreover, a bridging communication is established between the first and second calendaring systems. Next, a composite calendaring system is presented that uses the bridging communication to coordinate selective information from the first and second calendaring systems.","In another embodiment of the invention, a method that provides a composite calendar associated with disparate calendaring systems is taught. First and second calendaring systems are selected, each system having first and second schemas, respectively. Further, the first and second calendaring systems are disparate from one another. Additionally, a meta schema is used for selectively synchronizing events of the first and second calendaring systems into the composite calendar.","In still another embodiment of the invention, a composite calendaring system is presented. The composite calendaring system includes a data structure and an application programming interface (API). The data structure is for synchronizing first and second calendaring systems, which are disparate from one another. The API is for defining a composite calendar having selective information compiled from the first and second calendaring systems.","In yet another embodiment of the invention a composite calendar data structure, residing in a computer-accessible medium, is described for synchronizing external calendars. The composite calendar data structure includes a first calendar entry acquired from a first calendar, a second calendar entry acquired from a second calendar, and a composite calendar entry representing selective information from the first and second calendar entries. The first and second calendar entries are acquired from first and second calendaring systems, which are disparate from one another.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical, optical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The following description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limited sense, and the scope of the invention is defined exclusively by the appended claims.","In various embodiments of the invention, the phrase \u201ccalendaring system\u201d is used. A calendaring system can include existing commercially developed software calendar products (e.g., GroupWise, iCalendar, Lotus, Exchange, Outlook, and others) or software calendar products hereafter developed. Disparate calendaring systems are calendar products that are not compatible (different from) with one another. The composite calendaring systems, described below with various embodiments of the invention, can be modified existing calendar products or stand alone developed calendar products. Furthermore, the composite calendaring systems of the invention can be integrated into other software products or services.","A meta schema is a data definition that bridges two or more disparate schemas. Each disparate schema belongs to a separate calendaring system. Conventionally, calendaring systems include schema definitions that are internally used with each calendaring system in order to properly process calendar data. A meta schema includes definitions and logic for properly parsing and processing each of the disparate schemas into new data formats and Application Programming Interface (API) calls, which are consumed in composite calendaring systems of the invention. Moreover, variable values and parameter data can be passed to or expanded by tools processing schemas in order to permit dynamic data substitution within the schemas.","In additional CAP standards can be used with the bridging communication of this invention for purposes of providing a number of standard API calls for communications between disparate calendaring systems.","Schema definitions are readily known, available, and used by one of ordinary skill in art of this invention. Moreover, A variety of programming languages and tools exist to develop and process schemas (e.g., Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Extensible Style Sheets Transformation Applications (XMLT)). Any such schema definition, language, or tool can be used with the embodiments of the invention.","One embodiment of this invention is implemented using the GroupWise, NetMail and Portal Service products distributed by Novell, Inc., of Provo, Utah. Of course, the invention can be implemented in a variety of platforms, systems, modules, services, and products. Additional, communication standards can be used, for example, Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) standards can be used for bridging various communications between disparate calendaring systems for embodiments of this invention. All such platforms, systems, modules, services, and products, which are modified and used to achieve the tenets of the invention, are intended to fall within the scope of the invention.","Furthermore, although embodiments of this invention are discussed in terms of first and second disparate calendaring system, the invention is not so limited, since a plurality of disparate and non-disparate calendaring systems can benefit from the teachings of the invention, where at least two of the plurality of disparate calendaring systems is disparate from one another.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"At , a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application is interfaced to the method  processing. The GUI permits selection and identification of a first calendaring system and a second calendaring system. Each of the calendaring systems is disparate from one another. Of course any application can be interfaced to method  for selecting the first and second calendaring systems. For instance, an API application can directly interface with method  in order to initially identify the first and second calendaring systems. Thus, manual interactions with a GUI application or automatic processing of API application can be used to supply the identity of the first and second calendaring systems.","Once the identities of the first and second calendaring systems are determined, the types of the calendaring systems can be readily determined. A type uniquely identifies a specific calendaring system (e.g., GroupWise, iCalendar, Lotus, Exchange, Outlook, and others). For example, each calendaring system can be uniquely identified in a data file or data structure that is accessible to the processing of the method , where a lookup in the data file produces other information related to the appropriate unique type for each of the calendaring systems. When the calendaring system types are known an appropriate bridging communication is established at .","A bridging communication is an application or data definition that translates the API calls and data formats expected by the first and second calendaring systems into data formats and API calls used by the processing of the method . In some embodiments, the bridging communications is a predefined application for translating communications between the processing of the method  and the first and second calendaring systems. In other embodiments, the bridging communication is a meta schema that uses existing or custom-developed schema parsing and processing tools to translate communications between the processing of the method  and the first and second calendaring systems.","In one embodiment, at  after the types of the first and second calendaring systems are known, a proper meta schema needed for translation or proper parameters needed for processing a generic meta schema can be determined. The meta schema is used in connection with first and second schemas that define data and communication formats expected by the first and second calendaring systems, respectively. Accordingly, at  and , the first and second schemas are acquired, parsed, and processed.","At , selective information from the first and second calendaring systems is tracked, once the appropriate bridging communication is established. Selective information can be events occurring within the first and second calendaring systems, and are selectively configured as tracking events within in the bridging communication. Moreover, some of the tracked events can be predefined within the bridging communication.","The bridging communication can be driven by an API that interfaces with the processing of the method . According, at , an API is provided having a variety of methods or routines that can effect changes and direct the bridging communication to take some action. Example actions can include defining events to track in one or both of the first and second calendaring systems. Moreover, events within the processing of the method  can be defined and used to take other actions.","For example, when a defined calendar entry associated with the processing of method  is changed, an action can be defined within the API to send the corresponding change to the first or second calendaring system. A variety of events and actions can be defined using the API. Calendaring events and actions are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and can include such things as defining a meeting having specific attendees, dates, and times of day; defining access priorities to calendar entries; defining recurring meetings; defining reminders; defining alert notifications; defining modifications to existing calendar entries; defining calendar entries for deletion; and others.","Generally, events define conditions that occur during the processing of a calendaring system. Events can be predefined (globally accessible) within the logic of the calendaring system or, in many circumstances; events can be custom defined using an API of the native calendaring system. Thus, in various embodiments of the invention, external events are defined within the processing of the method  via the provided API for any calendaring system embodied as the processing of the method . Predefined external events are automatically available automatically through the bridging communication via the provided API. To the extent that the first and second calendaring entries permit custom-developed event definition, the bridging communication can be used in concert with the provided API to define such external events associated with the first and second calendaring entries. Detection of external events drive the processing of actions.","Actions can raise events, but do not need always need to raise events. For example, an action can be defined to make a notation in a calendaring tracking log. In this situation, it may not be desirable to detect that this processing has taken place, or event that it successfully happened, thus there may be no need to raise an event. However, in most circumstances, the processing of an action will raise an event, such as adding a calendaring entry to the first or second calendaring systems or to a composite calendar synchronized within the processing of the method . An action is processing logic definable within the processing logic of a calendaring system, whereas an event is a result of processing an action. Events and actions are readily understood and known to one of ordinary skill in the art of this invention.","The provided API can also be used to configure a composite calendaring system defined by the processing of the method , as depicted at . Thus, custom views, custom actions, and custom preferences for the composite calendaring system can be easily configured via the provided API.","At , a composite calendar is operational within the composite calendaring system, such that external events from the first and second calendaring systems are detected and tracked via the bridging communication. Additionally, in some embodiments, events native to the composite calendaring system can be detected and raised to the first and second calendaring systems via the bridging communication.","Once the composite calendar is operational, at , a composite calendaring system is completely presentable where selective information from the first and second calendaring systems is tracked and presented within the composite calendar. Additionally, some information being modified with the composite calendar can be optionally communicated back to the first or second calendaring systems via the bridging communication.","The first, second, and composite calendaring systems do not need to be owned by the same entity (user). In other words, a user may want to track and coordinate his composite calendar with that of other individuals who have their own calendars in the first or second calendaring systems. Of course, in these situations, the owner of the composite calendar needs at least view access rights to the calendars of the other individuals.","For purposes of illustration, an example application of a composite calendaring system embodied by the processing of the method  is presented. Consider a fictional person named Bob. Bob is a life insurance sales representative. As part of Bob's work responsibilities he frequently participates in project teams to assist the organization. Some of Bob's participation of project teams is voluntary, at other times Bob's participation is mandatory.","In Bob's spare time, he enjoys watching sporting events, participating regularly in his local church activities, and attempting to attend all the activities associated with his children. He tries desperately to keep track of everything in his organizer, which he synchronizes with his calendar at work but inevitably he misses some meetings, events, and activities because of regular conflicts. In an attempt to organize his life more efficiently, Bob thinks about all of the different calendars that his is trying to monitor, and he creates the following list:","Work:\n\n","Family:\n\n","Church:\n\n","Sporting Events:\n\n","As Bob is thinking about this over abundance of calendars, he discovers a feature of his GroupWise electronic calendaring system, represented by the processing the method , called composite calendaring. Bob accesses the composite calendaring system and selects or subscribes to each of his disparate electronic calendaring systems. Several of Bob's existing calendaring systems are disparate from his GroupWise calendaring system. For instance, at home Bob uses a Lotus calendaring system.","Bob access a number of GUI windows on his electronic organizer and readily defines the types of calendaring entries, events, and actions that he desires to be tracked in his newly discovered composite calendaring feature. Now, Bob can see at a glance all of the events in his busy life and best of all, all of the changes and additions to these disparate calendars automatically display in Bob's composite calendar. Bob decides all of his work and family calendar events automatically become part of his individual calendar. He chooses not to have the sports or church events in his permanent calendar, but he still displays these excluded events as an FYI in his composite calendar, so that he can attend when feasible.","As Bob access the composite calendaring features he discovers that he can add events from other composite calendars associated with other individuals. Moreover, Bob can publish his composite calendar to other composite calendars of different individuals or to his individual work calendar, if desired.","One of ordinary skill in the art of this invention now fully understands the benefits of federating disparate calendaring systems into a composite calendaring system. The composite calendaring system of this invention improves time management over conventional techniques, since now an individual can synchronize a plurality of calendars with a single composite calendar.","Furthermore, in various embodiments of the invention, the composite calendaring system can be used to create hierarchical calendars. For example, entries within one composite calendar can uniquely and visually be displayed within the composite calendar, such that font sizes, font types, font effects, images, and the like permit ready assimilation as to the origin of the individual entries. Some composite calendar entries can be associated with other composite calendars, which are associated with other individuals. These other composite entries can be expanded to show the calendars from which they originate. Furthermore, in some embodiments, different configurable views within the composite calendaring system can permit embedded composite calendars to be viewed as a hierarchy or tree, because embedded composite calendar entries can also include other embedded composite calendar entries. Thus, composite calendars can inherit entries from other composite calendars to create a hierarchy of composite calendars.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","200"]},"Calendars can be of three kinds: a calendar owned by an external agent (e.g., owned by a different individual or application for a group or organization), a calendar owned by a single entity that has write access privileges, and calendars owned by a separate entity by giving write access privileges to other entities (e.g., one spouse's calendar with write privileges granted to the other spouse).","Each of the calendar types can be represented in disparate calendaring systems (e.g., one calendar in a GroupWise calendaring system, one calendar in a Lotus calendaring system, and one calendar in an Exchange calendaring system). Although, for purposes of this invention (as was described above in detail with ) a single calendar type can also be depicted in a plurality of disparate calendaring systems as disparate calendars.","In order to access disparate calendars from disparate calendaring systems, the data and communication formats of the disparate calendaring systems are predefined in a unique schema for each calendaring system type. Once this has been achieved, a meta schema can be defined that bridges communication between disparate calendaring systems. In this way, the meta schema or bridging communication federates the disparate calendaring systems into a format that can be consumed and synchronized by composite calendaring systems of the invention.","In one embodiment, a single meta schema can be used to federate between three or more disparate calendaring systems, where the types of each disparate calendaring system are passed as parameters to any parsing and processing application utilizing the single meta schema. In other embodiments, a plurality of meta schemas can be developed and cooperate with one another, where each meta schema performs a translation from a single disparate calendaring system to another disparate calendaring systems. The plurality of meta schemas are then interfaced via an application of the composite calendaring system.","At , at least a first and second calendaring system is selected for federation into a composite calendar managed by a composite calendaring system. The first and second calendaring systems are disparate in type from one another. Selection can be achieved automatically via an API, such as when a batch application or automatic application is being used. Alternatively, selection can be achieved via a GUI application that manually interacts with a user and an API. The API communicates with the meta schema or other applications processing the meta schema, which establish a bridging communication between the first and second calendaring systems and the composite calendaring system.","At , the meta schema (or bridging communication) is used for synchronizing events occurring in the first and second calendaring systems with the composite calendaring system. Additionally, in some embodiments, the meta schema is used for synchronizing events from the composite calendaring system back to at least one of the first and second calendaring systems.","In one embodiment, at , rules are received via an API. The rules define events or actions that are to be detected or taken with the first and second calendaring system when assembling the composite calendar. For example, a rule can be defined through the API to detect when a calendar entry or modification is made in first or second calendars of the first or second calendaring systems, respectively. The rule can also define an action to automatically add the external entry to the composite calendar. Alternatively, the rule can send only an alert notification to the composite calendaring system for pop-up display within a GUI application of the composite calendaring system.","Rules can also be used to define preferences or configurations of the composite calendar and to speed processing of the composite calendar. For example, if an Appointment X conflicts with an Appointment Y and X originates from a higher priority calendar, then automatically accept X in the composite calendar and decline Y back to the external calendar.","Rules can also be more complex, such as if X is in conflict with Y and X has already been accepted in the composite calendar, then accept Y if X is subsequently cancelled. Rules can also set global priorities, such as X is work calendar appointment and is therefore a top priority whereas Y is a hobby calendar appointment and is therefore a low priority.","Rules can also be used to create permanent entries in the composite calendar or tentative entries in the composite calendar. Moreover, rules can require some manual interaction with or notification from the owning entity of the composite calendar. Additionally, a rule can give feedback or send automatic updates to the first and second calendaring systems based on access rights associated with the first and second calendaring systems.","In still other embodiments, at , actions (defined by the rules) can be received for processing, which require the composite calendaring system to send events to at least one of the first or second calendaring system. Accordingly, when composite calendaring entries are modified an action can be processed, which requires the bridging communication to use the meta schema in order to translate the changed entry into an external event that is recognized by at least one of the first and second calendaring systems. Thus, not only can the composite calendar be synchronized to first and second calendars, but the composite calendaring systems can also be used to synchronize the first and second calendars with the composite calendar.","Moreover, in some embodiments, rules and actions can be used to synchronize other composite calendars with a single composite calendar, as was described above with . Correspondingly, composite calendars can inherit children calendar entries of other composite calendars. In this way, a composite calendar can be viewed as a hierarchy of other calendars.","It should also be noted that the composite calendaring system can synchronize more than two disparate calendaring systems, and that some of the additional (greater than two) calendaring systems may not be disparate from one of the at least two disparate calendaring systems. Thus, the composite calendaring system can synchronize a first and second calendaring system associated with calendar types of GroupWise and Lotus, respectively, and the composite calendaring system can also synchronize a third calendaring system associated with a calendar type of Exchange.","At , the rules and actions of the composite calendaring system are used to synchronize the composite calendar with the first and second calendars of the first and second calendaring systems, respectively. Optionally, the rules and actions of the composite calendaring system are also used to synchronize at least one of the first and second calendars with the composite calendar. At , the composite calendaring system presents the assembled composite calendar.","In one embodiment, an API can be used in connection with establishing the rules and actions to also synchronize other related calendar data, as depicted at . For example, often calendaring systems include task or contact data, which is accessible to and integrated with the calendaring systems. In these circumstances, the API can be used to synchronize and integrate the external contact or task data as composite contact or task data, respectively. Thus, all related calendar data accessible and definable via the meta schema can be synchronized between the composite calendaring system and external calendaring systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","300","300","300","300"]},"The data structure  provides a synchronization technique for disparate first  and second  calendaring systems. In some embodiments, the data structure  is constructed as a meta schema  that bridges native data formats and API calls of the first  and second  calendaring systems into a normalized format for use within the composite calendaring system . In other embodiments, the data structure  is an executable software application  that bridges and normalizes data formats and API calls among the first  and second  calendaring systems and the composite calendaring system .","The API  provides interface applications between the composite calendaring system  and the data structure . Some lower level applications of the API  also make external calls to native APIs of the first  and second  calendaring systems. Thus, the API  serves to further bridge communications between the composite calendaring system  and the first  and second  calendaring systems.","API  applications is also interfaced to other higher-level applications, such as a GUI application providing an owning entity with access to the composite calendaring system . By interacting with the GUI application, the appropriate API  applications are processed within the composite calendaring system .","The API  is used for initially subscribing or selecting the first  and second  calendaring systems, which are desired to be synchronized within a composite calendar  being maintained within the composite calendaring system . Moreover, the API  is used for defining rules and actions, which are used for tracking and synchronizing selective information for the first  and second  calendaring systems. Selective information can be any calendar-related data, such as appointment information, notification information, contact information, task information, and the like.","When rules are processed from the API , the selective information is acquired from the first  and second  calendaring systems. Moreover, when actions are processed from the API , changes can be made in information maintained within the first  or second  calendaring systems.","In some embodiments, the API  also includes presenting applications that visually or audibly communicate the composite calendar  via the composite calendaring system . Presentation can be made with visual cues such as text fonts, font sizes, font effects, images, animation, or video.","Presentation can also permit audible communication, such as when the composite calendar  is represented in a data format (XML), which can be interfaced to an external text-to-voice application. In these situations a user can obtain information regarding his\/her composite calendar  by dialing into a service hosting the test-to-voice application. Furthermore, in situations where the text-to-voice application also includes voice-to-text capabilities, a user can issue commands to modify his\/her composite calendar.","One of ordinary skill in the art of this invention now fully appreciates how a composite calendaring system  is implemented to federate external calendars from disparate external calendaring systems. The system  provides better time management integration than has been conventionally available, since conventional calendaring systems do not collaborate or integrate with other disparate calendaring systems. Additionally, the composite calendaring system  communicates with the external calendaring systems via any traditional network . As a result, without the teachings of this invention, users attempt to maintain several calendars, and require multiple manual interactions with each of the calendars to stay in synch with their calendars whenever and wherever they may desire.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","400","400","400","400"]},"The data structure  includes first , second , and composite calendar entries .
