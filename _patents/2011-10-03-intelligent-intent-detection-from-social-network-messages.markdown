title: Intelligent intent detection from social network messages
abstract: An intent engine that automatically detects user intent from messages of a social network (e.g., messages with questions to ask) and outputs intent data. The engine is intelligent in that it can process natural language input such as questions and terms. The user is then directed to an answer page filtered according to the intent data and which provides answers related to a question, for example. The intent engine can be designated (e.g., tagged, or “friended”) and then linked into a specialized relationship (e.g., a “friend”). Accordingly, in one example, a URL link is constructed that points to the answer page, with filters configured based on the intent data. The URL is then sent back to the user as a friendly response. When the user selects the link, the user is presented with an answer page that provides answers which match the user intent derived from the user messages.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The of users of social networks continues to steadily increase, which provides a new source of search engine business opportunity. Tapping into the data of social networks then offers myriad possible data handling and processing capabilities to not only better serve users but also vendors. Moreover, ways in which to provide more effective search results is a continuing challenge for vendors.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some novel embodiments described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview, and it is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The disclosed architecture is an intent engine that automatically detects user intent from messages of a social network (e.g., messages with questions to ask) and outputs intent data. The engine is intelligent in that it can process natural language input such as questions and terms. The user is then directed to an answer page filtered according to the intent data and which provides answers related to a question, for example. The intent engine can be designated tagged, or \u201cfriended.\u201d, as referred to in some social networks) and then linked into a specialized relationship (e.g., a \u201cfriend\u201d). Accordingly, in one example, a URL (uniform resource locator) link is constructed that points to the answer page, with filters configured based on the intent data. The URL is then sent back to the user as a friendly response. When the user selects the link, the user is presented with an answer page that provides answers which match the user intent as derived from the user social network messages. This assists the user in finding significantly more relevant results for their questions.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of the various ways in which the principles disclosed herein can be practiced and all aspects and equivalents thereof are intended to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The disclosed architecture includes an intent engine to detect user's questions (queries) from social network messages and then sends intelligent high-quality answers back to the user. The intent engine operates as a member (social status) of the social network(s) (e.g., a \u201cfriend\u201d) which can answer user's queries.","Reference is now made to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident, however, that the novel embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof. The intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","106","110","112","111","102","116","110","108","110","118","120","112","106","101"]},"The intent component  and results component  operate to provide answers (as results ) to questions (queries) posed by the user  on the social network . The social network messages  can be used as training data for the intent component , which can be an intent engine. The intent component  improves the results  to the user  based on feedback of the user . In other words, when the user selects a result of the results , that interaction information can be monitored and fed back to improve the results generation for future queries and even the current query, should the user re-enter it for processing.","The results component  creates a results page  (e.g., a webpage) that presents the results , and the intent component  creates a link  to the results page . The link  is provided to the user  to access the results . The results  can be filtered based on the detected user intent . The intent component  analyzes the social network messages  and determines top (subset) popular domains in the messages . The intent component  processes the top domain messages to refine the results  to the user .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"A web service can be built which accepts user message input (e.g., in Twitter) or can monitor user posts (e.g., Facebook) at the backend to do domain classification and facet detection. If the service detects that the message falls into a specific domain (e.g., hotel, restaurant, movies, events, nightlife, flight, etc.), then the service calls an entity extractor to obtain detailed facet information (e.g., location, time, date, movie names, restaurant cuisine, etc), and then uses this information to construct a URL that points to the corresponding answer page, with filters set with those facet values.","The web service sends the URL back to the user as a \u201cfriend\u201d response. The user may click the URL and contribute a query share to the search engine . The user may find that the answer page gives a good answer, and then passes this experience on by sending the service link to friends. Moreover, the more that users interact with the service, the more the amount of training data that can be utilized to improve the intent engine.","Continuing with , flow begins with the user  interacting in social network conversations. The conversations (messages) are then accessed as input to intent analysis and generation, at . For example, if a user query is first detected in a \u201crestaurant\u201d domain, an entity extractor is run to find out the details of this query, such as \u201crestaurant name\u201d, \u201clocation\u201d, etc. This is efficient, since only running the restaurant entity extractor for a query classified to be a specific domain and the entity extractor can be more expensive to run than the domain classifier. In the backend, possible facets can be defined in a schema file for each domain. Given a user query, the entity extractor detects if there are any facets appearing in this query from the predefined schema, and outputs the facets and associated facet values.","Accordingly, intent analysis begins with domain classification , followed by facet detection . At , response (answer) generation is performed, and then the response (link to answers) is sent back to the user , as indicated at . Note that intent processing can occur in parallel with normal search engine processing. Thus, search engine results can also be considered for the results (e.g., answers) page of the intent engine.","Included herein is a set of flow charts representative of exemplary methodologies for performing novel aspects of the disclosed architecture. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the one or more methodologies shown herein, for example, in the form of a flow chart or flow diagram, are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance therewith, occur in a different order and\/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram.

Any aspect or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs.","Referring now to , there is illustrated a block diagram of a computing system  that executes intent processing in accordance with the disclosed architecture. However, it is appreciated that the some or all aspects of the disclosed methods and\/or systems can be implemented as a system-on-a-chip, where analog, digital, mixed signals, and other functions are fabricated on a single chip substrate. In order to provide additional context for various aspects thereof.  and the following description are intended to provide a brief, general description of the suitable computing system  in which the various aspects can be implemented. While the description above is in the general context of computer-executable instructions that can run on one or more computers, those skilled in the art will recognize that a novel embodiment also can be implemented in combination with other program modules and\/or as a combination of hardware and software.","The computing system  for implementing various aspects includes the computer  having processing unit(s) , a computer-readable storage such as a system memory , and a system bus .

A basic input\/output system (BIOS) can be stored in the non-volatile memory , and includes the basic routines that facilitate the communication of data and signals between components within the computer , such as during startup. The volatile memory  can also include a high-speed RAM such as static RAM for caching data.","The system bus  provides an interface for system components including, but not limited to, the system memory  to the processing unit(s) . The system bus  can be any of several types of bus structure that can further interconnect to a memory bus (with or without a memory controller), and a peripheral bus (e.g., PCI, PCIe, AGP, LPC, etc.), using any of a variety of commercially available bus architectures.","The computer  further includes machine readable storage subsystem(s)  and storage interface(s)  for interfacing the storage subsystem(s)  to the system bus  and other desired computer components.

All or portions of the operating system , applications , modules , and\/or data  can also be cached in memory such as the volatile memory , for example. It is to be appreciated that the disclosed architecture can be implemented with various commercially available operating systems or combinations of operating systems (e.g., as virtual machines).","The storage subsystem(s)  and memory subsystems ( and ) serve as computer readable media for volatile and non-volatile storage of data, data structures, computer-executable instructions, and so forth. Such instructions, when executed by a computer or other machine, can cause the computer or other machine to perform one or more acts of a method. The instructions to perform the acts can be stored on one medium, or could be stored across multiple media, so that the instructions appear collectively on the one or more computer-readable storage media, regardless of whether all of the instructions are on the same media.","Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by the computer  and includes volatile and Bon-volatile internal and\/or external media that is removable or non-removable. For the computer , the media accommodate the storage of data in any suitable digital format. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media can be employed such as zip drives, magnetic tape, flash memory cards, flash drives, cartridges, and the like, for storing computer executable instructions for performing the novel methods of the disclosed architecture.","A user can interact with the computer , programs, and data using external user input devices  such as a keyboard and a mouse.

LAN and WAN networking environments are commonplace in offices and companies and facilitate enterprise-wide computer networks, such as intranets, all of which may connect to a global communications network such as the Internet.","When used in a networking environment the computer  connects to the network via a wired\/wireless communication subsystem  (e.g., a network interface adapter, onboard transceiver subsystem, etc.) to communicate with wired\/wireless networks, wired\/wireless printers, wired\/wireless input devices , and so on. The computer  can include a modem or other means for establishing communications over the network. In a networked environment, programs and data relative to the computer  can be stored in the remote memory\/storage device, as is associated with a distributed system. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers can be used.","The computer  is operable to communicate with wired\/wireless devices or entities using the radio technologies such as the IEEE 802.xx family of standards, such as wireless devices operatively disposed in wireless communication (e.g., WEE 802.11 over-the-air modulation techniques) with, for example, a printer, scanner, desktop and\/or portable computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), communications satellite, any piece of equipment or location associated with a wirelessly detectable tag (e.g., a kiosk, news stand, restroom), and telephone. This includes at least WiFi\u2122 (used to certify the interoperability of wireless computer networking devices) for hotspots, WiMax, and Bluetooth\u2122 wireless technologies. Thus, the communications can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11x (a, b, g, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wire networks (which use IEEE 802.3-related media and functions).","What has been described above includes examples of the disclosed architecture. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components and\/or methodologies, but one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that many further combinations and permutations are possible.
