title: Artemisinins with improved stability and bioavailability for therapeutic drug development and application
abstract: A stable form of artemisinin wherein an artelinic acid or artesunic acid is complexed with cyclodextrin analogs, preferably, Î²-cyclodextrin. The complexed cyclodextrin artemisinin formulation shields the peroxide portion of the artemisinin backbone from hydrolytic decomposition rendering it stable in solution. Artelinic acid and cyclodextrin are placed into contact with one another to yield a 2:1 molecular species. Artesunic acid and cyclodextrin yield a 1:1 molecular species. The complexed cyclodextrin artemisinin formulation is effective for the treatment of malaria and is stable in solution for long periods of time.

Field of the Invention","A novel form of artemisinins that are complexed with cyclodextrin for solving stability problems associated with previous forms of artemisinins.","2. Brief Description of Related Art","Artelinic acid is an effective antimalarial agent when in contact with the malarial parasite. However, artelinic acid has poor stability in solution and, thus, has limited bioavailability in vivo. Artemisinins, as a class, include such analogs as artelinic acid and artesunic acid among many others. Currently, no analog of the artemisinin class of compounds exists which can remain stable in solution. Injectable formulations of artemisinin analogs, such as artelinic acid and artesunic acid, are not FDA approved due to their instability in solution. All artemisinins contain a peroxide bridge susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage. Artemisinins have been found to yield an inferior class of antimalarials due to these severe limitations in chemical stability. Artemisinins are limited to only being packaged as solids for oral dosing, as previous patents have claimed. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,326,023; 6,307,068; 6,306,896; 5,834,491; 5,677,331; 5,637,594; 5,486,535; 5,278,173; 5,270,037; 5,219,865; 5,021,426; 5,011,951.","Application of an antimalarial formulation must be specific to administration in hot, humid tropical regions native to the malarial parasite. Thus, chemical stability under drastic environmental conditions is essential. Attempts to produce a more stable form of artelinic acid have been accompanied by critical limitations. A soluble sodium salt of artelinic acid has been successfully formulated, but eventually degrades over time. This is presumably due to a reformation of the insoluble acid. Numerous attempts at preventing this precipitate have been unsuccessful.","The osmolality of the salt solution is significantly less than the predicted value indicating possible inter-molecular complexation that may be responsible for eventual precipitation over time. An amine-based buffer of artelinic acid has been successfully formulated, but yields a higher pH solution (>8.0) that induces significant vein irritation upon injection. Additional localized redness and swelling surrounding the injection site is a notable contraindication to a preferred intravenous formulation. Additionally, amine-based buffers have been observed to take on a strong yellow hue over time. The mechanism of color formation has not been deduced, but implies a modification of the artelinate formulation, which is not conducive to pharmaceutical preparations where a defined constant state of purity is essential.","U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,326,023; 6,307,068; 6,306,896; 5,834,491; 5,677,331; 5,637,594; 5,486,535; 5,278,173; 5,270,037; 5,219,865; 5,021,426; 5,011,951 are only directed to be packaged as solids for oral dosing.","Therefore, there is a need to provide a form of artemisinins that solve the stability problems associated with previous formulations.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a form of artemisinins, such as but not limited to artelinic acid and artesunic acid that solves the stability problems associated with previous formulations.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a stable form of artemisinins that is injectable.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a stable form of artemisinins that does not develop a yellow hue over time.","It is still another object of the invention to promote bioavailability and membrane permeability while decreasing the likelihood of localized inflammation at the route of entry, thus increasing its therapeutic activity.","These and other objects of the invention will become apparent upon a reading of the entire disclosure.","The present invention is directed to cyclodextrin complexed with artelinic acid or artesunic acid to form complexed cyclodextrin-artemisinin formulations in a 2:1 ratio of cyclodextrin per artelinic acid molecule or in a 1:1 ratio of cyclodextrin per artesunic acid molecule. The formulation is stable in solution, bioavailable, membrane permeable and does not cause inflammation upon injection.","The present invention is directed to a novel form of artemisinins that remain stable over time in solution. The artemisinins may be, but are not limited to artelinic acid and artesunic acid. This novel form of artemisinins uses a unique complexed form of the therapeutic agent with cyclodextrin analogs, such as but not limited to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrin analogs and their derivatives.","The present invention is directed to cyclodextrin complexed with artelinic acid in a 2:1 ratio which is a form of artemisinin that alters the electron cloud surrounding the artemisinin molecule in such a way as to stabilize this agent to promote bioavailability and membrane permeability while decreasing the likelihood of localized inflammation at the route of entry. Thus, this form of artemisinin increases its therapeutic activity. Artesunic acid was complexed with cyclodextrin, but in a unique 1:1 ratio in such a way as to stabilize the agent yield similar increases in its therapeutic activity.","The stability of the artemisinins is achieved by changing the physiocochemical properties such as but not limited to electron density, electrostatic potential and charge transfer mediated complexation.","The complexed cyclodextrin formulation of the artemisinins described deliberately shields the peroxide bridge of the artemisinin backbone from hydrolytic decomposition. Additionally, the aromatic benzoic acid portion of the artelinate molecule is also complexed with a second cyclodextrin molecule. This unique 2:1 complexation with cyclodextrin is not intuitively obvious because artelinic acid alone is unstable in aqueous solution. Simply placing cyclodextrin in solution with artelinic acid would not achieve these results, as the artelinic acid would not be in contact with the cyclodextrin to form complexation. Futher, cyclodextrin is know to form complexes with itself and thus may not be readily available in solution to interact efficiently and effectively with the artelinic acid. The inventors have placed artelinic acid and cyclodextrin into contact with one another and have complexed them in such a manner as to yield a stable 2:1 molecular species. The inventors have also placed artesunic acid and cyclodextrin into contact with one another and have complexed them in such a manner as to yield a stable 1:1 molecular species.","The present molecules are stable under ambient or physiologically relevant conditions.","Materials and Methods","\u03b2-cyclodextrin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo. Artelinic acid was alkalinized with NaOH to yield the sodium salt. Standardized PBS buffer at a pH of 7.4 was obtained from Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.","Absorption Spectroscopy Studies.","Mixtures of artelinate (10 \u03bcM) were prepared with increasing concentrations of \u03b2-cyclodextrin (0.0, 1.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 9.0 mM). Absorption spectra were collected on a Beckman DU Series 600 Spectrophotometer.","The spectra collected indicated a clear hypsochromic or blue shift in the absorption maximum at 230 nm with increasing concentrations of cyclodextrin. Hypochromic effects were also notable at 230 nm, as well as the broader transitions observed at 275 and 382 nm (FIG. ). This combined observation is consistent with inclusion interactions of the benzoic anion of artelinate with cyclodextrin.","Changes in observed isosbestic points at higher cyclodextrin concentrations indicates a complicated molecular species containing greater than a simple 1:1 molecular species (and ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"sup":"1"},"Mixtures of \u03b2-cyclodextrin (2.5 mM) and artelinic acid (1.2 mM) were prepared in PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2-3 hour to promote complexation prior to analysis.","All H NMR data was collected using a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600.02 MHz at a temperature of 25\u00b0 C. Solvent suppression was accomplished by application of the WATERGATE (WATER suppression by GrAdient Tailored Excitation) pulse sequence developed by Sklenar and co-workers. This sequence provides excellent suppression of the water resonance by a combination of rf pulses and a series of gradient pulses. The sequence combines a non-selective 90\u00b0 pulse with a symmetrical echo formed by two short gradient pulses in conjunction with a 180 selective (on water) pulse train.","The two-dimensional WATERGATE-TOCSY experiment employed a modified MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence for a total mixing time of 80 ms, including the 2.5 ms trim pulses at the beginning and the end of the spin-lock. The spectrum was collected with a spectral width of 7183.91 Hz (11.972 ppm) using 2K data points with 32 scans per 256 tincrements with a 1.5 s recycle delay. The data was processed by multiplication with a 90\u00b0 shifted sine-bell window function in each dimension, with one zero fill in the fdimension before transformation to produce matrices consisting of 512 data points in both dimensions.","The two-dimensional WATERGATE-NOESY spectra were collected with a spectral width of 7183.91 Hz (11.972 ppm) using 2K data points with 128 scans per 512 tincrements with a 1.5 s recycle delay. The data was processed by multiplication with a 90\u00b0 shifted sine-bell window function in each dimension, with one zero fill in the fdimension before transformation to produce matrices consisting of 512 data points in both dimensions. Two different experiments were conducted with mixing times of 50 and 600 ms.","The two-dimensional WATERGATE-ROESY spectrum was collected with a spectral width of 7183.91 Hz (11.972 ppm) using 2K data points with 256 scans per 512 tincrements with a 1.5 s recycle delay with a spin-lock mixing pulse of 400 ms. The data was processed by multiplication with a 90\u00b0 shifted sine-bell window function in each dimension, with one zero fill in the fdimension before transformation to produce matrices consisting of 512 data points in both dimensions.","Two-dimensional NMR methods were used to determine the degree of capping or complexation of artelinic acid by \u03b2-cyclodextrin. The 2D WATERGATE-TOSCY spectrum of artelinic acid () clearly indicates that the individual spin-spin coupling networks of a mixture of artelinic acid and \u03b2-cyclodextrin can be resolved. In , the spin-spin coupling network for \u03b2-cyclodextrin is shown at A and the spin-spin coupling network for the alkyl ring of artenilate is shown at B. The 2D-rotating frame NOE spectrum, WATERGATE-ROESY, of artelinic acid was collected at a mixing time of 400 ms and is shown in FIG. . The labeled intermolecular ROE interaction between the aromatic protons of artelinic acid with both the anomeric and ring protons of \u03b2-cyclodextrin proves that this region of artelinic acid is complexed with one molecule of \u03b2-cyclodextrin. In , A, B and C indicate the intermolecular dipolar ROE coupling between the aromatic protons of artelinate with the glucose ring protons of \u03b2-cyclodextrin. The ROE between the meta protons are more intense than those observed for the ortho protons indicating that meta protons are inserted deeper into the cavity. D and F indicate the dipolar coupling between the ortho protons of artelinate with the two benzyl protons of artelinate. E indicates the dipolar coupling between the meta protons of artelinate with the anomeric protons of \u03b2-cyclodextrin.  shows the alkyl region of this same spectrum. The labeled intermolecular ROE's between the alkyl ring protons of artelinic acid with both the anomeric and ring protons of \u03b2-cyclodextrin indicate that this region of artelinic acid is complexed with one molecule of \u03b2-cyclodextrin. These observations are similar to those reported by Nishijo (Nishijo, J.; Nagai, M.; Yasuda, M.; Ohno, E.; Ushiroda, Y. 1995, 84, 1420-1426) and by Redenti (Redenti, E.; Ventura, P.; Fronza, G.; Selva, A.; Rivara, S.; Plazzi, P. V.; Mor, M. 1999, 88, 599-607) in similar NMR \u03b2-cyclodextrin complexation studies. In , A represents a region that contains the dipolar coupling between the ring protons of \u03b2-cyclodextrin and the alkyl ring proton of artelinate; and B represents the region that contains the dipolar coupling of the anomeric protons of \u03b2-cyclodextrin with the alkyl protons of artelinate.","Two 2D WATERGATE-NOESY spectra were collected at mixing times of 50 and 600 ms (data not shown). The NOESY spectrum collected at 600 ms gave similar intermolecular and intramolecular NOE's to those observed in the ROESY spectrum, however the observed intensities were reduced. The NOESY spectrum collected at 50 ms did not exhibit the intermolecular NOE's between artenilate and \u03b2-cyclodextrin. This observation is consistent with what one would expect due to the fact that intermolecular NOE's require a longer mixing time to develop as compared to intramolecular NOE's.","The 2D ROESY and NOESY data clearly indicate that both the alkyl and aromatic regions of artelinic acid are complexed with one individual molecule of \u03b2-cyclodextrin.","In , the spectrum of artesunate with an excess of \u03b2-cyclodextrin in PBS is shown. This data clearly indicates that the artesunate is capped by \u03b2-cyclodextrin in a 1:1 ratio. The region that is represented by A contains the intramolecular dipolar coupling the alkyl ring proton of artesunate. The region that is represented by B contains the intermolecular dipolar coupling the alkyl ring proton of artesunate with the ring protons of \u03b2-cyclodextrin. The region that is represented by C contains the intermolecular dipolar coupling the alkyl ring proton of artesunate with the anomeric protons of \u03b2-cyclodextrin. The region that is represented by D contains additional intramolecular dipolar coupling the alkyl ring proton of artesunate. The region that is represented by E contains the intramolecular dipolar coupling of the \u03b2-cyclodextrin.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"i":["a ","b ","J.

Further, the benzoic acid moiety of artelinic acid coordinates deeply into the cyclodextrin pocket yielding significant changes in chemical shift for the 3-H, 5-H, and 6-H protons. In contrast, artesunic acid, which only binds to one cyclodextrin at the peroxide bridge, produced chemical shift changes of a lower magnitude indicating a more shallow binding interaction.

Thus, these types of profiles can provide an estimate of electronic distribution surrounding the molecule so as to enable qualitative assessment of any possible interaction with an approaching molecule. However, conformation search calculations using the \u201csystematic search\u201d technique via the single-point PM3 method of SPARTAN were used to generate different conformers for each of the molecules.

Test compounds were initially dissolved in DMSO and diluted 400-fold in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 32 mM HaHCO, and 10% Albumax I (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, N.Y.). These solutions were subsequently serially diluted 2-fold with a Biomek 1000 (Beckman, Fullerton, Calif.) over 11 different concentrations. The parasites were exposed to serial dilutions of each compound for 48 h and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% O, 5% CO, and 90% Nprior to the addition of [H]hypoxanthine. After a further incubation of 18 h, parasite DNA was harvested from each microtiter well using Packard Filtermate 196 Harvester (Meriden, Conn.) onto glass filters. Uptake of [H]hypoxanthine was measured with a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Concentration-response data were analyzed by a nonlinear regression logistic dose-response model, and the ICvalues (50% inhibitory concentrations) for each compound were determined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 28","sub":"50 "},"Advantages","The complexed cyclodextrin-artemisinins formulation does not precipitate or degrade over time. Formulations of artemisinins and cyclodextrin have been observed to remain completely soluble for up to seven weeks at elevated physiological temperatures (40 degrees C.) without any degradation and up to 6 months at room temperature. The complexed cyclodextrin formulation of the artemisinins does not change color over time. Formulations of artemisinins and cyclodextrin have been observed to remain colorless for several weeks at elevated physiological temperatures of 40 degrees C.","Measure 2 moles of cyclodextrin and pre-dissolve in buffer, deionized water, or saline. Sonicate the mixture to completely dissolve the cyclodextrin. Add 1 mole equivalent of artelinic acid and sonicate. Incubate at 40\u00b0 C. for 2-3 hours. Higher concentrations of artelinic acid require longer incubation times, such as overnight, to promote complexation.","Measure 1 mole of cyclodextrin and pre-dissolve in buffer, deionized water, or saline.
