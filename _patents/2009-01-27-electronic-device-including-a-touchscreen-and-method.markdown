{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to input mechanisms for handheld electronic devices and, more particularly to a handheld electronic device having a touchscreen and a method of using a touchscreen of a handheld electronic device.","Touchscreens are sometimes used in personal data assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, digital cameras, video recorders and other types of handheld electronic devices. Touchscreens may be implemented using one of many different touchscreen technologies including, but not limited to, resistive, capacitive, infrared and surface acoustic wave (SAW) touchscreen technology. Depending on the type of touchscreen technology which is implemented, a touch input may be activated by a finger, stylus or both. A stylus can be cumbersome to use, particularly when using only one hand. Accordingly, users often prefer to use their fingers to interact with a touchscreen device, particularly with capacitive touchscreen where the conductive touch of a finger or a conductively tipped stylus is used to generate a touch input on the touchscreen.","Touchscreens on handheld electronic devices may provide an intuitive user interface, however incorporating touchscreens into handheld electronic devices also poses challenges. One problem is the small amount of space on the touchscreen which is available to display information for user selection, particularly when using a finger to make selections on the touchscreen. The graphical user interfaces provided by applications and functions on handheld electronic devices often feature small interactive user interface elements (such as small icons, virtual keys of virtual keyboard, menu list elements and text) which may be difficult to select with a fingertip. In addition, interactive user interface elements are often situated in close proximity to each other making it difficult to detect the desired input selection.","Thus, there remains a need for improved input mechanisms for handheld electronic devices, and in particular an improved handheld electronic device having a touchscreen and an improved method of using a touchscreen of a handheld electronic device.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","The embodiments described herein generally relate to portable electronic devices. Examples of portable electronic devices include mobile (wireless) communication devices such as pagers, cellular phones, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation devices and other satellite navigation devices, smartphones, wireless organizers or personal digital assistants (PDA) and wireless-enabled notebook computers. At least some of these portable electronic devices may be handheld electronic devices. The portable electronic device may be a handheld electronic device without wireless communication capabilities such as a PDA, electronic gaming device, digital photograph album or picture frame, digital camera, or digital video recorder such as a camcorder. The portable electronic device comprises a touchscreen display and may comprise a mechanical keyboard in addition to the touchscreen display. These examples are intended to be non-limiting.","Referring first to , the concept of a touch offset will be briefly described. When selecting interactive user interface elements on a touchscreen of a handheld electronic device, whether using a finger, stylus or other input device, users have a tendency to press below the target area to avoid covering the target item (i.e., the target area). The area of a device user's fingertip which makes contact with the touchscreen is referred to as the finger contact area. As shown in , the centroid of the finger contact area below the centroid of the target menu item (the menu bar) in the menu user interface. While not intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that users touch below the contact area to avoid covering or occluding the user interface element or item they want to touch. Similarly, as shown in , the centroid of the finger contact area is below the centroid of the target icon in the icon menu user interface of , and the centroid of the finger contact area is below the centroid of the target item in the displayed list of . When a contact or writing device such as a stylus is used to interact with the touchscreen rather than the device user's fingertip, similar behaviour of touching the touchscreen below the target is also seen.","The present disclosure provides a method and touchscreen-based handheld electronic device which compensates for the difference in position between the target area and the area of the touchscreen touched by the device user (the contact area) to improve touch input accuracy of the graphical user interface (GUI) of touchscreen based handheld electronic devices. A touch offset is used to adjust the location of the external (e.g. touch) measured by the touchscreen display to compensate for the difference in position between the target area and the actual contact area. To compensate for the changing orientation of the handheld electronic device, its orientation is detected continuously or at regular intervals and the touch offset is dynamically selected based on the device orientation detected at that time.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of input using a touchscreen display of a handheld electronic device, the method comprising: displaying a graphical user interface (GUI) on the touchscreen display, the graphical user interface comprising a plurality of selectable user interface elements, each having an area of the touchscreen display associated herewith and each generating a respective input signal in response to selection thereof; detecting a touch input on the touchscreen display having a touch point; determining an orientation of the handheld electronic device; determining a touch offset in accordance with the orientation of the handheld electronic device; determining an adjusted touch point on the touch-sensitive input surface in accordance with the touch point and the touch offset; and generating an input signal associated with a respective user interface element displayed at the adjusted touch point when the adjusted touch point is associated with one of the plurality of selectable user interface elements in the graphical user interface","In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a handheld electronic device, comprising: a controller for controlling the operation of the device; a touchscreen display connected to the controller; and a position detection subsystem comprising a positional sensor connected to the controller which generates positional signals; the controller being configured to: (i) display a graphical user interface (GUI) on the touchscreen display, the graphical user interface comprising a plurality of selectable user interface elements, each having an area of the touchscreen display associated herewith and each generating a respective input signal in response to selection thereof; (ii) detect a touch input on the touchscreen display having a touch point; (iii) determine an orientation of the handheld electronic device; (iv) determine a touch offset in accordance with the orientation of the handheld electronic device; (v) determine an adjusted touch point on the touch-sensitive input surface in accordance with the touch point and the touch offset; and (vi) generate an input signal associated with a respective user interface element displayed at the adjusted touch point when the adjusted touch point is associated with one of the plurality of selectable user interface elements in the graphical user interface.","In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium having stored thereon computer program instructions for implementing a method on a handheld electronic device for controlling its operation, the computer executable instructions comprising instructions for performing the method(s) set forth herein.","Reference is now made to  which illustrate a mobile communication device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile communication device  is a two-way communication device having at least data and possibly also voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile communication device , in various embodiments the device may be a data communication device, a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a smartphone, a mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile communication device  includes a controller comprising at least one processor  such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the mobile communication device , and a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network . The processor  interacts with the communication subsystem  which performs communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display (screen)  defining a viewing area, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, with a touch-sensitive input surface or overlay  connected to an electronic controller  that together make up a touchscreen display . The touch-sensitive input surface\/overlay  may comprise a protective lens or transparent protective material. The touch-sensitive overlay  and the electronic controller  provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay  via the electronic controller .","The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , control keys , switch , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter, as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile communication device  is intended to operate.","The mobile communication device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  comprise operating system software , software applications  comprising a user interface module , a touch point adjustment module  and a virtual keyboard module . The user interface module  renders and displays the GUI of the device  in accordance with instructions of the operating system  and applications  (as applicable). The touch point adjustment module  adjusts the touch point of the touchscreen display . The virtual keyboard module  implements a virtual keyboard on the touchscreen display .","The modules ,  and  may, among other things, each be implemented through stand-alone software applications, or combined together in one or more of the operating system  and applications . In some example embodiments, the functions performed by each of the above identified modules , ,  may each be realized as a plurality of independent elements, rather than a single integrated element, and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The software applications  may include a range of applications, including, for example, an address book application, a messaging application, a calendar application, and\/or a notepad application. In some embodiments, the software applications  include an email message application, a push content viewing application, a voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, a map application, and a media player application. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display device ) according to the application.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a navigational tool such as a clickable\/depressible trackball or thumbwheel, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device  such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  also includes a removable memory card  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile communication device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile communication device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile communication device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile communication device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile communication device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The serial data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The serial data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile communication device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile communication device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the mobile communication device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The mobile communication device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile communication device .","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem  other wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .","The mobile communication device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email message application and output to the display . A user of the mobile communication device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the touch-sensitive overlay  in conjunction with the display device  and possibly the control buttons  and\/or the auxiliary I\/O subsystems . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile communication device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display device  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","Referring now to , the construction of the device  will be described in more detail. The device  includes a rigid case  for housing the components of the device  that is configured to be held or cradleable in a user's hand while the device  is in use. The touchscreen display  is mounted within a front face  of the case  so that the case  frames the touchscreen display  and exposes it for user-interaction therewith. The case  has opposed top and bottom ends designated by references ,  respectively, and left and right sides designated by references ,  respectively which extend transverse to the top and bottom ends , . In the shown embodiments of , the case  (and device ) is elongate having a length defined between the top and bottom ends ,  longer than a width defined between the left and right sides , . Other device dimensions are also possible.","As further illustrated in , the case  includes a back , a frame  which frames the touch-sensitive display , sidewalls  that extend between and generally perpendicular to the back  and the frame , and a base  that is spaced from and generally parallel to the back . The base  can be any suitable base and can include, for example, a printed circuit board or flex circuit board (not shown). The back  includes a plate (not shown) that is releasably attached for insertion and removal of, for example, the battery  and the memory module  described above. It will be appreciated that the back , the sidewalls  and the frame  can be injection molded, for example.","The display device  and the overlay  can be supported on a support tray  of suitable material such as magnesium for providing mechanical support to the display device  and overlay . The display device  and overlay  are biased away from the base , toward the frame  by biasing elements  such as gel pads between the support tray  and the base . Compliant spacers  which, for example, can also be in the form of gel pads are located between an upper portion of the support tray  and the frame . The touchscreen display  is moveable within the case  as the touchscreen display  can be moved toward the base , thereby compressing the biasing elements . The touchscreen display  can also be pivoted within the case  with one side of the touchscreen display  moving toward the base , thereby compressing the biasing elements  on the same side of the touchscreen display  that moves toward the base .","In the example embodiment, the switch  is supported on one side of the base  which can be a printed circuit board while the opposing side provides mechanical support and electrical connection for other components (not shown) of the device . The switch  can be located between the base  and the support tray . The switch , which can be a mechanical dome-type switch (or in other example embodiments a plurality of mechanical dome-type switches), for example, can be located in any suitable position such that displacement of the touchscreen display  resulting from a user pressing the touchscreen display  with sufficient force to overcome the bias and to overcome the actuation force for the switch , depresses and actuates the switch . In the present example embodiment the switch  is in contact with the support tray . Thus, depression of the touchscreen display  by application of a force thereto, causes actuation of the switch , thereby providing the user with a positive tactile quality during user interaction with the user interface of the . The switch  is not actuated in the rest position shown in , absent applied force by the user. It will be appreciated that the switch  can be actuated by pressing anywhere on the touchscreen display  to cause movement of the touchscreen display  in the form of movement parallel with the base  or pivoting of one side of the touchscreen display  toward the base . The switch  is connected to the processor  and can be used for further input to the processor when actuated. Although a single switch is shown any suitable number of switches can be used. In other embodiments, the switch  may be omitted.","The touchscreen display  can be any suitable touchscreen display such as a capacitive touchscreen display. A capacitive touchscreen display  includes the display device  and the touch-sensitive overlay , in the form of a capacitive touch-sensitive overlay . It will be appreciated that the capacitive touch-sensitive overlay  includes a number of layers in a stack and is fixed to the display device  via a suitable optically clear adhesive. The layers can include, for example a substrate fixed to the display device  (e.g. LCD display) by a suitable adhesive, a ground shield layer, a barrier layer, a pair of capacitive touch sensor layers separated by a substrate or other barrier layer, and a cover layer fixed to the second capacitive touch sensor layer by a suitable adhesive. The capacitive touch sensor layers can be any suitable material such as patterned indium tin oxide (ITO).","Each of the touch sensor layers comprises an electrode layer each having a number of spaced apart transparent electrodes. The electrodes may be a patterned vapour-deposited ITO layer or ITO elements. The electrodes may be, for example, arranged in an array of spaced apart rows and columns. As shown in , the touch sensor layers\/electrode layers are each associated with a coordinate (e.g., x or y) in a coordinate system used to map locations on the touchscreen display , for example, in Cartesian coordinates (e.g., x and y-axis coordinates). The intersection of the rows and columns of the electrodes may represent pixel elements defined in terms of an (x, y) location value which can form the basis for the coordinate system. Each of the touch sensor layers provide a signal to the controller  which represent the respective x and y coordinates of the touchscreen display . That is, x locations are provided by a signal generated by one of the touch sensor layers and y locations are provided by a signal generated by the other of the touch sensor layers.","The electrodes in the touch sensor layers\/electrode layers respond to changes in the electric field caused by conductive objects in the proximity of the electrodes. When a conductive object is near or contacts the touch-sensitive overlay , the object draws away some of the charge of the electrodes and reduces its capacitance. The controller  receives signals from the touch sensor layers of the touch-sensitive overlay , detects touch inputs by determining changes in capacitance which exceed a predetermined threshold, and determines the centroid of a contact area defined by electrodes having a change in capacitance which exceeds the predetermined threshold, typically in x, y (Cartesian) coordinates.","The controller  sends the centroid of the contact area to the processor  of the device  as the location of the touch input detected by the touchscreen display . Depending on the touch-sensitive overlay  and\/or configuration of the touchscreen display , the change in capacitance which results from the presence of a conductive object near the touch-sensitive overlay  but not contact the touch-sensitive overlay , may exceed the predetermined threshold in which case the corresponding electrode would be included in the contact area. The detection of the presence of a conductive object such as a user's finger or a conductive stylus is sometimes referred to as finger presence\/stylus presence.","It will be appreciated that other attributes of a touch input on the touchscreen display  can be determined. For example, the size and the shape (or profile) of the touch input on the touchscreen display  can be determined in addition to the location based on the signals received at the controller  from the touch sensor layers. For example, the touchscreen display  may be used to create a pixel image of the contact area created by a touch input. The pixel image is defined by the pixel elements represented by the intersection of electrodes in the touch sensor layers\/electrode layers. The pixel image may be used, for example, to determine a shape or profile of the contact area.","The centroid of the contact area is calculated by the controller  based on raw location and magnitude (e.g., capacitance) data obtained from the contact area. The centroid is defined in Cartesian coordinates by the value (X, Y). The centroid of the contact area is the weighted averaged of the pixels in the contact area and represents the central coordinate of the contact area. By way of example, the centroid may be found using the following equations:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["X","c"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["Z","i"]},{"mi":["x","i"]}],"mo":"*"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["Z","i"]}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Y","c"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["Z","i"]},{"mi":["y","i"]}],"mo":"*"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["Z","i"]}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}]}}},"br":{},"sub":["c ","c "]},"The controller  of the touchscreen display  is typically connected using both interpret and serial interface ports to the processor . In this way, an interrupt signal which indicates a touch input has been detected, the centroid of the contact area, as well as raw data regarding the location and magnitude of the activated electrodes in the contact area are passed to the processor . However, in other example embodiments only an interrupt signal which indicates a touch input has been detected and the centroid of the contact area are passed to the processor . In embodiments where the raw data is passed to the processor , the detection of a touch input and\/or the determination of the centroid of the contact area may be performed by the processor  of the device  rather than the controller  of the touchscreen display .","In other embodiments, the touchscreen display  may be a display device, such as an LCD screen, having the touch-sensitive input surface (overlay)  integrated therein. One example of such a touchscreen is described in commonly owned U.S. patent publication no. 2004\/0155991, published Aug. 12, 2004 (also identified as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/717,877, filed Nov. 20, 2003) which is incorporated herein by reference.","While a specific embodiment of the touchscreen display  has been described, any suitable type of touchscreen in the handheld electronic device of the present disclosure including, but not limited to, a capacitive touchscreen, a resistive touchscreen, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) touchscreen, an embedded photo cell touchscreen, an infrared (IR) touchscreen, a strain gauge-based touchscreen, an optical imaging touchscreen, a dispersive signal technology touchscreen, an acoustic pulse recognition touchscreen or a frustrated total internal reflection touchscreen. The type of touchscreen technology used in any given embodiment will depend on the handheld electronic device and its particular application and demands.","Referring again to , a Cartesian (two dimensional) coordinate system used to map locations of the touchscreen display  in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. The touchscreen display  defines a Cartesian coordinate system defined by x and y-axes in the input plane of the touchscreen display . Each touch input on the touchscreen display  returns a touch point defined in terms of an (x, y) value. The returned touch point is typically the centroid of the contact area.","In the shown embodiment, the touchscreen display  has a rectangular touch-sensitive overlay ; however, in other embodiments, the touch-sensitive overlay  could have a different shape such as a square shape. The rectangular touch-sensitive overlay  results in a screen which is divided into a rectangular of pixels with positional values ranging from 0 to the maximum in each of the x and y-axes (x max. and y max. respectively). The x-axis extends in the same direction as the width of the device  and the touch-sensitive overlay . The y-axis extends in the same direction as the length of the device  and the touch-sensitive overlay . In the shown embodiment, the touchscreen  has a square shaped touch-sensitive input surface  and an 8-bit resolution which results in a screen which is divided into a 256\u00d7256 pixel square with positional values ranging from 0 to 255 in each of the x and y-axes. However, it will be appreciated that in other embodiments a resolution greater than or less than 8-bits could be used.","The coordinate system has an origin (0, 0) which is located at the top left-hand side of the touchscreen display . For purposes of convenience, the origin (0, 0) of the Cartesian coordinate system is located at this position in all of the embodiments described in the present disclosure. However, it will be appreciated that in other embodiments the origin (0, 0) could be located elsewhere such as at the bottom left-hand side of the touchscreen display , the top right-hand side of the touchscreen display , or the bottom right-hand side of the touchscreen display . The location of the origin (0, 0) could be configurable in other embodiments.","During operation, a graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling the operation of the device  is displaying on the touchscreen display . The GUI is rendered prior to display by the operating system  or an application  which causes the processor  to display content on the touchscreen display . The GUI of the device  has a screen orientation in which the text and user interface elements of the GUI are oriented for normal viewing. It will be appreciated that the screen orientation for normal viewing independent of the language supported, that is the screen orientation for normal viewing is the same regardless of whether a row-oriented language or column-oriented language (such as Asian languages) is displayed within the GUI. Direction references in relation to the GUI, such as top, bottom, left, and right, are relative to the current screen orientation of the GUI rather than the device  or its case .","In embodiments in which the display screen is rectangular in shape, such as that shown in , the screen orientation is either portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal). A portrait screen orientation is a screen orientation in which the text and other user interface elements extend in a direction transverse (typically perpendicular) to the length (y-axis) of the display screen. A landscape screen orientation is a screen orientation in which the text and other user interface elements extend in a direction transverse (typically perpendicular) to the width (x-axis) of the display screen. In some embodiments, the GUI of the device  may change its screen orientation between a portrait screen orientation and landscape screen orientation in accordance with changes in device orientation, depending on the settings and\/or operational mode of the device . In other embodiments, the screen orientation of the device  may be fixed. In yet other embodiments in which the display screen is relatively square in shape, the screen orientation changes based on device orientation so that is oriented for normal viewing the user, however, the aspect ratio does not change since the dimensions of the screen are substantially symmetrical.","The mobile communication device  also comprises a device orientation subsystem  comprising at least one sensor which is connected to the processor  and which is controlled by one or a combination of a monitoring circuit and operating software. The sensor detects the orientation of the device  or information from which the orientation of the device  can be determined, such as acceleration. In some embodiments, the sensor is a three-axis accelerometer. In other embodiments, an orientation sensor other than an accelerometer could be used such as a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a tilt sensor, an electronic compass or other suitable sensor, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the device orientation subsystem  may comprise two or more sensors such as an accelerometer and an electronic compass.","As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, an accelerometer is a sensor which converts acceleration from motion (e.g. movement of the mobile communication device  or a portion thereof due to the strike force) and gravity which are detected by a sensing element into an electrical signal (producing a corresponding change in output) and is available in one, two or three axis configurations. Accelerometers may produce digital or analog output signals depending on the type of accelerometer. Generally, two types of outputs are available depending on whether an analog or digital accelerometer used: (1) an analog output requiring buffering and analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion; and (2) a digital output which is typically available in an industry standard interface such as an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) or I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface. The output of an accelerometer is typically measured in terms of the gravitational acceleration constant at the Earth's surface, denoted g, which is approximately 9.81 m\/s(32.2 ft\/s) as the standard average. The accelerometer may be of almost any type including, but not limited to, a capacitive, piezoelectric, piezoresistive, or gas-based accelerometer. The range of accelerometers vary up to the thousands of g's, however for portable electronic devices \u201clow-g\u201d accelerometers may be used. Example low-g accelerometers which may be used are MEMS digital accelerometers from Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (Freescale) and STMicroelectronics N.V. of Geneva, Switzerland.","Referring briefly to , a device orientation subsystem  in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. The circuit  comprises a digital 3-axis accelerometer  connected to the interrupt and serial interface of a controller (MCU) . The controller  could be the processor  of the device . The operation of the controller  is controlled by software, which may be stored in internal memory of the controller . The operational settings of the accelerometer  are controlled by the controller  using control signals sent from the controller  to the accelerometer  via the serial interface. The controller  may determine the device orientation in accordance with the acceleration measured by the accelerometer , or raw acceleration data measured by the accelerometer  may be sent to the processor  of the device  via its serial interface where device orientation is determined by the operating system , or other software module . In other embodiments, a different digital accelerometer configuration could be used, or a suitable analog accelerometer and control circuit could be used.","Referring now to , the assignment of pitch and roll vectors of a three-axis accelerometer in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will be briefly described. Each measurement axis is aligned with an axis of the mobile communication device . The x-axis and y-axis are typically aligned with the input plane of the touchscreen display . The z-axis is perpendicular to the horizontal plane and detects when the mobile communication device  is moved vertically.","As shown in , pitch (\u03c6) is the angle of the x-axis relative to the ground. \u03b8 is the angle of the z-axis relative to gravity. As shown in , roll (\u03c1) is the angle of the y-axis relative to the ground. It will be appreciated that rotation may occur about any combination of sensing axes. The concepts and methodology described herein can be applied to any axis orientation and any combination of pitch (\u03c6) angle, roll (\u03c1) angle and \u03b8 (the angle of the z-axis relative to gravity).

Moreover, it will be appreciated that the device  need not be orientated precisely in one the illustrated device orientations for the determination of the device orientation. Instead, the predefined device orientations act as reference positions. The device orientation is determined by selecting the reference position (e.g., which of the six predefined device orientations shown in ) is closest to the actual device orientation. Each of the predefined device orientations may be mapped to orientation values measured by the orientation sensor or derived from its measurements in order to determine the reference position which is closest to the actual device orientation. The orientation values may be used to construct an orientation profile of each of the six predefined device orientations. The orientation values which are mapped to the predefined device orientations, in some embodiments, may be defined, directly or indirectly, in terms of pitch (\u03c6), roll (\u03c1) and the angle of the z-axis relative to gravity (\u03b8) measured by a three-axis accelerometer, which may calculated using equations (3), (4) and (5) described above.","In some embodiments in which the touchscreen display  is rectangular in shape, the processor , in some operational modes, may change the screen orientation of the GUI to a landscape screen orientation when the mobile communication device  is (re)positioned in a generally horizontal direction in accordance with the instructions of the user interface module , and may change the screen orientation of the GUI to a portrait screen orientation when the mobile communication device  is (re)positioned in a generally vertical direction in accordance with the instructions of the user interface module .

The values of the offsets x, x, y and y are typically the same but may be different. Typical user bias (the tendency to press below or above the target item or area) has been determined to be approximately 2 to 3 mm so the value of the touch offsets x, x, y and y is typically 2 to 3 mm; however it is contemplated that offset values greater than or less than 2 to 3 mm could be used. The rules defined in Table 1 have the advantage that the touch point will always be offset in the proper direction by the same amount to correct for user bias regardless of the device orientation.","It is also contemplated that the direction of the touch offset could be switched in some embodiments. Accordingly the touch offset in some embodiments could be (0, \u2212y), (\u2212x, 0), (0, y), and (x, 0) in the first, second, third and fourth reference positions, respectively. Although device users typically press below the target item, there may be some device users having a user bias which causes them to press above the target item or area. The ability to switch the direction of the touch offset may be advantageous in instances where the device user consistently presses above the target item regardless of the device orientation.","It is also conceivable that user bias may be different in both quantity (i.e. where the amount by which the device user presses below or above the target item) and direction depending on device orientation. Accordingly, the values of the touch offsets x, x, y and y values may be different in some embodiments. In addition, the direction of the touch offset may be different than the two alternatives provided above. The use of variable touch offset values and directions may be advantageous for device users having an inconsistent user bias.","Because user bias may vary between device users, the touch offset rules and settings may be configurable by the device user. User settings for the touch offset value and\/or direction in the reference positions may be provided in some embodiments. In addition to or instead of user settings, in some embodiments a calibration mode may be provided by the device  which determines the required direction and value of the touch offset in the various reference positions for a particular device user in accordance with determined user bias. Calibration may be performed using a teaching mode of device  in which the user actively calibrates the touch offset in accordance with the user's input style and patterns, or a passive machine learning mode which monitors the device user's touch inputs in the background over a predetermined period of time during normal use of the device . This functionality is provided by a calibration module (not shown) stored in the memory of the device .","As noted above, the device  will rarely be orientated precisely at one of the six predetermined device orientations. To account for the multitude of possible device orientations, the predetermined device orientations closest to actual device orientation is used to determine the device orientation. Next, the device orientation is compared to the four reference positions to determine if the device  is in one of the four reference position. If the device  is in one of the four reference position, the touch offset may be selected in accordance with the reference position\/device orientation. If the device  is not in one of the reference position, it is in either the \u201cfront up\u201d or \u201cback up\u201d device orientations and a suitable touch offset cannot be determined. Accordingly, a previous touch offset or default touch offset is used. The touch point is then adjusted in accordance with selected touch offset.","The association between the reference positions and the predetermined device orientations, and the association between predetermined device orientations and plurality of possible device orientations may be stored in memory  as a table or mathematical formulae which describe the relationship between reference positions and the predetermined device orientations, and the association between predetermined device orientations and plurality of possible device orientations.","In other embodiments, rather than determining the device orientation in response to detection of a touch input, the device orientation may be determined continuously or a regular intervals, for example, for use in other device applications such as, for example, dynamic changing the screen orientation. In such cases, the device orientation may be fetched from the memory  shared with the other device applications. In some embodiments, the touch offset may be determined with the device orientation and stored in memory of the device , rather than being determined in response to detection of a touch input.","In other embodiments, an orientation log of the orientation\/positional data received from the positional signals received by the position detection subsystem  may be maintained by the device , for example, by the touch point adjustment module  or user interface module . The orientation log stores device orientation data over a predetermined period of time, such as 1 to 5 seconds, for example. To prevent spurious changes in device orientation, the device  may need to be held relatively stable\/constant within the range of device orientations associated with one of the six predefined device orientations for a change in device orientations to be recognized by the device . In some embodiments, the processor  may be configured to recognize patterns in a recent history of the orientation log such as, for example a 1 or 2 second duration or less, and to identify patterns in the recent log history which correspond to a change in the device orientation. Recognition of patterns in the log may be performed according to artificial intelligence techniques, fuzzy logic or other approaches known in the art.","Reference is now made to  which illustrates example operations  for touch point adjustment in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. The operations  are used in combination with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented by the user interface module . The GUI comprises a plurality of selectable user interface elements each having a portion of the viewing area of the touchscreen  associated herewith, and each generating a respective input signal in response to selection thereof. The user interface elements may be virtual keys or buttons of a virtual keyboard  or icons  of an icon selection menu , for example.","The operations  are carried out by the processor  of the device  under the instruction of the touch point adjustment module . The touch point adjustment module  may be part of the operating system  and\/or user interface module . To improve processing efficiency, the touch point adjustment module  is typically not part of an application , however, the active application  (also referred to as the foreground application ) may affect whether a (dynamic) touch offset is used","The touch point adjustment module  configures the processor  to monitor for and detect the occurrence of a touch input, to monitor for and detect the occurrence positional signals (or motion signals) from the position detection subsystem , and to use this information to dynamically select a touch offset and adjust the touch point detected by the touchscreen  in accordance with the selected touch offset.","In the first step , the processor  monitors for and detects touch inputs on the touchscreen  This may involve monitoring for and detecting touch input signals received from the touchscreen . Touch input signals are generated by the touchscreen  in response to the touchscreen  detecting a touch input such as a touch or press.","It will be appreciated that the displayed GUI may comprise one or more \u201cdead spots\u201d which are not associated with any selectable user interface element. To accommodate dead spots, in some embodiments the user interface module  may filter out touch inputs which do not correspond to a selectable user interface element and do not return such inputs to the operating system  or active application . This prevents a touch input from being recognized by the operating system  and\/or active application , and therefore the touch point adjustment operations described herein are not performed on such inputs.","Touch input signals are transmitted from the touchscreen  to the processor  of the device . The touch input signals comprise information which specifies the location of the touch input (i.e., the touch point) on the touchscreen . The touch input signals may comprise an interrupt signal on an interrupt port connecting the touchscreen  and the processor  which notifies the processor  that a touch input has been detected, and a data signal from a data port connecting the touchscreen  and the processor , such as a serial data port, which provides the processor  with at least location information concerning the touch input. The location information may be the touch point, for example, the centroid of the contact area, or raw data defining which define the contact area which is provided by the controller of the touchscreen . Alternatively, in other embodiments the processor  may determine the touch point from touch input signals comprises raw data passed from the controller of the touchscreen  to the processor , for example, as the centroid of the contact area defined by the raw data.","Next, in step  the processor  determines the device orientation from positional signals (or motion signals) received from the position detection subsystem , for example, using the tilt equations previously described. The determined device orientation may be stored in memory . The positional signals are generated by the sensor of the position detection subsystem . In at least some embodiments, the sensor is a three-axis accelerometer. The processor  may determine the device orientation in response to detection of the touch input, for example upon receiving an interrupt signal from the touchscreen . Alternatively, in other embodiments the processor  may determine the device orientation continuously or at regular intervals. The device orientation may be determined, for example, for other purposes such as determining the screen orientation for the GUI. In such cases, the processor  monitors for and detects positional signals received from the position detection subsystem  either continuously or at regular intervals. In yet other embodiments, the positional signal may comprise information which specifies the device orientation of the device , for example, if the sensor of the position detection subsystem  is a tilt sensor, gyroscope, or other positional sensor. In at some embodiments, the device orientation is determined to be in one of the predetermined six (6) device orientations described above.","Next, in step  the processor  determines whether the touch point is subject to touch point adjustment. This step is optional. In other embodiments, a touch offset may be determined for all touch inputs. In some embodiments, step  comprises determining the active application , operational mode of the device  (e.g., active telephone call) or the current user interface screen of the GUI which is displayed on the touchscreen . The active application , operational mode of the device , or the current user interface screen of the GUI is then compared to one or more predefined rules which define when touch point adjustment is to be performed. In other embodiments, the determination as to whether touch point adjustment is to be performed is made when the active application  is launched, the operational mode of the device  is started, or the current user interface screen of the GUI is displayed. The operations  are then disabled or enabled accordingly.","If the criteria used to determine whether touch point adjustment is to be performed is the user interface screen of the GUI, the rule may be based on the size of the selectable user interface elements in the GUI. For example, some user interface screens comprise relatively large selectable user interface elements for which touch point adjustment may not be necessary. For example, the icons  of the icon menu selection  may be sufficiently large for many users that touch point adjust may not be of assistance. In contrast, the virtual keys  of the virtual keyboard  are relatively small selectable user interface elements which may be sufficient small for many users that touch point adjustment may be of assistance. Thus, in some embodiments when the current user interface screen of the GUI comprises large UI elements it is not subject to touch point adjustment, and when the current user interface screen of the GUI comprises small UI elements it is subject to touch point adjustment.","A determination as to whether the user interface screen of the GUI is subject to touch point adjustment may be based on a predetermined value or setting associated with the various user interface screen of the GUI which, for example, may be stored in memory  of the device . In such embodiments, the device  need only determine the current user interface screen and the value or setting associated with the current user interface screen to determine whether to apply touch point adjustment. Alternatively, the determination may be made in real-time based on graphics information maintained by graphics rendering software, which may be part of the operating system software  or a separate application . The graphics information is stored in local memory, typically volatile memory such as RAM .","In other embodiments, determining whether the touch point is subject to touch point adjustment comprises identifying the user interface element located at the unadjusted touch point determined in step , and using the size of the user interface element obtained from graphics information maintained by the device  to determine whether to adjust the touch point. The determination is made by comparing the size of the user interface element to a predetermined size threshold. The size is defined by the area of the viewing area of the touchscreen  which is associated with the respective user interface element. It will be appreciated that the area associated with the user interface element may not be the same as the displayed area of the user interface element. Typically, the area defined by the user interface element will be slightly larger than the displayed text and\/or graphics of the respective user interface element.","When the size of the user interface element is greater than or equal to the predetermined size threshold, the touch point is not subject to touch point adjustment. This is because at this size the user interface element is likely not small enough for occlusion to be an issue. When the size of the user interface element is less than the predetermined size threshold, the touch point is subject to touch point adjustment. This is because at this size the user interface element is likely small enough for occlusion to be an issue.","In some embodiments, the predetermined size threshold is 10 mm in either displayed height or width, or an equivalent diameter of 10 mm. In other embodiments, the predetermined size threshold may be 10 mm\u00d710 mm in either displayed height or width. The above-described thresholds approximate the size of the average user fingertip. In this way, onscreen items larger than a fingertip will not be offset, allowing smaller touch items and bigger touch items to be handled more efficiently by the processor  and more accurately based on the user's intended target. In other embodiments, other predetermined size thresholds may be used. To further improve touch point adjustment, the predetermined size threshold may be configurable or calibrated to suit a particular device user.","When the active application , operational mode of the device , or the current user interface screen of the GUI matches a predefined rule for performing touch point adjustment, the touch point will be adjusted and processing proceeds to step . When the active application , operational mode of the device , or the current user interface screen of the GUI does not match a predefined rule for performing touch point adjustment, the touch point will not be adjusted and processing proceeds to step .","In step , the processor  determines the touch offset in accordance with the device orientation and possibly also the touch point. The touch offset is selected from a plurality of predetermined offset values in accordance with the device orientation. One example of touch offset values will be described for the purpose of illustration. When the device  is in one of the \u201ctop up\u201d, \u201cbottom up\u201d, \u201cleft up\u201d and \u201cright up\u201d device orientations, the touch offset is determined in accordance with the following mappings of touch offset to device orientation shown in Table 3:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Reference Position\/Device Orientation vs. Touch offset"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Reference position\/","First","Second","Third","Fourth"]},{"entry":["device orientation","(Top Up)","(Bottom Up)","(Left Up)","(Right Up)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Touch offset","(0, y1)","(0, \u2212y2)","(x1, 0)","(\u2212x2, 0)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"When the device  is in either of the \u201cfront up\u201d or \u201cback up\u201d device orientation, the input plane of the touchscreen display  is generally in the horizontal plane and there is no effective mechanism to unambiguously select a touch offset for the GUI. As a result, when the device  is in either in the \u201cfront up\u201d or \u201cback up\u201d device orientation, the touch offset is determined as the previous touch offset of the device orientation when the device  was last in one of the \u201ctop up\u201d, \u201cbottom up\u201d, \u201cleft up\u201d or \u201cright up\u201d device orientations.

This may comprise determining the user interface element associated with the adjusted touch point prior to selection, and may comprise determining the input signal associated with the user interface element format prior generating the input signal.","The action performed by the generated input signal depends on the respective user interface element. For example, in a text entry mode, the input signal may be cause a displayable character to be displayed in a corresponding text entry field on the touchscreen . In an icon menu selection mode, the input signal may execute an action associated with an icon  in the icon menu item  which may causes, for example, the processor  to launch the application or function logically associated with the icon  or to open a folder associated with the icon .","Returning to step , when it is determined that touch point adjusted is not to be applied, the processing processed to step . In step , the processor  selects the user interface element associated with the unadjusted (original) touch point and generates an input signal associated with the respective user interface element.","The touch offset solution described herein accounts for changes in device orientation by dynamically selecting a touch offset by determining the orientation (or a change in orientation) of the device , and determining the required touch offset accordingly. It will be appreciated that without dynamically setting or adjusting the touch offset, the touch offset may not be valid when the device orientation changes. Accordingly, the use of a dynamic touch offset improves the accuracy of touchscreen based input mechanisms. More precise touchscreen based input mechanisms may, in turn, allow smaller sensing areas to be used for user interface elements, thereby allowing more user interface elements to be incorporated within a touchscreen-based graphical user interface. The touch offset solution, in some embodiments, also takes into account the size of the user interface elements so that if an item which is touched is greater than or equal to a predetermined size, the touch point will not be offset. This may be advantageous because it reduces processing requirements of the device  so that touch offset is used only when determined to be necessary by the predefined touch offset rules. The touch offset solution described herein applies to GUIs which change screen orientation based on changes in device orientation, and to GUIs which change screen orientation based on changes in device orientation.","The teachings of the present disclosure can also be applied to change the touch offset to correspond to a change in the screen orientation independent of the device orientation, for example, so that the touch offset is maintained in a specific direction and optionally at a specific distance from the touch input (e.g., the centroid of the contact area) for all screen orientations. Typically, this involves determining the screen orientation of the GUI displayed on the device  and selecting a touch offset which adjusts the touch point in a direction opposite to a top of the GUI in the determined screen orientation (for example, so that a downward offset relative to the GUI is maintained). However, a different direction offset could be used for the touch offset in different embodiments. The change in the screen orientation of the GUI may be triggered by a change in device orientation detected by the positional\/orientation sensor of the device , or in response to respective input, for example, from the user.","While the operations  have been described as occurring in a particular order, it will be appreciated to persons skilled in the art that some of the steps may be performed in a different order provided that the result of the changed order of any given step will not prevent or impair the occurrence of subsequent steps. Furthermore, some of the steps described above may be combined in other embodiments, and some of the steps described above may be separated into a number of sub-steps in other embodiments.","While the terms \u201ctouch\u201d and \u201cpress\u201d are used in the present disclosure, these terms are used for purposes of illustration only. The present disclosure is intended to apply to any touch input (i.e., any application of an external force to the touchscreen ) which generates an input signal by the touchscreen display . The touch input may be caused by a finger of the user contacting the touchscreen , a stylus contacting the touchscreen , or the presence of a conductive object near the touchscreen  if the touchscreen  is a capacitive touchscreen. Moreover, aspects of the present disclosure relating to receiving input via interaction with user interface elements presented on the touchscreen  are intended to apply to any interactive user interface element such as an icon, virtual button, virtual key or other interactive user interface element having one or more inputs associated with it.","Communication System Configuration","In order to facilitate an understanding of one possible environment in which example embodiments described herein can operate, reference is made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied.
