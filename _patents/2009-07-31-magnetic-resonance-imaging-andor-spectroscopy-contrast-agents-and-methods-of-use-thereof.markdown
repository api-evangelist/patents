title: Magnetic resonance imaging and/or spectroscopy contrast agents and methods of use thereof
abstract: The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates that a spin state which has zero magnetic resonance signal, but an extremely long lifetime, can be used to store magnetization, which can then be recovered into an observable transition. Coupled with hyperpolarization techniques, this permits the preparation of a wide range of contrast agent molecules for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that have long effective relaxation time.

In NMR, the spin and magnetism of atomic nuclei are exploited to provide information about the chemical composition, spatial distribution, or molecular motion of molecules or atoms. The imaging analog of NMR, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is a powerful technique in biomedical sample imaging.","One of the limitations of NMR and MRI is low intrinsic signal strength. Some attempts to overcome this limitation have involved the use of hyperpolarized contrast agents, which have very large nuclear polarizations and, therefore, sensitivities that are orders of magnitude higher than ordinary molecules. For a few molecules, polarization can persist for 100 or more seconds before the polarized nuclei return to thermal equilibrium. However, for the majority of molecules, including those that could be used as in vivo contrast agents for MRI, polarization lasts more in the range of seconds or tens of seconds.","While such lifetimes can be sufficient for some imaging and\/or spectroscopy studies, contrast agents with longer lifetimes are highly desirable to study additional processes of interest, for example processes related to diffusion, flow, slow molecular motion, chemical reactions, metabolism, and drug targeting and distribution, among others. The relaxation of nuclear spins back to thermal equilibrium is characterized by a time constant, T, known as the longitudinal relaxation time constant or as the spin lattice relaxation time constant. The development of contrast agents having polarization that persists for times longer than Twould be beneficial for both NMR and MRI.","The presently disclosed subject matter pertains to a method of providing a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the method comprising:","providing a precursor molecule comprising two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei, wherein said precursor molecule is chemically convertible to a contrast agent molecule wherein the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei are converted to equivalent nuclei;","hyperpolarizing the precursor molecule to provide a hyperpolarized precursor molecule;","applying one or more radiofrequency pulse(s) to the hyperpolarized precursor molecule to create one or both of a non-equilibrium \u03b1\u03b2 nuclear spin state population and a non-equilibrium \u03b2\u03b1 nuclear spin state population; and","chemically converting the hyperpolarized precursor molecule into a contrast agent molecule by converting the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei to two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, equivalent nuclei, wherein the contrast agent molecule comprises a non-equilibrium nuclear singlet spin state population and is chemically convertible to a detection molecule wherein said equivalent nuclei are converted to non-equivalent nuclei.","In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule is chemically convertible to the detection molecule under physiological conditions.

The presently disclosed subject matter can, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the embodiments to those skilled in the art.","All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Throughout the specification and claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all optical and stereoisomers, as well as racemic mixtures where such isomers and mixtures exist, unless otherwise noted.","While the following terms are believed to be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the following definitions are set forth to facilitate explanation of the presently disclosed subject matter.","Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which the presently disclosed subject matter belongs. Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the presently disclosed subject matter, representative methods, devices, and materials are now described.","The term \u201ccontrast agent\u201d refers to a contrast agent molecule or a composition comprising a contrast agent molecule that increases the contrast of a tissue, organ, cell or other biological structure being examined, for example using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The contrast agent molecules of the presently disclosed subject matter can also be used to determine the progress of chemical reactions or non-biological phenomena (e.g., chemical diffusion) via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.","The term \u201cJ-coupling\u201d can also be referred to as spin-spin coupling or scalar coupling. As used herein, J-coupling can refer to a J coupling which is larger than the reciprocal of the spin-spin relaxation time, T.","As used herein the term \u201cequivalent nuclei\u201d can refer to nuclei having exactly the same chemical shift. If the chemical shifts are identical because the two nuclei are related by some symmetry element, such as a mirror plane, such nuclei can be referred to as \u201cchemically equivalent.\u201d Alternatively, the equivalent nuclei can be \u201ceffectively equivalent,\u201d wherein, by coincidence or choice of field strength, the resonance frequencies of the nuclei will differ by less than the J coupling between them. For example, in some embodiments, the effectively equivalent nuclei can have a chemical shift difference that is at least three times (or at least five times) smaller than the J coupling between them.","\u201cNon-equivalent nuclei\u201d are generally nuclei wherein one nucleus is bonded to at least one chemical group that is different in structure than the chemical group or groups bonded to the other non-equivalent nuclei. Thus, non-equivalent nuclei have a resonance frequency difference which exceeds the J coupling between them.","The term \u201cderivatives\u201d refers to compounds that differ from a named parent compound by the addition or subtraction of one or more atoms or chemical groups. Thus, the term \u201cderivatives\u201d includes, but is not limited to, compounds wherein one or more hydrogen atom of the parent compound has been replaced by one or more alkyl, aralkyl, aryl, acyl, halo, nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, alkoxyl, aryloxyl, or amino groups. For example, the derivative can be the ester or amide of a parent molecule that includes a carbonyl (i.e., a \u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014), carboxylic acid (i.e., a \u2014C(\u2550O)OH group), amine (i.e., a \u2014NHor \u2014NHR group, where R is an alkyl or aryl moiety) or hydroxyl (\u2014OH) group. Other derivatives include ethers of hydroxyl-containing parent molecules and N-alkylated amines of amino-containing parent molecules. In addition, derivatives of the presently disclosed contrast agent molecules are derivatives wherein the derivatization does not change the equivalency of the equivalent nuclei therein. Thus, any derivative of a named contrast agent molecule includes two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, equivalent nuclei.","The terms \u201cchemically converting\u201d and \u201cchemical transformation\u201d refer to chemical and biochemical reactions wherein one or more bonds are formed or broken. In some embodiments, the term chemically converting refers to a non-photo catalyzed reaction.","The term \u201cphysiological conditions\u201d refers to biologically relevant pH, temperature, and salt conditions, such as might be present in vivo (i.e., in a living organism) or in vitro (e.g., in a cell, tissue, organ or mixture of biological molecules outside a living organism). Physiological conditions can refer to the presence of an aqueous solvent (e.g., water or saline), which can be buffered or unbuffered by the presence of a buffering agent (e.g., sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, monopotassium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate, sodium citrate, citric acid, sodium acetate, acetic acid, bicine, cacodylate, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine (Tris), N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine (Tricine), 4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), piperazine-N,N\u2032-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES), 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), etc). One or more biological molecules (e.g., proteins, peptides, enzymes, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, or the like) can be present under physiological conditions.","Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and the imaging analog, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have become extraordinarily important techniques. MRI has become a very powerful clinical imaging modality, for two fundamental reasons. First, the hardware is mature: modern MRI machines routinely give complex sequences of arbitrarily shaped radiofrequency pulses to create precise excitation, and give magnetic field gradient pulses to suppress magnetization or obtain spatial resolution. More importantly, however, the theoretical framework is mature. No other modern spectroscopy has such a strong theoretical basis, which of course is used to understand the structures of molecules as complicated as proteins in solution. This maturity is even more important in MRI: complications associated with imaging in vivo can often be reduced or eliminated by clever pulse sequence design.","However, the maturity of that theoretical framework also implies that the known limitations of MRI are rather fundamental. The Boltzmann distribution implies that the net fractional magnetization is small at room temperature, so in most MRI studies, the signal arises mostly from water. Contrast then arises primarily from parameters that can be traced back to the spin physics explorations of the 1940s and 1950s (the local bulk magnetization M, the relaxation parameters T, Tand T*, and local values of diffusion, sometimes in different directions), which often only have very indirect clinical relevance or correlation with metabolism and cell biochemistry. MRI contrast agents generally have limited specificity, and usually need to be present in high concentration to affect the signal.","These limitations have recently been partially surmounted by the ready commercial availability of hyperpolarized reagents, which have very large nuclear polarizations and thus orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than ordinary molecules. Among the recent methods are techniques to create spin polarized He (see McFall et al., 200, 553-558 (1996); and Salerno et al., 40, 33-44 (2001)), para-Haddition across double bonds (see Bowers and Weitekamp, 57, 2645-2648 (1986); Bowers and Weitekamp, 109, 5541-5542 (1987); Natterer and Bargon, 31, 293-315 (1997); Duckett and Sleigh, 34, 71-92 (1999); and Golman et al., 46, 1-5 (2001)), and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). See Abraqam and Goldman, 41, 395-467 (1978); de Boer et al., 15, 249-267 (1974); de Boer and Niinikoski, 114, 495-498 (1974); Hall et al., 276, 930-931 (1997); Bajaj et al., 160, 85-90 (2003); Johansson et al., 51, 464-472 (2004); and Ardenkjaer-Larsen et al., ., USA, 100, 10158-10163 (2003). All of these methods have demonstrated large nuclear magnetization (>10%, as compared to typical thermal magnetization of 10), with the polarization persisting as long as 100 s in some molecules. Many different research groups have been examining potential uses of such hyperpolarized molecules both in vivo and in vitro. See Kurhanewicz et al., 49(3), 341-344 (2008); Golman et al., 66, 10855-10860 (2006); Merritt et al., ., USA, 104, 19773-19777 (2007); Day et al., 45(12), 1018-1021 (2007); Gabellieri et al., 130(14), 4598 (2008).","DNP methodology in particular is very versatile, and hundreds of different molecules have been polarized. However, most DNP studies have focused on C in pyruvate, largely because the Trelaxation time for the C1 position is relatively long (40 s at 14.1 T), so the polarized nuclei can potentially undergo many reactions before the NMR signal returns to thermal equilibrium and becomes undetectable. Generically, carbon-13 Tvalues are expected to be tens of seconds for carbons without attached protons, and much shorter with attached protons. While this lifetime permits some important metabolic processes to be studied, it is vastly shorter than the lifetimes associated with other molecular imaging modalities (e.g., F PET) and provides a fundamental limitation to the ultimate generality of the technique.","Previous studies have demonstrated the use of singlet states comprised of non-symmetry related spins to lengthen T. See Ahuja, et al., 127, 134112 (2007); Carravetta et al., 92, 153003 (2004); Carravetta and Levitt, 126, 6228-6229 (2004); and Carravetta and Levitt, 122, 214505 (2005). In the studies, molecules with broken symmetry (for example, a single carbon-13) are used. The non-symmetry related spins are manipulated to appear to be equivalent by removing frequency differences with multiple spin echoes (which requires excessive radiofrequency power dissipation in vivo) or by lowering the magnetic field so much that the resonance frequencies are essentially the same (which requires removing the sample from the magnet). The signal is then observed by permitting free evolution in a high field. Both approaches give interesting demonstrations of lifetime increases, but neither is practical for MRI. In addition, at the microscopic level, both of these approaches have certain limitations. For example, relaxation is dominated by the local components of the magnetic field fluctuating near the Larmor frequency, and, if two sites are physically inequivalent, these fluctuations are expected to be poorly correlated, even if the resonance frequencies are nearly the same.","PCT International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2005\/015253 relates to an approach that involves lowering the field to create a pseudo-singlet state and to reacting an unsaturated symmetric molecule with parahydrogen to provide a quasi-equilibrium nuclear spin ensemble estate. See also, Carravetta et al., 92, 153003 (2004); Carravetta and Levitt, 126, 6228-6229 (2004); and Carravetta and Levitt, 122, 214505 (2005).","The presently disclosed subject matter provides novel methods to make certain molecules have vastly longer effective relaxation times, thus facilitating their practical use in clinical and preclinical magnetic resonance imaging. A central concept is that of storing population in a \u201csinglet state\u201d, the only antisymmetric spin state created when two magnetically equivalent nuclear spins are present in the same molecule. In such a system, quantum mechanics predicts that the singlet energy level 2(\u03b1\u03b2-\u03b2\u03b1) is disconnected from the other three (triplet) energy levels. This has various consequences. For example, the water molecule has two nuclear spins, but a very simple NMR spectrum (i.e., one line) because one of the four possible energy levels is disconnected from all of the others. The singlet state also should have no significant interactions with external magnetic fields, and, thus an extremely long relaxation time, as long as the field does not break the symmetry between the spins. Unfortunately, the signal is also unobservable for the same reasons. The methods of the presently disclosed subject matter take advantage of chemistry to break the symmetry in a controlled way so that signal can be detected. Thus, under certain circumstances, combinations of chemical action and radiofrequency pulses can make these spin states accessible, so that they can be used as a \u201csafe storage\u201d for hyperpolarization.","Prior to the presently disclosed subject matter, most general methods for preparing hyperpolarized reagents do not directly prepare substantial population in singlet states. Further, parahydrogen addition has been demonstrated to work in a very small number of molecules, only one of which at this time has any relevance to biochemistry. The dynamic nuclear polarization method, on the other hand, has been used to hyperpolarize hundreds of different small molecules, for example, via the commercially available Oxford HYPERSENSE\u2122 (Oxford Instruments Molecular Biotools Ltd., Tubney Woods, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom) system. Other methods to hyperpolarize a sample with equivalent carbons, nitrogens, or phosphorus (for example, transfer of polarization from a highly spin polarized gas or reduction of temperature to achieve increased polarization) also tend not to produce singlet population. The presently disclosed methods can be used for preparing substantial excess population, which requires creation of a precursor that is chemically inequivalent; perturbation of a line in the spectrum (or other methods using if pulses on allowed transitions); and then chemical transformation into the singlet. The presently disclosed subject matter further encompasses many examples of classes of chemical reactions that would be capable in vivo of transforming population between singlet and observable signal and is applicable, in some embodiments, to carbon, nitrogen, or phosphorus atoms without attached hydrogens, which are known to have an appreciably longer relaxation time.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a hyperpolarized contrast agent molecule. Generically, hyperpolarized contrast agent molecules that can be used in methods of the presently disclosed subject matter satisfy one or more of the following three conditions. First, the contrast agent molecule can have two equivalent nuclei. For example, the molecule can have two nearby equivalent H, C (e.g., C), N (e.g., N), or P (e.g., P) nuclei. Proximity is important because the nuclei need to have a coupling. In solution phase, this coupling would normally be the so-called scalar or J coupling in NMR. The equivalent nuclei will have a resonance frequency difference much less than the scalar coupling (or zero) and much weaker coupling to other spins.","Secondly, there can be a method for preparing excess (or depleted) population in the singlet state. This is possible if the contrast agent molecule has a precursor where the two nuclei are non-equivalent, and if the precursor can be hyperpolarized by a method such as, but not limited to, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Then combinations of radiofrequency pulses can be used to perturb the population in the \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b1 energy levels in the hyperpolarized precursor to increase or decrease the singlet population. Chemical transformation of the hyperpolarized precursor to a species with equivalent nuclei can then lock population in the singlet. Ideally, this chemical transformation is achievable in a time shorter than the normal T.","Thirdly, for the contrast agent molecule to give desired contrast, there can be a mechanism (e.g., a biological or chemical pathway) which makes the equivalent nuclei non-equivalent again, thus permitting detection of the hyperpolarization. For example, there might be a biological pathway that involves an enzymatic reaction that transforms the contrast agent molecule into a detection molecule in which the nuclei are non-equivalent. As another example, the contrast agent molecule might be encapsulated in a delivery system which excludes water. At an appropriate time, opening or degrading the capsules causes hydration of the contrast agent molecule and, thus, causes the equivalent nuclei to become non-equivalent (e.g., by breaking the symmetry of the contrast agent molecule). Such a mechanism can be employed, for example, when diacetyl is used as a contrast agent molecule.","Some contrast agent molecules, such as, but not limited to diacetyl, comprise no hydrogens attached directly to the equivalent nuclei. Partitioning between hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases can control the rate of conversion of such contrast agent molecules to detectable molecules. For instance, partitioning in vivo modulates the rate of conversion between diacetyl and its first metabolite, acetoin (i.e., CHC(\u2550O)CH(OH)CH), which has inequivalent carbons.","In addition to diacetyl, many other molecular systems can be used as contrast agent molecules. Simple examples include oxolin (an antiviral compound with two equivalent carbons and no attached hydrogens) and FOSAMAX\u2122 (i.e., alendronate, Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J., United States of America), which has two equivalent P atoms separated by a single carbon. Derivatives of pyridazine or phthalazine, which have recently been shown to have VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity (see Kisselyov et al., 68, 308-313 (2006)), and which can have equivalent nitrogen atoms, can also be used. Also, in some embodiments, deuteration or very weak irradiation can essentially eliminate the coupling to outside nuclei.","As directly bonded H atoms are not needed in the DNP method to create hyperpolarization, isotopic substitution of hydrogen with deuterium is possible and thus additional, more complex, molecular systems can also be used as contrast agent molecules according to the presently disclosed subject matter. These molecules include, but are not limited to, the antidepressant amitryptyline and its primary metabolite nortriptyline, whose seven-member ring gets hydroxylated in the liver (see Oleson and Linnet, 25, 740-744 (1997)), as well as succinate and fumarate, which become asymmetric as they get converted to malate and oxaloacetate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Succinate can be prepared directly as the (hydrogen) singlet via parahydrogen addition (see Bhattacharya et al., 186(1), 150-155 (2007)), but, in the past, has generally been singly carbon-13 labeled, intentionally to break the symmetry. In the 2,3- or 1,2,3,4-labeled compound, the singlet could be transferred by radiofrequency (rf) pulses between H and the 2,3-carbons, or to the 1,4 carbons (which are long lived), then back to the 2,3 carbons to have a detectable coupling. Thus, hyperpolarized succinate is accessible by para-hydrogen addition, as well as the DNP hyperpolarization method.","At moderate fields, such as at about 1 Tesla or at between about 0.5 to about 4.0 Tesla (i.e., the field range of commercial MRI machines), even molecules with not quite chemically equivalent nuclei, such as the 3,4-C versions of L-DOPA or dopamine can be used as contrast agent molecules. The degradation pathways of L-DOPA and dopamine lead to compounds such as homovanillic acid (HVA), which has significant asymmetry.","Thus, the presently disclosed subject matter provides, in some embodiments, a contrast agent comprising a contrast agent molecule that allows for retention or \u201cstorage\u201d of hyperpolarization for an extended period of time, for example, so that the contrast agent can be used to detect a number of biologically or chemically relevant events. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter relates to a method of providing a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the method comprising:","providing a precursor molecule comprising two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei, wherein said precursor molecule is chemically convertible to a contrast agent molecule wherein the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei are converted to equivalent nuclei;","hyperpolarizing the precursor molecule to provide a hyperpolarized precursor molecule (which also comprises the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei);","applying one or more radiofrequency pulse(s) to the hyperpolarized precursor molecule to create one or both of a non-equilibrium \u03b1\u03b2 nuclear spin state population and a non-equilibrium \u03b2\u03b1 nuclear spin state population; and","chemically converting the hyperpolarized precursor molecule into a contrast agent molecule by converting the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei to two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, equivalent nuclei, wherein the contrast agent molecule comprises a non-equilibrium nuclear singlet spin state population and is chemically convertible to a detection molecule wherein said equivalent nuclei are converted into non-equivalent nuclei. In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter relates to the contrast agent molecule prepared according to the above-described method.","In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule is chemically convertible to the detection molecule under physiological conditions. Thus, in some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule is converted to the detection molecule via contact with water. In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule is converted to the detection molecule via an enzymatic reaction. In some cases, conversion between equivalent and inequivalent states can be as simple as a change in pH (e.g., in perdeuterated urea or arginine) or removal of water (as in diacetyl), and such systems can be used as reporters in incapsulated delivery systems.","In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule is in chemical equilibrium with the hyperpolarized precursor molecule or the detection molecule. In some embodiments, the chemical equilibrium can be perturbed (e.g., changed or manipulated) to interconvert the contrast agent molecule and the hyperpolarized precursor molecule, the contrast agent and the detection molecule, or both. For example, the hyperpolarized precursor molecule and\/or the detection molecule can be dehydrated to form the contrast agent molecule. In such an embodiment, the pH of an aqueous solvent in which the hyperpolarized precursor molecule or detection molecule is dissolved can be adjusted to accelerate or slow chemical conversion to the contrast agent molecule.","In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule is selected from the group including, but not limited to, diacetyl, oxolin, alendronate, amitryptyline, nortriptyline, succinate, fumarate, maleimide, catechol, naphthalene, naphthoquinone, phenylbutazone, pyridazine, phthalazine, dopamine, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and derivatives thereof. In some embodiments, the precursor molecule and the detection molecule can have the same molecular structure. In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule is diacetyl (i.e., CHC(\u2550O)C(\u2550O)CH) and one or both of the precursor molecule and the detection molecule is the monohydrate of diacetyl (ie., CHCH(OH)C(\u2550O)CH). In some embodiments, both the precursor molecule and the detection molecule are the monohydrate of diacetyl.","In some embodiments, the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei of the precursor molecule are selected from the group consisting of H, C, N and P. In some embodiments, the nuclei are selected from C and P. In some embodiments, providing the precursor molecule comprises synthetically doping or labeling a molecule with C, H, N or P.","In some embodiments, the hyperpolarizing is performed by DNP. DNP refers to transferring spin polarization from electrons to nuclei. DNP can be performed by doping a material with a free radical. The unpaired electrons in the free radical can be polarized, for example, by exposure to a high magnetic field and low temperature. Irradiation at the electron paramagnetic resonance frequency can then serve to transfer polarization to the nuclei. By \u201chyperpolarization,\u201d it is meant that the sample is polarized to a level over that found at room temperature and 1 Tesla, preferably polarized to a polarization degree in excess of 0.1%, more preferably 1%, even more preferably 10%.","In some embodiments, the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, equivalent nuclei of the contrast agent molecule are free of directly bonded hydrogen atoms. In some embodiments, the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, equivalent nuclei of the contrast agent molecule are directly bonded to hydrogen atoms and are J-coupled to two other, additional equivalent nuclei within the molecule, wherein the two other, additional equivalent nuclei are free of directly bonded hydrogen atoms, and whereby application of one or more radiofrequency pulse(s) can transfer a spin state population between the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, equivalent nuclei and the two other, additional equivalent nuclei.","In some embodiments, such as when the contrast is for use in an in vivo MRI study, the method can further comprise incorporating the contrast agent molecule into a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation suitable for administration to a subject. Administration can be by any suitable means, such as, but not limited to, oral, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration. In some embodiments, the contrast agent can be delivered directly to a target organ or tissue of interest in the subject directly via injection or topical application (e.g., to a wound or surgical incision).","In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal. In some embodiments, the mammal is a human. However, the presently disclosed subject matter also relates to the administration of contrast agents to any vertebrate animal (e.g., dogs, cats, horses, cows, goats, sheep, and the like, including both animals kept on farms and in zoos). Thus, the presently disclosed MRI contrast agents can be used in both medical and veterinary practice. In some embodiments, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d refers to a carrier that is pharmaceutically acceptable in humans, including water, saline, and aqueous solutions that can comprise other diluents in addition to water, including, but not limited to, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, and the like.","In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule can be encapsulated into a delivery format or vehicle to protect the contrast agent molecule from one or more conditions in an in vivo environment (e.g., for at least a period of time) or to aid in delivery of the contrast agent molecule to a specific location in a subject (e.g., to a particular organ or to tumor). Thus, the delivery format can include one or more targeting groups (e.g., an antibody, antigen, receptor ligand, enzyme substrate, or the like) that directs the contrast agent to a particular tissue, organ or type of cell (e.g., a cancer or other type of diseased cell) due to the presence of receptors or enzymes present on or nearby the tissue, organ or cell.","In some embodiments, the method comprises encapsulating the contrast agent molecule into a biodegradable delivery format that prevents water contact with the contrast agent molecule prior to complete or partial biodegradation of said delivery format. Therefore, in some embodiments, the rate of biodegradation of the delivery format can be chosen or manipulated to control the rate of conversion of contrast agent molecule to detection molecule. Suitable encapsulation agents include, but are not limited to, various biocompatible, biodegradable polymers such as polyglycolic acid (PGA) and copolymers thereof, polylactic acid (PLA) and copolymers thereof, other polyesters and polyamide esters, polyvinyl esters, and polyanhydrides. In some embodiments, the encapsulation agent is not biodegradable, but can swell in the presence of water to allow conversion of the contrast agent molecule to the detection molecule and\/or diffusion of the contrast agent molecule or detection molecule out of the encapsulation agent. In some embodiments, the delivery agent is a liposome. For example, the liposome can have a lipophillic interior to protect the contrast agent molecule from physiological conditions until delivery to a site of interest.","In some embodiments, the non-equilibrium nuclear singlet spin state population can persist for a time that is substantially greater than T. For example, in some embodiments, the non-equilibrium nuclear singlet spin state population can persist for a time that is greater that about 3 times T. In some embodiments, the non-equilibrium nuclear singlet spin state population can persist for a time that is greater that about 10 times T. In some embodiments, the non-equilibrium nuclear singlet spin state population can persist for a time that is between about 3 times Tand about 10 times T(e.g., about 3 times T, about 4 times T, about 5 times T, about 6 times about 7 times T, about 8 times T, about 9 times Tor about 10 times T).","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of imaging a target, the method comprising:","providing a contrast agent molecule having a non-equilibrium singlet state nuclear spin population;","contacting the contrast agent molecule with the target;","allowing the contrast agent molecule to be chemically converted into the detection molecule;","generating a nuclear magnetic resonance signal; and","detecting the nuclear magnetic resonance signal, thereby imaging the target; wherein providing the contrast agent molecule comprises: providing a precursor molecule comprising two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei, wherein said precursor molecule is chemically convertible to a contrast agent molecule wherein the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei are converted to equivalent nuclei; hyperpolarizing the precursor molecule to provide a hyperpolarized precursor molecule; applying one or more radiofrequency pulse(s) to the hyperpolarized precursor molecule to create one or both of a non-equilibrium \u03b1\u03b2 nuclear spin state population and a non-equilibrium \u03b2\u03b1 nuclear spin state population; and chemically converting the hyperpolarized precursor molecule into the contrast agent molecule by converting the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, non-equivalent nuclei to two J-coupled, non-zero-spin, equivalent nuclei, wherein the contrast agent molecule comprises a non-equilibrium nuclear singlet spin state population and is chemically convertible to a detection molecule wherein the two J-coupled, non-zero-spin equivalent nuclei are converted to non-equivalent nuclei.","In some embodiments, the target is one of a cell, a tissue, an organ, and a subject. In some embodiments, the contrast agent can be used in an NMR study and the target can be a chemical composition (e.g., a non-biochemical reaction mixture or an environmental sample, such as a water sample from a lake, stream, river, ocean, residential water supply, or industrial site).","In some embodiments, the contacting comprises administering a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the contrast agent to a subject.

Thus, the methods can be used as medical or veterinary diagnostic methods in mammals and birds.","More particularly, provided herein is the nuclear magnetic imaging of mammals, such as humans, as well as those mammals of importance due to being endangered (such as Siberian tigers), of economical importance (animals raised on farms for consumption by humans) and\/or social importance (animals kept as pets or in zoos) to humans, for instance, carnivores other than humans (such as cats and dogs), swine (pigs, hogs, and wild boars), ruminants (such as cattle, oxen, sheep, giraffes, deer, goats, bison, and camels), and horses. Also provided herein is the imaging of birds, including the treatment of those kinds of birds that are endangered, kept in zoos or as pets, as well as fowl, and more particularly domesticated fowl, i.e., poultry, such as turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese, guinea fowl, and the like, as they also are of economical importance to humans. Thus, embodiments of the methods described herein include the imaging of livestock, including, but not limited to, domesticated swine (pigs and hogs), ruminants, horses, poultry, and the like.","In some embodiments, providing the contrast agent molecule further comprises incorporating the contrast agent molecule into a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule is formulated for oral, intravenous, or interperitoneal administration to the subject. In some embodiments, the contrast agent is formulated for administration directly to a site of interest (e.g., a wound or a tumor site accessible via a surgical incision).","In some embodiments, the contrast agent molecule can be incorporated into a delivery format that effects delivery of the agent to a specific site in vivo (e.g., to a particular type of tissue, organ or cell). In some embodiments, providing the contrast agent molecule further comprises encapsulating the contrast agent molecule into a biodegradable delivery format that prevents water contact with the contrast agent molecule prior to complete or partial biodegradation of said delivery format. Thus, in some embodiments, upon complete or partial degradation of the delivery format, the contrast agent molecule will be converted into the detection molecule.","Suitable encapsulation agents for use in preparing the delivery format include, but are not limited to, various biocompatible, biodegradable polymers such as polyglycolic acid (PGA) and copolymers thereof, polylactic acid (PLA) and copolymers thereof, other polyesters and polyamide esters, polyvinyl esters, and polyanhydrides.

Phys. Org. Chem., ","Trans. Faraday Soc., ","J. Am. Chem. Soc., "]},"Preparation of the Singlet State of Diacetyl Requires Perterbation of the \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b1 populations from their equilibrium 25%. Hyperpolarization does not do this efficiently by itself. For example, 20% nuclear polarization (60% \u03b1, 40% (3) would imply an \u03b1\u03b2 population of 24%, only 1% from equilibrium, wasting most of the potential signal. However, since all the energy levels in the hydrate are accessable, suitable pulse sequences can manipulate the \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b1 populations. The simplest is inversion of one line in one of the doublets (e.g. \u03b1\u03b1\u2192\u03b1\u03b2), which in this example would interchange the 36% as and 24% \u03b1\u03b2 populations. Dehydration converts the sum of the \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b2\u03b1 populations (in this case, 60%) evenly among the singlet \u03b1\u03b2-\u03b2\u03b1 and triplet \u03b1\u03b2+\u03b2\u03b1 of diacetyl. The singlet population in this case is 30%, six times farther from equilibrium than is produced by DNP alone. After this dehydration, the population should be locked for a very long time, unless it exchanges back to the hydrate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0119"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"With hyperpolarization, this population could be readily converted back to observable signal in the hydrate (excess population in an and na implies dipolar order, which can be optimally converted to observable signal with a 45\u00b0 pulse and delay), dramatically extending the effective hyperpolarized lifetime. This differs from most hyperpolarization studies previously reported, where small pulse flip angles are used to conserve the signal for multiple shots. Singlet diacetyl is unaffected by if pulses, so large flip angles do not deplete the stored population. Equilibrium is readily shifted away from the hydrate by the addition of acetone, thus permitting the singlet state to last longer as a spin reservoir. For the data shown in , diacetyl was hyperpolarized in water, then followed inversion of one line of the monohydrate with immediate 3:1 dilution with acetone. See Warren et al., 323, 1711-1714 (2009). The individual spectra were acquired by 45\u00b0 pulses with 10 s time separation. The dynamics are complex (for example, as the equilibrium shifts). Thus, one way to follow what is going on is to look only at the FID from hydrate peaks. See . The first FIDs have excess signal at t=\u00bd J (dotted lines), expected from the selective inversion. At intermediate times (sufficient for dehydration and mixing of the acetone), the FIDs look similar to the thermal ones (averaged over 360 shots). The later FIDs have signal higher than thermal, and the structure is very complex. In the case of FID 14 in , the preceding 45\u00b0 pulses should have depleted all but 1% of the hyperpolarized signal, the relaxation should have depleted all but 0.1%, so less than 10should remain in the absence of singlet effects.","Shifting the equilibrium with acetone in vivo is not feasible. However, as diacetyl does not have a dipole moment, it can migrate to the nonpolar phase. For example, it is mostly found in the fatty phase in butter. See Hoecker and Hammer, 25, 175-185 (1942). Accordingly one application of diacetyl is as a \u201creporter molecule\u201d in a delivery system, including, but not limited to, functionalized or temperature sensitive liposomes or functionalized ultrasound contrast agents, including those based on encapsulated perfluorocarbons. See Jakobsen, et al., 15, 941-945 (2005).","In a high resolution spectrometer, the spectra of diacetyl is complicated. See Warren et al., 323, 1711-1714 (2009). The carbonyl carbon spins are not strictly fully equivalent. Each carbonyl carbon is coupled differently to the two methyl groups (the C\u2014H couplings are 6.4 Hz and \u22121.1 Hz). However, the C\u2014C coupling constant (approximately 50 Hz) significantly exceeds these couplings. The effect of this can be seen in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0123"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C"],"sup":["13","13","13","13","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0124"},"figref":["FIGS. 4D-4F","FIG. 4D","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4E"],"sup":["13","13"],"sub":["C-C ","C-C","C-C "]},"Similar spin systems with the same properties, such as but not limited to, the AXcase (e.g., 1,2-dichlorobenzene) have been previously studied. See Pople et al., 35, 1060 (1957); and McConnell et al., 23, 1152 (1955). In general, it is known that strong couplings can produce deceptively simple spectra. See Abraham and Bernstein, 39, 216 (1961); Anet, 39, 2262 (1961); Musher and Corey, 18, 791 (1962); and Becker, (Academic, San Diego, 2000), page 171-175. In the AXcase, 12 lines associated with the A transitions would be expected, not one. As described previously (see Pople et al., 35, 1060 (1957); and McConnell et al., 23, 1152 (1955)), one important parameter is the ratio (J\u00b1J\u2032)\/(J\u2212J), where J and J\u2032 are the two different A-X couplings (the minus sign gives the larger value in cases where the couplings have opposite signs). When this ratio is small, simple perturbation theory analysis shows the worst overlap of a carbon singlet state with a true spin eigenstate to be {1\u22120.25((J\u2212J\u2032)\/J\u2212J))}, and Tlengthening is expected to be on the order of ((JA\u2212A\u2212JX\u2212X)\/(J\u2212J\u2032)).","Perturbation theory analysis can be extended to the case of diacetyl. Even though the spectra in  are quite complex, assuming the couplings have the same value as in the hydrate shows that the average overlap of the singlet state with an eigenstate is better than 0.97. This can be verified by precise numerical analysis of this eight-spin system, predicting more than an order of magnitude lengthening of the spin lifetime. In effect, the strong coupling between the two carbons quenches communication with other spins. Thus, without being bound to any one theory, it is believed that virtually all the spectral complexity comes from the other three carbon states, and singlet to triplet interconversion is slow. Perdeuteration, which can be readily achieved in this system via keto-enol tautomerization, can dramatically reduce even this limited singlet-triplet mixing and further increase the lifetime.","All references listed below, as well as all references cited in the instant disclosure, including but not limited to all patents, patent applications and publications thereof, and scientific journal articles, are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties to the extent that they supplement, explain, provide a background for, or teach methodology, techniques, and\/or compositions employed herein.\n\n"],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 1","sup":["13","13","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","sup":["13","13"],"sub":"C-H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","sup":"13","sub":"C-H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","sup":["13","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 4D","sup":["13","13"],"sub":"C-C "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4E","sup":["13","13"],"sub":"C-C "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 4F","sup":["13","13"],"sub":"C-C "}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
