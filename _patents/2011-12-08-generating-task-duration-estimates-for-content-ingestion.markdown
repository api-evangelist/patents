title: Generating task duration estimates for content ingestion
abstract: Embodiments establish duration estimates for tasks associated with media content ingestion, such as in application or game production. A content ingestion system receives a content submission request from a publisher. The request identifies a media content type that has a plurality of associated tasks. Based on previous submissions from the publisher, duration estimates for the tasks are generated and adjusted based on historical transaction data associated with other publishers (e.g., global averages). The duration estimates are provided to the publishers along with, for example, start and end dates for the tasks presented on a calendar or other workback schedule.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Additional Examples","Exemplary Operating Environment"],"p":["Software development lifecycles for the production of games, applications, videos, downloadable content, and other media content are often complicated and time-sensitive with multiple tasks to complete. The tasks may be manual or automated, and some tasks are dependent on other tasks which further increases the complexity of scheduling the tasks. Additionally, the time it takes to complete each of the tasks varies by developer and per project. Delays in completing the tasks can result in slipped release dates leading to reduced sales and lost productivity.","Embodiments of the disclosure produce a schedule for media content ingestion. A content ingestion system receives a content submission request from a publisher. The content submission request identifies a media content type. The media content type has a plurality of tasks associated therewith. The content ingestion system generates, based on previous content submissions from the publisher, a duration estimate for each of the plurality of tasks associated with the media content type in the received content submission request. The generated duration estimates are adjusted for each of the plurality of tasks based on historical transaction data associated with a plurality of publishers. The adjusted duration estimates for each of the plurality of tasks are provided to the publisher.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring to the figures, embodiments of the disclosure enable the generation of a schedule for content ingestion. In some embodiments, duration estimates for tasks involved in processing content are generated and provided to publishers . Start and end dates for the tasks may be identified and presented on a calendar (e.g., as a Gantt chart) or other workback schedule. The calendar or schedule is visible to the publisher  and helps the publisher  to manage the submission of content to a content ingestion system . In some embodiments, the duration estimates are used to establish achievable service level agreements (SLAs).","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates the content ingestion system  receiving content from the publishers . The content ingestion system  represents any system for receiving content or other data from another entity such as the publisher  or submitter. Exemplary content may be defined by media content type including applications, games, audio, video, images, and\/or documents for execution or rendering on one or more computing devices such as user computing devices. For example, the media content types may identify content as a mobile device application, a downloadable game, a disc game, a portable media player video or audio clip, a game or movie trailer, and the like.","Exemplary computing devices include user computing devices such as mobile telephones, tablets, gaming consoles, and any other devices or appliances. Exemplary publishers  include content developers such as software developers (e.g., individuals or corporations), media producers, and the like. Each of the publishers  includes any quantity of computing or processing devices implementing functionality for providing content from the publishers  to the content ingestion system .","In some embodiments, the content ingestion system  represents a market, marketplace, or store that receives content from the publishers  and makes the content accessible to the user computing devices. In other embodiments, the content ingestion system  represents a producer and\/or distributor. The content ingestion system  receives the content from the publishers  via a network  such as the Internet, although aspects of the disclosure are operable with any form of network.","In the example of , the content ingestion system  is a computing device that produces a task-based schedule for ingesting or otherwise processing the content received from the publishers . The computing device represents any device executing instructions (e.g., as application programs, operating system functionality, or both) to implement the operations and functionality associated with the content ingestion system . The computing device may include any portable or non-portable device including a mobile telephone, laptop, tablet, computing pad, netbook, gaming device, portable media player, desktop personal computer, kiosk, and\/or tabletop device. Additionally, the computing device may represent a group of processing units or other computing devices, such as in a cloud computing system or service.","The computing device has at least one processor  and a memory area . The processor  includes any quantity of processing units, and is programmed to execute computer-executable instructions for implementing aspects of the disclosure. The instructions may be performed by the processor  or by multiple processors executing within the computing device, or performed by a processor external to the computing device. In some embodiments, the processor  is programmed to execute instructions such as those illustrated in the figures.","The computing device further has one or more computer readable media such as the memory area . The memory area  includes any quantity of media associated with or accessible by the computing device. The memory area  may be internal to the computing device (as shown in ), external to the computing device (not shown), or both (not shown).","The memory area  stores, among other data, one or more applications . The applications , when executed by the processor , operate to perform functionality on the computing device to implement the content ingestion system . Exemplary applications  include mail application programs, web browsers, calendar application programs, address book application programs, messaging programs, media applications, location-based services, search programs, and the like. The applications  may communicate with counterpart applications or services such as web services accessible via the network . For example, the applications  may represent downloaded client-side applications that correspond to server-side services executing in a cloud.","The memory area  further stores workstream data  identifying a plurality of media content types each having a plurality of tasks associated therewith. The workstream data  may also identify dependencies among the plurality of tasks associated with one of the media content types. The workstream data  may also identify \u201cgates\u201d or other actions associated with the tasks such as user or publisher input, certification, etc. Exemplary workstream dependencies represent one or more of the following: product-to-product dependencies (e.g., from a product development lifecycle), workflow-to-workflow dependencies (e.g., task-to-task dependencies), and state dependencies (e.g., what stage the content is in). In some embodiments, the workstream data  is stored in a relational database and surfaced to a schedule component  via a system application programming interface (API)  (e.g., see ). Exemplary media content types include, but are not limited to, movies, games, and applications.","Exemplary tasks include, but are not limited to, system tasks and approval and certification tasks or gates. Exemplary system tasks include, but are not limited to, processing an uploaded media file, and propagating new catalog data to a cloud service. Exemplary approval and certification tasks include, but are not limited to, human approval of submitted data, certification and testing of a game, and creation of pricing data (e.g., offers). Other exemplary tasks include content submission and approval, catalog submission and approval, SKU definition submission and approval, game configuration prop, test disc validation, network verification, and retail disc manufacturing.","The memory area  further stores historical transaction data  associated with a plurality of the publishers . The historical transaction data  includes data describing previous content submissions from one or more of the publishers . The historical transaction data  may include, for example, statistics describing the duration (e.g., averages) for each of the tasks associated with each of the media content types. In some embodiments, the historical transaction data  may be filtered by publisher  to identify the previous content submissions received from each of the publishers . The historical transaction data  may be generated by the content ingestion system  or a received from another source.","The memory area  further stores one or more computer-executable components. Exemplary components include a communications interface component , a transaction component , and a presentation component . Operation of the computer-executable components is described below with reference to .","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates organization of the content ingestion system . In operation, the content ingestion system  includes a calendar user interface (UI) component  displaying the tasks, corresponding due dates, and\/or other data on a calendar or other schedule. The calendar UI component  receives the data from the schedule component . The schedule component , for example, calculates the start and end dates for each of the tasks. In some embodiments, the start date for a task represents the latest possible start date for the task. The schedule component  communicates with the system API . The system API  obtains and provides various data items to the schedule component  including, but not limited to, SLA data , workstream data , and capacity data . The SLA data  defines the times for completing each of the tasks (e.g., as agreed upon contractually or otherwise). In some embodiments, the content ingestion system  adjusts calculated duration estimates to meet or conform to the SLA data . The capacity data  includes, for example, a scale factor representing system or personnel processing. The capacity data  may be defined in \u201cslots\u201d and may be defined regionally (e.g., per country or per continent).","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of the content ingestion system  to calculate duration estimates for tasks involved in ingesting content from the publishers . Content received from the publishers  may be processed in real-time, near real-time, or on a batch (e.g., periodic) basis. In some embodiments, the content ingestion system  processes content stored in a buffer or other memory area. For example, the content ingestion system  may receive a content submission request from one of the publishers . The content submission request includes the content to be ingested by the content ingestion system  and also identifies the media content type associated with the content. Each of the media content types has a plurality of tasks associated therewith.","If the content ingestion system  receives the content submission request at , the content ingestion system  generates a duration estimate for one or more of the tasks associated with the media content type of the content in the received content submission request at . The duration estimates are generated based on historical transaction data  filtered to identify previous content submission by the publisher  providing the content submission request. For example, the historical transaction data  of a plurality of the publishers  (e.g., all the publishers ) is filtered or searched to produce the historical transaction data of the particular publisher .","At , the content ingestion system  adjusts the generated duration estimates for the tasks based on the historical transaction data  for a plurality of the publishers . For example, if the average duration across all publishers  for performing a similar task is 10 weeks but this particular publisher  has a consistent history of performing the task (or task type) 50% slower than average, aspects of the disclosure may increase the generated duration estimates to 15 weeks.","In some embodiments, the content ingestion system  further alters (e.g., overrides) the duration estimates based on SLAs. As an example, if there is an SLA to approve a document within five business days but the duration estimate is six business days, aspects of the disclosure alter the duration estimate to be five business days. In this example, a party may be contractually bound to adhere to the SLA and embodiments of the disclosure enable duration estimate overrides based on those contractual obligations to avoid confusion.","In other embodiments, the content ingestion system  calculates the duration estimates first based on the historical transaction data  for a plurality of the publishers , and then adjusts those duration estimates based on the historical transaction data for the publisher  that provided the content submission request. That is, operation  is performed before operation .","At , the content ingestion system  provides the adjusted duration estimates to the publisher  or other entity. For example, the adjusted duration estimates may be provided as a chart listing each of the tasks associated with the media content type of the content in the content submission request and the duration estimate associated with each of the tasks. As another example, the content ingestion system  may provide a calendar or other UI illustrating the tasks and duration estimates. In still another example, the content ingestion system  keeps the publishers  informed of the progress and deadlines for the tasks by sending notifications.","The content ingestion system  may further update the historical transaction data  before, during, or after completion of each of the tasks by the publisher . For example, the historical transaction data  may be updated based on the actual duration values for each of the tasks.","In some embodiments, a target completion date is identified for the content submission request. For example, the publisher  may include the target completion date in the content submission request. In another example, the content ingestion system  identifies the earliest completion date based on the calculated duration estimates for the tasks involved in processing the content. Given the target completion date, the content ingestion system  generates a workback schedule or other deadline system based on the adjusted duration estimates and the identified target completion date. For example, a due date for one or more of the tasks is generated and generates a calendar showing the due dates.","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates operation of the content ingestion system  to determine start and end dates for tasks involved in ingesting content from one of the publishers . At , the content ingestion system  accesses a content submission request received from one of the publishers . The content submission request includes a target completion date. At , the content ingestion system  calculates duration estimates for the tasks associated with the received content submission request. For example, the content ingestion system  identifies the media content type of the content in the content submission request, and then accesses the workstream data  to identify the tasks associated with the media content type. For each of the tasks, the duration estimates are calculated based on the statistics for previous content submissions of the publisher  (e.g., filtered historical transaction data ) that requested the content submission.","At , the calculated duration estimates are adjusted based on the historical transaction data  for one or more other publishers . For example, the calculated duration estimates are weighted, scaled, or otherwise adjusted based on global averages across a plurality of the publishers  or other group of the publishers .","At , the content ingestion system  determines a start date and an end date, or other milestones, for each of the tasks involved in the content submission. The start dates and the end dates are calculated based at least on the adjusted duration estimates and the target completion date. For example, the start dates and the end dates may also be calculated based on dependencies among the tasks. For example, some tasks may be performed simultaneously while other tasks are performed sequentially.","The content ingestion system  presents the tasks and calculated start and end dates to the publisher . For example, the tasks and dates may be provided in a calendar at . As another example, the tasks and dates may be provided in a Gantt chart overlaid on a calendar.","In some embodiments, the content ingestion system  compares the determined start and end dates for the tasks with, or relative to, the target completion date from the publisher . If the content ingestion system  concludes that the tasks cannot be completed by the target completion date, are unachievable by the target completion date, or are at risk or incompletion by the target completion date, the content ingestion system  notifies the publisher . For example, the content ingestion system  may alert the publisher  to an error state by color-coding tasks that cannot be completed or task completion dates that cannot be met. Different colors may indicate different severity levels for the tasks and due dates.","The operations illustrated in  may be performed by one or more computer-executable components such as the components illustrated in . For example, the communications interface component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to receive the content submission request from the publisher . The content submission request identifies the media content type. In some embodiments, the communications interface component  includes a network interface card and\/or computer-executable instructions (e.g., a driver) for operating the network interface card.","The transaction component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to generate, based on previous content submissions from the publisher  and on historical transaction data  associated with a plurality of the publishers , a duration estimate for each of the plurality of tasks associated with the media content type. In some embodiments, the transaction component  further accesses the workstream data  to identify or define the tasks associated with the media content type.","The presentation component , when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to identify start and end dates on a generated calendar based on the adjusted duration estimates for each of the plurality of tasks.","Referring next to , an exemplary calendar  shows tasks and corresponding start and end dates. The calendar  illustrated in  corresponds to, for example, the calendar generated by the operations illustrated in . The calendar  illustrates each of the tasks, workstreams, or workflows involved in the content submission. The start and end dates for the tasks leading up to the target completion date (e.g., anticipated street date) are also scheduled. On the anticipated street date, the content will be available within the catalog listing of content.","The calendar  in  further illustrates the dependencies, including overlap, among the tasks. For example, catalog submission and approval may overlap with concept submission and approval. However, content submission and approval occurs after completion of the catalog submission and approval.","The calendar  illustrated in  may be interactive. For example, the publisher  may view the calendar  in a user interface that enables the publisher  or other user to dynamically interact with the calendar elements displayed in the user interface. For example, the publisher  may click or otherwise select any of the tasks or durations to obtain additional information about the tasks, durations, dependencies, etc. The publisher  may also hover a pointing device such as a mouse or finger over the user interface elements to provoke a popup that displays the additional information.","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates creation of a workback schedule by the content ingestion system . At , the content ingestion system  builds global estimate caches. The global estimates caches correspond to the historical transaction data  for the publishers , and include duration estimates for the tasks involved with processing content of the various media content types. The operation  may be performed responsive to, or prior to, receiving a content submission request from one of the publishers .","At , the content ingestion system  produces duration estimates for the tasks associated with the media content type associated with the received content submission request. Based on the duration estimates, the content ingestion system  produces a workback schedule at .","Each of the operations illustrated in  are next described with reference to , , and .","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates calculation of duration estimates for tasks based on historical transaction data  for a plurality of the publishers . The operations illustrated in  build the global estimate caches as described above with reference to .","At , the historical transaction data  is grouped by media content type and by task. At , the grouped historical transaction data  is filtered to remove outliers or other data outside an allowable deviation from the other data. The outliers may be determined statistically. For example, data outside one or two standard deviations may be removed.","At , recent historical transaction data  is weighted more heavily than older historical transaction data . For example, historical transaction data  that is more than one year old may be weighted less than historical transaction data  from two weeks ago. At , a starting duration estimate, or global estimate, is generated for each of the tasks for each of the media content types. Alternatively or in addition, the duration estimates are calculated responsive to receipt of a content submission request from one of the publishers .","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates calculation of task duration estimates for a particular publisher . The operations illustrated in  produce the particular duration estimates as described above with reference to .","The historical transaction data  is filtered to identify the data related to the publisher . The historical transaction data  may be filtered prior to, or in response to, receipt of a content submission request from the publisher . Duration estimates for the tasks involved with the content submission request are generated by performing a duration estimate process on the filtered data at . The duration estimates are compared to the global averages calculated for a plurality of the publishers  at . Based on the comparison, a multiplier is calculated at  to adjust one or more of the duration estimates. In some embodiments, an overall multiplier and a per-task multiplier are calculated for the publisher . For example, a multiplier of 1.0 indicates no modification. In general, the ratio between the duration estimate averages for the publisher  and the duration estimate averages for the publishers  as a group is defined and applied to the duration estimates.","The content submission request is analyzed to identify the media content type and corresponding tasks at . The multiplier is applied at  to customize the duration estimates for the publisher . At , the content ingestion system  further alters the customized duration estimates based on any SLAs applicable to the content submission request and\/or publisher .","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates generation of a workback schedule based on a target completion date for content ingestion. The operations illustrated in  produce a workback schedule as described above with reference to .","The content ingestion system , or other entity receiving or accessing the content submission request, identifies the target completion date for processing the content. For example, at , the content ingestion system  identifies one or more street, market, or release dates for the content. For example, the content identified in a new content submission request may be related to content associated with a previously-submitted content submission request. The content ingestion system  may apply the target completion date from the previously-submitted content submission request to the new content submission request.","At , the content ingestion system  further transforms the duration estimates based on the identified street or market dates. For example, aspects of the disclosure decide when the tasks associated with the content submission request should be completed based on the release date identified by the publisher . Working back from the target completion date (e.g., accounting for weekends and holiday), the duration estimates are converted or transformed to start and end dates for the tasks. In an example in which a task has a duration estimate of ten business days and an anticipated release date of December 14, the content ingestions system  selects December 1 as the start date for the task in order for the task to be completed prior to or by the target completion date. In examples in which multiple tasks are transformed, task interdependencies are examined to determine whether particular tasks may be executed in parallel.","In another example, if the identified dates are far enough out, the content ingestion system  may increase the duration estimates (e.g., as a buffer) to ensure that each task can be completed.","At , the content ingestion system  calculates start dates for each of the tasks based on the duration estimates. The start dates are calculated to ensure that the identified street or market dates can be met. For example, the content ingestion system  may create an execution sequence for the tasks based on the workstream data  (e.g., task interdependencies), and identify which tasks may be executed or performed simultaneously (e.g., concurrently). Starting with the identified street or market date as the end date of the last task in the execution sequence, the content ingestion system  may work back through the execution sequence and calculate the start dates for the remaining tasks.","In some embodiments, the content ingestion system  provides the tasks, start dates, and end dates to the publisher .","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrates generation of task duration estimates adjusted by SLAs. The operations illustrated in  may be performed by an entity such as the content ingestion system .","The content ingestion system  calculates and caches the average duration estimates across a plurality of the publishers  at  based on the historical transaction data  for the publishers . The content ingestion system  further calculates and caches the average duration estimates for the submitting publisher  at  based on the historical transaction data  for the publisher  (e.g., previous submissions from the publisher ).","The content ingestion system  accesses a current submission state (e.g., the state of tasks associated with the current content submission request) at . In the example of , the content ingestion system  identifies the media content type at  separate from the content submission request. Given the calculated duration estimates and knowledge of availability of a certification team (e.g., for completion of some of the tasks) at , the content ingestion system  calculates the estimated time to ingest or otherwise process the content associated with the content submission request at .","The content ingestion system  applies transforms to the estimated times at  based on the target completion date for the content submission, such as illustrated and described with reference to . The content ingestion system  further applies transforms to the estimated times at  based on documented SLAs . The documented SLAs  represent, for example, maximum response times.","At , the content ingestion system  provides the generated task duration estimates to the publisher . The content ingestion system  may also provide start and\/or end dates, a calendar, Gantt chart, or any other data representing or derived from the duration estimates for the tasks.","In some embodiments, after the content has been processed (e.g., a product has been released), aspects of the disclosure present information on purchase offers received or configured for the released product. The purchase offers are presented to the publisher  or other entity with corresponding start and end dates for each of the purchase offers. For example, the start and end dates for the purchase offers may be displayed in a Gantt chart overlaid on a calendar.","In an exemplary scenario, the content ingestion system  may dynamically adjust the duration estimates as one or more of the tasks are completed based on the actual durations for the completed tasks. For example, if the publisher  is completing tasks ahead of schedule, the content ingestion system  may reduce the duration estimates for the remaining tasks. Further, revised start and\/or end dates for one or more of the tasks may be calculated, and provided to the publisher  (e.g., on a calendar).","At least a portion of the functionality of the various elements in  and  may be performed by other elements in  and\/or  or an entity (e.g., processor, web service, server, application program, computing device, etc.) not shown in  or .","In some embodiments, the operations illustrated in the figures may be implemented as software instructions encoded on a computer readable medium, in hardware programmed or designed to perform the operations, or both. For example, aspects of the disclosure may be implemented as a system on a chip.","While no personally identifiable information is tracked by aspects of the disclosure, embodiments have been described with reference to data monitored and\/or collected from users. In such embodiments, notice is provided to the users of the collection of the data (e.g., via a dialog box or preference setting) and users are given the opportunity to give or deny consent for the monitoring and\/or collection. The consent may take the form of opt-in consent or opt-out consent.","Exemplary computer readable media include flash memory drives, digital versatile discs (DVDs), compact discs (CDs), floppy disks, and tape cassettes. By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media are tangible, exclude propagated data signals, and are mutually exclusive to communication media. In some embodiments, computer storage media are implemented in hardware. Exemplary computer storage media include hard disks, flash drives, and other solid-state memory. In contrast, communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media.","Although described in connection with an exemplary computing system environment, embodiments of the invention are operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.
