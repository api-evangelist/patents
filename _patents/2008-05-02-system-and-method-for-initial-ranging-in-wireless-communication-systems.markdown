title: System and method for initial ranging in wireless communication systems
abstract: A system and method for initial ranging in wireless communication systems is provided. A plurality of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) blocks are received by an OFDMA base station transceiver from a plurality of remote user devices in wireless communication with the base station. A ranging subchannel is extracted from the OFDM blocks. The number of active codes in the ranging subchannel is determined, active codes are identified, and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) are estimated for each active code. Timing delays and power levels for each active code are then estimated. The estimated CFOs, timing delays, and power levels are broadcasted by the base station to the remote user devices, so that the user devices can utilize same to adjust transmission parameters to optimize power levels and synchronize communication with the base station.

ANI-03-38807 and CNS-06-25637. Accordingly, the Government has certain rights to the present invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to a system and method for initial ranging in wireless communication systems.","2. Related Art","In the field of wireless communication technology, recent demands for high data rates have stimulated intense research activity in multicarrier modulation techniques. Particular interest has been directed to orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) wireless communication systems, which have become part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics (IEEE) 802.16 family of standards for wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs). OFDMA systems allow for the transmission of digital information between a base station (BS) and a plurality of remote user devices, such as cellular telephones, wireless handheld computers, etc. OFDMA systems split the available bandwidth into smaller subchannels composed by a set of orthogonal subcarriers, which are assigned to different users to simultaneously communicate with the BS. The user signals are received at the BS as a series of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) blocks, from which information data are extracted by the BS. Unfortunately, OFDMA systems are extremely sensitive to timing errors and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) that may occur between uplink signals and the local references at the BS. Timing errors give rise to interblock interference (IBI), while inaccurate compensation of the CFOs destroys orthogonality among subcarriers and produces interchannel interference (ICI) as well as multiple access interference (MAI).","In an attempt to alleviate these drawbacks of OFDMA systems, the IEEE 802.16 standards specify a synchronization procedure called Initial Ranging (IR), wherein users that intend to establish a link with the BS adjust their transmission parameters so that uplink signals arrive at the BS synchronously and with approximately the same power level. In its basic form, the IR process develops through the following steps. First, a remote user computes frequency and timing estimates on the basis of a downlink control channel. The estimated parameters are then used in the uplink phase, during which each remote user transmits a randomly chosen code over a ranging time-slot that comprises a specified number of adjacent OFDM blocks. However, as a consequence of the different users' positions within the cell, uplink signals arrive at the BS at different time instants. Furthermore, since the ranging time-slot is randomly selected, several users may collide over a same ranging subchannel. After separating colliding codes and extracting timing and power information, the BS broadcasts a response message indicating the detected codes and giving the necessary instructions for timing and power adjustment.","The main functions of the BS during the ranging process may be classified as multi-user code detection, and multi-user timing and power estimation. In existing IR techniques, a long pseudo-noise (PN) code is transmitted by each RSS over all available ranging subcarriers. Code detection and timing recovery is then accomplished on the basis of suitable correlations computed in either the frequency or time domains. These approaches require huge computational complexity since each correlation must be evaluated for each possible ranging code and hypothesized timing offset. Moreover, separation of users is achieved by exploiting only the correlation properties of the employed code set. In the presence of multipath distortions, however, ranging subcarriers are subject to different attenuations and phase shifts, thereby leading to a loss of the code orthogonality. This gives rise to MAI, which severely degrades the system performance.","Alternative solutions involve replacing the PN ranging codes with a set of modified generalized chirp-like (GCL) sequences and mitigating the effects of channel distortion through differential detection of the ranging signals. Unfortunately, this approach is still plagued by significant MAT and, furthermore, it cannot be applied to interleaved OFDMA systems since ranging subcarriers must be assigned adjacently. Some attempts at reducing the system complexity rely on the decomposition of the multi-parameter estimation problem into a number of successive steps. However, they are only suitable for flat channels and fail in the presence of multipath distortions. Still another approach involves a reduction of the computational burden, but this is achieved at the price of an increased overhead using a dedicated common ranging code.","A common drawback, among others, of existing IR methods is their poor performance in the presence of frequency selective channels. For example, in one existing method a signal design is proposed which is robust to multipath distortions, wherein ranging signals are divided into several groups and each group is transmitted over an exclusive set of subcarriers with a specific timing delay. This approach leads to a significant reduction of MAI as signals of different groups are perfectly separable in either the frequency or time domain. Additionally, in existing approaches, phase rotations induced by residual CFOs between the uplink signals and the BS frequency scale are ignored even though such rotations may become significant over ranging periods spanning several adjacent blocks. In such cases, the received ranging signals are no longer orthogonal and CFO compensation is necessary to avoid a serious degradation of the system performance. Unfortunately, frequency recovery schemes for OFDMA systems are normally derived under the assumption that uplink signals are transmitted over disjoint subcarriers and, as a result, cannot be applied to a scenario where multiple codes share the same subchannel.","Accordingly, what would be desirable, but has not yet been provided, is a system and method for initial ranging in wireless communication systems, which addresses the foregoing shortcomings of existing initial ranging approaches.","The present invention relates to a system and method for initial ranging in wireless communication systems. OFDM blocks are received by an OFDMA base station transceiver from a plurality of remote user devices. After passing the received signal into a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) unit, ranging subchannels are extracted from the received blocks, and a ranging subchannel is selected for processing. The number of active codes that are present in the selected subchannel is then determined. Once this information is obtained, CFOs are subsequently estimated together with the active codes using a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. Timing delays and power levels are then estimated for each active code using maximum likelihood (ML) and least-squares (LS) estimation algorithms. The BS then broadcasts a response message indicating the detected codes and their corresponding instructions for adjusting synchronization parameters and power levels. A reduced complexity algorithm is also provided by the present invention for estimating timing delays and power levels with reduced computational complexity. In another embodiment of the present invention, CFOs, timing errors, and power levels are estimated using an Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (EPSRIT) algorithm.","The present invention relates to a system and method for initial ranging in wireless communication systems, wherein a specified number of OFDM blocks are received by the BS from a plurality of remote user devices. The received signal is passed to a DFT unit which extracts ranging subchannels from the received blocks, and a ranging subchannel is selected for processing. After determining the number of active codes in the considered subchannel, CFOs are estimated for each active code using a MUSIC algorithm. Timing delays and power levels are then estimated for each active code using ML and LS estimation algorithms. The estimated CFOs, timing delays, and power levels are broadcast by the base station to the remote user devices, which can optimize their power levels and synchronize with the BS reference scales. In another embodiment of the present invention, CFOs, timing errors, and power levels are estimated using an ESPRIT algorithm.","As used herein, matrices and vectors are denoted by boldface letters, with Ibeing the identity matrix of order N.

The equations\/algorithms according to the present invention can be utilized in OFDMA systems where M denotes the number of OFDM blocks in a ranging time-slot and each ranging subchannel can be accessed by no more than M\u22121 RSSs.

The subcarrier indices in the qth tile (q=0, 1, . . . , Q\u22121) of the rth subchannel (r=0, 1, . . . , R\u22121) are collected into a set J={i}with entries",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msubsup":{"mi":"i","mrow":[{"mi":["q","v"],"mo":","},{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mi":["qN","Q"]},{"mi":["rN","QR"]}],"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":{"mi":"v","mo":"."}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":["(r)","Q\u22121","(r),","R\u22121","(r),"],"sub":["q=0","q","R","R","r=0","R "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"10"},"Beginning in step , an OFDMA base station transceiver receives M OFDM blocks from a plurality of RSSs that intend to establish a link with the BS.

If a negative determination is made, control returns to step , so that an additional subchannel can be processed as described above to provide estimates of CFOs, timing delays, and power levels for the corresponding RSSs. If a positive determination is made, step  occurs.","After CFOs, timing delays, and power levels have been estimated for each RSS, this information is broadcast in step  to the remote users (i.e., the RSSs), so that each user device can adjust its transmission parameters and align its own uplink signal to the BS reference scales. Specifically, users that intend to access the network for the first time compute initial frequency and timing estimates on the basis of a downlink control signal broadcast by the BS. The estimated parameters are then employed by each RSS as synchronization references for the uplink ranging transmission. This means that, during the IR process, the CFOs are induced only by Doppler shifts and\/or estimation errors and, as a consequence, they will be quite small. For example, consider the IEEE 802.16 standard for WMANs with subcarrier spacing \u0394f=11.16 kHz and carrier frequency f=5 GHz. In the case of perfect downlink synchronization, the maximum CFO in the uplink is 2f\u03bd\/c, where \u03bddenotes the terminal speed while c=3\u00d710m\/s is the speed of light. Letting \u03bd=120 km\/h yields \u03b5\u22660.10, which means that the normalized CFO lies within 10% of the subcarrier spacing. Timing errors depend on the distances of the RSSs from the BS and their maximum value \u03b8corresponds to the round trip propagation delay for a user located at the cell boundary. This parameter is known and is given by \u03b8=2R\/(cT), where R is the cell radius and T=1\/(N\u0394f) is the sampling period. A simple way to counteract the effects of timing errors relies on the use of sufficiently long CPs comprising N\u2267\u03b8+L sampling intervals. This leads to a quasi-synchronous network in which timing errors do not produce any IBI and result only in phase shifts at the output of the receive DFT unit. The CP of data blocks should be made just greater than the channel length to minimize unnecessary overhead. It follows that accurate timing estimation must be accomplished during the ranging period in order to align all active users with the BS time-slot and to avoid IBI over the data section of the frame.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["18","18"]},"In step , the number of received codes in the considered subchannel is determined by evaluating the correlation matrix and applying an eigendecomposition (EVD) procedure.

However, since at this stage the BS has no knowledge of which codes have been transmitted over the considered subchannel, frequency estimates {{circumflex over (\u03c9)},{circumflex over (\u03c9)}, . . . ,{circumflex over (\u03c9)}} must be evaluated for the complete set {c,c, . . . ,c1}.","In step , active codes are identified. The present invention searches for the K largest values in the set {\u03a8({circumflex over (\u03c9)})}, say {\u03a8({circumflex over (\u03c9)})}, and declares as active the corresponding codes {c}. The CFO estimates are eventually found as {circumflex over (\u03c9)}=[{circumflex over (\u03c9)},{circumflex over (\u03c9)}, . . . ,{circumflex over (\u03c9)}]. The CFO estimation based on the MUSIC algorithm is referred to herein as the MUSIC-based frequency estimator (MFE), while the active code identification algorithm is referred to herein as the MUSIC-based code detector (MCD).","A key issue is the maximum CFO value that can be handled by MFE. To simplify the analysis, it is assumed that the ranging codes belong to the Fourier basis of order M and are given by:\n\n()=, 01 \u2003\u2003(20)\n\nfor k=1, 2, . . . ,M\u22121. Then, identifiability of the rotated codes {\u0393(\u03c9)c}is guaranteed as long as the CFOs are smaller than N\/(2MN) in magnitude. Let \u03b5=N\/(2MN) and \u03b5=\u2212N\/(2MN). In such a case, the received codes \u0393(\u03c9)cand \u0393(\u03c9)care identical and there is no way to distinguish among them. This fact limits the acquisition range of MFE to the interval |\u03b5|<N\/(2MN). Although this result has been derived for the Fourier basis specified in Equation 20, it may also apply to other code designs.\n","The computational load (complexity) of MFE can be assessed as follows. Assume that the number of active codes has already been found and is available at the BS. Then, computing {circumflex over (R)}in Equation 14 requires approximately O(MQV) operations, while the complexity for evaluating the metric \u03a8({tilde over (\u03c9)}) in Equation 19 is O(M(M\u2212K)) for each {tilde over (\u03c9)}. Denoting by N the number of candidate values {tilde over (\u03c9)} and observing that the maximization in Equation 18 must be performed over the entire code set {c,c, . . . ,c}, it follows that a total of O(NM(M\u2212K)) operations are required to find {circumflex over (\u03c9)}. The overall complexity of MFE is thus on the order of O(MQV+NM(M\u2212K)).

Since C({circumflex over (\u03c9)})C({circumflex over (\u03c9)}) is independent of q and v, the overall complexity involved in the computation of \u015c(i) for 0\u2266q\u2266Q\u22121 and 0\u2266v\u2266V\u22121 is approximately O(KQV(M+K)). Additional O(QV logQ) operations are eventually needed by the IDFTs in Equation 33. Compared to the first stage of LS-TE, it follows that the computational burden is reduced by a factor MKQV\/(M+K), which may be significant even for small values of the product QV.","Evaluating \u03a5({tilde over (\u03b8)}) for each value {tilde over (\u03b8)}=0,1, . . . ,\u03b8may still be computationally demanding, especially when \u03b8is large. A viable method to further reduce the system complexity is to decompose the timing error \u03b8into a fractional part \u03b2, less than Q, plus an integer part which is multiple of Q.

of Equations 45 and 46 indicates that the simplified estimator maximizes \u03a5({tilde over (\u03b8)}) in a decoupled fashion, where an estimate of \u03b2is obtained first and is then exploited to get {circumflex over (p)}. In assessing the computational load of this scheme, it is assumed that the quantities {\u015d(v,l)}have already been computed for 0\u2266v\u2266V\u22121. Then, evaluating {circumflex over (\u03b2)}through Equation 45 requires O(QVL) operations while O(QVL) operations are needed to get {circumflex over (p)}from Equation 46. Since estimates {circumflex over (\u03b2)}and {circumflex over (p)}must be obtained for each detected code, the overall complexity in the second stage of the estimation process is approximately O(KVL(Q+PV)). Compared to LS-TE, the computational requirement is thus reduced by a factor \u03b8\/(Q+PV). This advantage is achieved at the price of some performance degradation since the described search procedure is not guaranteed to locate the global maximum of \u03a5({tilde over (\u03b8)}).","A further simplification is possible by setting V=2.

Simulations of an IEEE 802.16 wireless MAN programmed in accordance with the present invention was conducted, which had a total of N=1024 subcarriers over an uplink bandwidth of 11.4 MHz. The sampling period is T=87.5 ns, corresponding to a subcarrier distance of 1\/(NT)=11.16 kHz. It was assumed that R=8 subchannels were available for initial ranging. Each subchannel was divided into Q=16 tiles uniformly spaced over the signal spectrum at a distance of N\/Q=64 subcarriers. To reduce the system complexity, the number of subcarriers in any tile was set to V=2. Each ranging time-slot included M=4 OFDM blocks. The ranging codes were taken from a Fourier set of length 4 and are randomly selected by the RSSs at each simulation run (expect for the sequence [1,1,1,1]). The discrete-time CIRs had order L=12. Their entries were modeled as independent and circularly symmetric Gaussian random variables with zero means and an exponential power delay profile, i.e.,\n\n()|}=\u03c3exp(\u2212\/12), 0,1, . . . ,11 \u2003\u2003(49)\n\nwhere \u03c3is related to the average transmission power of the kth RSS. In all subsequent simulations, \u03c3was chosen such that E{\u2225h\u2225}=1 for 1\u2266k\u2266K. In this way, the powers {P}of the ranging signals are random variables with unit means. Channels of different users were assumed to be statistically independent of each other. They were generated at each new simulation run and kept fixed over an entire time-slot. A cell radius of 10 km was considered, corresponding to a maximum propagation delay of \u03b8=204 sampling periods. Ranging blocks were preceded by a CP of length N=256 in order to avoid IBI. The normalized CFOs were uniformly distributed over the interval [\u2212\u03a9,\u03a9] and varied at each run.

During IR, the CFOs are only due to Doppler shifts and\/or to estimation errors and, in consequence, they are assumed to lie within a small fraction of the subcarrier spacing. Timing offsets depend on the distance of the RSSs from the BS and their maximum value is thus limited to the round trip delay from the cell boundary. In order to eliminate IBI, it is assumed that, during the ranging process, the CP length comprises N\u2267\u03b8+L sampling periods, where \u03b8is the maximum expected timing error.

The latter results in a disturbance term plus an attenuation of the useful signal component. To simplify the analysis, in the ensuing discussion the disturbance term is treated as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable while the signal attenuation is considered as part of the channel impulse response.
