{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to buying and selling products on the Internet, and in particular to providing customized offers for e-commerce.","When purchasing goods, most websites follow a model popularized by Amazon.com and others. The user first selects a product to purchase from a product webpage then must navigate through checkout pages on separate web pages. Similarly, when selling goods, a user may create a website or go to a website such as eBay.com to list his product for sale. The requirement of navigating through numerous checkout pages can often be tedious and the requirement to go to a particular website to make a sale or purchase fails to actively entice users of web browsers to consume goods.","Ads take many forms on the internet. Typically, a \u201cbanner ad\u201d is a rectangular graphic element on a webpage and has artwork and a product description along with a hyperlink. If the user clicks on the ad, the user is taken to the website offering the product or service. There are also other types of ads, such as pop-up ads, ads that incorporate video, pop-under ads and floating ads. These ads typically describe one product or service, or a class of products or services. There are also dynamically alterable banner ads. These ads can scroll either horizontally or vertically.","A number of techniques exist for providing ads in web pages. A banner ad is generally produced by embedding HTML code for that banner within the HTML coding for a given web page. Consumers can obtain more information by clicking through the ad, thus being referred to the advertiser's site, and click through counts can be monitored. Interstitial ads are displayed in an interval of time that occurs after a user has clicked on a hot-link displayed by a browser to retrieve a desired web page but before that browser has started rendering that page. Ads can also be provided via a \u201cpush\u201d application program that connects with a server, typically during off-hours. Ads are downloaded for later display. A user profile is used to determine the type of ads for that user. Real-time downloading and rendering of advertising HTML files uses advertising files stored on remote web servers. These ads show content in a \u201cstreamed\u201d media file that relies on a continuous real-time network connection existing to a remote web server.","While banner ads often attempt to entice users of web browsers to consume goods, they often fall short since they require users to be taken to other websites and typically engage in numerous web page transitions to purchase a good. The end result is that the conversion rate is lower than it otherwise could be because of these traditional requirements.","Embodiments of the present invention overcome some or all of the aforementioned deficiencies in the related art. According to one embodiment, a marketplace server performs at least one functionality for enabling an end user to purchase or sell a product via a web banner. The functionality may include all of the functionality necessary to engage in and complete such transactions, including performing fraud checks, financial transactions, and causing shipment. Compared to technologies where such functionality is disseminated between multiple parties, such as a where one party obtains transaction information from end users and subsequently passes the transaction information to another party such as a retailer, the functionality discussed with reference to the marketplace server may increase efficiencies in information processing, reduce complexities regarding managing and communicating consumer information, and increase transaction speeds.","According to one embodiment, a marketplace server may perform at least one functionality for enabling an end user to purchase a product via a web banner. For example, the marketplace server may provide product information including a description of a product and a price of the product for display in a web banner. In response to a user input via a buyer computer activating the web banner, the marketplace server may receive a product purchase request from the buyer computer. The marketplace server may then process the product purchase request. For example, the marketplace server may perform a fraud check on the buyer, perform a financial transaction for a price of the product, and cause the product to be shipped to the buyer. After processing the product purchase request, the marketplace server may provide confirmation of the purchase to the buyer via the web banner.","According to a further embodiment, a marketplace server may perform at least one functionality for enabling an end user to sell a particular product via a web banner. For example, the marketplace server may provide product information including a description of a product and a suggested sale price of the product for display in a web banner. In response to a user input via a seller computer activating the web banner, the marketplace server may receive a product sale request from the seller computer. The marketplace server may then process the product sale request, and provide confirmation of the product sale request to the seller computer via the web banner.","According to another embodiment, a marketplace server may perform at least one functionality for enabling an end user to search for a product to sell via a web banner. For example, the marketplace server may receive a product sale request from a seller computer via the web banner, where the product sale request includes a product identifier. The marketplace server may then process the product sale request, and provide confirmation of the product sale request to the seller computer via the web banner.","According to yet another embodiment, a marketplace server may acquire information about a user of an end user computing device. For example, the marketplace server may acquire various types of information about a particular user, such as demographic information, behavioral information, and product interest information. Marketplace server may then identify the user when the user accesses a third party web site, and then generate a customized offer for the user. For example, the customized offer may be for the sale or purchase of a product, and may be generated using at least some of the acquired information. The offer may then be communicated to the user.","In some embodiments, the customized offer may be provided to the user via a web banner. In the event the user accepts the offer, subsequent transaction processing may also all be performed within the web banner. For example, the end user may purchase or sell a product subject to the offer within the web banner. By combining customized offers with the ability to complete a transaction within a web banner, a powerful product merchandising tool is provided.","For a fuller understanding of the nature and advantages of embodiments of the present invention, reference should be made to the ensuing detailed description and accompanying drawings. Other aspects, objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the drawings and detailed description that follows. However, the scope of the invention will be fully apparent from the recitations of the claims.","Embodiments of the present invention provide systems, apparatuses, and methods for facilitating e-commerce via a banner ad. According to one embodiment, a marketplace server performs at least one functionality for enabling an end user to purchase or sell a product via a web banner. The functionality may include all of the functionality necessary to engage in and complete such transactions, including performing fraud checks, financial transactions, and causing shipment. Compared to technologies where such functionality is disseminated between multiple parties, such as a where one party obtains transaction information from end users and subsequently passes the transaction information to another party such as a retailer, the functionality discussed with reference to the marketplace server may increase efficiencies in information processing, reduce complexities regarding managing and communicating consumer information, and increase transaction speeds.","Banner ads according to embodiments of the present invention may allow a user operating an end user computing device to engage in and complete transactions within the banner ad. For example, the banner ad may advertise a product to be sold by a third party. In such a case, the user may click on the banner ad to purchase the product, enter purchase-related information such as mailing address and credit card information into the banner ad, and receive a confirmation of purchase within the banner ad. As a result, an entire product purchase transaction may occur within the banner ad.","For another example, the banner ad may solicit sales of a product from the user operating the end user computing device. In such a case, the user would be a seller rather than a buyer, where the seller lists an item for sale via the banner ad. According to one embodiment, the banner ad may solicit sales of a specific product. For example, the banner ad may identify a particular product by providing an image of the product and\/or a description of the product, and may include a suggested sale price of the product. The user may click on the banner ad to sell the product, enter sale-related information such as credit card information and a condition of the product into the banner ad, and receive a confirmation that the user's product will be listed for sale. According to another embodiment, the banner ad may generally solicit sales of any product. For example, the banner ad may include a search box allowing the user to search for a product to sell. If the search finds the searched-for product, the user may then enter sale-related information into the banner ad. If the search does not find the searched-for product, the user may then add a new product to a product database.","When the banner ad solicits sales of a product from the user operating the end user computing device, the user provides information for listing the product for sale. Such information, once submitted, may then be pushed out to other users via other banner ads. Accordingly, while one user may list a product for sale by the user via a banner ad, another user, via another banner ad, may view that listing. In some cases, the banner ad that advertises a product to be sold to the user may show all of the listings associated with that product, including listings from numerous sellers, and including listings for various conditions of the product, such as new or used. In some cases, the banner ad may show a listing having the lowest price for the advertised product.","In some embodiments, a customized offer may be provided to a user. The marketplace server may store information about a number of users, and may identify one of the users when they access a third party web site. The marketplace server may then generate a customized offer for that user, and communicate it to the user. In such a fashion, users surfing anywhere on the Internet may be provided with customized offers for the purchase or sale of products. In some embodiments, this customer targeting and customized offers may be combined with transaction processing within a web banner. Such a combination may advantageously increase the likelihood of the user engaging and completing a product purchase or sale.","In this fashion, banner ads may be used to facilitate e-commerce in a multi-seller and multi-buyer environment. Such functionality may advantageously enable users to engage and finalize product purchases and product sale listings without leaving a host website and without visiting a website dedicated to facilitating such transactions. Such functionality may also advantageously push purchase and sale opportunities to Internet users so as to entice the users to engage in such transactions. Such functionality may also further encourage users to purchase or sell products via time-limited, customized offers.","System for Facilitating Web Banner Commerce",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","140","150"]},"Marketplace server  may be a single computer server or a network of computing devices.

For example, banner interface module  may include an application programming interface (API) allowing activation of elements of banner  to execute functionality of marketplace server , and\/or allowing data entry into banner  to be passed through to marketplace server . Such communication between banner interface module  and other devices, such as webserver  and\/or end user computing device , may be over a secure connection. Payment module  may perform at least one payment-related functionality as described below, such as user authentication and credit or debit card authorization. Product shipping module  may perform at least one product shipping-related functionality as described below, such as causing a product to be shipped to a buyer. Account management module  may perform at least one account management functionality as described below, such as executing user login procedures. User information database  may store various information concerning buyers and sellers, while product information database  may store various information concerning products to be purchased or sold. User information database  and product information database  may be provided separately or as a single database.","As briefly described, a seller may use end user computing device  to provide, to marketplace server  via web banner , information concerning a product to be sold by the seller. However, in some embodiments, a seller may provide information concerning products to be sold via other mechanisms.","For example, e-commerce system  may further include webserver . Webserver  may be a single computer server or a network of computing devices, operated by a third party independent from marketplace server  or operated by the same operators of marketplace server . Webserver  may include tangible non-transient storage media that has computer code stored thereon. Webserver  may also include a database  for storing various information. Webserver  may cause a webpage  to be displayed on a display of end user (seller) computing device . Webpage  may enable a user of end user computing device  to submit information concerning products to be sold to marketplace server . In one embodiment, webserver  is operated by the same operators of marketplace server , and webpage  includes various fields for receiving such information from end user computing device . In another embodiment, webserver  is operated by operators different from those of marketplace server , and webpage  includes an in-line store in communication with marketplace server .","For another example, e-commerce system  may further include end-user (seller) computing device . End-user computing device  may be in direct communication with marketplace server , and be capable of providing information directly to marketplace server . For example, end-user computing device  may be used by a professional seller that communicates user and product information to marketplace server via an API or via a file transfer protocol (FTP).","Processes for Selling Products to End Users",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["202","150","146","150","146","122","110","140"]},"The advertisement may advertise products for sale by any type of party, and marketplace server may store associations between the advertised products and the parties selling such products. For example, the operator of marketplace server  may wish to sell a product, and thus the advertised product may be associated with information identifying the operator of marketplace server . For another example, an end user may wish to sell a product, and thus the advertised product may be associated with information identifying the end user. The products advertised may be new products or previously used products, and the information advertising such products may include information identifying whether the product is new or used.","The advertisement may advertise products for sale by any number of parties. For example, a particular product may be advertised for sale by a plurality of end users. For another example, a particular product may be advertised for sale by a plurality of end users as well as an operator of marketplace server. In this fashion, a multi-buyer, multi-seller marketplace is formed.","In operation , end user computing device  calls marketplace server  to return a current price and availability for an advertised product. In one embodiment, end user computing device  may make such a call automatically when the banner loads. In another embodiment, end user computing device  may make such a call by, for example, activating a button labeled \u201cCurrent Price and Availability\u201d on banner . Activation of such a button may cause end user computing device  to make an API call to marketplace server . The API call may include an identifier identifying the product being advertised. In response to receiving such a request, marketplace server  may search product information database  for a current price and availability of the advertised product, and return such information to end user computing device .","The current price may be any price selected by marketplace server . For example, the current price may be a minimum of all prices for the product stored in the product information database . For another example, the current price may be a minimum of all prices for the product taking into account shipping charges. In one embodiment, the current price may be selected as discussed in United States Patent Publication No. 2009\/164338, which is commonly assigned and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","In operation , marketplace server  receives a purchase request from end user computing device .

For example, a first offer provided to a user may offer a 10% discount. A subsequent offer, provided after the first offer expires, may offer the user a 20% discount. For another example, marketplace server  may use the user information to determine that the user is a high-value buyer (e.g., a repeat buyer), and use the product information to determine that a product has a high margin and has been held in inventory for a long time. Based on such information, marketplace server  may generate an offer that provides a significant discount to move the product and to re-engage the valuable user.","In operation , marketplace server  communicates the customized offer to the user.

That is, to accept the offer, the user must activate the web banner  by, for example, activating a \u201cYes please\u201d button on web banner . Once the offer is executed, marketplace server  receives an indication of acceptance. Upon receiving such an indication, marketplace server  may process the offer. Processing the offer may include performing operations substantially similar to those previously discussed regarding the sale and purchase of products. In this case, however, offer information stored in product information database , for example, information indicating the product being offered for purchase or sale and information indicating the price for the purchase or sale, may be used for facilitating the transaction. For example, where the user accepts an offer to purchase a product, processing may begin at operation  discussed with respect to . In such a case, the purchase request will refer to the offer information.","According to one embodiment, once an offer is accepted within web banner , the subsequent processing for fulfilling the offer is also performed within web banner .
