title: Device and method for preventing superheating of liquids in a microwave oven
abstract: A safety device for reducing the likelihood of superheating a liquid includes a transducer disposed on a support surface proximate to a placed container containing a liquid. The transducer generates a vibrational force in the container and onto the liquid that creates nucleation within the liquid. The nucleation allows the liquid to boil, thus preventing the liquid from becoming superheated.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to microwave ovens, and in particular relates to a device and method of use to prevent superheating of liquid during heating within the microwave oven.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Microwave ovens are commonly used to heat foods, beverages, and the like by people of all ages and intelligences. Unknown to the general public, heating liquids in a microwave oven can create a very dangerous condition. For example, if the water contained in a new or very smooth cup or bowl (e.g., one that does not have any scratches to initiate boiling) is brought to a temperature of 100\u00b0 C. or greater in a microwave, it can be brought to a superheated (metastable) state.","Superheating takes place when a substance is heated above the temperature at which a change of state would ordinarily take place without such a change of state occurring, for example, the heating of a liquid above its boiling point without boiling taking place. When this superheated state is disturbed, a large amount of water can vaporize at once, causing the liquid to \u201cexplode\u201d into the face of the person taking the cup or bowl out of the microwave resulting in first and second degree burns to the person.","Burn injuries from microwave use are not uncommon and are familiar to emergency room physicians. Presently, microwaves have no apparent indications to warn a person that a liquid is in a superheated condition. While precautions exist that can be taken to avoid creating a superheated condition, these precautions (and the condition itself) are not well known by the general public.","In view of the above, it is therefore desirable to have a device that reduces the likelihood of liquid superheating while being easy to use by the general public.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a device that reduces the likelihood of liquid superheating.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a device adaptable for a microwave oven and easy to use by the general public.","A safety device according to the present invention includes a transducer disposed on a support surface. The support surface is adapted to support a container containing a liquid within a microwave oven. The transducer prevents the liquid from becoming superheated by vibrating the support surface such that the liquid within the container nucleates, thus allowing the liquid to boil.","In a preferred embodiment, the transducer is embedded within or secured to the support surface. Alternatively, the support surface may be either an integral element or removable element of the microwave oven. The transducer may be powered from a power source powering the microwave oven. The transducer may be powered by a pulsed impulse function, or driven in a sinusoidal mode and preferably operates at ultrasonic frequencies.","Referring now to the drawing wherein like numerals refer to like elements, one sees that  depicts a safety device  according to the present invention with the safety device designed to be used with a microwave oven . The safety device  generally includes a transducer  positioned in a support surface  within the microwave oven .","In operation, the transducer  creates a vibrational force of a sufficient amplitude to cause standing waves in the surface  of a container  containing a liquid , for example, but not limited to water. The waves generated by the transducer  create nucleation sites for the liquid , thus allowing the liquid to boil. By boiling, a superheated state is avoided for the liquid .","The support surface  of a type known to those skilled in the art within the microwave oven  is sufficiently rigid to allow vibrations generated by the transducer  to propagate throughout the entire support surface with a negligible decrease in amplitude. The standing waves generated by the transducer  are of sufficient amplitude to dissipate or shock the liquid  out of a superheated state. When breaking waves occur on the surface B, this breaking wave action provides nucleation sites.","Standing waves of much less amplitude may be sufficient. High amplitude ultrasonic energy will produce cavitation even under normal conditions. When the liquid is in a metastable state to begin with, the amplitude needed to induce cavitations will be greatly reduced.","The transducer  may be any device capable of generating a vibrational force sufficient to cause nucleation of the liquid  within the container . The transducer  may be powered using a power source (not shown) that powers the microwave oven .","The transducer  may operate in several different modes, in that the transducer may create the vibrational force randomly, continuously, or periodically. For example, the transducer  may be powered by pulsed impulse functions with sufficient amplitude to shock the liquid . Alternatively, the transducer  may driven in a sinusoidal mode, but at ultrasonic frequencies, so that the standing waves would have very small wavelengths.","The transducer  may be activated manually, but is preferably automatically operated once the microwave oven  is activated. A timer (not shown) may also be used to activate the transducer  after a preset amount of time in the event that the container  is left within the microwave oven  after the microwave oven has finished heating the liquid .","In the preferred embodiment, shown in , the transducer  is embedded within or secured to the support surface . Alternatively, the support surface  may be an integral part or a removable element of the microwave oven .","Accordingly, the safety device  creates waves within the liquid . The waves create nucleation sites that allow the liquid  to safely boil and avoid becoming superheated. The device is easy to operate, thus making the microwave oven  safer for general use.","In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be better understood in view of the following description of the invention taken together with the drawing(s) wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
