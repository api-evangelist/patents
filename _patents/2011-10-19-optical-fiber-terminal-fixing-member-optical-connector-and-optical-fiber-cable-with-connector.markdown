Unlike the metal cable, the optical fiber cable is free from a problem of emitting noise therearound due to increase in the communication speed, and thus is a signal transmission path suitable for high-speed and large-capacity information communication.","The optical fiber cable is provided at an end thereof with a removable optical connector. The optical connector includes a terminal (optical fiber terminal) including a ferrule and the like to be attached to the end of the optical fiber cable, and a housing having a structure for being connected to another optical connector or the like. On the other hand, an optical connector is also provided on a device performing communication, and the optical fiber cable can be connected with the device performing communication by connecting the optical connectors to each other.

The connection between optical fiber cables is called wire-to-wire connection.","Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-107573","Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent No. 3813496","When optical fiber cables are applied to wire harnesses in a vehicle, a device performing communication through the wire harnesses is disposed at each component unit of the vehicle, such as a roof portion, a floor portion, an engine and surroundings thereof, and an instrument panel and surroundings thereof. Therefore, among components in the wire harnesses connecting between the communication devices disposed at the respective component units, particularly the optical connector used for the wire-to-wire connection can be repeatedly mounted and dismounted many times, for example, in the assembly process and the mounting process during the vehicle production, and in the inspection and maintenance, and thus can be subjected to strong impacts such as tensions at those occasions. The optical connector is also subjected to vibration, impacts, and the like while the vehicle is running. Accordingly, particularly the optical connectors used in a vehicle are particularly required to be strong against vibration and impact.","Accordingly, there is a need to provide an optical fiber terminal fixing member which can achieve an optical connector that is strong against vibration and impact, and to provide an optical connector which uses the optical fiber terminal fixing member, and an optical fiber cable with the connector.","In some embodiments, an optical fiber terminal fixing member is configured to be inserted into an optical connector to fix an optical fiber terminal to a housing. The optical connector includes: the optical fiber terminal attached to an end of an optical fiber cable; and the housing that holds the optical fiber terminal. The optical fiber cable includes: an optical fiber; a tensile member disposed along a longitudinal direction of the optical fiber; and a coating portion that covers the optical fiber and the tensile member.

Note that the present invention is not limited by the embodiments.","In the description given below, an optical fiber terminal used for the optical connectors according to a first embodiment and a second embodiment of the present invention will be described first, and then, the optical connectors according to the first and the second embodiments and an optical fiber terminal fixing member according to a third embodiment used in the optical connectors will be described next.","(Optical Fiber Terminal)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","1","2","3","4","2","2","10","10"],"i":"e"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"],"i":["a ","aa ","aa ","aa","b ","a","c ","b ","b ","a","ab ","c ","aa","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1"],"i":["a","aa ","aaa ","aab ","aaa ","aaa","aaa ","aab ","aa "]},"Referring back to , the ferrule  has a cylindrical shape on the whole, and includes a front end portion , a flange portion provided along the outer circumference, a main body , a base portion , and the optical fiber fixing member . The ferrule  is made of, for example, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resin excelling in thermal resistance, mechanical strength, and moldability. The front end portion has a front end face . The base portion is located at an end on the opposite side of the front end face , and provided along the outer circumference thereof with projecting portions , thus having a corrugated surface. A groove portion is formed along the outer circumference between the main body and the flange portion . The ferrule  is also formed with an insertion hole for inserting the end of the optical fiber cable  therein so that the insertion hole penetrates from the front end face to the base portion . The diameter of the insertion hole is set to substantially equal to or slightly larger than the outside diameter of the optical fiber at the front end portion , and set to substantially equal to or slightly larger than the outside diameter of the optical fiber element wire at other portions (except at an open hole to be described later).","The optical fiber fixing member has a gutter-like shape, and includes a groove for holding the optical fiber element wire . The main body of the ferrule  is formed on a side face thereof with the open hole for inserting the optical fiber fixing member therein. The open hole has a shape that allows inner walls of the open hole to come contact with outer walls of the optical fiber fixing member substantially without a space therebetween when the optical fiber fixing member is inserted. In addition, the open hole is communicated with the insertion hole , and is formed to a depth allowing a portion of the element wire coating portion lab of the optical fiber cable  inserted in the ferrule  to be exposed. A structure of the open hole of the ferrule  will be described later in detail. When the widths of the top of the optical fiber fixing member and the bottom of the groove are designed to have sizes allowing the optical fiber fixing member , when being set on the optical fiber, to project from the circumference around a front end face of the flange portion of the optical fiber terminal  by about 0.1 mm to about 1 mm, a pressing force obtained by inserting the optical fiber terminal  into a housing  (to be described later) strengthens the fixing of the optical fiber and provides a resistance against tension.","A description will be made next of a method for attaching the optical fiber terminal  to the end of the optical fiber cable . First, the optical fiber cable  is sequentially inserted through the protection boot  and the clinching ring . Next, the outer coating portion and the element wire coating portion lab at the end of the optical fiber cable  are partially removed to externally expose the optical fiber , the element wire coating portion , and the tensile member by the respective predetermined lengths.","Then, the end of the optical fiber cable  is inserted from the side of the base portion into the insertion hole of the ferrule . At this time, the optical fiber cable  is inserted so that a front end face (refer to ) of the optical fiber inserted in the insertion hole is coplanar with the front end face of the ferrule . Then, the element wire coating portion of the optical fiber element wire results to be located in the position of the open hole ","Next, the optical fiber fixing member is inserted into the open hole so as to hold the optical fiber element wire and thus to fix the optical fiber element wire to the ferrule .  is a cross-sectional view in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the ferrule  for explaining the state of inserting the optical fiber fixing member into the ferrule . As illustrated in , a support base is provided on a bottom surface of the open hole of the ferrule  along the insertion direction of the optical fiber element wire , and the optical fiber element wire , when inserted, is supported by the support base ","The optical fiber fixing member is inserted into the open hole , and thus, the optical fiber element wire is held by the groove . The groove is formed inside thereof with a corrugated portion . Therefore, when the optical fiber fixing member holds the optical fiber element wire with the groove , the frictional force increases between the groove and the optical fiber element wire . In addition, the optical fiber fixing member , when inserted in the open hole , is pressed to be in contact with the ferrule  because the inner walls of the open hole are in contact with the outer walls of the optical fiber fixing member substantially without a space therebetween, as described above. The optical fiber fixing member fixes the optical fiber element wire to the ferrule  with the frictional force and the pressure described above. By fixing the optical fiber element wire to the ferrule  using the optical fiber fixing member such as described above, the attaching operation can be continued, for example, without waiting for adhesive to be solidified in the case of fixing the optical fiber element wire with the adhesive. Thus, the time for the working process can be shortened.","Next, the tensile member is placed on the base portion of the ferrule . At this time, it is preferable to place the tensile member uniformly over the outer circumference of the base portion . Then, the clinching ring  is fitted onto the base portion , and the base portion is crimped by the clinching ring  together with the tensile member placed on the base portion . Thereafter, the protection boot  is mounted on the clinching ring . Thus, the optical fiber terminals  are attached to the optical fiber cable  to produce the optical fiber cable with terminals. The protection boot  is made of, for example, rubber or elastic plastic, and prevents a joint portion between the optical fiber terminal  and the optical fiber cable  from bending to a smaller bending radius than an allowable radius, thereby preventing the optical fiber element wire from breaking.","Here, in the optical fiber terminal , the clinching ring  fixes the tensile member to the ferrule , and thus, the tensile member is fixed to the ferrule  to be integrated therewith. Therefore, a strong structure against vibration and impact is obtained.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["1","1","2","2","3","1","10","1","10","2","2","2","3","1","2"],"i":["b ","b ","d ","d ","da ","d","b","da "]},"In addition, in the optical fiber terminal , the optical fiber element wire is fixed to the ferrule  using the optical fiber fixing member . Accordingly, the optical fiber terminal  is further firmly connected with the optical fiber cable , and thus is further strengthened against vibration and impact.","As has been described above, the optical fiber terminal  hardly separates from the optical fiber cable  even when the optical fiber cable  is pulled due to vibration or impact. Thus, the optical fiber terminal  is strong against vibration and impact, and can endure a tensile force of, for example, as large as 100 N.","(First to Third Embodiments)","A description will be made next of the optical connectors according to the first and the second embodiments of the present invention, and of the optical fiber terminal fixing member according to the third embodiment used in the optical connectors.  is a view schematically illustrating a state in which the optical connectors according to the first and the second embodiments are used.  illustrates an in-vehicle communication system . In this in-vehicle communication system , a control board  and a control board  provided in devices performing communication are connected to each other through optical fiber cables  and  with connectors, and perform mutual transmission of control signals.","The control boards  and  are respectively equipped with fiber optical transceivers (FOTs) and , each of which has a female connector structure. The optical fiber cable  with connectors is a cable in which male optical connectors  according to the first embodiment are attached to both ends of the optical fiber cable  illustrated in . The optical fiber cable  with connectors is a cable in which the optical connector  and a female optical connector  according to the second embodiment are attached to the respective ends of the optical fiber cable . The optical connectors  of the optical fiber cables  and  with connectors are connected to the FOTs and , respectively, while the other optical connector  of the optical fiber cable  with connectors is connected (that is, connected wire-to-wire) to the optical connector  of the optical fiber cable  with connectors. Accordingly, a signal transmission path is formed by the optical fiber cables  and  with connectors between the control boards  and , and thus, high-speed and large-capacity communication is enabled.","Next, the optical connector according to the first embodiment will be specifically described. , B, and C are front, side, and plan views, respectively, schematically illustrating the optical fiber cable with connectors in which the optical connector according to the first embodiment is attached to the end of the optical fiber cable.  is a partial cross-sectional view of the optical connector illustrated in .","As illustrated in and , the optical connector  includes the optical fiber terminals  illustrated in , the housing  for holding the optical fiber terminals , and an optical fiber terminal fixing member  according to the third embodiment for fixing the optical fiber terminals  to the housing .","The housing  includes two insertion holes formed in parallel with each other in the longitudinal direction for inserting therein the two optical fiber terminals  attached to the respective ends of the duplex optical fiber cable ; a slit formed so as to penetrate from a top surface to a bottom surface of the housing  and so as to communicate with the insertion holes in order to insert therein the optical fiber terminal fixing member ; an elastic arm portion formed so as to slant obliquely upward from the front end to the rear end in the longitudinal direction in the substantially middle in the width direction; a hook portion for hooking and stopping a front end portion of the arm portion ; and a latch projection formed on an upper portion of the arm portion . An inner wall of the insertion hole is provided with a restricting surface that abuts against the front end face of the flange portion of the optical fiber terminal  to restrict the optical fiber terminal  from moving toward the side of the front end face thereof.

As illustrated in , when viewed from the side, the spring portion is curved in a circular arc shape so as to project toward the latch portion , and formed so that the arc-shaped portion projects higher than the surface of the fitting portion on the side of the latch portion . In the present embodiment, the width of the fitting portions and the width of the groove portion are designed to have almost the same size. However, when the width of the groove portion is set to be larger than that of the fitting portions by 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm so that the spring portion applies pressure, a tensile force applied to the optical fiber cable  is absorbed by the spring so as to be prevented from acting instantaneously on the housing , and thus, the housing  can be effectively prevented from breaking.","Next, a method for assembling the optical connector  will be described. First, as illustrated in , the two optical fiber terminals  are inserted into the insertion holes of the housing  so that the front end faces of the flange portions of the ferrules  abut against the restricting surfaces in the insertion holes .

Accordingly, the ferrule  is pressed and stopped by the restricting surface of the housing . The latch portion passes between the two ferrules , and the latching pawl is engaged into the slit in the top surface of the housing .

The two ferrules  are disposed in the two gaps ","As described above, the fitting portions of the optical fiber terminal fixing member  according to the third embodiment fit in the groove portions of the ferrules , and the optical fiber terminal fixing member  also fits in the slit . Accordingly, the optical fiber terminals  are firmly fixed to the housing , and thus, the optical connector  is further strengthened against vibration and impact. Therefore, the optical connector  can endure a tensile force of, for example, as large as  N, and has high connection reliability. In addition, in the first embodiment, the optical fiber terminal fixing member  uses the spring portion to press the optical fiber terminal  to be stopped against the restricting surface of the housing , and thus, the optical fiber terminal  is further restricted from moving toward the front end face thereof.
