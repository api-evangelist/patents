{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["Botanical designation: ","Cultivar denomination: \u2018WBPREST\u2019.","The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of plant, botanically known as and hereinafter referred to by the name \u2018Wbprest\u2019.","The new plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Hillegom, The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program is to develop new compact and freely flowering plants with attractive foliage and flowers.","The new plant originated from a cross-pollination conducted by the Inventor during the summer of 2003 of a proprietary selection of , not patented, as the female, or seed, parent with a proprietary selection of , not patented, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor in July, 2005 as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination in a controlled environment in Hillegom, The Netherlands.","Asexual reproduction of the new plant by divisions and by micro propagation in a controlled greenhouse environment in Hillegom, The Netherlands since February, 2006 has shown that the unique features of this new plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction.","Plants of the new have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and various cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype.","The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of \u2018Wbprest\u2019. These characteristics in combination distinguish \u2018Wbprest\u2019 as a new and distinct plant:\n\n","Plants of the new can be compared to plants of the female parent selection. Plants of the new differ from plants of the female parent selection in the following characteristics:\n\n","Plants of the new can be compared to plants of the male parent selection. Plants of the new differ from plants of the male parent selection in the following characteristics:\n\n","Plants of the new can be compared to plants of \u2018Kahome\u2019, not patented. Plants of the new differ from plants of \u2018Kahome\u2019 in the following characteristics:\n\n","Plants of the new can also be compared to plants of \u2018Nana\u2019, not patented. Plants of the new differ from plants of \u2018Nana\u2019 in the following characteristics:\n\n","The aforementioned photographs and following observations, measurements and values describe plants of the new grown during the late spring in ground beds in an outdoor nursery in Hillegom, The Netherlands and under cultural conditions which closely approximate commercial production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures ranged from 14\u00b0 C. to 28\u00b0 C. and night temperatures ranged from 4\u00b0 C. to 18\u00b0 C. Plants were three years old when the photographs and the description were taken.
