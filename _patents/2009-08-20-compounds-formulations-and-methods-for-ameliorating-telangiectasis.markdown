No. 11\/449,079 filed Jun. 8, 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,838,563, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/853,585 filed May 25, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,439,241, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/473,611, filed May 27, 2003. The contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The present teachings are directed to compositions and methods for treatment of telangiectasias.","Telangiectasias are highly prevalent skin disorders. Telangiectasias are visible small, red, purple or blue surface blood vessels that can be located on the face, upper chest, neck or other parts of the body. Telangiectatic blood vessels, which can include swollen blood vessels, spider veins, red dermal patches, purple dermal patches, or blue dermal patches are abnormal and are not necessary for any essential body function.","Telangiectatic blood vessels can appear with or without a preceding or concurrent skin or internal disease. Telangiectasias can develop anywhere within the body, but can be most easily seen in the skin. Telangiectasias include essential or primary telangiectasias, which include blood vessel dilations of unknown etiology. Generalized essential telangiectasias (GET) exhibit a widespread distribution pattern over the body. Other primary telangiectases include angioma serpiginosum, ataxia telangiectasia, angiomas and spider naevi. Some other examples of conditions, syndromes, diseases and disorders which can include telangiectasias are CREST Syndrome (acronym for Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyl), and Telangiextasis), hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome), Ataxia-telangiectasia, rosacea (also known as acne rosacea), basal cell carcinoma, scleroderma, unilateral nevoid telangiectasia, Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.","A telangiectasia can be a symptom of rosacea, However, rosacea also encompasses erythema, and is, accordingly, a phenomenon distinct from a telangiectasia.","Current treatments for ameliorating telangiectasias include laser therapy and electro-optical synergy (ELOS), which combines intense pulsed optical energy and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energy into a single pulse (Sadick, N S et al., J. Drugs Dermatolog. 4: 181-186, 2005).","The present inventors have developed formulations and treatment methods for mitigating telangiectasias. The methods include topically applying a formulation comprising an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist to an affected area of the skin of a subject in need of treatment of a telangiectasia. Topical application of an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist leads to a reduction in the visibility of telangiectatic blood vessels directly at and adjacent to the site of application. A formulation which can be used in the methods can further comprise additional components such as an excipient. In various aspects, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist can be applied to the skin in a topical skin formulation that is effective for mitigating a telangiectasia but does not induce serious systemic side effects in the patient.","Accordingly, in various aspects, the present teachings disclose methods of ameliorating telangiectatic skin. The methods comprise topically administering to the skin of a subject in need of treatment a composition comprising at least one active ingredient selected from an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist, a prodrug thereof, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a hydrate thereof, a solvate thereof and a combination thereof. In various aspects, a composition is administered in an amount effective for mitigating a telangiectasia. An amount effective for mitigating a telangiectasia can be an amount locally effective for amelioration of telangiectasia upon topical administration. In addition, in various configurations, an effective amount of an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist for ameliorating a telangiectasia can be non-restrictive with regard to other skin care and cosmetic products. Accordingly, a formulation comprising an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist can be compatible with, e.g., separate application of make-up. Furthermore, in some configurations, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist can be comprised by a skin care or cosmetic product, so that the user can simultaneously receive the benefits of both suppressing a telangiectasia as well as masking, coloring and\/or cleansing skin by application of a single product. In various configurations, a subject can be a mammal, such as a human, a farm animal, or a companion animal.","In various configurations, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist which can be comprised by a composition described herein can be any \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist, as well as active solvates, hydrates, prodrugs such as esters, stereoisomers including enantiomers, polymorphic forms, and crystalline forms thereof. In addition, various formulations can comprise at least one \u03b11-adrenergic receptor agonist, at least one \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist, or a combination thereof. In various configurations, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist can be a selective \u03b11-adrenergic receptor agonist, a selective \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist, or an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist which is non-selective for either type of \u03b1-adrenergic receptor. Accordingly, some \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonists which can be used in the disclosed methods and compositions include amphetamine, apraclonidine, brimonidine, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, dextroamphetamine, dopamine, I-dobutamine, ephedrine, epinephrine, epinine (N-methyl-dopamine), ethylnorepinephrine, guanabenz, guanfacine, levarterenol, lofexidine, mephentermine, metaraminol, methamphetamine, methoxamine, \u03b1-methyldopa, \u03b1-methylnorepinephrine, methylphenidate, mivazerol, mitodrine, moxonidine, naphazoline, norepinephrine, norphenylephrine, oxymetazoline, pemolinepropylhexedrine, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, propylhexedrine, tetrahydrozoline, tizanidine and xylometazoline.","In various configurations, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist which can be comprised by a formulation and used in methods of the present teachings can have the structure of a compound shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"158.83mm","wi":"47.41mm","file":"US08231885-20120731-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In some configurations, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist which can be comprised by a formulation and used in methods of the present teachings can have the structure of a compound shown in Formula I below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"33.87mm","wi":"62.31mm","file":"US08231885-20120731-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","20 ","1","20 ","1","20 ","1","20 ","1","20 ","1","20 "]},"In some configurations, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist which can be comprised by a formulation and used in methods of the present teachings can have the estructur of a compound shown in Formula II below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"24.13mm","wi":"57.40mm","file":"US08231885-20120731-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","2","4 ","1","20 ","2 "]},"In some configurations, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist which can be comprised by a formulation and used in methods of the present teachings can have the structure of a compound shown in Formula III below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"23.88mm","wi":"55.03mm","file":"US08231885-20120731-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","2","3 ","4 ","5 ","1","20 "]},"In some configurations, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist which can be comprised by a formulation and used in methods of the present teachings can have the structure of a compound shown in Formula IV below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"28.79mm","wi":"49.53mm","file":"US08231885-20120731-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"29.04mm","wi":"53.42mm","file":"US08231885-20120731-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In various aspects, a composition of the present teachings comprising an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist can further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Precipitated isothiocyanates 25 can be recovered by filtration and dissolved in a suitable solvent, e.g., chloroform, to form a solution. The solution can be dried (e.g., over MgS0), filtered, and concentrated to yield the isothiocyanates 25.","Isothiocyanates 25 can be treated with an excess of the appropriately substituted ethylene diamine to form the corresponding 3-quinoxalin-6-yl-thioureas 35. Isothiocyanates 25 can be reacted with an excess (e.g., 5 moles to 1 mole) of ethylene diamine 30 in a suitable solvent, e.g., diethyl ether, benzene, chloroform or dioxane. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature for about 2 hours. 3-Quinoxalin-6-yl-thioureas 35 precipitate and can be recovered by filtration and washing the filter cake with solvent.","Cyclization of 3-quinoxalin-6-yl-thioureas 35 to afford compounds of the present teachings 10 can be effected by heating a suspension of thioureas 35 with mercuric or cupric oxide in a suitable organic solvent, e.g., ethanol. The mercuric or cupric oxide can be replaced by an organic soluble mercuric or cupric salt, e.g., mercuric or cupric acetate. The reaction mixture can be filtered, to remove the mercuric or cupric sulfide by-product, and the filtrate can be concentrated to give compounds 10 in crude form. Compounds 10 can be recrystallized as the free base or converted to an acid-addition salt by conventional reaction with a suitable acid. In certain cases, cyclization can be effected by simply refluxing the thioureas 35 in a suitable organic solvent, e.g., methanol, in the absence of mercuric or cupric oxide.","Quinoxalines 15 can be synthesized by well-known synthetic procedures, for example, procedures disclosed in J.

Examples of cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, (C-C)cycloalkyl groups, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl, and saturated cyclic and bicyclic terpenes and (C-C)cycloalkenyl groups, such as cyclopropenyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, and cycloheptenyl, and unsaturated cyclic and bicyclic terpenes. A cycloalkyl group can be unsubstituted or substituted by one or two suitable substituents. Preferably, the cycloalkyl group is a monocyclic ring or bicyclic ring.","The term \u201cheterocycloalkyl\u201d means a non-aromatic monocyclic or polycyclic ring comprising carbon and hydrogen atoms and at least one heteroatom, preferably, 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. A heterocycloalkyl group can have one or more carbon-carbon double bonds or carbon-heteroatoms double bonds in the ring as long as the ring is not rendered aromatic by their presence. Examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include aziridinyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolidino, piperidinyl, piperidino, piperazinyl, piperazino, morpholinyl, morpholino, thiomorpholinyl, thiomorpholino, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, and pyranyl. A heterocycloalkyl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or two suitable substituents. Preferably, the heterocycloalkyl group is a monocyclic or bicyclic ring, more preferably, a monocyclic ring, wherein the ring comprises from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and from 1 to 3 heteroatoms, referred to herein as (C-C)heterocycloalkyl.","The term \u201chalogen\u201d means fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Correspondingly, the term \u201chalo\u201d means fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo.","As used herein, the terms \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201ctreating\u201d refer to an amelioration or reversal of a disease or disorder, or at least one discernible sign or symptom thereof. In some aspects, \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d can refer to an amelioration or reversal of at least one measurable physical parameter related to the disease or disorder being treated, not necessarily discernible by the subject. \u201cTreatment\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d can also refer to inhibiting or slowing the progression of a disease or disorder, either physically, e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom, physiologically, e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter, or both.","As used herein, an \u201ceffective amount\u201d of an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist is an amount effective to treat telangiectasia, i.e. reduce locally the visibility of the dilated blood vessels following topical administration. The amount of the \u03b1adrenergic receptor agonist in a topical formulation will vary depending upon which alpha agonist is employed but can be in the range of about 0.001% w\/w up to about 10% w\/w of the formulation. In various aspects, the amount administered can be an amount that covers the affected area. In certain aspects, covering an affected area can comprise applying a formulation to affected skin manually, by dabbing or brushing on with an applicator, which can be any type of applicator known to skilled artisans, such as, in non-limiting example, a cottontipped stick.","As used herein, \u201ccarbomer\u201d is the USP designation for various polymeric acids that are dispersible but insoluble in water. When the acid dispersion is neutralized with a base a clear, stable gel is formed. Carbomer 934P is physiologically inert and is not a primary irritant or sensitizer. Other carbomers include 910, 940, 941, and 1342.","In certain aspects, the present teachings disclose methods of treating a telangiectasia, comprising topically administering to the skin of a subject in need of such treatment a compound of a formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0169","num":"0168"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00015","num":"00015"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00015","he":"92.63mm","wi":"71.63mm","file":"US08231885-20120731-C00015.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","2","3 ","4 ","5 ","6 ","7 ","1","3","4 ","2 ","1","2","3 ","4 ","5 ","1","20 ","1","20 "]},"All citations (e.g., scientific journal publications, patents, and other reference material) mentioned herein are hereby incorporated herein by reference to the same extent as if each individual citation was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
