{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/326,174, titled \u201cUSER-DRIVEN CONFIGURATION,\u201d filed Dec. 14, 2011; and is also related to U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/326,149, titled \u201cINTEGRATED PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES,\u201d filed Dec. 14, 2011; and is also related to U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/326,155, titled \u201cRELEASE INDEPENDENT DEPLOYMENT OF USER PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES,\u201d filed Dec. 14, 2011; and fully incorporating the contents therein.","The present disclosure relates to software, computer systems, and computer implemented methods for deployment of services independent of a particular deployment model.","Certain user productivity features, applications, add-ons, and\/or upgrades may not be available to business applications because they may have outdated or legacy features and\/or older user interface (UI) components. A complete upgrade of the business application must be performed to update the business application with a new graphical user interface (GUI) or new features. In some instances, however, the upgraded features are only a small portion of the full set of features available through the application. The upgraded features may also only be used by a small number of users relative to the total number of users of the business application within a business organization. A particular user may also prefer a certain layout or functionality associated with an existing business application but still be interested in certain newer features. Different users with different roles, preferences, or interests may be interested in different features when using the business application. Further, in some cases, the newer features or UI components may be provided by third party services and may not be immediately compatible with an existing business application.","In some computing models, resources such as software and storage space are accessed by clients locally at, for example, a client's desktop computer. The software may be stored and executed from the client's local memory, and further upgrades or features of the software are provided by installing new versions of the software directly on the client computer. Likewise, the client computer may utilize only a local hard disk drive for storage space. The increased use of high bandwidth networks and data connections, as well as high capacity data storage servers, has resulted in the implementation of new and alternative computing models, such as cloud computing solutions. In cloud computing solutions, resources, services, enhanced functionality, or software may be provided to a client computer across a network. Cloud computing models may also be used to provide shared access and remote storage of data to users. In cloud computing solutions, computing resources are provided as hosted services across a network, such as the Internet.","End users of software applications may frequently work in a corporate environment with an information technology (IT) department. Improvements in the end users' productivity may require involvement of existing IT maintenance and administration processes. For example, upgrades to the software applications may be provided using on-premise deployment models involving installation of a complete software package provided by an existing IT department. The end user may be limited to software versions that have been installed by the IT department if the end user's employer has not upgraded to more up-to-date versions of the application. In particular, end users that work in heterogeneous environments may interact with other end users that use different versions of various applications. Certain end users may use web application user interface technology when interacting with other systems or older versions of a front-end enterprise portal. The ever growing and changing demands of businesses may dictate a need or desire for quick updates and release of new features or applications from software developers. In some instances, an older version of an application is used because the end users' employer may not have adopted the newest version. Accordingly, some end users of a particular application may be forced to interface with other end users of the particular application using different versions of the same application. Further, the end user's productivity may be limited by the lack of enhanced functionality and configuration options of the application. Users outside of the end user's IT environment may work with applications (similar to the end user's application) that have a particular configuration of the application based on the users' roles within the working environment. These configurations and preferences implemented by other users may be inaccessible to the user or may require a complete software upgrade due to the restrictions inherent in an existing corporate IT infrastructure.","The present disclosure involves systems, software, and computer implemented methods for deployment of services independent of a particular deployment model. One process includes operations for receiving a selection for a user productivity service from a client device, the client device located in a corporate network. A request for a particular method of deployment of the user productivity service is received. At least a portion of the user productivity service is transmitted to the client device if the request is for on-demand deployment of the user productivity service. At least a portion of the user productivity service is transmitted to a server in the corporate network if the request is for on-premise deployment of the user productivity service.","While generally described as computer implemented software embodied on non-transitory media that processes and transforms the respective data, some or all of the aspects may be computer implemented methods or further included in respective systems or other devices for performing this described functionality. The details of these and other aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","This disclosure generally describes computer systems, software, and computer implemented methods for providing user productivity and integrated services to an end-user. The user productivity and integrated services may include augmented features integrated into an existing business application through various deployment methods independent of the lifecycle or release of the existing business application. The existing business application may be complemented with additional features or even replaced with an entirely new business application. The additional features may include augmenting the user interface of the existing business application with new graphical objects that may enhance or complement the existing functionality and user interface of the business application based on the context in which the business application is used by an end-user. In some implementations, the additional features may include third party services or applications.","A flexible deployment model of the augmented features may also be provided to allow an appropriate deployment suitable to the needs, preferences, or context of the end-user. In certain implementations, the augmented features may be deployed through on-demand services, on-premise services, a combination of both on-demand and on-premise services, mobile services, or other suitable deployment methods. Further, the front-end and user interface integration aspects of the augmented features may be decoupled from the backend lifecycle of the underlying business application to allow for timely, efficient, and user\/context-specific integration of user productivity and third party services. In some implementations, the configuration aspects of the user productivity and integrated services may be provided through different deployment models at different stages to simplify and streamline the configuration process. The configuration process may be initiated through on-demand user interface services to allow discovery, setup, and fine-tuning of content packages for certain roles, work centers, navigations, pages, or gadgets. The configuration process using on-demand services may be followed by deployment of the content packages containing the configuration data to run on-premise without connection to the on-demand services. Accordingly, business users may configure the content packages to address user processes that meet the specific needs of a business organization.","For example, a business customer may want to configure defined roles and run Work Centers within a corporate network. A set of UI integration and productivity services (e.g., roles, work centers, page builders, work lists, assistance panels) may be able to be configured by Line-of-Business (LOB) units of the business customer, then loaded from a download site to be deployed and run inside the on-premise system. In another example, a business customer may receive a new application with a set of UI integration services embedded within the new application. The business customer may be given the ability to run the UI integration services on-premise or update, configure, and run the services on-demand.","A set of user productivity features may be integrated with an existing business application based on the context associated with the business application and the user of the business application. The set of features may be included as a context-sensitive augmentation of the current business application or of the graphical user interface (GUI) of the current business application. In some implementations, the context-sensitive augmentation may include a side panel to the current application, a menu or navigation tree, or a dedicated new application built to optimize the usability and productivity of frequently needed user interactions. Further, the context-sensitive augmentation may include integration of third party services or user interfaces into the current business application, such as third party search services or social networking services, for example, without modifying or upgrading the current business application.","The augmented features may be delivered to a user independent of a particular deployment model for an underlying business application or a particular release or lifecycle of the business application. A user may be able to access on-premise productivity features or on-demand productivity features separately or in combination. A seamless interchange may be provided between different deployment models, such as on-premise, on-demand, or mobile deployment models. For example, certain users may be given a selection between consuming landscape-wide UI integration and productivity services via on-demand models or on-premise models. In some implementations, information technology (IT) groups or Line-of-Business (LOB) units within an organization may be able to decide whether UI integration and productivity services are consumed through on-demand services, or downloaded and applied for use within the organization's on-premise landscape or on a particular user's desktop.","Generally, the functionality of the different applications is augmented such that the augmented features are integrated with certain existing features in the existing application based on similar or related functionality. For example, the existing application may provide information related to a geographic location of a customer in a sales order. The existing application may be augmented with a third party map search service to display the geographic location of the customer on a map. The particular address field of the customer in the existing application, however, may not be exposed to the map search service as currently implemented in the existing application. Accordingly, the context-sensitive augmentation may expose the address fields in the existing application to the map search service without modifying the existing application.","In some implementations, the particular augmentation applied to a business application may be based on the context associated with the user of the business application or the features being used. In certain instances, the augmented features or applications may need to be integrated into an existing application based on the integration context associated with the different applications. Each release of a business application may have different attributes, configurations, roles, or user interfaces. The integration context may provide information regarding the specific releases of the different applications or features that are to be augmented with user productivity and integration services. The integration context may then be used to determine the particular features or options that will be augmented on top of the existing features in the current release of the underlying business application. For example, in an older release of a business application, certain work list items may have been represented in a different way than in a newer release. The augmented features, however, may simply present an approval or disapproval graphical object that allows the user to approve the work list item regardless of the business application release currently used. Accordingly, a business application may be augmented with features that are independent of a specific release of the business application.","Some augmented features may be integrated with the existing application based on a role context associated with a user of the existing application. In some instances, the role context may include information defining a certain role of a user of the existing application within a business organization. Certain features may be provided to the user through the context-sensitive augmentation based on the role of the user. For example, a user with the role of a procurement manager within an organization may be provided access to available business and market information of a vendor and information associated with assigning a vendor to a material in a material replenishment scenario. Another type of context used to integrate augmented features may include a user context of the user of the existing application. The user context may include information indicating personal preferences or habits that influence the usability or productivity of the existing application. For example, based on the user context, augmented features may be provided to a user based on metadata indicating preferred user contact for requesting information in certain scenarios or providing access to a calendar when the user performs certain tasks.","Other contexts may include a departmental, networking, or friends context. In some implementations, the departmental\/networking\/friends context may include information reflecting certain best practices when a user works within a particular department or within a network of people while using an existing application. For example, a customer service agent of an international ordering department may be required to complete a spreadsheet checklist for handling customer service requests before an actual service request in a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system can be processed. The augmented features for a business application may accordingly include quick access to a customized spreadsheet document for completing the customer service task when the user is using the application in association with the international ordering department. In another example, augmented features may be automatically integrated into an application when other colleagues within a user's network are detected. In one example, a report may be automatically generated for informing the user of how certain trusted members of the user's network value different reports associated with the user's business organization.","The example contexts described above provide information for the features, information, or graphical components to include in a context-sensitive augmentation for the business application. The various contexts for providing augmented features may be end-user dependent, allowing various features or tools to be provided based on specific contexts associated with a user without modifying or upgrading the business application. Accordingly, the augmented features may be directed at specific needs of a user while being independent of the life cycle of the business application or a specific deployment model, and the functionality of older applications may be used with newer features or third party services in a timely manner.","Turning to the illustrated example,  illustrates an example environment  for providing user productivity and integrated services to an end-user. The illustrated environment  includes or is communicably coupled with one or more servers  and one or more clients , at least some of which communicate across network . In some implementations, the one or more servers  provide a set of services to the client , and they may be logically grouped and accessible within a cloud computing network . In general, environment  depicts an example configuration of a system capable of providing user productivity and integrated services to clients while being independent of a particular release, lifecycle or deployment model of an underlying business application. The environment  also supports a system capable of enabling users to configure content packages associated with the user productivity and integrated services through different deployment models at different stages of the configuration process.","The illustrated environment of  includes one or more clients . Each client  may be any computing device operable to connect to or communicate with other computing devices via the network  or with at least the servers  or  using a wireline or wireless connection. Further, as illustrated by client , each client  includes a processor , an interface , a graphical user interface (GUI) , a client application , and a memory . In some implementations, a server application  can be executed at a server  but accessed and displayed at client  in GUI . The server application  is hosted in memory  at server , which can be physically located on the premises of client . In general, each client  comprises an electronic computer device operable to receive, transmit, process, and store any appropriate data associated with the environment  of . It will be understood that there may be any number of clients  associated with, or external to, environment . For example, while illustrated environment  includes two clients (and ), alternative implementations of environment  may include a single client  communicably coupled to the servers , or any other number suitable to the purposes of the environment . Additionally, there may also be one or more additional clients  external to the illustrated portion of environment  that are capable of interacting with the environment  via the network . Further, the terms \u201cclient,\u201d \u201cuser,\u201d and \u201cend-user\u201d may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, while each client  is described in terms of being used by a single user, this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one computer, or that one user may use multiple computers.","As used in this disclosure, client  is intended to encompass a personal computer, touch screen terminal, workstation, network computer, kiosk, wireless data port, smart phone, personal data assistant (PDA), one or more processors within these or other devices, or any other suitable processing device. For example, each client  may comprise a computer that includes an input device, such as a keypad, touch screen, mouse, or other device that can accept user information, and an output device that conveys information associated with the operation of servers  and  or the client  itself, including digital data, visual information, the client application , server application , or the GUI . Both the input and output device may include fixed or removable storage media such as a magnetic storage media, CD-ROM, or other suitable media to both receive input from and provide output to users of the clients  through the display, namely, the GUI ","Generally, example client  may be communicably coupled with a network  that facilitates wireless or wireline communications between the components of the environment  (i.e., between each client  as well as between client  and servers  and ), as well as with any other local or remote computer, such as additional clients, servers, or other devices communicably coupled to network  but not illustrated in . In the illustrated environment, network  is illustrated as a single network in , but may be a continuous or discontinuous network without departing from the scope of this disclosure, so long as at least a portion of the network  may facilitate communications between senders and recipients. The network  may be all or a portion of an enterprise or secured network, while in another instance at least a portion of the network  may represent a connection to the Internet. In some instances, a portion of the network  may be a virtual private network (VPN), such as, for example, the connection between the clients and and one or more servers  and . Further, all or a portion of the network  can comprise either a wireline or wireless link. Example wireless links may include 802.11a\/b\/g\/n, 802.20, WiMax, and\/or any other appropriate wireless link. In other words, the network  encompasses any internal or external network, networks, sub-network, or combination thereof operable to facilitate communications between various computing components inside and outside the illustrated environment . The network  may communicate, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets, Frame Relay frames, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells, voice, video, data, and other suitable information between network addresses. The network  may also include one or more local area networks (LANs), radio access networks (RANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), wide area networks (WANs), all or a portion of the Internet, and\/or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations.","In the illustrated environment , each of the clients  may belong to a network  that is maintained by an organization such as a company. The organization may incorporate clients  into a security domain to reduce security risks to the organization's data accessible via network . Accordingly, communication between clients  and server  within the organization's network  and computing devices external to the organization, such as servers  within cloud computing network  for example, may be governed by a firewall . Firewall  may comprise any device or set of devices configured to monitor and control data communications between different security domains (i.e., between devices connected via network  and servers  within the cloud computing network ). Firewall  can be implemented in either hardware or software or both. The organization may have an information technology (IT) department that manages firewall  as well as the installation of applications on each client  and server .","Client  may have access to resources external to the firewall  including computing devices , other networks such as the Internet, and servers  within cloud computing network . The servers  within the cloud computing network  comprise a cloud computing platform for providing cloud-based services. The terms \u201ccloud,\u201d \u201ccloud computing,\u201d and \u201ccloud-based\u201d may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Cloud-based services can be hosted services that are provided by servers and delivered across a network to a client platform to enhance, supplement, or replace applications executed locally on a client computer. Clients  can use cloud-based services to quickly receive software upgrades, applications, and other resources that would otherwise require a lengthy period of time before the resources can be delivered to the client .","Client  may receive or implement applications using various deployment models such as through on-demand services or on-premise services. As described in the present disclosure, on-demand services can include multiple types of services such as products, actionable analytics, enterprise portals, managed web content, composite applications, or capabilities for creating, integrating, and presenting business applications. For example, the cloud-based implementation of the present disclosure can allow clients  to transparently upgrade from an older user interface platform to newer releases of the platform without loss of functionality. Users of a server application  can also obtain suggested configuration settings for use with server application  based on user context data associated with the user. Based on the user's own self configuration settings and on user context data comprising situational data associated with the user, recommendations for increasing productivity for the user can be provided to the user.","On-demand services can be hosted services that are provided over a network such as the Internet in a cloud computing implementation. In some implementations, the hosted services are computing resources such as business applications, software, data, and storage space that are stored or located at servers within the cloud computing network but that are provided to an end-user directly over the Internet or accessed by the end-user from a web browser. Thus, an existing business application can be complemented with additional features or even replaced with an entirely new business application through the cloud computing network without the installation of new software on a client computer or the involvement of an information technology (IT) department. In addition, data for improving user productivity can be shared among multiple end-users through the cloud computing network such as, for example, preferred business application configuration data or other information associated with best practices. To meet the ever growing and changing demands of businesses, a user of a business application can be provided with a flexible, integrated, and \u201cself-service\u201d work environment.","On-premise services can include various services provided to client  from within a business organization's security domain, such as services downloaded from servers (e.g., server ) behind the firewall . The network protected by the firewall  may be an internal network for members of the business organization. In certain instances, the services provided through on-premise deployment may benefit from security measures provided by the firewall , an IT department of the business organization, or other security features provided by the business organization for devices in the same company network.","Augmented features may be provided in a flexible manner independent of a particular deployment model and based on the needs of the end-user. On-demand deployment may be more appropriate for certain situations while on-premise deployment may be better in other instances. For example, users can register in a cloud-based environment which allows the users to download additional features and capabilities to enhance the user's productivity on demand rather than relying on on-premise applications provided by a user's employer, for example, to increase user productivity features. The users can also store the user context data on a cloud-based server, which allows sharing knowledge with other users and increasing the speed at which new user productivity features are provided, as well as improved integration with other web-based solutions in the cloud-computing network. On-demand services may also be less costly to maintain from a hardware or operational perspective. On-premise services may provide increased security as the services are running behind a firewall , which may limit the amount of traffic to and from external sources. Accordingly, end-users may not be restricted to a specific deployment model and may be given the flexibility to use one or more different deployment models, including using multiple deployment models for different aspects of the augmented features. In the illustrated example, a user may utilize user productivity and integration services via on-demand services implemented by a UI integration module  at a server in the cloud-computing network. Alternatively or in addition, the user productivity and integration services may be provided to the user via on-premise services implemented by a UI integration module  at a server  behind a firewall  of a business organization.","Additional on-demand services can also be implemented using the techniques described in the present disclosure. A tagging infrastructure and application interrogation APIs (application programming interface) can be used to augment and enhance existing applications. Applications can be interrogated to identify data objects for annotation via tags. The cloud-computing environment can then attach on-demand services to particular annotated and tagged objects such as search, mail, and financial data services. Thus, different applications and services can be coupled and augmented without changing the source code to the underlying applications. Moreover, on-demand services for automating tasks can record user interaction sequences and play the sequences back as needed so that users do not have to repeat repetitive tasks. Personal workflows can be optimized and elements of an application can work more effectively together using on-demand services for automating tasks. In addition, collaboration and decision making tools can be integrated into the existing customer landscape using on-demand services. Also, users can be enabled to create portal pages containing static content in conjunction with applications. Still further, existing applications can be simplified using on-demand services so that only the elements and information needed for the current task performed by the application are shown to a user.","In general, server is any server that stores one or more hosted applications , where at least a portion of the hosted applications  are executed via requests and responses sent to users or clients within and communicably coupled to the illustrated environment  of . For example, server may be a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (JEE)-compliant application server that includes Java technologies such as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), JEE Connector Architecture (JCA), Java Messaging Service (JMS), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). In some instances, the server may store a plurality of various hosted applications , while in other instances, the server may be a dedicated server meant to store and execute only a single hosted application . In some instances, the server may comprise a web server, where the hosted applications  represent one or more web-based applications accessed and executed via network  by the clients  of the system to perform the programmed tasks or operations of the hosted application .","At a high level, the server comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive, transmit, process, store, or manage data and information associated with the environment . The server illustrated in  can be responsible for receiving application requests from one or more server applications  associated with the clients  of environment  and responding to the received requests by processing said requests in the associated hosted application , and sending the appropriate response from the hosted application  back to the requesting server application . Alternatively, the hosted application  at server can be capable of processing and responding to local requests from a user accessing server locally. Accordingly, in addition to requests from the external clients  illustrated in , requests associated with the hosted applications  may also be sent from internal users, external or third-party customers, other automated applications, as well as any other appropriate entities, individuals, systems, or computers.","As used in the present disclosure, the term \u201ccomputer\u201d is intended to encompass any suitable processing device. For example, although  illustrates a group of servers , environment  can be implemented using computers other than servers, including a server pool. Indeed, server  may be any computer or processing device such as, for example, a blade server, general-purpose personal computer (PC), Macintosh, workstation, UNIX-based workstation, or any other suitable device. In other words, the present disclosure contemplates computers other than general purpose computers, as well as computers without conventional operating systems. Further, illustrated server  may be adapted to execute any operating system, including Linux, UNIX, Windows, Mac OS, or any other suitable operating system. According to one embodiment, server  may also include or be communicably coupled with a mail server.","In the present implementation, and as shown in , the server includes a processor , an interface , a memory , and one or more hosted applications . The interface  is used by the server for communicating with other systems in a client-server or other distributed environment (including within environment ) connected to the network  (e.g., client , as well as other systems communicably coupled to the network ). Generally, the interface  comprises logic encoded in software and\/or hardware in a suitable combination and operable to communicate with the network . More specifically, the interface  may comprise software supporting one or more communication protocols associated with communications such that the network  or interface's hardware is operable to communicate physical signals within and outside of the illustrated environment .","As illustrated in , server includes a processor . Although illustrated as a single processor  in , two or more processors may be used according to particular needs, desires, or particular embodiments of environment . Each processor  may be a central processing unit (CPU), a blade, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or another suitable component. Generally, the processor  executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of server  and, specifically, the one or more plurality of hosted applications . Specifically, the server's processor  executes the functionality required to receive and respond to requests from the clients  and their respective client applications  or server applications , as well as the functionality required to perform the other operations of the hosted application  or UI integration module .","Regardless of the particular implementation, \u201csoftware\u201d may include computer-readable instructions, firmware, wired or programmed hardware, or any combination thereof on a tangible and\/or non-transitory medium operable when executed to perform at least the processes and operations described herein. Indeed, each software component may be fully or partially written or described in any appropriate computer language including C, C++, Java, ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming), Visual Basic, assembler, Perl, any suitable version of 4GL, as well as others. It will be understood that while portions of the software illustrated in  are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects, methods, or other processes, the software may instead include a number of sub-modules, third party services, components, libraries, and such, as appropriate. Conversely, the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components as appropriate. In the illustrated environment , processor  executes one or more hosted applications  on the server ","At a high level, each of the one or more hosted applications  is any application, program, module, process, or other software that may execute, change, delete, generate, or otherwise manage information according to the present disclosure, particularly in response to and in connection with one or more requests received from the illustrated clients  and their associated client applications  or server applications . In certain cases, only one hosted application  may be located at a particular server . In others, a plurality of related and\/or unrelated hosted applications  may be stored at a single server , or located across a plurality of other servers , as well. In certain cases, environment  may implement a composite hosted application . For example, portions of the composite application may be implemented as Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) or design-time components may have the ability to generate run-time implementations into different platforms, such as JEE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition), ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming) objects, or Microsoft's .NET, among others. Additionally, the hosted applications  may represent web-based applications accessed and executed by remote clients  or server applications  via the network  (e.g., through the Internet). Further, while illustrated as internal to server , one or more processes associated with a particular hosted application  may be stored, referenced, or executed remotely. For example, a portion of a particular hosted application  may be a web service associated with the application that is remotely called, while another portion of the hosted application  may be an interface object or agent bundled for processing at a remote client . Moreover, any or all of the hosted applications  may be a child or sub-module of another software module or enterprise application (not illustrated) without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Still further, portions of the hosted application  may be executed by a user working directly at server , as well as remotely at client .","As illustrated, server can also include a UI integration module  that provides context-specific augmentation of an existing business application by integrating additional features or UI components without modifying the existing business application. As used in the present disclosure, the UI integration module  may be separate from the hosted application , while in other instances, the UI integration module  may be embedded within or part of the hosted application  or one or more other hosted applications. In some implementations, the additional features and services provided by the UI integration module  are designed to augment an existing transaction or application and can be provided graphically, such as in the form of a side panel object that is displayed concurrently with the user interface of the existing application. The side panel can interact with existing applications and transactions and visually represent additional user productivity services based on a context associated with the user. In certain implementations, the UI integration module  may integrate specific features into the existing application based on one or more contexts, such as an integration context, a role context, a user context, or a departmental\/network\/friend context, for example. The UI integration module  may also allow or facilitate sharing of contextual information among related users within a network to increase user productivity. The side panel object may integrate the settings, features, or applications used by other users sharing similar contextual information with a current user of an existing application. For example, users sharing similar roles, departments, or preferences may be presented with information related to the settings or features of the other similar users.","The side panel object may integrate external or third party services into an existing application to improve, extend, or complement the functionality within the existing application. For example, the side panel can act as a document management service allowing users to add and store, via the side panel, attachments relevant to the user's current working context. Existing services provided in a business application can also be enhanced via the side panel. For example, in addition to basic help content provided by an on-demand application, users can also integrate existing help content from a hosted environment or any other help providing environments.

Various servers within the cloud network  may host on-demand services, such as a download\/update site , a runtime site , or a tools and configuration site . In general, the on-demand services may be provided to clients within a company network without requiring company servers to host the on-demand services. In some implementations, applications or other software may be downloaded by client or other clients directly from a server in the cloud network  hosting a download\/update site . Other on-demand services may include runtime components that are integrated into applications running on the client at runtime. The runtime components may be provided by servers hosting a runtime site  as depicted in . The runtime components may include features based on users, groups, or roles associated with the client , or other user interface components or augmented functionality, including shells, cockpits, dashboards, pages, microapps, gadgets, gadgets, or catalogs for applications running on client . In some implementations, the on-demand services provided by the runtime site  may include personalization, collaboration, or central configuration features to enhance the user productivity of client ","Each of the services , ,  in the cloud network  may operate in connection to provide context-specific on-demand services to client that are decoupled from the lifecycle of applications running on the client . In certain implementations, for example, a user of a business application on client requests an on-demand service available from the cloud computing network . User context metadata associated with the business application is identified and transmitted to the cloud computing network . Updated metadata associated with the on-demand service comprising additional features of the business application is received from the cloud computing network. The updated metadata is then applied to a user interface associated with the business application, allowing the user to utilize the requested on-demand service without acquiring additional software for installation on client . In other implementations, the user of the business application may store configuration settings of the business application. The configuration settings and situational data associated with the user are transmitted as user context data to a server in the cloud computing network . Based on the user context data, recommendations for improving productivity such as suggested configuration settings are generated and transmitted to the user at client ","Some of the on-demand services may include context-specific user productivity and integration services provided by a UI integration module  as described above in connection with . In some implementations, a user interface of an application running on the client may be augmented with a shell component at runtime, as described in further detail below in relation to , to provide a visual framework for integrating additional features into the application. The additional features may include graphical components that provide an updated user interface as well as augmented functionality related to existing features in the application. The new graphical components supported by the shell may include a side panel with additional features or third party services that enhance user productivity for the application based on various contexts associated with a user of the application. Other graphical components may also be provided based on context, such as dashboards, pages, or gadgets.","Although the context-specific user productivity and integration services may be provided as on-demand services through the cloud network , the services may also be provided as on-premise services through servers within a company network, as illustrated in . The installation server , for example, is located behind the firewall  and may host various runtime and configuration components for clients within the company network. Some of the components hosted by the installation server  may include many of the same services provided through the runtime site  in the cloud network . Accordingly, a user of client may not be restricted to a single deployment model when accessing the context-specific user productivity and integration services. Instead, different deployment models may be used to provide augmented features to client , including through a cloud network  as an on-demand service or through services hosted by servers within a company network of the client ","The landscape illustrated in  may allow for business-driven, decoupled configuration of application content packages. In some instances, the original developers of a business application may not be aware of newer developments in technology, business practices, or specific roles or needs of a business customer or organization. For example, the original developers of the business application may have been unaware of how new social networking applications and trends could be integrated into a company's business processes. Further, individual users may have specific needs for certain new features that may not be used by a significant number of other users in the organization. The individual user, however, may have specialized knowledge in a particular area such that the new features would be beneficial to the individual user, but due to the specialized nature of the feature, a full-scale update of the entire business application may not be justified. Accordingly, the UI integration and user productivity services may be decoupled from the lifecycle and deployment of the business application to allow members of the business customer who are more familiar with the requirements of the organization to self-service the integration services. Business customers may initiate development of configurable aspects of a business application and receive content packages from services provided through the cloud network  and then, in turn, implement the content packages as on-premise services to clients within the company network.","For example, many of the augmented features may originate from a download\/update site  in the cloud network . In some instances, an IT department, LOB unit, stakeholder, partner, or other lead users within the company may manage configuration of various aspects of a business application. These members of the company may be in the best position to determine the new roles, implementations, practices, or navigation requirements for the integration services. Accordingly, the lead user may access configuration services provided through the cloud network , such as using the tools and configuration site , to discover, setup, and fine-tune content packages suited to the needs and preferences of members of the company. In some implementations, the tools and configuration site  are provided as on-demand services and may include a configurator tool that allows a user to configure the integration services that will be delivered based on the functionality of a back-end system running the business application. The lead users may, for example, define or model certain roles within the company using the tools and configuration site  to define permissions, best-practices, documents, or other data associated with those roles. In some instances, the content packages may include work centers, navigation centers, pages, gadgets, or other features that may be integrated into an existing application. As illustrated in , for example, a configurator tool may allow user-driven configuration and selection of specific tables, columns, or links to different services that can be integrated into a user interface of a business application.","The content packages configured by the lead users may then be downloaded to different servers in the company network, such as depicted in states (a), (b), (c), or (e), before they are distributed to clients as on-premise services through on-premise servers , , , or . The augmented features may be downloaded to the installation server  at state (e), for example, before they are downloaded and installed at client during state (g). Accordingly, a lead user may configure and obtain certain UI integration and user productivity services initially through on-demand services by receiving content packages at corporate servers within the company network. The lead user, IT department, or other business unit may then manage and deploy the received content as on-premise services for clients in the company network.","Alternatively, some applications and updates may be downloaded as on-demand services directly from the download\/update site  by client as depicted in state (d). In some instances, a new application that already contains the UI integration and productivity services may be downloaded to client directly from the cloud network . Once downloaded, however, the user may be given the ability to run the UI integration and productivity services on-premise or to update, configure, and run the services on-demand. Further, the features may be implemented at runtime of the business application running on client , which may require transmission of the augmented features from the download\/update site  to the runtime site  in the cloud network , as represented in state (f), before the features are integrated into the application at client at runtime. Additional flexibility may be provided to the user of client by distributing different features or stages of the user productivity and integration services through different channels. Although separate data and user interface components may typically be consolidated on an application server as a central location for distributing services to client , the data and user interface components may instead be obtained by client from different sources and different deployment models, as depicted in the different distribution channels represented by states (a)-(g) in . Accordingly, the augmented features may be provided through the appropriate channel based on the particular context associated with the client ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3G","FIG. 3A"],"b":["302","304","302"]},"As illustrated in the example screenshot of , for example, a shell component  is generated adjacent to or around the user interface of the legacy business application . The user interface of the business application  may remain unchanged, but the shell component  may include an additional graphical object that presents additional functionality to a user that may not have been available with the current version of the business application . In some instances, the additional functionality provided in the shell component  may be based on a user role associated with the user. For example, the business application  may include many features and functions that are directed at various roles within a business organization. A single user having a particular role, however, may only need or be allowed to access a portion of the entire functionality of the business application. The shell  may enhance navigation of existing parts of the business application  based on the role of the user in a business process. In the illustrated example, the shell  may present options to navigate through certain documents, allowing the user to display or perform various tasks related to the documents. In some instances, the user may only be allowed to navigate to the documents that are permitted for users having the same role. Although the user may be able to access the documents using the user interface of the business application , the shell  may provide quick navigation to relevant documents based on the user's role. At the same time, the user may still use the existing and unchanged features of the business application .","In some implementations, the shell  provides a desktop component for the business application  that is configured to access metadata associated with the user's role within a business organization. Based on the user's metadata, certain features can be dynamically injected into the user interface. The features presented to the user of the business application  may change based on the changing role of the user within the organization. Further, the business application  may be configured to not only be updated with additional features and options in response to changes to a user's role metadata but also in response to external status changes such as changes in the business' status or the status of third party business entities related to the user. A persistent business context is applied to a user's application workspace that ensures the application workspace reflects changes to business entities and applicable business processes that are of interest to the user or that are associated with the user's role within the business. Accordingly, the application workspace may be updated based on identification of new third party services or changes to existing third party services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["300","302","306","302","306","302","302","304","306","306","302","306","302","306"],"i":"b "},"In certain implementations, the augmented features in the side panel  for a particular user may be based on preferences of other users as determined by a departmental\/networking\/friends context. For example, users within a business organization may share their preferences or the functionality that they frequently use or recommend using to other users within certain networks. In some instances, an action taken by a particular socially connected or otherwise related user may be provided in the side panel , such as by listing information or links used by the related user. For example, a particular link to additional functionality may include a statement such as \u201cLink added by Markus C.\u201d or \u201cReport added by Filip M.\u201d A user may share preferences, actions, and\/or activities with other users in the same department or sub-group, for example, or with \u201cfriends\u201d in a social networking group. In certain instances, a particular user may also \u201cfollow,\u201d or track the status of, other users to determine certain best practices or commonly used settings or features. Individual users or groups may determine what aspects of the side panel  are shared with what groups of users. For example, the components in the side panel  for each user may be tailored specifically for that user, but those components may be shared with other users in different scenarios. Users may choose to share certain functionality in a side panel  with other users, or other users may choose to view the components that other users have in their side panel , depending on the permission settings chosen by the other users. Accordingly, the side panel  may display various features based on the departmental\/networking\/friends context of the user. In some implementations, users may share documents that are appropriate for certain business contexts with other users within a departmental\/networking\/friends context. The user who is sharing a particular document may control authorization of the users that are permitted to view the document. At least one benefit of the sharing of features, settings, or preferences among groups of users is quick scalability and dissemination of new functionality that may not otherwise be used by end-users without requiring upgrades to existing business applications.","As illustrated in , the features presented in the side panel  may be specific to the functionality presented in the business application and the context associated with the user. The side panel  may include links to functionality that directly enhance the functionality of the business application  and that is likely helpful to the user. If the user is viewing a particular document in the business application  user interface, for example, the side panel  may display an option to view the document flow associated with the document displayed in the business application  or allow the user to access an overview of all related documents in the system.","A link in the side panel  may lead to other pages or windows displaying additional information associated with the document displayed in the business application . As illustrated in the example screenshot of , a document flow window  may be displayed if the user clicks on the link depicted in the side panel . The flow of the particular document may be determined from the business application  and displayed in the document flow window .","In some implementations, a user of the user productivity and integration services or an administrator associated with the user's business organization may program customized content to include in the side panel . For example, users or administrators may develop new, customized functionality to include in the side panel  or even a new side panel  implementation using a page builder. As illustrated in the example screenshot of , for example, customizable mashup components and , also known as gadgets or chips, may be custom programmed for the side panel  to allow a user to view master data related to certain functions or documents associated with the business application . The mashup components or , or gadgets, can be a webpage, application, or part of an application such as a module, component, service, or subroutine that contains data or functionality that can be combined with another application or component, such as the business application  or side panel , into a new service or arranged in a particular layout along with other components to present a customized arrangement of applications for convenient access to a user. Specifically, the on-demand services provided by the side panel  can be included in or represented as software components called mashup components or gadgets or . Users can build the gadgets or from existing content elements of business applications such as screens, portal views, or dashboards. The gadgets can be visually represented as a user interface element that is easily moved from one location to another within the GUI of a client computer . Further, the gadgets can also be \u201cmashable\u201d in the sense that they can be linked with other components or with an underlying application for data flow. That is, input and output ports from one gadget can be connected to input and output ports of another gadget or application.","In some implementations, the gadgets or can also be incorporated into the side panel  by applying tagging data to data objects used by an application. Existing applications can be augmented and enhanced through a tagging infrastructure that associates data objects in an application with on-demand services. Tags can be applied to a data object that are merely descriptive of the data object, or the tags can be additional data linking the data object to a software component such as, for example, a gadget or . The tagging data applied to data objects helps facilitate user-intuitive extension of the functionality of current applications that do not necessarily have tagging capabilities. In some implementations, data objects can be graphical elements in the user interface of the application. Specifically, a business application  can be interrogated and particular data objects associated with the business application  can be annotated via tags. The existing personalization infrastructure of the business application  can be used to apply tagging data to data objects used by the application. The tagging data is not stored for a user interface element or a field of the user interface element but for bound data objects underlying the user interface element. The tagging data is stored in the same way as other kinds of personalization data for the business application . The gadgets or can then be executed using the tagged data objects as input values when the tagged data objects are selected. Thus, various user interface elements of the business application  can be linked with gadgets to enhance the functionality of the application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 3E","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3E"],"b":["300","306","306","306","302","302","306","306","306","306","306","302","114","135","306"],"i":["e ","c ","e ","f ","e ","f ","a "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 3F","FIG. 3G"],"b":["300","306","306","302","306","302","306","306","306","300","310"],"i":["f ","g ","g "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4B","FIG. 2","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","400","236","114","402","404","402"],"i":["a ","b "]},"For example, a plurality of back-end systems may be presented in a destination field  to allow a user to choose the back-end system destination for the configured services. The user may also choose the worklist type  and\/or business application  associated with the configured services. The business worklists may include metadata for configuring and accessing particular application objects and functions, allowing efficient access to the application objects and functions without complex navigation through standard transactions involving the application's user interface. Business worklists can be generated automatically based on metadata concerning a user's role within an organization. Alternatively, business worklists can be manually created by users based on the user's own preferences or based on recognized best practices that can be shared across a network with other users. Users that share similarities in roles within their respective organizations, for example, may share their business worklists, or access to automatically generated worklists may be given to other users. The business worklists can be applied to an application to automatically configure the application or incorporate on-demand services into the application according to user preferences, best practices, or role metadata as defined in the business worklists. Further, the business worklists can be provided to mobile devices so that the content and configuration data of the application can be easily accessible on mobile devices. A user first selects a business worklist to be made available on a mobile device, and a gadget can be configured to push the business worklist and associated data to a mobile gateway, where the business worklist can be transferred to the mobile device. Thus, business worklist functionality and self-service mobility can be instantly delivered to users of the application and business worklists.","In some implementations, the user may define queries  for performing specific tasks on the appropriate back-end systems. The user may choose, for example, to query a particular back-end system for all flight information relating to different airlines if the user productivity service is for airline worklists.
