Technical Field","Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to application platforms, and more particularly, to methods and systems for providing a secure network for application platforms.","2. Related Art","Existing application platforms allow an application developer to develop and deploy applications that may be used for various purposes in various contexts. A consumer may load applications on a mobile device, which may run the applications after the mobile device has been manufactured and purchased. The applications may be developed or sold by the manufacturer of the device or by third party application developers. In general, application developers want their applications to be housed and used in as many devices as possible and provide services that are secure and high quality. Consumers expect convenient and secure services within a trusted environment when downloading and using the applications. However, existing application platforms have a number of shortcomings related to security. For example, application developers may have different resources, preferences or policies for different types of security mechanisms, some preferring security mechanisms that are low in cost or easier to implement. Also, if a mobile device is configured to load applications from third party developers, there may be a risk of attack of the device and data stored on the device, for example by viruses, spyware or other malware. Furthermore, consumers and third party application developers may be concerned about entering confidential information or credentials within an existing application platform due to problems such as phishing. Users need to know that the their confidential information or credentials are appropriately securitized. Although the application developer and the consumer may each have its own culture and expectations, they all have the same basic requirement regarding an application platform\u2014the need for security and confidentiality.","As will be further described herein in relation to various embodiments, systems and methods are provided for a network of secure platforms to enable application developers to securely develop and deploy applications to users or consumers so that users may download applications from a trusted environment.","In accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure, a system for a secure application network comprises a service provider server adapted to interact with an application development server and a client device over a network, wherein the service provider server is adapted to implement the secure application network system.

In one embodiment, service provider  may be implemented by a payment service provider such as PayPal\u2122, Inc., or eBay\u2122, Inc. of San Jose, Calif.","Application development server  includes one or more processors  coupled to one or more memories  configured to process creation and\/or deployment of applications by application developers to be downloaded by one or more users. The application developer may be an entity, for example an individual or a corporation, which develops one or more portions of an application, for example a software application, operable on different types of client devices. Examples of application developers include iTunes\u2122, Sprint\u2122, mFoundry\u2122, Tivo\u2122, Wii\u2122, Playstation\u2122, RIM\u2122 application store, or the like. The application developer may be known or unknown to the manufacturer of client device .","Service provider  may implement an infrastructure for a secure network of platforms  (also referred to as a \u201csecure application network\u201d) to enable application developers using application development server  to create and deploy applications to client device .","Client device  may be configured to safely download, install, and run applications created and\/or deployed by application development server  from the secure network of platforms . The secure network of platforms  may include one or more platforms  associated with application developers involved with any context or purpose including, for example, iTunes\u2122, Sprint\u2122, mFoundry\u2122, Tivo\u2122, Wii\u2122, Playstation\u2122, RIM\u2122 application store, or the like. Advantageously, service provider  may market applications in the secure network of platforms  as certified so that user  may download the certified applications with confidence that the applications are not fraudulent and user  is not providing sensitive or confidential information to a fraudster.","Service provider  may maintain a plurality of application developer accounts  and user accounts , each of which may include account information associated with specific application developers and users such as individuals, respectively. For example, in one embodiment, account information may include private or confidential information of an application developer or a user such as account numbers, passwords, credit\/debit card information, bank information, or other information that may be used to facilitate online or other types of transactions between service provider  and application developers or users.","According to an embodiment, platform application  of service provider  may be configured to interact with application developer server  so that user  (via client device ) is enabled to securely download applications of application developer server  from the secure network of applications . The application developer may first register, prepare or otherwise sign up to use the secure network of platforms  implemented by service provider  via platform application .","In this regard, service provider  may provide information to application development server  to assist the application developer in creating and\/or deploying an application such as a software application in a manner which is compatible with client device . For example, service provider  may provide application development server  with information such as a Software Development Kit (SDK) , which may comprise a collection of software tools and specifications that allows application development server , and correspondingly the application developer, to build and test an application operable on client device . The application would then have an embedded secure interface to SDK  of service provider .","Service provider  may assign each application a unique identifier associated with application identifier  for both internal and external identification.","In the system for providing a secure network of platforms according to an embodiment, a transaction using client device  and service provider  may additionally generate certain data to provide feedback on selected applications downloaded by user  as will be described below.","Service provider  may provide a transaction records processing application  that may be configured to receive transaction information from client device  over network  and store the transaction information in a plurality of transaction records that are associated with individual user accounts . Also, as further described herein, transaction records may be implemented to store transaction information associated with particular applications, for example online, NFC or other types of downloaded applications, between client device  or user  and application developer server .","Access to application transaction records may be controlled by service provider , for example, to prevent the storage or retrieval of the transaction records by other parties without the permission of user . In this regard, service provider  may require the receipt of a security identifier such as a valid password, a user identifier, a username, and\/or other appropriate information before transaction records may be stored, changed, and\/or retrieved.","It will be appreciated that by performing a plurality of transactions by user  with application development server , a plurality of transaction records may be stored by service provider  and associated with an appropriate user account , which is associated with user .","The centralized storage of transaction information or data of service provider  may be combined and enhanced with data obtained from business partners of service provider  including subscriber acquirers, brands, Internet companies, or other entities. In one embodiment where service provider  is PayPal\u2122, Inc., the centralized stored transaction data may be combined with data obtained from PayPal's business partners such as eBay\u2122, thus resulting in even richer and more extensive data.","Client device  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over a network. For example, in one embodiment, client device  may be implemented as a mobile device of user  in communication with network  such as the Internet or another network. In other embodiments, client device  may be implemented as a personal computer, wireless telephone, personal digital assistant (PDA), key fob, smart phone, smart card, notebook computer, game console, digital video recorder (DVR), and\/or other types of computing devices. Furthermore, client device  may be enabled for NFC, Bluetooth, online, infrared communications and\/or other types of communications.","Client device  may include various applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide desired features to client device . For example, in various embodiments, applications may include security applications for implementing client-side security features, programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over a network, or other types of applications.","Client device  may further include one or more user identifiers  that may be implemented, for example, as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with a browser application, identifiers associated with hardware of client device , or other appropriate identifiers. In one embodiment, a user identifier may be used by service provider  to associate client device  or user  with a particular account maintained by service provider .","According to an embodiment, service provider , for example in a role as a Trusted Service Manager (TSM), may work with a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to put a certificate issued by service provider  in a Secure Element (SE) or Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card  of client device . The SE or SIM card  may follow security guidelines such as FIPS 140-2 Level 2\/3. Service provider issued certificates already installed in client device  may be done for personalization purposes. When users or customers activate their service provider application , such as a PayPal application, which may already be built in client device , user  may be asked to select a personal identification number (PIN) or a passcode, which may be optional or mandatory. The PIN or passcode protects the private key of the certificate.","Service provider  has multiple \u201cverified\u201d statuses. Hence, the centralized data storage capabilities of service provider  facilitate both a rule-based system and behavioral engine that may generate proprietary fraud models based on such rich and extensive data. Service provider  is able to offer and provide a service that may work in real time to identify information and data associated with application development server  and client device  to detect and prevent transaction fraud and without compromising privacy.","Client device , application developer server , and service provider  may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and methods described herein. For example, such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable mediums such as memories or data storage devices internal and\/or external to various components of the system, and\/or accessible over a network, which may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, network  may include the Internet or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"In block , service provider  may receive registration information from an application developer using application development server  to form a secure platform  in the secure network or platforms  facilitated by service provider  and to open an application developer account  (as illustrated in  according to an embodiment). In this regard, it will be appreciated that the application developer may provide account information to service provider  over network  through, for example, a secure connection between application development server  and service provider . For example, in one embodiment, service provider  may provide a webpage that may be viewed by an application developer through a browser application.","As a result of such registration, service provider  may assign, and application development server  may store, a specific application identifier  that may be used to identify the particular application developer as having an application developer account  maintained by service provider . The application developer identifier may be implemented, for example, as one or more cookies, operating system registry entries, hardware identifiers, or other types of identifiers. Other data specific to the application developer may be created and stored by service provider , including for example, signature information and an application developer profile . Signature information is the way to identify the application developer. Furthermore, application developer profile  may be created, for example, based on a developer's typical behavior in transactions.","In block , once an application developer has registered and opened an account for the secure network of platforms  of service provider , the application developer may interact and exchange data with service provider . In an embodiment, the application developer may log in to service provider  via a mechanism such as a tool or site provided by service provider  in order to create or deploy an application. In this regard, the application developer may be required to input an identifier such as a PIN or a passcode for identification purposes.","In block , service provider  authenticates the application developer. For example, service provider  may first verify that the log in information provided by the application developer such as a PIN or passcode matches information maintained by service provider . For example, information in connection with application identifier  of application development server  is verified. Other data maintained at service provider  such as signature information and application developer profile information, may also be used to correlate and authenticate the application developer. According to an embodiment, service provider  may compare each transaction by an application developer with application developer data or centralized stored data maintained by service provider . If a particular transaction by the application developer appears to be out of line with the application developer's typical transaction profile as maintained in application developer profile , a fraud alert may be raised. For example, if the application developer generally only deals with transactions over the telephone for a particular technology, a transaction related to a different odd technology may raise a fraud alert. Other data that may raise fraud alerts include the number of transactions, the time of day or the time of year when the transaction takes place. Finally, transactions made over application development server  may also provide geo-location information using for example a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) to identify the location of the application development server  (and correspondingly the application developer). The location of application developers may be helpful in establishing risk models for transactions. For example, if the application developer profile indicates that a particular account is based in Northern California, but one or more transactions suddenly appear in Russia, a fraud alert may be issued.","In other embodiments, established application developers such as Apple\u2122 or TiVo\u2122 may work with service provider  on the backend to authenticate applications that such application developers provide to users or consumers. Service provider  may work with such application developers so that they may provide an API to service provider  to accelerate the service provider's verification functionality.","In block , once an application developer is authenticated, service provider  enables the authenticated application developer to create and deploy applications so that user  may securely download applications with confidence that the application is being downloaded from an authenticated and secure location, that is, from a trusted environment as implemented by the service provider's secure network of platforms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},"In block , user  may download a client device specific authenticity check application provided by service provider . According to an embodiment, user  may download the client device specific authenticity check application from platform application  of service provider  via network  as illustrated in .","In block , once user  downloads the authenticity check application onto client device , the authenticity check application may locate all the applications installed on client device . Next, the authenticity application conducts a verification routine to verify the authenticity of the applications installed therein as will be described in more detail below with respect to  according to an embodiment.","In block , applications whose authenticity has been verified are identified and shown or displayed to user  on client device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"In block , the authenticity check application as may be implemented in platform application  of service provider  may be downloaded onto client device  as described above. The authenticity check application locates all the applications installed in client device  and queries the identification information of each particular application including, for example, the identifier of the application provided by service provider  (if applicable), or other types of identifiers.","In block , service provider  creates a checksum of the application, that is, service provider  compiles the identification information of a particular application as installed in client device  and as queried by the authenticity check application.","In block , using the checksum of the application, service provider  compares such checksum of the specific application and corresponding identification information with the application information maintained by service provider  in, for example application developer profiles  (if any), to verify the authenticity of the application.","Optionally, a service provider identifier as well as other identifiers stored in an application may be used to display any applicable feedback and\/or ratings for a particular application to user  as will be described in more detail below with respect to  according to an embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"Service provider  including the network of secure platforms may be used to share feedback and\/or ratings information provided by a user about an application across different device application platforms. Feedback and\/or ratings information may be based, for example, on the quality, user-friendliness, content of the application, or other factors.","In block , users may enter, and the service provider receives, feedback and\/or ratings information about an application. The user may enter feedback information in the application itself or in an application provided by the service provider such as in the authenticity check application or via a tool or website of service provider . According to one or more embodiments, user  may also enter feedback and\/or ratings information about an application by sending a text message or SMS to service provider  in connection with an application.","In block , service provider  may store the feedback and\/or ratings information entered by the users on the backend, for example, service provider  may store received application feedback and\/or ratings information in transaction record processing application . Service provider  may then link the feedback and\/or ratings information to the application, the application developer and\/or the application platform.","In block , service provider  may provide or make available the feedback and\/or ratings information to future users of the application through, for example, a service provider application, tool or website.","The feedback information may also be made available to partners or associated entities of service provider  through a secure connection. For example, in embodiments where the service provider is PayPal\u2122, Inc. or eBay\u2122, Inc., feedback provided by users to PayPal\u2122 or eBay\u2122 about various entities such as merchants, bloggers, etc., may also be provided to users of the network of secure platforms via a PayPal\u2122 application through a secure connection. In this regard, for example, the PayPal\u2122 application may call the PayPal\u2122 SDK function to obtain feedback about a particular eBay\u2122 merchant, for example. In turn, the PayPal\u2122 SDK may provide access to the particular merchant ratings and comments.","In addition to verifying authenticity of applications and sharing user-provided application feedback and\/or ratings information, the network of secure applications provided by service provider  according to one or more embodiments may provide several other conveniences including notifications to users. For example, the secure applications network of service provider  may be used to check whether the client device (or user) has the latest version of installed applications, whether an installed application is blacklisted or blocked, or whether a vendor\/merchant ratings have changed.","Although various components and steps have been described herein as being associated with client device , application development server , and service provider  of , it is contemplated that the various aspects of such servers illustrated in  may be distributed among a plurality of servers, devices, and\/or other entities. For example, in one embodiment, transaction record processing application  may be implemented by an entity separate from service provider . Accordingly, in such an embodiment, communications described herein performed in relation to transaction record processing application  may be provided to a separate entity and need not be routed through service provider  in all instances.","Referring now to , a block diagram of a system for implementing a device is illustrated according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1500","108","106","102","1500","1502","1504","1506","1508","1512","1514","1516","1518"]},"In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, system  performs specific operations by processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in system memory component .
