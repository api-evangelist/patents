{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM TO FOREIGN APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A claim for priority is hereby made under the provisions of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 for the present application based upon German Patent Application No. 08150301.3, filed on Jan. 16, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates to a system and method for providing information in a virtual world.","Today, companies investing in virtual worlds (e.g. Second Life, Active Worlds, etc.) by building and designing virtual objects such as houses, cars, computers and the like, obtain little data on how their investment is perceived and used by virtual world members. The lack of this data effectively prevents such companies from improving their virtual world design based on empiric data which results in the investment potentially being spent in the wrong places.","It is known in the art to mitigate this problem by implementing simple counters at specific places within the companies' virtual world space to at least track the amount of avatars visiting the company area, thus capturing information triggered by static sensors.","In World Wide Web, tracking cookies are used for tracking which sites a user is visiting and how the user is interacting with the sites. A tracking cookie is a piece of information stored at the browser in the user's computer.","It is an object of the invention to provide a method and a system for providing information in a virtual world which is not restricted to a user's computer.","These objectives are achieved by the features of the independent claims. The other claims and the specification disclose advantageous embodiments of the invention.","A method is proposed for providing information about events in a virtual world, comprising:","providing a re-usable code portion with a unique identifier and an address of an external data storage;","configuring at least a set of events to be tracked for sending information about tracked events to the external data storage;","associating the re-usable code portion with a virtual object to be tracked.","Favorably, it is possible to support virtual world wide data correlation and spatial tracking of objects moving or being moved in a virtual three dimensional (3D) world. The re-usable code Portion can provide communication with an outside web server using a virtual world HTTP interface function. A service processing the request stores the posted data in the centralized external storage device. Besides the possibility for local tools to operate and reason on the data stored in the storage device, the service can also support access to the aggregated data via e.g. HTTP request or other suitable protocols. Tracking and data collection can be implemented by simply using and\/or attaching the re-usable code portion to a dedicated object in the virtual world. Custom data can be passed on for additional analysis external to the virtual world. It is possible to store the data on the external storage device and by this provide persistence beyond the persistence of the virtual world. The re-usable code portion is not restricted to spatial distances or other physical world limitations. Independent of its current location within the virtual world, the re-usable code portion is able to transmit its identification and custom data to the data repository, i.e. the data storage external to the virtual world. Favorably, these data are accessible even if the virtual world is not available. The aggregated data stored in the external data storage device can be analyzed by the owner of the re-usable code portion for usage information. Such operation is typically performed by tools that do further correlation of the data. An interesting aspect within virtual worlds is that captured 3D position data can be projected directly into the virtual world. As a result, a field of vision tracking can be directly projected into e.g. an exhibition hall as a set of 3D curves giving direct feedback on customer interests and options for improving the spatial arrangement of the presentation. Privacy matters can be addressed by restrictions on execution of certain scripts.","Favorably, the re-usable code portion can be associated with a first virtual object by integrating it on source code level into said first virtual object. The first virtual object can be e.g. a passage way in the virtual world thus tracking virtual world objects which are moving or which are moved through the passage way.","Alternatively or additionally, a dedicated virtual world object which contains the re-usable code portion can be attached to other objects that shall be tracked in the virtual world. The dedicated object can be e.g. a T-shirt, a sunglass or the like, which can be chosen and used by an avatar, i.e. a user in the virtual world, thus providing information about what dedicated object is chosen by the user, i.e. the tracked object, and\/or which use is made of it by the user.","The re-usable code portion can favorably provide a first interface for collecting information about events relating to the tracked object. Particularly, the first interface provides at least one of","a definition of events of which the virtual tracking object whishes to receive information from the tracked object;","a receipt information from the tracked object.","Thus usage information can be made available. The re-usable code portion's first interface allows the object to which it is attached to pass on usage information, e.g. object was touched, the object was bought by, object user is . . . etc., which can be also stored in the database along with the identification information for later correlation and analysis. By default, the re-usable code portion can transmit location information periodically, which allows, for example, to gain insights how often a specific avatar is coming back to a specific place, e.g. a store or the like, and at which times. In particular, this allows e.g. to optimize the availability of store attendants.","The re-usable code portion can favorably provide a second interface for periodically collecting spatial information based on a configurable tracking frequency. Particularly, the spatial information can be e.g. a location and\/or an orientation of the dedicated object thus revealing the location and\/or the orientation for the tracked object.","The re-usable code portion can favorably provide a third interface for providing collected data to said external data storage. Particularly, the third interface can support http protocol. This allows easy data exchange with an appropriate http server.","According a preferred embodiment the re-usable code portion can provide tracking of individual pieces of information by at least one of\n\n","Thus, for instance, the data can be collected if the dedicated object containing the re-usable code portion is picked up by an avatar.","Preferably, an identifier-generation algorithm can generate the unique identifier by concatenation of a unique identification of an executing avatar, a current virtual world time and a random integer number. Particularly, a wait state after generating the unique identifier can be implemented before a new unique identifier can be generated. By this approach, it is possible to avoid using the same identifier twice. Each re-usable code portion can get assigned its own globally unique identifier.","Favorably, the re-usable code portion can provide a definition of one or more conditions when information should be provided.","According to a preferred embodiment, an input of information from the external storage to the virtual world related to the tracked object can be performed. As a result, direct feedback can be provided on customer interests and options for improving the spatial arrangement of a presentation by directly projecting a field of vision tracking as a set of 3D curves into e.g. an exhibition hall.","According to another aspect of the invention, a system for performing a method for providing information about events in a virtual world is proposed, comprising\n\n","Favorably, the re-usable code portion can provide at least one of\n\n","The re-usable-code-portion-tracking system is preferably a system external to the virtual world which can be accessed even when the virtual world is down. Further, its existence is not tied to the existence of the virtual world, the virtual world may cease to exist but the data will still be available. It can also be easily integrated with other systems outside the virtual worlds for data analysis. In a preferred implementation, the tracking system offers a HTTP based remote API that can be accessed from within the virtual world to push captured data to the tracking system.","Preferably, the re-usable code portion can provide at least one of a first interface for collecting information about events relating to the tracked object; a second interface for periodically collecting spatial information based on a configurable tracking frequency; a third interface for providing collected data to the external data storage.","The external storage can be coupled to a tracking system, the tracking system comprising a server and a tracking data analyzer system.","The tracking data analyzer system can comprise a code-portion-tracking servlet and a tracking data handler. The servlet can receive the data from the virtual world and detect the data in an e.g. http request portion. The data handler can unpack the data collected by the re-usable code portion and store it in the tracking data storage device.","Favorably, the tracking data analyzer system can comprise a code-portion-tracking monitor.","A data transmission helper running on the virtual world can be assigned to the re-usable code portion. The transmission helper can provide a unique identification (identifier), such as the server address, a URL or the like, of the virtual world to the tracking system in the real world.","A tracking data visualizer running on the virtual world can be assigned to the re-usable code portion. As a result, a direct feedback can be provided on customer interests and options for improving the spatial arrangement of a presentation in the virtual world by directly projecting a field of vision tracking as a set of 3D curves into e.g. an exhibition hall.","Sharing of information by the tracking system can be customized both by the issuer of the re-usable code portion as well as by the owner of the object the re-usable code portion is attached to. For this purpose, an external browser unit can be coupled to the tracking system. For example, the frequency of the transmission of location change of the object can be configured when the re-usable code portion is issued. Also, the creator of an object with an attached re-usable code portion can allow the owner of the object to disable certain transmissions.","In embodiments, methods for providing tracking information about events in a virtual world using a computer are presented including: causing the computer to provide a re-usable code portion, the re-usable code portion configured with a unique identifier and an address of an external data storage; causing the computer to configure at least a set of events to be tracked for sending information about tracked events to the external data storage; causing the computer to associate the re-usable code portion with a virtual object to be tracked in the virtual world. In some embodiments, methods are presented wherein the causing the computer to associate the re-usable code portion with the virtual object comprises causing the computer to integrate the re-usable code portion on a source code level into the virtual object. In some embodiments, methods are presented wherein the causing the computer to associate the re-usable code portion with the virtual object comprises causing the computer to attach the re-usable code portion to the virtual object. In some embodiments, methods further include: causing the computer to retrieve a portion of the information from the external data storage; and causing the computer to project the information into to the virtual world related to the virtual object. In other embodiments, systems for providing information about events in a virtual world are presented including: a virtual object configured for operating within the virtual world; a re-usable code portion having a unique identifier, the re-usable code portion configured for tracking the events corresponding with the virtual object, wherein the tracking corresponds with the information; and an external data storage for receiving the information. In some embodiments, systems are presented wherein the re-usable code portion is associated with the virtual object in a manner such as: integrating the re-usable code portion at a source code level with the virtual object, and attaching the re-usable code portion with virtual object. In other embodiments, computer program products for providing tracking information about events in a virtual world, the computer program are presented including: first programmatic instructions for providing a re-usable code portion, the re-usable code portion configured with a unique identifier and an address of an external data storage; second programmatic instructions for configuring at least a set of events to be tracked for sending information about tracked events to the external data storage; third programmatic instructions for associating the re-usable code portion with a virtual object to be tracked in the virtual world.","The drawings are merely schematic representations, not intended to portray specific parameters of the invention. The drawings are intended to depict only typical embodiments of the invention and therefore should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention.","In the drawings, like elements are referred to with equal reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["300","100","200","300","110","120","100","110","120","102","100","110","102","100","102","102"]},"The preferred method for providing information about events in a virtual world , comprises the steps of providing the re-usable code portion  with a unique identifier and an address of an external data storage , configuring at least a set of events to be tracked for sending information about tracked events to the external data storage  and associating the re-usable code portion  with a virtual object  to be tracked.","The re-usable code portion  can be associated with the virtual object  by integrating it on source code level into the first virtual object . As an example, the virtual object  can be a passage way in the virtual world  which then can register avatars  passing by this passage way.","Alternatively, the re-usable code portion  can be associated with the virtual object  by attaching a dedicated virtual world object (indicated by dashed lines) which contains the re-usable code portion  to other objects  that shall be tracked in the virtual world . The dedicated virtual object can be, e.g. a T-shirt, a pair of sunglasses and the like, and the object  to be tracked can be the avatar  itself carrying the dedicated virtual object with him, for example.","The re-usable code portion  communicates with an outside web server  in the real world  using, for instance, a virtual world HTTP interface function. The invocation carries a unique identifier of the re-usable code portion's  and the captured tracking data. The service processing the request stores the posted data in a centralized tracking data repository, i.e. data storage device . Besides the possibility for local tools to operate and reason on the data stored in the storage device , the service also supports remote access to the aggregated data via HTTP request.","This approach allows the data to be analyzed outside the virtual world  and independent of the virtual world  either by tools running local on an application server  coupled to the central data storage  or by tools that aggregate remote data potentially originating from multiple repositories (e.g. data storage device ). The application server  comprises a tracking subsystem  with an integrated tracking servlet  and a tracking data handler unit . The servlet  receives and finds data in the request from the server  and the handler unit  unpacks the data and stores them into the storage device .","As a further option, the aggregated data can be fed back into the virtual world , e.g. to render spatial tracking data as 3D artifacts within the virtual world .","The re-usable code portion  can submit its data on specific events, e.g. timer events or events related to the object  it is attached to. The re-usable code portion  provides a customization interface  allowing an external user to specify to which event the VW re-usable code portion should respond. If after the re-usable code portion  has been customized it is copied, it retains its customization and hence allows mass-creation of specific purpose-customized re-usable code portion . The only difference between the re-usable code portions  are their identifiers which are unique are created when a new re-usable code portion  is created and\/or instantiated.","The customization interface  is dedicated for collecting information about events relating to the tracked object  and can particularly provide a definition of events of which the dedicated virtual tracking object whishes to receive information from the tracked object  and a receipt information from the tracked object .","The re-usable code portion  provides a second interface  for periodically collecting spatial information based on a configurable tracking frequency. The spatial information can be location and\/or orientation of the tracked object .","Further, the re-usable code portion  provides a third interface  for providing collected data to said external data storage . By way of example, the third interface  can support HTTP protocol for communication with a server  being coupled to the application server .","The application server  receives a unique identifier, e.g. a server address, of the virtual world  by way of a data transmission helper unit  being coupled to the server  in the real world.","Preferably, the re-usable code portion  has direct access to its actual location (i.e. 3D coordinates) within the virtual world . This makes it easy for the re-usable code portion  to track even complex relocations. Even subtle changes in object orientation can be captured by using a re-usable code portion  that is attached in relation to the spatial orientation of the tracked object . This allows for example to create virtual sunglasses instrumented with a re-usable code portion  tracking the filed of vision of customer avatars  within an exhibition hall. Such data is of tremendous value for companies trying to optimize the presentation of their merchandise.","The life cycle of an individual re-usable code portion is depicted in  in a flow chart  making reference to the elements described in . In step  a re-usable code portion  is created, in step  the re-usable code portion  is attached to the object  to be tracked and tracking data are collected in step . In step  it is checked whether a data synchronization point is reached of yes, the data are transmitted to the tracking system in step . If no, data collection is continued in step . Step  can also request for continued data collection in step .","Re-usable code portions  can be created in the virtual world  through cloning an initial re-usable code portion . The new re-usable code portion  instance contains all properties and object logic of the initial one (including a tracking logic of the original re-usable code portion ) but it can tweak its internal data during its \u2018creation\u2019 event. In this event, the re-usable code portion  will compute its internal unique identifier that will allow actually correlating all data collected by this re-usable code portion . The identifier-generation algorithm generates the re-usable code portion identifier by concatenating the following values:\n\n","After generating the identifier, the algorithm can implement a wait state that lasts for 1 millisecond. By this approach, the re-usable code portion identifier-generation algorithm guarantees that the same identifier is never generated twice and each re-usable code portion  gets assigned its own globally unique identifier.","In addition to this the re-usable code portion  contains internal properties that control its behavior. The corresponding property values are just copied by default from the initial object , but they can be modified by authorized users in order to adjust the tag behavior. The supported properties are preferably:\n\n","After being created, the re-usable code portion  starts collecting actual tracking data as long as the re-usable code portion's enabled flag is set to true. As depicted in , the re-usable code portion  captures two kinds of data records: Location Records  and Event Records . The Location Record  comprises parameters, particularly a string name for the re-usable code portion , a current location (currentLocation) of the tracked object , a current orientation (currentOrientation) of the tracked object  in the virtual world , a user identification related to the avatar , and a current time in the virtual world  of a timer . The Event Record  extends the Location Record  by additionally furnishing an event (generatedEvent) and an object identification (generatedObject).","The location records  can be repeatedly collected according to a fixed time interval based on the location record tracking frequency mentioned earlier. In addition to that, event records can be generated for specific events. In order to achieve that, the re-usable code portion  registers itself as a listener to those events at the object  the re-usable code portion  or the dedicated object , respectively, is attached to. As a result, the object  will notify the re-usable code portion  on each occurrence of such events. The re-usable code portion  in turn will then generate a corresponding EventRecord entry. As mentioned earlier the re-usable code portion  contains a configurable list of events that shall be tracked (i.e. result in EventRecords) all other events will be just ignored. Events of interest may include:\n\n","All location and event records ,  are written into a tracking record data object . At each time a LocationRecord  is captured the re-usable code portion  checks if a data synchronization point has been reached (step  in ). The result of this check depends on the data transmission frequency configured within the given re-usable code portion . If a data synchronization point has been reached, the tracking record  is transmitted to the external tracking system , ,  and a new tracking record data object  is created to capture the upcoming data records.","For example, if the data transmit frequency is configured to track 0.1 data records per second and the data transmission frequency is configured to transmit 0.001 tracking records per second to the tracking system, than each tracking record will contain  location records  plus eventually some event records .","The actual transmission of the tracking record to tracking system is implemented by a data-transmission-helper-unit-script component. This script (which can be stored directly in the tracked object  or the re-usable code portion  or be attached to it) facilitates the projection of tracking data collected by the re-usable code portion  to the virtual world object tracking system  (). This transmission crosses the border between the virtual world  and the real world  where the virtual world object tracking system manages  its data.","The actual transmission utilizes, for instance, a HTTP support available in the Second Life virtual world . Other virtual worlds may provide other means to communicate with the outside world . The tracking record  is transferred to the tracking servlet  of the tracking system  by doing a corresponding HTTP POST request to the URL retrieved from the re-usable code portion's  internal configuration data. The tracking servlet  is implemented e.g. as a J2EE servlet running on the corresponding J2EE application server  (e.g. WebSphere Application Server\u00ae) adhering to the Representation State Transfer (REST) Pattern. This implementation allows for superior caching, load balancing and high availability characteristics of the service.","The servlet  in turn passes the individual tracking records  to the tracking data handler unit  () which extracts the individual data records  again and transforms those into a relational data model such that it can be stored into a relational database like IBM DB2\u00ae in the data storage device . Based on this model, further database view can be defined that allow aggregated and precompiled views on the tracking data that can be visualized by a tracking Monitor component, as shown in .","The tracking monitor  is another servlet that displays the aggregated information in meaningful way to the system analysts  who access the monitor  using a web browser . The views exposed by the monitor  would include dedicated views for EventRecord data like:\n\n","3D visualizations of the LocationRecord data are also possible that allows to track the special routes that individual objects took in the virtual world  (e.g. the route the virtual shopping carts took through a virtual mall).","As depicted in  the location tracking data can also be used to project this data back into the virtual world  to directly visualize the 3D data in the virtual world  itself by a tracking data visualizer  implemented in the virtual world . For instance, the routes of the shopping carts in the mall could be visualized as thicker or thinner lines on the mall floor depending on how many carts have been traversing a specific hall way. In this scenario, the system analysts  do not use a web browser  to analyze the data, but they log into the virtual world , enter the mall and directly see the sweet spots and the weak points rendered directly within their part of the virtual world .","To achieve this, the tracking data visualizer script component in the virtual world  retrieves the corresponding aggregated 3D data from the tracking monitor servlet  via a corresponding HTTP GET request. Depending on the retrieved data the visualizer  adjusts the visual appearance of the object containing the script component to actually visualize the data (e.g. change the texture of the object).","To accommodate such requests, the tracking monitor servlet  exposes a corresponding REST service (REST=Representational State Transfer) to allow the tracking data visualizer  to retrieve aggregated data relevant for the specific object doing the request. This approach shields the individual visualizer objects from having to implement complex aggregation logic and allows to keep them simple such that basically any object can be turned into a tracking data visualizer  very easily.","The invention can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc.","Furthermore, the invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by on in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk-read-only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk-read\/write (CD-R\/W) and DVD.","A preferred data processing system suitable for storing and\/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.","Input\/output or I\/O-devices (including, but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly of through intervening I\/O controllers.","Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems, cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.","While the foregoing has been with reference to particular embodiments of the invention, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes in these embodiments may be made without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention together with the above-mentioned and other objects and advantages may best be understood from the following detailed description of the embodiments, but not restricted to the embodiments, wherein is shown in:","FIG. \u2014a preferred embodiment of a virtual world object tracking system;","FIG. \u2014a life cycle of a preferred re-usable code portion in a virtual world;","FIG. \u2014data tracking within a preferred re-usable code portion; and","FIG. \u2014a preferred embodiment of a virtual world object data analysis."]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
