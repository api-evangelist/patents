{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates generally to network management. In particular, the invention relates to systems and methods for search contents of a network.","A variety of network management platforms exist to assist network administrators with installing and configuring network resources and services. In many platforms, a management server can be used to issue commands to hosts or other network nodes to manage the configuration of the network hosts, underlying clients or other devices. As part of the management of comparatively large-scale and other networks, changes are made to systems of the network and new systems are added and removed. Often, the different systems in the network inter-depend on each other. As changes are made to the systems, the changes can often affect multiple systems in the network. As such, the administrators must be able to identity different systems that can be affected by changes.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present invention are described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments thereof. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be implemented in, all types of information and systems, and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying figures, which illustrate specific embodiments. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for managing a network of computing systems and devices. More particularly, a network management server can utilize a search tool to search the components of the computing systems and devices for specified settings and configurations.","According to embodiments, the network management server can be configured to search the components of computing systems and devices in a managed network for specified settings and configurations in order to determine if the computing systems or devices contain the specified settings and configurations. The network management server can be configured to utilize a search tool. The search tool can be configured to receive a request containing search parameters. The search parameters can identify specific settings and configurations to search for in the components of the systems and devices of the managed network.","According to embodiments, once the request is received, the search tool can be configured to initiate a search of the components of all the systems and devices in the managed network based on the search parameters. The search tool can be configured to individually search all the systems and devices to identify the systems and devices and components of the systems and devices that match the search parameters. Likewise, search tool can be configured to instruct the systems and devices to perform the search and return the identify the systems and devices and components of the systems and devices that match the search parameters.","According to embodiments, once the search is completed, the search tool and\/or the network management server can be configured to categorize the search results (identify the systems and devices and components of the systems and devices that match the search parameters). Additionally, the search tool and\/or the network management can be configured to store the search results and\/or report the search results to the requester of the search or any other entity.","By utilizing the search tool, the network management server can search the entire network of managed computing systems and devices for specific settings and configurations. When changes occur affecting the specific setting and configurations, the network management server can quickly and efficiently locate computing systems and devices affected by the change without individually checking each system or device. As such, the network management server can reduce the time and effort of managing the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110","105","115"]},"In embodiments, the network management system  can be configured to communicate with a set of supervisory hosts  via one or more networks  in the managed network .
