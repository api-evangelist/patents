{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to information technology (IT) services and, more particularly, to Web services.","In information technology (IT) services such as Internet Web services, typically a user utilizing a Web browser, knows the provider Web service interface but is unaware of the number of Web services involved in implementing that interface. Further, the user is unaware of the location of the Web services or which service can serve the user request. Web services are software services (i.e., services provided by a software module). The most prominent approach for managing Web services utilizes a Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) based registry. UDDI is a standard for publishing and locating information about Web services, using an information framework for description and classification of information such as Web services, and interfaces for the Web services.","Conventional Web service registries can be used to determine the number and location of Web services involved in a Web service interface implementation. However, such registries do not provide information about which Web service can serve the user request best. Such registries simply provide information such as \u201call implementations can serve your request\u201d. However, this is not accurate and, in reality, the selection responsibility is with the user in determining which Web service implemented can best serve the user request for service. The user must engage in UDDI programming to fetch the information about all such Web service implementations to determine the appropriate one.","A correlator for Web services is provided. One embodiment involves receiving a request for a Web service and automatically correlating a request to a Web service by: searching in an information technology network for Web services that can satisfy the request, selecting among the Web services a Web service satisfying the request and providing the selected Web service in response to the request.","The information technology network may comprise the Internet. Receiving a request for a Web service may further include receiving a Service Data Object (SDO) encapsulating service request information from a browser; searching for Web services further includes: based on the service information searching for Web services to satisfy the service request by querying each Web service to determine if it can satisfy the request; and selecting among the Web services further includes: selecting among the Web services using the service information to provide a Web service best suited for satisfying the request.","In another embodiment, a registry is maintained for one or more service records, wherein each service record registers a service interface and name for an associated Web service. Each service interface includes a filter function for determining if the associated Web service can satisfy a request. Receiving a request for a Web service further includes: receiving a service interface name for the interface of the service of interest and receiving a Service Data Object (SDO) encapsulating service request information. Searching for Web services that can satisfy the service request further includes: querying each service interface filter function to determine if the associated Web service can satisfy the request.","Correlating the request to a Web service is performed in a Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry implementation. Each provider of a Web service implements said filter function for the service interface associated with the Web service, and a Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry implements querying each service interface filter function to determine if the associated Web service can satisfy the request, and selecting among the Web services a Web service satisfying the request.","The following description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and is not meant to limit the inventive concepts claimed herein. Further, particular features described herein can be used in combination with other described features in each of the various possible combinations and permutations. Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, all terms are to be given their broadest possible interpretation including meanings implied from the specification as well as meanings understood by those skilled in the art and\/or as defined in dictionaries, treatises, etc. The description may disclose several preferred embodiments for information technology (IT) Web services. While the following description will be described in terms of Web services for clarity and placing the invention in context, it should be kept in mind that the teachings herein may have broad application to all types of systems, devices and applications.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a correlator system that relieves the consumer from Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) programming to fetch the information about all Web service implementations to then determine the appropriate Web service for a user request. The correlator system places responsibility for fetching such information on the registry and the Web service providers.","The correlator system includes a filter module and a request correlator module. These modules can comprise software modules including program instructions for execution by one or more processors or computing devices. In one implementation of the correlator system, each Web service provider implements the filter module configured to check the user request data to judge if the request can be processed by that Web service or not. The UDDI registry implements the request correlator module configured to receive a service request from the user, find the Web service providers that match the requested interface and utilize the filter module of each matching Web service provider to select a Web service provider best suited to service the user request. A translator service implementation is the service provider for English-to-French translation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","11","12","15","15","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","21","22","23","24","25","1","2","24","26","24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["30","20","1","1","1"]},"In steps .. and ..., the Service Correlator iterates on the registry ServiceRecords searching for the registration entry for the provided InterfaceName. When the registry entry of said Interface Name is found, in steps .., ... and .., the Service Correlator obtains all concrete Web service implementations of the interface associated with said Interface Name, and iterates on them asking each Web service whether it \u201ccanHandle\u201d the request based on the provided request data in the SDO. When a Web service answers positively, in steps ., .. and ., the ServiceCorrelator returns that Web service to the Consumer as a selected Web service. In one example, the best Web service may be the first service that can handle the request. Other ways of selecting a best Web service may also be used.","Specifically, when a Web service answers positively, the Service Correlator returns it to the Consumer in case the \u201cfindService\u201d is the originally called method, or the Service Correlator calls the Services' \u201chandle\u201d method providing it the SDO and receiving the resulting SDO then returning it to the consumer in case the \u201chandle\u201d method is the called method. The sequence describes one scenario which is calling \u201chandle\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-5","FIG. 4"],"b":["20","41","42","43","44","41","42","43","44"]},"When the service correlator process is not used, as shown by process  in , the ordering process involves three different approval sub-processes , , and , for the three customer types, although all three sub-processes take the same input and have the same interface (e.g., Order Approval user interface). If the organization owning the order processing service Web server decides to add a fourth consumer type (e.g., \u201cDiamond customer type), the order processing system requires an update (i.e., a fourth approval sub-process for the fourth customer type), and re-deployment of the entire order processing system (i.e., main process including modules , , , and ) to handle that case.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["50","20","51","52","53","54","43","43","43","30","43","43"],"i":["a","b","c "]},"The correlator system is further useful in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) processed, Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) processes, etc. The correlator system takes dynamic decisions out of the process itself and provides the capability to dynamically plug-in services in an SOA solution or a BPEL process. Decisions are dynamic because, when any service (used by the process) is changed, being able\/unable to handle the process request, will be reflected automatically on the process logic, without need to redevelop any part of the process (i.e., the process behavior is dynamically changed).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["100","100","101","130","130","102","104","102","130","106","102","104","106","104","130","108","102","104","110","102","102","106","102","104","106","110"]},"The server  may be coupled, via the bus , to a display  for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device comprises cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor , and for controlling cursor movement on the display .","According to one embodiment of the invention, the functions of the system  () are performed by the server  in response to the processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in the main memory . Such instructions may be read into the main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in the main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in the main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The terms \u201ccomputer program medium,\u201d \u201ccomputer usable medium,\u201d \u201ccomputer readable medium,\u201d and \u201ccomputer program product,\u201d are used to generally refer to media such as main memory, secondary memory, removable storage drive, a hard disk installed in hard disk drive, and signals. These computer program products are means for providing software to the computer system. The computer readable medium allows the computer system to read data, instructions, messages or message packets, and other computer readable information from the computer readable medium. The computer readable medium, for example, may include non-volatile memory, such as a floppy disk, ROM, flash memory, disk drive memory, a CD-ROM, and other permanent storage. It is useful, for example, for transporting information, such as data and computer instructions, between computer systems. Furthermore, the computer readable medium may comprise computer readable information in a transitory state medium such as a network link and\/or a network interface, including a wired network or a wireless network, that allow a computer to read such computer readable information. Computer programs (also called computer control logic) are stored in main memory and\/or secondary memory. Computer programs may also be received via a communications interface. Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computer system to perform the features of the present invention as discussed herein. In particular, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor or multi-core processor to perform the features of the computer system. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of the computer system.","Generally, the term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d, as used herein, refers to any medium that participated in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as the main memory . Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.","Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the server  can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector coupled to the bus  can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and place the data on the bus . The bus  carries the data to the main memory , from which the processor  retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received from the main memory  may optionally be stored on the storage device  either before or after execution by the processor .","The server  also includes a communication interface  coupled to the bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  that is connected to the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet . The Internet  uses electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from the server , are exemplary forms or carrier waves transporting the information.","In another embodiment of the server , interface  is connected to a network  via a communication link . For example, the communication interface  may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line, which can comprise part of the network link . As another example, the communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, the communication interface  sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through the local network  to a host computer  or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) . The ISP , in turn, provides data communication services through the Internet . The local network  and the Internet  both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which carry the digital data to and from the server , are exemplary forms or carrier waves transporting the information.","The server  can send\/receive messages and data, including e-mail, program code, through the network, the network link , and the communication interface . Further, the communication interface  can comprise of a USB\/Tuner and the network link  may be an antenna or cable for connecting the server  to a cable provider, satellite provider or other terrestrial transmission system for receiving messages, data and program code from another source.","The example versions of the invention described herein are implemented as logical operations in a distributed processing system such as the system  including the servers . The logical operations of the present invention can be implemented as a sequence of steps executing in the server , and, as interconnected machine modules, within the system . The implementation is a matter of choice and can depend on performance of the system  implementing the invention. As such, the logical operations constituting said example versions of the invention are referred to for e.g. as operations, steps or modules.","Similar to a server  described above, a client device  can include a processor, memory, storage device, display, input device, and communication interface (e.g., e-mail interface) for connecting the client device to the Internet , the ISP , or LAN , for communication with the servers .","The system  can further include computers (e.g., personal computers, computing nodes)  operating the same manner as client devices , wherein a user can utilize one or more computers  to manage data in the server .","As is known to those skilled in the art, the aforementioned example architectures described above, according to the present invention, can be implemented in many ways, such as program instructions for execution by a processor, as software modules, microcode, as computer program product on computer readable media, as logic circuits, as application specific integrated circuits, as firmware, etc. The embodiments of the invention can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to, firmware, resident software, microcode, etc. Furthermore, the embodiments of the invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by, or in connection with, a computer, processing device or any instruction execution system.
