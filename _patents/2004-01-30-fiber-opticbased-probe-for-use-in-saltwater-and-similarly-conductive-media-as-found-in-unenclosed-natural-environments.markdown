title: Fiber optic-based probe for use in saltwater and similarly conductive media as found in unenclosed natural environments
abstract: Arrays of optical fibers connected to specially configured electronics, e.g., a phototransistor, an LED, an amplifier, a detector, and display, software and PCMCIA A/D board available on a personal computer, are used to obtain continuous real-time acquisition, processing, and visualization of change in a media occurring in natural environments. Alternatively, many of the individual circuit elements above may be replaced with a power meter. In a specific application, data are collected on the depth of sediment below a body of water. As the sediment depth is changed by an event, the ends of the optical fibers in the array display a different reflection or transmission coefficient indicating that water has replaced sediment or vice versa. By knowing which of the optical fiber ends in the array is indicating the changed reflection or transmission coefficient, scour depth or silt accretion may be estimated. A method of employment of the system is also described.

This and related patents are available for licensing. Please contact Sharon Borland at 703 428-9112.","Scour is a severe problem that results in millions of dollars of damage to infrastructure and loss of life annually. Scour occurs during times of high tides, hurricanes, rapid river flow and icing conditions when sediment, including rocks, gravel, sand, and silt are transported by the currents, undermining bridge pier foundations, submarine utility cables and pipelines, and filling in navigational channels. Scour is dynamic; ablation and deposition can occur during the same high-energy hydrodynamic event, so the worst-case net effect cannot be easily predicted nor previously monitored in real-time.","Several bridge scour monitoring technologies exist, including several patented electromagnetic sensors, including U.S. Pat. No. 5,784,338, Time Domain Reflectometry System for Real-Time Bridge Scour Detection and Monitoring, to Yankielun, N. E. and L. Zabilansky, Jul. 21, 1998; U.S. Pat. No. 5,790,471, Water\/Sediment Interface Monitoring System Using Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave, to Yankielun and Zabilansky Aug. 4, 1998; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,084,393, Scour Probe Assembly, to Yankielun, Jul. 4, 2000.","These technologies, employing metallic time domain reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-modulated continuous wave FM-CW reflectometry have proved highly successful in detecting, monitoring and measuring scour and deposition of sediments in freshwater. However, they are of limited utility, or even unusable in conductive media such as brackish water, seawater, or in clays and some contaminated soils. Consequently, the technologies may be deployed only in inland (fresh) bodies of water having sediments comprising non-cohesive (non-clay-based) soils.","Dr. Yankielun developed an optical TDR-based (OTDR) scour probe that relies on \u201cmicro-bending\u201d in an optical fiber. This micro-bending is caused by the impinging pressure of sediments on a specially configured optical fiber to indicate the extent of scour depth. The technology is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,526,189, Scour Sensor Assembly, to Yankielun, Feb. 25, 2003. While circumventing the problems encountered by conventional metallic TDR in saline waters and cohesive soils, the system uses an expensive OTDR unit.","An embodiment of the present invention employs an optical reflection coefficient-based technique. See U.S. published patent application 20030117154 A1, Method and Instrument for Electronically Recording and Imaging Representations of the Interaction of an Object with Its Environment, by Yankielun and J. H. Clark, Jun. 26, 2003, incorporated herein by reference. Using this technique, one may detect, monitor and measure sediment transport in conductive water\/sediment environments economically, continuously and in real-time.","This new technology improves the ability to perform sediment transport research, monitoring, and measurement in coastal zones, saltwater estuaries, embayments and other highly conductive waters, especially in cold regions and in the presence of ice. The system is not only applicable to saline and highly conductive environments but will function as well in freshwater regimes.","In general, a system is provided for monitoring and alerting to change in media. It comprises optical means for sensing change in characteristics of media and transmitting data representing the change; an array of these optical means in which an end of each optical means is affixed to a support having a long axis and each optical means is exposed orthogonal to the media with respect to the long axis; a means for energizing each optical means; a processing means communicating with the optical means; and a means for coupling together the optical means, the energizing means and the processing means. The array may be configured to provide a pre-specified level of detail regarding the change. Real time alerting is associated to the change and information related to the change is displayed and recorded by the processing means. Depending on its application, the system may include a control device and an anchoring device for installation.","An embodiment of the present invention monitors and alerts to change in media adjacent an installed part of the embodiment. It comprises an array of optical fibers affixed to a support, each optical fiber having an end exposed orthogonal to the media; a source to energize each optical fiber during operation; an optical coupler or splitter for each optical fiber; and a sub-system connected to each optical fiber during operation. The sub-system processes received data to provide real time alerting to the change and records and displays information corresponding thereto. An optical signal is maintained on each optical fiber during operation and the array may be configured to provide a pre-specified level of detail regarding a change.","The change may be indicated by a change in reflection coefficient, transmission coefficient, and combinations thereof. Data transmitted on the optical fibers, as well as the signals that energize the individual fibers, may be multiplexed in a pre-specified sequence.","The sub-system may further include a multi-channel multiplexed data acquisition printed circuit board incorporating an analog-to-digital converter connected to a personal computer having a display and software loadable on the personal computer for processing the data.","In one application, an embodiment of the present invention may be fitted with either or both of a control device and a heavy anchor for buried installation in sediments below a body of water.","A method for monitoring and alerting to change in media is also provided.

The value of the refractive index, \u03b7, varies if the \u201cb\u201d component of the boundary is water or saturated sediment. Although somewhat temperature dependent, water has a nominal refractive index of \u03b7, =1.3. Weast, R. C. (ed), , CRC Press, Cleveland, Ohio, 58edition, 1977. The core of the plastic optical fiber used in an embodiment of the present invention has an index of refraction of \u03b7=1.492. Industrial Fiber Optics, Inc., Product Catalog, Tempe, Ariz., 1999. Other optical fibers (either plastic or glass) with different characteristics may serve as well. The refractive index for other optical fibers may vary from this value, but should be selected to be different from that of water. The index of refraction, of the sedimentary material that may come in contact with the end of the clad optical fiber varies according to local mineralogy, granularity and packing efficiency as related by the sediment grain structure and the amount of water saturation thereof. The index of refraction from any sedimentary material is generally significantly different from both that of the overlying water and the optical fiber, even water that is muddy from runoff.","Refer to . The fiber optic scour sensor  consists of a vertical array of numerous, single point optical fibers  appearing approximately flush with the profile of a vertical support structure . The opto-electronics packages  are indicated by the symbol \u201cE\u201d and the multiplexer  is identified as \u201cMUX\u201d with output  to an appropriate processor\/display such as shown at  of . The optical fiber used in an embodiment of the present invention is a 1-mm, step index plastic fiber with a numerical aperture, NA, of 0.51, a core refractive index, \u03b7, of 1.492, a cladding refractive index, \u03b7, of 1.402, and an attenuation of <0.20 dB\/m. (Industrial Fiber Optics, Inc. 1999). Other optical fibers (either plastic or glass) with different characteristics may serve as well.","Refer to , a block diagram  of a single sensor \u201cmodule\u201d and related energy sources, processors, controls and display used in an embodiment of the present invention. For clarity, the multiplexer  of  is not shown in . Each optical fiber  is part of an array (as shown in ) inserted in a vertical support structure  and connected to its own optical coupler . Each optical coupler  is also connected to a multiplexer  for use with common source illumination circuitry , , processing circuitry , , , , and processor\/display . In application specific embodiments, the processing circuitry may be embodied in the processor\/display . In one embodiment of the present invention, the components , , ,  may be incorporated on a printed circuit board internal to the processor display  or in an alternative embodiment they may be located within the probe assembly along with the other components , , .","The light source , typically an LED, is energized using a signal generator . This signal is passed through the multiplexer  to each of the optical couplers (splitters) . The return signal from the end of the optical fiber  is fed from the optical splitters  to the multiplexer  from which it is sent to the optical receiver , typically a phototransistor. The signal from the optical receiver  is sent to a high pass filter  to attain a \u201ccleaner\u201d signal which is then amplified by an amplifier  before passing to a detector  as input to a processor\/display . The display may also contain control features, such as a keyboard for use by an operator in calibrating or operating the system . The multiplexer  permits each of the optical fibers  and their associated optical splitter  to share common source  and processing , , ,  devices in a pre-specified sampling sequence.","Refer to  illustrating a typical commercially available optical coupler . The optical fibers  are stripped of cladding as at  within a coupling medium  that is encased in a light tight case . This enables energy impinging on each of the two fibers of the optical splitter  to be \u201cshared\u201d for purposes of both transmitting and receiving light energy. Light energy entering, for example, Port   is divided in half, with equal components exiting through Ports   and  . Virtually no light entering Port   exits through Port  . The device functions similarly for light entering any of the four ports , , , . The optical coupler  permits a single optical fiber  to act simultaneously as a receiver and transmitter of light energy. An optical receiver  (phototransistor, photo-diode or similar device), designated as a phototransistor in , is connected to one port of the splitter . In one embodiment of the present invention, a light source , shown as an LED in  and typically emitting visible (660-nm) red light, is connected to another port of the splitter . In an embodiment of the present invention as represented in , the last port is a dark termination  implemented by covering the aperture of the port with black plastic tape (not shown separately) or otherwise providing an optically non-reflective termination. If referencing to , Port   is connected to the light source , Port   is connected to the optical receiver , Port   is terminated in the vertical support , and Port   is a dark termination , e.g., covered with black plastic tape thus providing a non-reflective termination. All optical fibers  inserted in the vertical support  may be configured similarly.","Since the optical fibers  may be exposed to some degree of ambient light when submerged in shallow water, pickup of background light along with the reflected light from the light source  would also be sensed by the optical receiver  and interfere with accurate scour depth measurement. There are at least two potential solutions to eliminate this interference.","Refer to . Using a light source  operating at a wavelength different from that of ambient light and appropriate optical bandpass filtering  at the photo sensor (receiver)  eliminates interference from the ambient light.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the time-varying intensity of natural ambient lighting is exploited. In most circumstances the intensity of natural ambient light tends to vary relative slowly with time (e.g., diurnal cycle, passage of clouds, etc.). To eliminate the interfering effects of ambient lighting, a 3-kHz square wave source  is used to modulate a visible light source , typically an LED. The signal received by each phototransistor (receiver)  is sent to a high-pass filter , thus eliminating any of the low-frequency components of the signal and permitting further analog processing of the received 3-kHz signal. This filtered signal is forwarded to an amplifier  and peak rectified in a detector , resulting in a DC voltage proportional to the intensity of the received signal. The output of the peak rectifier  is digitized using a 16-bit PCMCIA A\/D card (not shown separately) as may be installed in a processor\/display  such as a laptop computer, desktop computer, or a dedicated application specification processor. The subsequent data stream is processed, stored and may be displayed in real time on the display associated with the processor\/display . Values suitable for use with this embodiment of the present invention include at V a 10-Volt P-P 3-Khz generator, at V a 15 V power source, a red light LED , a phototransistor , an 1N914 diode, resistors having values as follows: R=470\u03a9, R=20 K\u03a9, R=4.7 K\u03a9, R=60 K\u03a9, a \u201cvariable resistor\u201d or \u201cpotentiometer\u201d VR=47 K\u03a9, and capacitors having values: C=0.01 \u03bcF, C=0.047 \u03bcF.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the data acquisition, processing and display software is written in LABVIEW\u00ae, a GUI-based language. Other convenient or appropriate computer language may be employed. Custom displays or display formats suitable for use on existing CRTs or LCDs may be developed for clear indication of scour conditions. For example,  depicts a dual display  suitable for use with a personal computer. It includes a vertical \u201cthermometer-like\u201d display  to show the dynamic change in scour level and a numeric display  to give an absolute or relative indication of scour depth in engineering units, accurate to the spatial resolution, i.e., the separation of optical fibers  in the sensor  of . Further, an alert function may be programmed into the processor to indicate when scour has reached a critical level such as displayed at the arrow .","Refer to . Depending on implementation specifics, embodiments of the present invention may have the optical receiver , source  and splitters  replaced with an optical power meter  that measures the reflected photonic power present in an optical path. A power meter  provides a more sophisticated (and expensive) implementation that monitors the power of both the transmitted and the reflected optical signal while producing an output proportional to the normalized reflected power. This embodiment also functions under the principle of changing reflectance levels at the end of an optical fiber  as a function of a change in the refractive index contrast at the boundary ab of the optical fiber path and the overlying sediment or water column. If the optical path terminates into saturated sediment, there will be a specific and measurable level of reflectance. If the terminal end of the optical path is terminated, instead, into water (as would occur during scour) a different level of reflectance is measured. By noting the difference between reflectance levels occurring with sediment and water, scour may be dynamically monitored. When using an optical power meter , the power meter  may be located \u201chigh and dry\u201d on the shoreline and coupled to the fiber scour sensor  by a series of optical fibers , or via a single optical fiber  and fiber multiplexer  located in the submerged scour probe .","Refer to . With the appropriate hardware, an embodiment of the present invention may be implemented using a directly connected optical or metallic umbilical cable . Additionally an embodiment may be implemented with a radio, ultrasonic, or other form of remote telemetry (not shown separately) to transmit scour status from the buried optical probe  to an on-shore monitoring and data storage system such as that described as elements , , ,  and .","In the case of a highly saline environment, e.g., seawater, the radio telemetry method is impractical because of the losses suffered by the radio signal propagating through a lossy medium. Additionally, an implementation using batteries and a wireless means (all not shown separately), such as a radio or submerged acoustic telemetry link, is most suitable for shorter-term applications in which the probe is either disposable or retrievable for refurbishment and replacement of batteries. An umbilical cable-based system as depicted in  is intended primarily for long-term or permanent monitoring situations where the umbilical cable  may be easily and more permanently installed and used in electrically lossy environments. Further, the sub-system that receives and processes sensor data may be operated in a more benign environment than the probe ,  itself.","In one application, an embodiment of the present invention is buried in river bottom sediments  below water  in a body of water being monitored for scour. It is emplaced via a heavy anchor  at a point below the maximum expected depth of scour. Primarily, an embodiment of the present invention is designed for installation by \u201cair jetting\u201d or \u201chydro jetting\u201d. Alternatively, it may be installed in softer sediments by being \u201cpile driven\u201d or hydraulically forced into the sediment . In one embodiment of the present invention, the top of the installed probe is \u201csurveyed in\u201d relative to a local survey benchmark.","Depending on the desired implementation, output signals of an embodiment of the present invention may be further multiplexed to monitor a distributed array consisting of numerous probes (each having a vertical array of optical fibers  as shown in ) installed in close proximity to a structure or sediment field of interest.","There are advantages to the implementation of an optical time domain reflectometer for scour monitoring:\n\n","Numerous industrial, commercial, and military instrumentation and measurement systems can take advantage of this technique. Some potential applications include:\n\n","Although only a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the invention.
