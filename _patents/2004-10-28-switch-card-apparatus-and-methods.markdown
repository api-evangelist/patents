The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present disclosure relates to switch cards for electrical systems, and more specifically, to switch card apparatus and methods having wide voltage range, high current capability for use with, for example, safe and arm devices for missiles.","The handling of live missile boosters presents obvious dangers to personnel. Conventional safe and arm devices are mechanical relays that fully isolate the battery from the squib for purposes of firing train interruption. Applicable specifications (e.g. Mil-STD-1901A) typically require safe and arm devices to include the ability to eliminate a single fault scenario. Particular program requirements may impose more stringent safety specifications.","Although desirable results have been achieved using prior art safe and arm devices, there may be room for improvement. For example, each missile may have a variety of critical signals that must be isolated, each of which may have widely different voltage and current levels. A particular missile's load current variability may be very high with an extremely wide voltage range that requires a specific design solution. Thus, conventional safe and arm devices are typically designed for a particular missile, and lack the capacity to handle the range of voltages and current variabilities presented by multiple missile types.","The present invention is switch card switch card apparatus and methods for electrical systems. Embodiments of the present invention may provide a safe and reliable solution as an acceptable safe and arm device on multiple missile configurations, meeting or exceeding isolation requirements for safely isolating the battery and squibs and ensures personnel safety during the handling of live missile boosters. Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may be capable of handling a wide voltage and current range, suitable for use in association with multiple missile and safety applications.","In one embodiment, an arming and firing circuit for applying a control voltage to a load includes a first portion having a first switch adapted to be coupled to a first voltage, a second portion operatively coupled to the first portion and including a second switch, and a third portion operatively coupled to the second portion and adapted to be coupled to the load, the third portion also including a third switch. The first portion is adapted to receive a first input signal and to activate the first switch in response to a first value of the first input signal to couple the first voltage to the second portion. Similarly, the second portion is adapted to receive a second input signal and to activate the second switch in response to a second value of the second input signal and in response to the first voltage from the first portion to couple a second voltage to the third portion. Finally, the third portion is adapted to receive a third input signal and to activate the third switch in response to a third value of the third input signal and in response to the second voltage from the second portion to couple the control voltage to the load.","The present invention relates to switch card apparatus and methods for electrical systems.

One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments, or that the present invention may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description.","In general, embodiments and apparatus and methods in accordance with the present invention provide a safe and reliable solution as an acceptable safe and arm device on multiple missile configurations, meeting the requirements for safely isolating the battery and the squibs, and ensuring personal safety during the handling of live missile boosters. Because embodiments of the present invention are adapted to handle a wide voltage and current range, multiple missile and safety applications may be safely accommodated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","100","102","104","100","106","107","108","104","102","106","107","108","104","104","100"]},"The test system  includes an assembly test equipment module  coupled to a booster emulator module  which is, in turn, coupled to the Booster Avionics Module  of the missile assembly .

A third section  (Section ) includes signal conditioning  and high side switch circuitry  for the first input signal CONTROL_IN. The third section  works as a safe and arm for the firing circuitry of fourth and fifth sections ,  (Sections  and ). As shown in , when activated, a signal out of the optocoupler U enters the third section  and deactivates a first transistor Q, which turns on a second transistor Q, and then a third transistor Q, and a fourth transistor Q. In one embodiment, the second transistor Q is an n-channel MOSFET which turns on the p-channel MOSFETs Q and Q. Transistors Q and Q are connected in parallel to allow increased current capability. Transistors Q and Q also separate the battery power  from next stage circuitry. When the third section  (Section ) is deactivated, the first transistor Q turns on, which shuts off transistors Q, Q, and Q.","Specifically, in the embodiment show in , the activation works as follows: the first input signal CONTROL_IN (e.g. a +5V signal) comes from the computer inputs  into a resistor R and the optocoupler U. The first input signal CONTROL_IN turns on a light emitting diode inside of the optocoupler U forcing the output of the optocoupler U to go low. This shuts off the first transistor Q, which produces a voltage divider output at resistors R, R, and R (e.g. of 12 V) at the gate-to-source of transistor Q. This turns on the second transistor Q setting up another voltage divider at resistors R and R (e.g. of 12 V) from transistors Q and Q gate to source. Transistors Q and Q then turn on, thereby closing the switch  () and allowing the battery voltage  to go to the fourth section  (Section ). This activation pattern is similar in the fourth and fifth sections ,  (Sections  and ). A pair of diodes VR and VR (e.g. Zener diodes) limit the maximum divider voltage across the gate to source of the transistors Q, Q, and Q (e.g. to 15 V) over a relatively wide voltage range input (e.g. 12 to 100 Vdc).","The deactivation works as follows: a deactivation signal (e.g. 0V) comes from the computer  into the resistor R and the optocoupler U. The deactivation signal turns off the light emitting diode inside of the optocoupler U forcing the output of the optocoupler U to go high. This turns on transistor Q, grounding off transistor Q. With transistor Q off, the gate to source voltage across transistors Q and Q is zero, keeping both transistors Q and Q off, and opening the switch . This deactivation pattern is also similar in the fourth and fifth sections ,  (Sections  and ).","As mentioned above, the fourth section  (Section ) works in a similar manner to the third section  (Section ) and includes a signal conditioning  and a high side switch circuitry  for a second input signal CONTROL_IN. When activated, the signal out of the Optocoupler U deactivates Q, which turns on transistor Q, and then transistors Q, and Q. In a presently preferred embodiment, transistor Q is an n-channel MOSFET which turns on the p-channel MOSFETs Q and Q. Transistors Q and Q are connected in parallel to allow increased current capability. Transistors Q and Q also separate the third section power from the load (missile squib) . When the fourth section  (Section ) is deactivated, transistor Q turns on, which shuts off transistors Q, Q, and Q. The fourth section  also contains diodes (CR) for reverse voltage protection and for the option of additional current summing of modules.","With continued reference to , the fifth section  (Section ) includes signal conditioning  and low side switch circuitry  for the third input signal CONTROL_IN. When activated, the signal out of the optocoupler U deactivates transistors Q and Q, which turns on transistors Q and Q. Again, in one embodiment, transistors Q and Q are n-channel MOSFETs and are connected in parallel to allow increased current capability. Transistors Q and Q separate the load from ground . When the fifth section  (Section ) is deactivated, transistors Q and Q turn on, which shuts off transistors Q and Q.","A sixth section  (Section ) includes load current and load voltage telemetry monitoring circuitry . The telemetry current out of a current sensor Ul, in one embodiment equal to a load current divided by , is sent as a voltage to telemetry. The resulting telemetry load voltage is a buffered output of the load voltage. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) D-D are also utilized to indicate when the battery input and Sections , , and  are activated.","Embodiments of the present invention may provide significant advantages over prior art safe and arm devices. For example, embodiments of the present invention provide a safe and reliable solution as an acceptable safe and arm device on multiple missile configurations, meeting or exceeding isolation requirements for safely isolating the battery and squibs and ensures personnel safety during the handling of live missile boosters. Embodiments of the present invention also provide multiple fault tolerances. Furthermore, because embodiments of the present invention are capable of handling a wide voltage and current range, such embodiments are suitable for use in association with multiple missile and safety applications.","While preferred and alternate embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes such as adding equivalent blocks (, sections , , or ), can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is not limited by the disclosure of these preferred and alternate embodiments.
