title: System and method for fuzzy concept mapping, voting ontology crowd sourcing, and technology prediction
abstract: The invention provides a system and method for providing ttx-based categorization services and a categorized commonplace of shared information. Currency of the contents is improved by a process called conjuring/concretizing wherein users' thoughts are rapidly infused into the Map. As a new idea is sought, a goal is created for a search. After the goal idea is found, a ttx is concretized and categorized. The needs met by such a Map are prior art searching, competitive environmental scanning, competitive analysis study repository management and reuse, innovation gap analysis indication, novelty checking, technology value prediction, investment area indication and planning, and product technology comparison and feature planning.

More specifically, but not by way of limitation, the invention relates to a system and method for concept-based management of categorizations or classifications to organize a commonplace, enhancing the navigability of very large information bases by providing in-depth sub-categorization of terminology bases, providing users with incentives to be creative, protecting crowd sourced contributions, managing searches for what is known either within, or in some accessible location outside of it, and establishing communities associated especially with the concepts, or its narrow categories, and particularly in Intellectual Property. It provides a user a searching tool for something known or unknown, capturing the concept if unknown to be reused as if known. This invention extends to new forms of fuzzy clustering and hierarchical self-organizing maps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,","Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;","And as imagination bodes forth","The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen","Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing","A local habitation and a name.","Such tricks hath strong imagination, . . . \u201d\n        \n        "]}}}},"Known systems for ideation and innovation, developed over centuries, are closed so that the ideas generated are hidden for long periods. While this is somewhat effective in a commercial sense, the attitude fostered and results are often counter-productive for society. Modern concepts of open software and crowd sourcing, coming from the utopian view, also have faults.","Intellectual Property Classification management services may include, for instance, ideation, intellectual property categorization, information asset categorization, product management, product line management, competitive analysis, study management, study outsourcing, development outsourcing, information categorization and retrieval management, contract management, communities, technology advertising, incentives management, collaboration management, and, emergence games involving technology.","Known systems and methods for providing complex conceptual data for searching associatively, along with the connected management of search, retrieval, and categorization services have many disadvantages, however. Present topic maps are of limited use because firm and precise identification of subjects in topic maps works only with a limited set of locators. They cannot easily be kept current or organized. They fail to predict, and they are inefficient. Previous systems have not used capturing of conjuring and only one known project has incorporated the idea of consensus through voting. Previous research efforts have not focused on the business process elements of the problem.","What is needed is an improved categorization, search and retrieval management paradigm combined into a tool that: empowers users to proactively seek a better understanding of the best available knowledge; stirs imagination; provides deep and dynamic prior art classification; addresses the full life cycle of knowledge refinement; and manages the progress of ideas from conception to description to protection to collaboration to securitization and to public release and use for the next great idea. It must bring in knowledge so that a user sees it as already having the knowledge in order for the user to trust it as a search tool. While we extend beyond present inventions, we acknowledge the prior work done in:\n\n","The invention provides, in one embodiment, a system and method for providing crowd sourced consensus building, topic categorization services, a commonplace, and on-line community services by topics.","A result of the system and method is a Common Mental Map (CMM) for navigation. Visualization maps provide a customized view of this \u2018best available\u2019 information commonplace. Different visualizations and views provide efficient tools to communities. Information from users and disparate external sources is combined and merged to form a more complete commonplace.","A user searching for something, known or unknown, provides one source of information for the commonplace. By capturing the concept searched for, the system saves the creative thought for reuse, and captures the fact of the search for that concept for value prediction.","As a goal-based search is performed for what a user believes is a concept already known, the goal is moved in the map to a location where the concept may most likely be found, and if the user is not successful in finding a match, the goal itself is concretized as representing the concept being search for, and categorized into where the goal was moved to, thus making a new concept out of a mere thought of the user. When a user conjures a concept and wishes to save it in the system, a representation is concretized and one or more categorization techniques are considered for categorizing the concept. The representation becomes an indexing point for attachment of information resources. After the concept is described, it may be shared with others, form the basis for investment or social interaction, used in a classification index or a mashup, or be used as a category for new ideas. Finally, the concept's characteristics, its categorization, and its importance may be reviewed by the crowd to determine changes needed, and new ideas are discovered, closing the lifecycle. The commonplace provides for analysis and prediction on a \u2018best available\u2019 data basis.","The term concept is too general to be used in the following. Generally, concepts are ttxs represented by cnxpts. The Topic Map Standard \u2018subject\u2019 is similar to the ttx, and the \u2018topic\u2019 is similar to the cnxpt, but more general.","The following outlines a search and categorization tool useful, in one embodiment, for rapidly finding tcepts, TPLs, or appcepts stored in a CMMDB that contains a structured list of categories including, but not limited to: fields of study, categories of tcepts, and categories of appcepts.","In one embodiment, the categorization is visualized, in one CMMV visualization technique called a map, as a visible \u2018skin\u2019 of a sphere that represents, including, but not limited to, a: cnxpt, goal, tcept, tcept category, TPL, tplxpt, appcept, appcept category. The CMMV \u2018category\u2019 spheres may contain internal spheres that represent, including, but not limited to, a: tcept, tcept category, appcept, appcept category, or another ttx. The CMMV \u2018category\u2019 structure is derived from various relationships in the CMMDB. The CMMDB is initially populated by automated consolidation of existing indices and tools such as cluster and cross-citation analysis, but is maintained and extended by crowd source collaboration, the ease of which is improved by effective visualization and editing interfaces. \u2018Votes\u2019 on the existence, validity, relationships, categorization, relevance of external information, and data quality of info-items within the CMMDB are the basis for reaching consensus on the accuracy of the categorization, prediction, naming, and description.","The utility of this is that it provides a facility to assist users in their daily activities involving, including, but not limited to: ideation, innovation, product planning, and competitive intelligence. Users are often expected to be technology workers or intellectual property workers. In each case, the users will need to organize their work. This system provides a toolset for staying organized. It is intended to contain the basis of categorization for, including, but not limited to, ttxs and tcepts. The tcepts are not only historic, but prospective.","The utility of this is that it provides a management tool for crowd sourcing in innovation to bridge from older patent protection systems to first to file patent systems, to utopian open source systems while protecting inventors. It provides a management tool to serve various sets of users needing information at different phases of its gestation, including but not limited to: armchair inventors and science fiction writers conjuring futuristic ideas, entrepreneurs and investors concerned about practical ideas not yet developed, product planners and competitive analysis working on product lines, and researchers, educators, individuals and governments concerned with new ideas and networking, providing to each answers they need. Futurists and creative people effectively \u2018out\u2019 their technology ideas into the \u2018map\u2019 and then, on a collaborative basis, the ideas are improved and re-categorized, making it usable for the users having funds who can pay for the information. The constraint of data quality is reduced into a positive because the impurities in the data become a force toward innovation itself, giving other users a spark known as an \u2018adjacent possible\u2019. The result is a proactive system for creativity measurement and tool for affecting and directing technology.","Purposes","An embodiment of the invention provides management of a CMMDB in a specific domain of the owner's choice.","An embodiment of the invention provides a visualization tool for depicting a map of the ttxs in a CMMDB, allowing map navigation, searching, refinement operations, execution of analytics, and interaction with associated communities.","An embodiment of the invention provides the mechanisms and procedures to achieve a CMMDB that is the best available source for a list of ttxs.","An embodiment of the invention provides the mechanisms and procedures to achieve a CMMDB database that is the best available source for a list of txpts and appcepts.","An embodiment of the invention provides the mechanisms and procedures to utilize a combination of user discussions, categorizations from outside, collected concretizations of conjurings, and the prior state of the stored Common Mental Map to provide a base upon which to users can search for abstract thoughts that are converted to new categorized ttxs to provide a continually improved and explicit formal specification of the ttxs that are assumed to exist in some Area of Interest and the relationships that hold among them.","An embodiment of the invention provides a method and apparatus for providing ttx categorization visualizations (\u201cmaps\u201d), comprising: 1) the Preparation step comprising planning the ttx map study, 2) the Generation step comprising: receiving data indicating a ttx, the data including at least one of a defining of a search goal, a defining of a query, a marking of a place on a visualization derived from the CMMDB, an extension of a ttx, a subdividing of a ttx, a combining of two ttxs to form a convergence, a defining of a new ttx, a defining of a contradictory feature or requirement for an existing ttx, a coalescing of a ttx into the CMMDB, a stating that a ttx is defined by an information resource;

Embodiments of the invention provide general tools for creativity, categorizing, virtual mapping, visualization, search, and retrieval of ttxs and its extensions for web communities and analytics. Embodiments of the invention also provide a specialization of the general tools directed to technology innovation, creativity, and categorizations, as well as the procedures for manipulating categorizations and use of the tools, technical information categorization and retrieval controls, and business processes for incentivization and fee collection.","Sub-headings are used below for organizational convenience, but do not necessarily limit the disclosure of any particular feature to any particular section of this specification. An improved information categorization and retrieval lifecycle including the process flows involved is presented first, followed by the tool descriptions and the related process flows. The Functional Architecture is presented after the lifecycle, tools, and process flows.","Observations: Advantages and Disadvantages","One use of creativity is in technology innovation. One use of creativity is in legal argument, resulting in development of law.","Creativity","There is a need to better organize for and incentivize creativity and innovation. This creativity begins with the general case of \u2018new idea\u2019 to be collected and categorized, but extends to: by way of example, technology innovation and entrepreneurship. The need extends to incentivizing entrepreneurs to start businesses based upon needed technologies and for technical people to be incentivized to work on clearing the roadblocks to use of technologies. There is an additional need to improve the capturing and use of creativity and the reusability of innovation workers' results, and to otherwise use the information collected for more efficient and effective innovation. There is a need to provide continuous quality improvement of ideas and an iterative process that yields a continuous flow of new ideas and improvements for predictions.","There is a need to reuse the efforts of others over time, incorporating and improving other's understanding of relationships among tcepts, their purlieu timeframes or contexts, and their cncpttrrts. As an example, competitive strategists draw a breakdown diagram of the field they are studying, and summarize their research on the basis of the diagram, resulting in a paper based but reusable understanding of the relationships between technology application domains and players. There is a need is to make this structure available and efficient for users, so that understanding of the knowledge is progressive and the amount of work required of each individual user is small.","There is a need to foster innovation within society and within companies. This need extends to more effective collective development of innovations. Sharing of innovation globally or within a project or company, coupled with protections and collective development, is needed.","Legal Clarity","There is a need to decrease an inventors time to file for patent protection. The economic benefit of immediately filing has changed dramatically through reduced cost to file and reduced burden on best mode and possibility of non-public inventorship.","There is a need to improve the common understanding of the issues and ttxs as recorded by others in legal documents, research papers, and more generally. People around the world have different opinions on definitions of a ttx, and what categorization it should fall under. The difference increases over time partly due to generalization chauvinism theory\u2014since people judge past eras by present standards. For example: When someone said the word \u2018pipes\u2019 (referring to the instrument used as a medium of transportation), it was defined as lead pipes two decades ago, concrete pipes a decade ago, and Carbon nano-tubes in today's world.","There is a need to show ttxs and issues side by side other sources regarding similar ttxs, and products offering these classification indices must be improved to become more dynamically organized to improve efficiency. Examples of such systems abound, including the Shepard's system, Lexis and Westlaw, all of the various patent research systems. Google performs this function with loosened constraints and poorer results for a wider market of topics, but none of these systems offer all that is needed by a researcher who must work effectively, retain and update his work effortlessly, combine the results needed from several sources, and spend less to get the satisfactory result sought. Legal analysis could be built on the shoulders of what others considered rather than merely on their results in court opinions. The strength of an argument could be predicted where prior success at use of a position could be measured, but it can also be predicted by an attorney considered and rejected its use, given a similar fact pattern.","Sharing of Creative Results","There is a need to answer the currently existing demand for technology by uncovering the available technologies isolated in the mind of any of the thousands of potential inventors now unable to find the appropriate means to get an idea into the reach of those able to make use of it.","There is a need to improve the current burdensome common ground for inventors, technology seekers, and technology holders called the patent system. Efficiency demands allowing these groups to come together and share their knowledge, their problems and their potential solutions to avoid replication of technology invention and solve the chaos created due to disorganization existing in today's world.","There is an additional need to variously balance or reconcile the ease of global sharing of knowledge and the cost of exposing valuable Intellectual Property (utility patents or other secrets). Owners of IP need to know what is known by others about technologies they own. They also need access to technologies that surpass their own to solve larger appcepts as is seen within make or buy studies.","There is a need to incentivize and award creativity and thus to protect the new ttxs as they are shaped into marketable products and services. Team formation and investment must occur within the parameters of these protections, but must occur.","There is thus a need to move ideas from those who have them to those who can generate higher value from them. To do so, this need demands that the ideas have to be collected, managed, organized, made retrievable, made useful for valuation and analysis, and, set to be the anchoring point to which new material can be related in a cognitive structure.","Learning","There is an additional need to empower meaningful learning. \u201cMeaningful learning results when new information is acquired by deliberate effort on the part of the learner to connect the new information with relevant, preexisting topics or propositions in the learner's own cognitive structure.\u201d Ausubel. Here, meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new ttxs and propositions into existing cognitive structures.","There is an additional need to empower serendipitous learning to make it fun to learn of ttxs that a user had previously not studied or known about through browsing within ttx categories (subject areas) and frequently discovering resources that are tangentially related to known ttxs. This need is not adequately addressed by today's online resources or by search engines like Google, even though the ability widely enjoyed.","There is an additional need to provide the mental excitement as would occur in game program to keep the speed of learning high. Incremental explorative browsing should be provided alongside other techniques to look for something specific, such as performing a search to get to the area showing the required information.","Information Management Tools","There is a need for improvement in technology information management, a broad field today hobbled by a lack of effective tools and proper incentives. In the past, technology information categorization and retrieval meant prior art searching at the patent office, a competitive intelligence study, or a technology road mapping project at a product company. Each of these ad hoc exercises consistently result in one time reports that become stale rapidly. The infrastructure for the studies\u2014the queries and intermediate results\u2014are usually lost soon after the report is written, and have to be recreated when the inevitable need for a repeat of the effort occurs.","There is a need for users to decrease their costs for legal research. The presents Shepard's system, while widely used, is costly yet restricted in abilities relative to what is possible today with dynamic indexing and refinement, akin to but beyond Google's systems.","There is a need for professionals to become proactive in using and managing intellectual property as the need for rapid innovation and more efficient utilization of resources increases, and the amazing amount of information becoming available and the new paradigms of work such as open source expand. For instance, prior art searching must be more efficient than ever because of the extreme waste of resources spent on reinvention and poor utilization of the knowledge of others.","Another need is in environmental scanning within competitive intelligence. Management is driven to see farther out strategically and they often realize how ineffective their tools and organizations are when they are blind-sided by a competitor from another part of the world or another industry.","The rise of data mining and investment vehicles and products improves the market for new analytic and investment products.","The disintermediation of investing and teaming, allowing ventures to form online and be invested in directly establishes a need for vetting, effort management, investment portfolio management, pooled investments, and communities online for entities seeking investment, etc.","Name and Relationship Based Information Management Tools","There is a need to provide deeper classification. Experts are held back when only superficial descriptions of ttxs are available, meant only for the novice. Novices need to start at a general level and progress toward detail only to the degree they must based upon their task. Experts need to be concerned about the future, while investors need to be concerned about the timing of invention, inventors need to know about the details of prior art, and competitive analysts need detailed information about very specific topics. Novices need little of these, but want to find out whether an idea they have considered may have been invented already. What is needed is a tool to mitigate the differentials in understanding levels between experts and novices while addressing the needs of each, and managing the authority and quality issues related to dynamic classification complexity.","A missing element from traditional information categorization and retrieval product solutions is the equivalent of a personal command and control system (a \u2018Dashboard\u2019) coordinated with a consistent management system and database. The command and control system would have to connect the point solution results to a user's view of the CMM when appropriate to achieve consistency, harmonization, and traceability.","There is a need to reduce redundancy and provide authority control in the presence of multiple manifestations\u2014ttxs that are identical in meaning but have different names, names in different languages, misspelled names, or different explanations that are equivalent. Among normal textual works, this problem is relatively small, but not so where the system is ideation centric.","There is a need to name ttx categories in an automated categorization process, such as in clustering, and a need to name ttxs where they are collected automatically as occurs in scraping. When such ttxs are entered into the system automatically, a name should be created for ease of user understanding of visualizations. Keywords are a limiting mechanism and as newer ideas are generated, the ability of keyword lists for use as differentiators decreases. In addition, because the human vocabulary is limited, similar words are often used to name different ttxs even if user entered. People simply cannot generate new words quickly enough and need to rely on existing language to explain new ttxs.","Human input is often the only possible method for correcting such naming to obtain unique names, and even so, it is sometimes unrealistic to expect that uniqueness is possible. There is a need for some ability to improve understandability and adherence to explicit or implicit naming conventions.","There is a need to reduce the burden of choosing ttx names, now a critical activity for the user. In many present systems, naming a ttx has been left to the user who had to choose a unique name and generally stick with it to establish and maintain the \u2018authorities\u2019. Unique naming has also been required because references are made to the ttx using that name, and since names were tightly connected to the implementation of the system and were \u2018sufficient\u2019 item identifiers, as well as identity indicators, for ttxs. This has had several consequences:\n\n","There is a need to edit relationships in databases. Databases with deep relationship chains, deep taxonomies, and ontologies are in greater use as more information objects are managed. Some applications, such as intelligence, law, interne, or intellectual property, continuously grow in chain or classification depth. No tool currently provides an ability to efficiently edit an ontology visually. No ability exists for viewing or editing by fxxts, or for viewing with information hiding. Ontologies are little used because, in part, practitioners have little recognition of or means to provide incentives toward use, and thus few incentives for refining or entering new information into the ontology are put into practice. Often, the objects involved in these chains are of interest by specific communities, and online communities centered on the object could be helpful to increase communication efficiency for the interest group.","What is needed is a tool to mitigate the authority and quality issues related to naming and relationship complexity.","What is needed is a tool that is effective enough to provide answers, offer initial values, and also to become the tool for cleanup. Users not obtaining good results for their needs will not be willing to clean up their data or the data from others. The answers must be effective, while possibly imperfect, even where the data is \u2018fuzzy\u2019 and ttx meanings are poorly constructed. The tool must be helpful but not overbearing, providing assistance to reduce user burden and making mere suggestions for improvement rather than denying progress where, for example, a value such as a name is not entered. The cleanup should support, including but not limited to: fix errant data; complete entries; improve understandability; assign best names; clarify description to remove ambiguities; obtain translations; fix grammar; enforce adherence to civility in discussion; enforce adherence to naming conventions and use of authorities; or approve use of suggested synonyms, translations, and homonyms. Each such cleanup need must cause an editorial workflow item to be entered suggesting that a review is needed. A user's prior use forms a context they are familiar with, and thus old names must remain with the named entities for historic purposes.","Currency of Technology Description","Currency is the up-to-datedness of information provided from a repository.","To provide currency, a system must be updated, and the data held in it must be improved.","Problems in Searching Prior Art\u2014Complexity and Detail","Problems in Searching Prior Art\u2014Language","Categorization Services","Known categorization services provide slowly changing and superficial categorization indices. While technologies, led by the Internet, have increasingly allowed for the easy sharing of knowledge and valuable IP, the information for categorization has been lacking, causing wild attempts at \u2018semantic web\u2019 and other research. Companies, such as Derwent, have developed tools aimed at helping IP owners manage their own property (embodied in patents and copyrights), by providing a software solution that allows them to categorize their property with that of others, but these are costly, not dynamic, and limited as well.","Known methods provide inadequate business models for ttx creativity in general, but also where utilizing categorization services. Such services fail to provide modern techniques for analyzing the ttxs, extending the value of the categorizations provided, or providing infrastructure around the ttxs.","There is a commercial need to maximize the value of the information in the CMM, and to be competitive. This need can be met if the information contained is the best available. To achieve data supremacy, users must be incentivized to enter as many new tcepts and appcepts as possible, and to clean up as much database information as possible. Thus an additional need is to provide sufficient value to users to get them to use the system so that they will add or refine information in the database.","There is a commercial need to add incentives to connect in other data and opportunities and to catch user interaction with the data to show user interests, because the value of the data is multiplied by data mining, and for determining the health of innovation.","There is a need for greater ease of use of categorization services and tools. Their present limited audience and purpose has caused them to be tuned for limited purposes and to be tedious for use outside of IP management, further limiting their utility.","In one respect, known methods for procuring categorization services and data provide little or no effective harmonization between new locally defined ttx categorizations and newly defined ttxs from the central data store or even with new locally defined ttx categorizations at another user location. Thus, it falls to the buyer of such services or data to ensure that the categorizations and object definitions in their local system are reconciled with those of a central standard or with other buyer's local systems.","In another example, known methods provide inadequate business models for traceability and version control over changes made in central data stores (vendor's or private) and local systems that might be managed by users and might contain data not privy to the categorization service vendor. Again, it falls to the user of such services to ensure that the data is valid and up-to-date.","Further, known systems for providing categorization information from a central data store are lacking. For instance, they may be configured to distribute categorization information, or collect categorization information (data related to the categorization services), but not both effectively. Moreover, where systems are configured to collect categorization information, they may only be configured to report the collected categorization information, without a capability to timely reconcile and publish the collected knowledge to assist others in categorization, even within the users own organization.","In addition, known systems and methods fail to take into account the full lifecycle of creativity, of categorization delivery, or of categorization refinement and reuse, or to coordinate the information needed for process improvement. For example, known systems do not sufficiently provide a cost-effective way to update categorizations based on changing categorization information from other users.","Also, known tools aimed at helping Intellectual Property owners manage their own property provide solutions that allow them to categorize their property with that of others, but the categorization structures fail to recognize the complexity of the need. The insufficient tools cannot effectively serve product departments more generally causing both unnecessary infringement and wasteful reinvention.","There is an additional need to extend deeper the level of categorization of technologies. Current approaches require the user to develop the queries and filters needed to establish the membership of a particular category below the categories provided or where information needed is classified in multiple categories as defined by the categorization vendor. This constrains the sharing of the knowledge and forces inefficiency.","What is needed is a system and a technique for managing the various categorizations in their various fxxts, enabling an architecture of participation around categorization.","What is needed is a more robust system and method for managing categorization services, including the improved creativity methods, business methods, functional architecture, and lifecycle management processes associated with such management.","In addition, known systems and methods fail to address the vertical markets or the horizontal markets where the needs exist, notably from their inability to provide the generality needed for extension of purpose beyond basic search and retrieval. The competition now, in most vertical markets, is the spreadsheet or a word processing document, leading to a vast under-utilization of prior work.","What is also needed is an improved txo-based information categorization and retrieval management paradigm to deal with a multi-source environment with few standards, providing streamlined methods for incentivized creation of new knowledge; retrieval and inclusion of current knowledge; incentivized refinement of stored knowledge; efficient access, reuse, sharing, and distribution of the stored knowledge; and management of the studies that require all of these. The need is not for unassembled pieces but a working combination. This often involves \u2018harmonization\u2019 of topic indexes from various sources. A need exists for a generalized specification language for scripting the process of finding an index taxonomy from an ontology in a way that ensures that the best structure for the resulting taxonomy.","Search and Retrieval","There is a need to greatly improve searching of highly categorized ttxs. Failure to provide effective searching leads to superficial searching and unnecessary culling of results. By way of example, the field of Prior Art Searching has limited and costly facilities for accurately finding prior art, and the effect is that the cost of each search is high and that results are poor. This leads inventors to forego searches, to spend large sums on fruitless patent prosecution, to claim excessively on patent applications, etc. Patent offices are hard pressed to maintain performance as well. Lack of good quality searches leads to major costs for all concerned as patents are issued and must then be defended against similar technologies.","Similar searches are often performed repetitively when the community as a whole is considered. Often the information sought has been lost due to poor cataloging or categorization when the search is first attempted, or has become stale due to passing of time.","As the quantity of information available on the Internet grows, it is becoming more and more important to provide more advanced search and retrieval capabilities. Keyword indexing, thesauri, meta-searching, and taxonomies alone are proving inadequate in providing a search system that permits a user to effectively locate and access the best available information on the internet and in their organizations.","There is a need for expansive searching, tying information from disparate sources into the result. Present search engines such as Google provide limited sourcing, including local files, corporate knowledge bases, Google knowledge bases, and internet searches. Even this wide set is limited, failing to provide for searches of fee sources and deep web data.","There is a need to better manage returned results of searches. The output of data from Google is in form of links that the user may cull, but the Google facilities stop there. These links are not easily reusable, and the tracking of the links ceases immediately. The links are not easily retained in a sorted list by search query and are not retained by topic. Multi-step queries are not available in some search facilities.","Most available content is unstructured so that it is difficult to locate pertinent data. As the cost of access and disk space has decreased, the volume of information available has grown tremendously. Elementary search engines that simply create indexes of keywords are becoming increasingly ineffective in identifying relevant information. There is a growing need for more effective search systems.","There is an additional need to provide a search system that can be used to perform a search across many heterogeneous information retrieval systems. For example, many organizations have built information retrieval systems to permit users to obtain documents and aggregated data sets published by that organization. It is desirable to provide a search system that can index and catalogue information stored in many different formats on different websites, permitting users to perform a smaller number of searches through a single web portal to achieve a wide search goal on several sites and to obtain disaggregated data in addition to documents. Providing a user the ability to penetrate the content of some sites by more sophisticated searching techniques or by use of an account while at the same time searching other simpler engines would greatly speed the overall search effort.","There is an additional need to provide a system for performing automated cataloging and indexing of information resources. Prior art systems have simply created keyword indexes or use thesauri. There is a need for a system that uses a strong classification system to assist in finding data by keywords, thesauri, translated keywords, and classifications. The system should utilize internet meta-search techniques to find and index information resources not previously indexed, but also search internal data stores and indexed information resources. Information resources should be ranked by relevance to a specific ttx by the meta-search facility, internal analytics, and with the aid of the user to permit more effective search and retrieval of information and reuse of the newly gained knowledge.","Again, by way of example, the complexity and detail involved in Prior Art searching are well known, as is the issue of language, where legal speak is difficult or where patents may be obtained in other jurisdictions.","There is an additional need to provide a system for performing search and categorization for rapidly finding tcepts or appcepts. The categorization must be a stored data CMMDB that contains a structured list of fields of study, tcepts, and appcepts where the structure is provided by various relationships.","There is an additional need to provide content and categorization currency or the users will not find the tool useful over time. The content and categorization should be the \u2018best available\u2019 or it will be seen as stale.","An additional need is that the returned results must be managed for a user during the query process and as a record of the query for reference later. These \u2018scan hits\u2019 are cumulatively important but are also in need of refreshing and any ability to rerun the query and notify the user of new information would be important to a user.","Even if the forgoing needs are addressed, there is an additional need to present the information in a way that users may be educated, may remember context, and may search associatively (by co-location). This need has often been served by map making.","Prediction","The need for currency does not stop at the present. Professionals plan ahead and need to share the information at least internal to their organization. Individuals want to see ttxs before they are real. Inventors want to know what ideas others have disclosed, not just which ones have been realized into a product. This need is the bridging of the abstract and reality.","There is an additional need to provide worthwhile assessments of value and importance of tcepts. The average accuracy of these assessments is a measure of collected intelligence. The difficulty is perhaps best illustrated by the frustration most people experience with committees and meetings where the result is rarely much better than the result if the different participants had tackled the problem individually.","Although committees are obviously important and useful, in practice it appears difficult for them to realize their full potential. They fail to organize and they disband rapidly. At the same time, they do yield what may be called the \u2018best available\u2019 information and predictions because of the consensus reached. Small groups and other outliers may and often do believe that they can do better than the public in general, and they are too often correct to be ignored.","There is an additional need to raise the collective intelligence by speeding the evaluations of opinions, and to increase the efficiency of sharing the alternatives.","There is a need to present technologies from varying points of view. As examples, technologies must be seen with their antecedents for prior art, with their contemporaries for competitive intelligence and product assessment, along side yet to be developed technologies for looking ahead, by ownership, by application, and by importance. The need for mapping by these fxxts is needed for associative searching, to communicate current reality, and to stir imagination.","There is an additional need to provide prediction management so that the estimates of users about when some tcept may become real, and what value the reality will have can be stored, assessed, reconsidered, and totaled to obtain the \u2018best available\u2019 guess about the future. Predictions of outcomes, based upon modeling rules for, as examples, market share, investment, risk, competitive position, etc. are a needed additional facility for business decisions and gaming analysis.","An additional need to improve the efficiency of searching is apparent. In one aspect of searching, the number of queries needed to find the proper collection of information for a study could better be reduced. In another aspect, the results of a study involving many queries could be reused, at least as a basis, or at least by sharing the queries.","The need for currency, best availability, and provision of future, the presence of abstract ttxs presents a significant need for collaboration by many users for refinement to decrease the abstraction toward reality. This leads to the need for consensus building to choose the better of multiple user contributions.","Collaboration","There is an additional need to enable effective collaboration. Collaboration in tcept categorization and description already exists widely in the patent system and in research. There many, many experts already involved are not working together well. Every company, every professional organization, every government department, every inventor, and every scientist has some form of categorization scheme and description tool that they use for their own work, but these and the content are almost never shared consistently at any more than a superficial level. This is strikingly obvious when an engineer has to learn something about an unfamiliar tcept and cannot find the experts or the prior work.","The collaboration of various parties in a study, even if unaware, could serve to improve the results for one or more of the group. Naturally, many users will be experts in what they are studying. However, few can know more about a particular topic than the sum of his or her colleagues. Having the additional benefit of outsider information, if handled properly, only improves results. This presents a new need, to provide a mechanism to weigh the opinions and results of collaborators.","The additional need exists to add the assessment of different experts on different fxxts of categorization content to provide better quality in the content and categorizations as the number of fxxts grow. Improvement of data is obviously important. Once new ttxs are entered, they must be examined by someone to determine if they are well-formed and meaningful. No limit exists on the number of poorly formed ideas that could be entered into a ttx system, and so the number of editors needed is very high. Perfection is out of the question because this form of knowledge changes rapidly.","The additional need exists to incentivize users to perform cleanup. The objective to be achieved is acceptability of information AFTER some cleanup. Impediments to use or to clean up must be reduced.","There is also a need to manage ownership interests both in the existing and newly contributed information.","List, Taxonomy, Ontology Comparison, Integration, Harmonization","Few solutions exist for the realistic management of lists, taxonomies, and ontologies to allow operations such as comparison, combination, and differencing on the basis of factors used to limit and organize the data (such as categories, strengths of relationships, etc.); integration by complex equation and factors including the differencing and comparison operations; or harmonization where the combination depends upon very complex factors including personal opinions and voting regarding the naming, relationship strengths, categorizations, rationale for classifications, etc. Few provide those functions for collaboration among thousands of users over thousands of list items and over extended timeframes. Yet all of these abilities are possible and achieved here.","List, Taxonomy, Ontology Statistical Analysis and Modeling","The ability to build models communally is not readily available today. Models based upon lists, taxonomies, and ontologies are possible with the techniques and infrastructure here, because of the combination of relationship based formulas which affect the strengths used in categorization and importance strengths and the other factors here, including the combination and differencing above resulting in fxxt level formulas and multi-level heuristic application. Clustering algorithms are applicable to generate relationship strengths to obtain initial relationship discovery from unstructured data as well as, including but not limited to: determination of similarity of classifications based upon overall opinions on approximately the same base set of data; determination of similarity of classifications resulting from different fxxt specification calculations on approximately the same base set; determination of the similarity of internally held ideas (thoughts in the mind of users) based upon various classifications (children of parents) and characteristics data (cnxpt identifiers).","Communities and Ecosystems and Narrow Networking","There is a need to connect people through and centered upon ttxs. Social networks are not focused upon problem solution or are purposely constructed to serve an audience for a general rather than a very specific topic. Rapid social networking between those interested in a narrow topic will incentivize communication because the efficiency of communication about the topic with other experts is higher than when experts are forced to discuss the topic widely with those less well trained or less interested in the specific topic.","There is a need to provide the ttxs, as an authority control file resource, an information utility, and as a classification structure, to others for use on a dynamic mash-up basis or for use by them to organize content on their system or web site, statically or dynamically.","Audience Segmentation","There is a need to address people based upon ttxs. To serve a specific audience to achieve a sales objective based upon a product or service that is specific to a technology requires collection and maintenance of the interests of the people. Social networking rarely provides the incentive for maintenance of such lists, making their value low. A technology list (classification structure) that rapidly improves and is maintained, along with the incentive provided to those using it is needed. Events or meetings, discussions, teaming, networking, and other ecosystem mechanisms are all in need of audience selection, and where they are associated with technologies, then the classification structure is needed.","Methodologies and Study Management","An additional need to improve the efficiency of the sophisticated studies that professionals in intellectual property and product management perform prescribes better multi-stage query, study management, and collaboration tools. Also, there is a need to impart best practices and sophisticated methods to those who have an immediate need and a general lack of resources to pay for service providers. The delivery of those methodologies to a specific user in a measured fashion and allowing self-help, work management, and any eventual recognition of a need for professional assistance and the coincident customer qualification all show a need for methodology attachment and delivery to users in a managed and measured process.","In specific market segments, where professionals must utilize deeper content and delay is costly, the importance of sophistication in many elements of the search, retrieve, evaluate, and refine cycle interact and compound.","These studies are costly and the present internet environment provides for the disintermediation of these service providers by at least the guidance of the person in need of the services to self-perform various portions of the needed work as stated in well developed best practices and other methodologies though guided workflows, guided self-education, and guided development of documents.","State of Innovation","There is a need to obtain metrics on innovation both within a company and nationally. We don't know how well we are managing the innovation process except by a simplistic R&D and Patent processing metrics. We feel uneasy about our success rate, and yet cannot easily justify spending on improvements.","There is a need to properly describe an \u2018ideal\u2019\u2014a specific state of technologies at some future point. We cannot predict the \u2018distance\u2019 to it, measure our rate of achievement against it, or show areas where the quality of our attempts is good or bad. We have no Map giving a destination or distances. We do not know if we make good use of our collective intellect because we do not know what we are thinking or what is possible. We do not know what a good direction is for the longer term. Our employees are consistently underutilized in innovation. We cannot easily find technology we need, or the experts in it, etc. We cannot determine easily what specific technologies to invest in. We don't know how well we manage, execute, innovate, or invest.","Employment","There is a need to better manage human resources. Today, the common internet job boards are constructed around needed technology skills on a superficial, vague level. When searching for a job, a candidate first must suffer through a long list of vague job descriptions, then must answer many more than possibly needed where they might have a special skill needed but not well called for in the descriptions. A candidates chance on a job posting is considerably decreased largely because of the lack of a tcept based job board. Further, where a candidate is known by others who show there expertise relative to a tcept, or participate in communities related to tcept, knowledge by others of their skills could be significantly increased.","Response","Recently however, many new technologies have enabled the solution. A CMM offering a structured \u2018best available\u2019 understanding of an area of knowledge, limited in scope, can now be built to serve as a commonplace. A graphical interface aligned with a query facility can bring efficient and reusable mapping to users. Content will improve if incentives are available to users who focus on incrementally defining new tcepts or new appcepts. Content will improve if an ecosystem for the users of a tcept offers community website structures specific to the tcept.","A database that is the best available source for a list of tcepts and appcepts provides significant value from the accumulated CMM information. Tcepts gain liquidity because a market is created where the tcepts can be licensed and sold. Tcept and appcept data also gains value and can be used, licensed, or sold. The holder\/owner of the database can extract value from that accumulated CMM information and the interest information from use. Also, users can be offered access to that value for a fee. An ability to allow users ownership and control of their search results is valuable.","A visualization display showing ttxs that are very similar in close proximity provides at least a visual clue to users that the similarity exists. Collocation (a more precise matching) by self-organizing mapping is useful to essentially combine ttxs by apparent similarity. The CMM is more permanently improved by automated merging and categorization, and a user ability to note that two ttxs are so similar that they really should be considered to be in the same category or that they should be the same by combining them.","Such a commonplace can provide prior art searching, competitive environmental scanning, competitive analysis study repository management and reuse, innovation gap analysis identification, novelty checking, technology prediction, investment area assessment and planning, and product comparison and feature planning.","The answer to gaining a common understanding and a common categorization of technology that can be as fluid as the real world, be as current as needed, and still support a substantial set of the needs of intellectual property managers, product managers, and inventors is to use a form of computer assisted and interne assisted Delphi technique in combination with the commonplace and a wiki like system to obtain the deep classification as well as the roll-up needed to provide users the information needed, and to provide the breadth that the real world set of users require.","Early and efficient capture of users' imagination into an accurate structure of the commonplace will empower the most imaginative\/expert users in specific areas of technology to efficiently create in the most detailed categories\u2014the fringe areas or the most futuristic ttxs. Early capture maximizes the currency of the categorization. Improving the authority or quality of the information held by proper consensus will ensure the CMM's \u2018best available\u2019 status.","The answer to better innovation metrics lies in having categorization so that statistical measurement based upon the newness of a technological category and its parentage (which changes more slowly) can provide rate of change metrics by technology area on a disaggregated basis.","The answer to improved job search is placement of job availability notices connected to one or more specific tcepts relevant to the job. In addition, use of the collaboration and community structures connected with a specific tcept, if available, would serve to improve the chance that a person involved with a tcept would know and be known sufficiently to connect for the job.","The answer to these needs is a search and categorization tool useful for rapidly concretizing, categorizing, and finding ttxs, tcepts or appcepts. The user views the structure of the underlying data from various points of view using visualizations called Maps, in one embodiment akin to video game displays. Each of the several available Maps is based upon data and the relationships of many varieties stored in the CMMDB ontology. A Map is produced by an analysis of these relationships in the CMM and thus have a structure based upon the typing, scopxing, and fxxt analysis used.","Along the lines of tallying votes about how to organize the map and the underlying index it is based upon, this system interprets a user's \u2018fxxt specification\u2019 to find an index taxonomy from an ontology in a way that ensures that the best structure for the taxonomy results. The taxonomy is then used to form the map.","Searching is like playing charades. A search engine as described here attempts to find what a person is trying to describe, from what they can \u2018verbalize\u2019, about the thought they have. When a person tells the search engine what s\/he is searching for, s\/he is acting in ways meant to convey their \u2018charade idea\u2019\u2014a concept hidden in their mind. That idea is not necessarily being simply described in words directly into the search engine, but rather through this set of acts such as keyword\/phrase searching and document relevance culling, \u2018survey\u2019 question answering, focusing selection display and serendipitous discovery of possible ways to classify the thought, search goal \u2018avatar\u2019 repositioning, technology combination, stating that an application is being solved, stating the traits of the concept, etc., all placed\/combined into multiple \u2018action\u2019 or \u2018step\u2019 discussions with the search engine, possibly over a very extended timeframe, and sometimes involving more than one person (sometimes many) into the \u2018collaborative\u2019 search process. Collecting and using all of these combined indicators effectively to \u2018understand\u2019 the concept being searched for is the base technical purpose of the search engine, but the building of the knowledge base from it for later reuse is the key to effectiveness in crowd sourcing.","Data Collection and Collective Creativity","The base of data described above will surely be in need of \u2018maintenance\u2019. The categories established by the patents and prior art documentation may not be precise. Not all of the ttxs found will be real or meaningful ttxs. The categories will not always be cohesive, or well named. Relations may be missing or odd. Little agreement would be available on some descriptions or names. But, with some work, improvement will occur. Just to understand where editing is needed, a good navigation tool (user interface) is needed. To simplify the data sufficiently for understanding the relationships effectively, a very special user interface will be important.","New users will want to quickly understand the data and find out whether specific ttxs exist, and will use goals.","There are issues involved in building a common memory map of innovation. First, no single person will understand the entirety of the data, but many will have an opinion about one aspect or another when they see the detail. Any information added will have to identify the user and the expertise level of the user making the addition (or change). Different users will feel that they are experts in certain ttxs and will wish to have their contact information related to the ttx (ego, advertising, or notoriety).","A large number of interested parties are needed to update the data. To get a large number of qualified users to start adding and repairing data, incentives such as allowing users to attach their name to new ttxs are used. Second, analysts who wish to obtain improved results will adjust data and make new filters, etc. which will be left for reuse.","Additional Purposes, Features, and Advantages","This section presents summaries of some of the system's other purposes and why the system has value in achieving those purposes.","Document Management and File Systems","Today, document management is most often seen in a personal computer where it is typical to have 300,000 files, most of which are hidden. In typical law offices, the number of paper documents and files is much higher. These documents and files must be controlled, categorized, and accessible, yet the control varies between the document tracking the football pool and the document key to a $Billion verdict. Categorization is extremely differentiated because one document may be relevant to many issues. No one wants to wait for the documents to become \u2018useable\u2019. This system provides cnxpts to categorize information, and allows documents, as information resource info-items, to be \u2018occurrences\u2019 of the cnxpt. The cnxpts may be changed, recategorized, categorized in multiple ways, etc., but the documents stay with cnxpts unless moved, and documents can be \u2018occurrences\u2019 of multiple cnxpts. Workflows can manage documents as information resource info-items, and cnxpts. Alerts and several other paradigms greatly assist the user to find, obtain, categorize, and access the information resources. Goals are useful to add notes and new areas.","News Collection and Publishing","Traditional news consisted of trusted reporters spreading out and digging up facts. The spreading out is costly as is the digging up. Trust is costly as well. This system cannot fully supplant all of the news operation, but it greatly diminishes the costs involved by crowd collection and trust model operation. News collection will naturally become more rapid, and many \u2018readers\u2019 will have the opportunity to obtain news specifically relevant to them faster with fewer intermediaries, with or without \u2018filtering\u2019 by quality of source, amount of editorial review, translation, or print layout. The instant application can form a bridge between \u201cTwitter\u201d and online newspapers, while naturally also building interrelationships between stories; categorizing the stories by issue, time, interest, etc.; and mapping the topics of the stories for more rapid associative searching.","Law","The business of law has the major areas of Law\u2014Precedent; Litigation\u2014Theory of the Case and presentation; and Evidence\u2014Discovery and presentation, among others. These each evolve over time and require detailed categorization of information within them. Each is \u2018crowd\u2019 oriented, where precedent is established by many jurisdictions, litigation always involves at least two theories of a case, and facts must be supported by evidence that must be obtained and analyzed by many participants. As a document or information management problem, each of these areas can be made more efficient with the instant application. The application of evidence to facts involves the detailing of the specific evidence relevant to the fact, or, in terms here, the establishment of \u2018occurrences\u2019 to cnxpts representing facts. The breakdown of law to elements is a categorization of elements to be associated with law, precedent, contract, legal opinion, other elements, or doctrine, often hierarchically. The application of facts to law involves the establishment of associations between facts and elements. Precedent and statutory law is now and can be better categorized over time by issues as well as citation. The repeated searching for pertinent law by a large number of attorneys is an expert level crowd sourcing wisdom of crowds operation already, but it is inefficient and costly. The instant application provides efficiency, where issues are represented by cnxpts, specific opinion text is represented by cnxpts, and court orders, trial documents, statutes, and other documents are represented by information resource info-items. The issue and opinion text cnxpts are associated and categorized by associations between cnxpts by the searching or manual operations as discussed below. The mapping process below provides better searching results. The result sets enable better searching not only for the first user interested in an issue but for all subsequent users. The associative search queries track issue development. The shared queries, paths, and results assist secondary users of many ilks, such as clerks and law students. The cnxpt categorization provides element sub-element structuring, and the reapplication of elements across precedent and theory, with differentiations. The connection of facts to law by association gives refinement tools to an attorney, providing a review mechanism to his supervisors, an assembly mechanism for legal teams, and a structuring tool for writing or analysis. Discovery involves process\/workflow management, document management, setting objectives (information sought), document review (classification, analysis, ranking, presentation arrangement), etc. all of which involve information resource info-items, people (and other txo's), and cnxpts, and all of which must be performed in cycles or in refinement. Litigation is the process of setting a strategy to present a theory and then presenting the evidence relevant to it. Litigation, in terms here, is the assembly of the facts in a theory, and the assembly of the evidence relevant to those fact into a presentation. In terms of the instant application, litigation is the establishment of cnxpts representing the theories, elements, and facts, and the setting of relationship strengths on associations and occurrences to show priorities or importance or for otherwise setting presentation order.","Other Advantages","Further objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing descriptions.","Definition of terms used herein are given in alphabetical order.","Alerts","As used herein, the term \u201calert\u201d refers generally to a notification to a user regarding a change in the CMM, a workflow task, or a new system event that the user has registered interest in.","Collaboration Alerts","A collaboration alert is a notification to users who have previously participated in the definition of a ttx or made comments about, including but not limited to: ttxs, associations, or cncpttrrts which has been changed.","Analytic","As used herein, the term \u201canalytic\u201d refers generally to a package of all of the automation structures that are put into place to effect automation of categorization paradigms required and that are not already a part of the infrastructure. In one embodiment, the analytic information package may consist of a series of items, including, but not limited to:\n\n","When properly arranged, the items are sufficient to perform some automation of, including, but not limited to: data collection, data reporting, and\/or categorization actions within a planned context within a system. Analytics, when deployed to the various components of the framework, customize and configure the framework to, in one embodiment, enable specialized operations on information resources and database information during information retrieval query sessions to classify the information resources by query relevance (with levels of relevance recorded by those items selected, those abstracts read, those articles read extensively, those articles reacted to negatively, those visited, etc.), to classify the information resources into categorical groupings, to extract categorization definitions from the information resources, to extract categorization relationships from the information resource information, or to perform other specialized operations within categorization procedures or query processing.","Application Domain","As used herein, the term \u201capplication domain\u201d refers to a family of appcepts. Application domains define the bundle of requirements of a wider range of solutions needed to solve a class of similar problems than what a single specific solution at a specific timeframe would require. An application domain description serves as a reference to resolve ambiguities later in the process of, or deeper down in the planning of a product line. It is a repository of knowledge about the characteristics and definition of needs and requirements at a more general level of specification than what is needed to describe a single product. It is also used to state what a company is good at (a \u2018core asset\u2019) and where they focus their attention. Application domains are known as \u2018domains\u2019 in systems engineering and competitive intelligence, or \u2018product lines\u2019 from product management. Domains define a strategic focus for a company for defining a series or family of products. Domains cannot be solved by a single tcept, but appcepts may be solved by one or more tcepts, if at all.","Area of Consideration","As used herein, the term \u201cArea of Consideration\u201d refers generally to a cognitive area of a CMM or of a CMMV virtual map, and thus includes the ttxs, represented by cnxpts, therein, for which a user has shown interest by, including but not limited to: the making of a FindAll (with further action), selection (with further action), search, query, setting of a \u2018goal\u2019, or defining a result set for a goal. It is what the user would say he is studying, although the list of cnxpts contained in the area may not all be relevant to what is his real interest. The cnxpts within the Area of Consideration have an increased probability as being relevant as compared to those not in the Area of Consideration, and that a cnxpts is not within the area does not entirely rule out its relevance to the user's interest.","The root of the \u201cArea of Consideration\u201d is the cnxpt that is the cntexxt of the basis of the area, such that the cnxpt is the lowest parent cnxpt that has all the cnxpts of the area as children or grandchildren, etc. If no such single cnxpt exists, then there will be multiple roots in the Area. All areas are based upon a fxxt specification for derivation of the categorization. (A base fxxt specification is always stated in the commonplace.)","An \u201cArea of Consideration\u201d is a specialization of a Selection Set where the rsxitems are all cnxpts. Dxos may appear in an Area of Consideration in the same manner as a enhanced map.","Area of Interest","As used herein, the term \u201cArea of Interest\u201d refers generally to a cognitive area of a CMM or of a CMMV virtual map, and thus includes the ttxs, represented by cnxpts, therein, for which a user has shown interest by, including but not limited to: the making of a FindAll (with further action), selection (with further action), search, query, setting of a \u2018goal\u2019, or defining a result set for a goal. It is what the user would say he is studying, although the list of cnxpts contained in the area may not all be relevant to what is his real interest. The cnxpts within the Area of Interest have an increased probability as being relevant as compared to those not in the Area of Interest, and that a cnxpts is not within the area does not entirely rule out its relevance to the user's interest.","An \u201cArea of Interest\u201d is a specialization of a Selection Set where the rsxitems are all ttxs.","The root of the \u201cArea of Interest\u201d is the cnxpt that is the cntexxt of the basis of the area, such that the cnxpt is the lowest parent cnxpt that has all the cnxpts of the area as children or grandchildren, etc. If no such single cnxpt exists, then there will be multiple roots in the Area. All areas are based upon a fxxt specification for derivation of the categorization. (A base fxxt specification is always stated in the commonplace.)","Attribute","As used herein, the term \u201cattribute\u201d refers to a property of an info-item that has a value or is unassigned a value. Description fields are specialized attributes used for wiki style data for community editing.","Authority Control","As used herein, the term \u201cauthority control\u201d refers to the library science principle of quality control over index terms for bibliographic material in a catalog to maintain the consistency in the naming or category naming of exposed ttxs in the CMMDB ontology. The CMMDB will serve as a virtual international authority file for ttxs, and provides for quality improvement by consensus-based naming, description, and interconnection among category cnxpts, ttxs, and information resources to improve the value of the combined data.","Authority control ensures that every entry name, description, or ttx exposed to users are either unique or at least does not inappropriately conflict with any other entry that is already in the CMMDB or may be included at a later date. Names overlap naturally, and interrelationships among ttxs vary considerably by scope.","As part of the facility promoting authority control, authority records are maintained in the CMMDB by use of synonym associations, description variants, and name variants. Synonym associations are affinitive associations formed from votes stating that two ttxs are the same. Name variants provide for synonyms, translations, as well as historic, \u2018superseded\u2019 or deprecated names. The objectives of authority control are to facilitate and make transparent the tracking of the decisions made toward identifying and collocating so that users can assume that a term or phrase will refer to a particular ttx, that name variations will be brought together under the one form, and that relationships are proper. Identification methods are used to determine if a relationship exists between ttx names by whether a ttx is duplicated or merely similar. Various methods, primarily suggestions (votes) from users, will be used to create, weight, and update these authority records, and vote tallying provides a consensus result. In each of the methods above, users will be the primary participants in researching for variants; choosing one among many; analyzing parts of the term; adding, omitting or modifying the term; handling special language cases; linking the used and the unused and documenting the process. The information retained can be as authority records closely mirrors library catalog records, and provide both authority, the voting structure, and for maintenance such as error detection and correction by providing a change log for the other records.","Authority control is used to reduce redundancy by first identifying ttxs through authority based identity indicators, then increasing co-location of ttxs for display (giving notice to users and allowing them to vote), then by suggestion workflow tasks asking what the differences between the ttxs are to generate votes or more creativity. The CMMDB is a Terminological Ontology structured to avoid repetition of information, and to provide continuous improvement in the precision of information on relevancy to ttxs discussed.","Avatar","As used herein, the term \u201cavatar\u201d refers to a specialized Dxo, possibly animated, displayed on a map, that including but not limited to: 1) an \u2018assistant\u2019 for holding a spot on the map and as a bookmark, providing the user an access path to a display of a set of dxos, for providing tools associated with a search, query, or goal and a storage manager for search artifacts, a guide to the user to provide the next steps for a goal or its searches; 2) to show where another person is currently viewing a visualization; 3) to show where a person or company wants to be seen on a visualization as experts, or service providers or product suppliers; or 4) to represent other free or paid position objects such as, including but not limited to: reports available, comparisons, or response analytics that can answer questions. (Signposts are similar to advertisement avatars except that they do not answer questions.)","The avatar may also provide an access path to sets of dxos, txos, or cnxpts as derived from relationships and mappings according to information for various fxxts from a selection, search, query, etc. Each such set can be visualized as a map or a highlighted marking of a map. Refinement of searches, relevance ranking of documents, result set culling, and movement of the avatar by the user will affect the size and placement of the avatar on the map.","Goal avatars are placed at a position where a goal is best located (so far). As a goal is better refined and described, the avatar is moved into the map and more strongly related to, often, fewer txos. A change of position of the Goal avatar changes the description of the goal, and thus the change of position is permanent but alterable.","Question Mark Bubbles and Money Mark Bubbles are avatars placed at a position where new innovative concepts are being sought. Suggestion Bubbles are avatars place at a position and thus in a context where the system has been able to generate a differentiation, keyword trigger, or some other triggering thought that a user could form into an actual innovative concept.","View avatars are placed at a position that user is focused upon (essentially the focus of a camera viewpoint that the other user currently is or was viewing) in the visualization, and may be saved. View avatars may also follow a user's navigations ready for the user to save it for jumping back or sharing. View avatars incentivize communication with other users. A change of position of the view avatar changes the description of the view, and thus the change of position is permanent but alterable if saved.","Advertisement avatars are placed at positions on the map as either fixed or relative to other cnxpts or dxos, as set by a company or individual wishing the avatar to be seen. Advertisement avatars may also follow a user's navigations ready for the user to activate the avatar to obtain a benefit or a service. Advertisement avatars incentivize communication with companies, communities, or other users.","Signpost avatars are placed at positions on the map defined by a user as either fixed or relative to other cnxpts or dxos.","Path avatars are placed at visible points on the map along the path taken or tour defined by a user.","Selection set, Area, and result set avatars are placed at the centroid of the set's objects on the map.","Avatars may act as an assistant to a user where the user is performing searches. The Goal Avatar, Search Avatar, Find Avatar, Query Avatar, and Area Avatars are each a special concept to enable access the information related to searching, to \u2018apparently\u2019 hold that information (in the avatar's accessible contents \u2018bag\u2019), to make suggestions, and to offer tools and actions to the user.","In one embodiment, an avatar will have a \u2018go back\u2019\/\u2018go forward\u2019 or \u2018undo\u2019\/\u2018redo\u2019 ability to take it and the underlying meaning (the search, path, view, selection, etc.) back to a prior state, or forward to a previously attained state.","In one embodiment, selection of an avatar changes the user's current selection to the set represented by the avatar. In one embodiment, indication of an avatar highlights the elements of the set represented by the avatar. In one embodiment, indication of an avatar lists the list of information available in its \u2018bag\u2019.","Avatars provide access paths to tools. For a Goal Avatar, tools include but are not limited to: \u2018complete goal\u2019, \u2018new query\u2019, \u2018show map\u2019, \u2018show map with filtering\u2019, \u2018apply fxxt and show resulting map\u2019, \u2018apply scopx and show resulting map\u2019, \u2018compare against\u2019, and any actions which apply to txos, such as (not exhaustive) \u2018view web home\u2019, \u2018initiate consortium\u2019, \u2018export list\u2019 to export a prior art list, \u2018file patent application\u2019 to prepare and file a provisional application.","Avatars give guidance. Guidance actions available from an avatar include but are not limited to: \u2018Please Answer\u2019 (where the avatar asks a question or provides a survey to the user), \u2018Please Consider\u2019 (where an avatar offers some contextually appropriate information), \u2018Please Act\u2019 (where an avatar provides a methodology driven process for the user to follow, or to continue in), \u2018Please Describe Me\u2019 (where further descriptive and meta information is requested of the user), \u2018Please Resolve\u2019 (where an issue is present in an avatar which needs to be resolved and voting is elicited).","Avatars form a basis for comparisons, provide study results, and summarize model results. Actions associated with avatars include but are not limited to: \u2018visualize model\u2019, \u2018visualize report\u2019, \u2018compare against\u2019, \u2018detail investment opportunities\u2019 and others.","Avatars form a basis for communications, providing actions as available on txos including but not limited to: \u2018view blog\/email entries\u2019, \u2018connect with expert\u2019, \u2018view interest shown\u2019, \u2018blog\u2019. Such avatars may show images of, including but not limited to: individuals, company logos.","Avatars communicate their status and demographic information, including but not limited to: the phase of development the avatar's technology is present in (such as \u2018Field of Science\u2019, theory, patent applied for, patented, productized), the amount of interest shown in the technology represented or the information represented by the avatar, the generality versus specificity or the state (new, recent, bogus) of the avatar's technology concept (as calculated or voted by users).","Avatars with images of inventions or abstracted images of inventions indicate the concept or category without text titles.","Avatars may link to, including but not limited to: web page for cnxpt, cnxpt originator or owner sites, a ticker showing a metric, a news\/activity feed, portfolio visualization page, advertising page, expertise page, \u2018community\u2019 or \u2018ecosystem\u2019 pages, job description pages, Consortia\/team building pages, negotiation tracking pages, workflow control pages. Such links allow a commercial and\/or social mechanism where the idea maker can help others with innovation or state perspectives.","Categorization","As used herein, the term \u201ccategorization\u201d refers to a division of items into classes or groups (called categories) according to a particular system. The categories may be mere \u2018parents\u2019 or may have a greater semantic meaning. It is the basic cognitive process of arranging items into classes or categories defined to contain items only of the same type by some definition. More specifically, a categorization is a classification of items within in the CMM into logically hierarchical classes, subclasses, and sub-subclasses based on the characteristics they have in common and those that distinguish them.","Categorizations hold onto the effort put into performing the original classification by defining the relationships. Lists may be used to display the contents of a categorization but are not powerful enough where an item might properly be a member of multiple categories. For instance, a categorization by field of science is useful to show where the science behind a technology was developed. Of course, most technologies stem from multiple fields of science (and business). The field of science categorization is useful for learning about the technology field progressively from the general to the specific, and is used for general searching. The separate categorization for TPLs, also categorizable from fields of science, is useful for determining how outmoded or obsolete a technology is, or where gaps in technology exist.","Technology categorizations, as a basis for communities, offer narrow groupings of members that have a greater sense of trust in what is discussed and a heightened expectation that the other members wish to be efficient in discussion. The members of the group are more homogeneous due to their common interest in the technology of the categorization.","Also, categorizations provide a basis for calculation and modeling, especially for roll-up or for holding of aggregated data not available in a disaggregated form. A categorization based upon a company's product lines is needed for each company for comparing the revenue, for instance, with that of other product lines. Or, a company would like to show how their R&D lab is benefiting various product lines. These categorizations form a technology management, research management, product management, or competitive intelligence categorization. Each company would have their own version of each, and the categorizations would each change over time, etc.","Categories in comparison to Taxonomies, Classifications, and Ontologies Tpx Categorizations","As used herein, the term \u201ctpx categorization\u201d refers to a division of tpxs into classes or groups according to at least one of a particular algorithm to describe an organization of the tpxs in the CMMDB.","Tpx categorizations are based upon unscopxd relationships, such as, including but not limited to: member tpx and the category it is in, specialization txo and the more general class txo it is based on, as well as those relationships without scopxs listed elsewhere in this document.","In one embodiment, tpxs can be organized by, including but not limited to: when a tpx was \u2018conceived\u2019; who should have access to a tpx; who owns a tpx; which license a tpx packaged into; which techniques can be applied to analyze a tpx; the lexicon used a to define a tpx; the language of the original tpx description; a workflow category set up to encompass tpxs needing improvement; a category set up to encompass tpxs of a specific interest; a result set of a query or an analytic converted to a tpx possibly not yet named, now representing a tpx encompassing other tpxs that were set as rsxitems by the query or analytic; a tpx, possibly named, stemming from the import by a user where the tpx was a category in the import; a tpx, possibly not yet named, stemming from the indication that a set tpxs are members of the new category.","Ttx Categorizations","As used herein, the term \u201cttx categorization\u201d refers to a division of cnxpts representing the ttxs into classes or groups according to at least one of a particular algorithm to describe an organization of the cnxpts in the CMMDB.","Ttx categorizations are based upon one of: scopxd associations, such as, including but not limited to: sub-category and its parent category, cnxpt and the ttx category it is in, cnxpt and a more general ttx it stems from, as well as those association scopxs listed elsewhere in this document; an analysis of cnxpts by an analytic or other algorithm separating the cnxpts into groups; or by a fxxt calculation. In all cases, the categorizations are retained by construction of (or use of preexisting) scopxd associations which may be held only temporarily.","In one embodiment, ttx categories are \u2018soft\u2019 in that all cnxpts are susceptible of becoming categories: categories may be formed around a cnxpt even if the cnxpt would not normally be considered a category where, for instance, a new ttx is created as an improvement from the ttx represented by the original cnxpt, and thus the original cnxpt then appears to be a category encompassing the new cnxpt.","In one embodiment, ttxs can be organized by, including but not limited to: when a ttx was \u2018conceived\u2019; what predecessor ttx is a ttx stemming from; who should have access to a cnxpt; who owns a ttx; what field of study is a ttx related to; which users have queried for the ttx; which users have visited the cnxpt; which license is a cnxpt packaged into; which techniques can be applied to analyze a ttx; the lexicon used a to define a ttx; the language of the original ttx description; a category set up to encompass cnxpts needing improvement; a category set up to encompass ttxs of a specific interest, represented by a category cnxpt; a goal converted to a cnxpt not yet named, now representing a ttx encompassing other ttxs that were rsxitems in the goal; a cluster converted to a cnxpt not yet named, now representing a ttx encompassing other ttxs that were found to be in the cluster; a result set of an analytic converted to a cnxpt not yet named, now representing a ttx encompassing other ttxs that were set as rsxitems by the analytic; a cnxpt, possibly named, stemming from the import by a user where the ttx was a category in the import; a cnxpt, not yet named, stemming from the indication that a set of ttxs are members of the new category represented by the cnxpt.","In one embodiment, cnxpts can be organized by, including but not limited to: scopxd associations and scopxd category cnxpts.","In one embodiment, tcepts can be organized by, including but not limited to: fields of study; technology area; application domain; its applications; when a tcept was \u2018conceived\u2019; how a tcept is described; the tcept name; who named a tcept; what the parts of a tcept are; how a tcept works; the features\/characteristics of a tcept; the requirements description of a problem it needs to solve; the tcept's predecessor; the department set to manage a tcept in a specific organization (professional organizations, lobbying organizations, publishers, companies); patent index for each patent classification and country; who has been granted access to a tcept in a specific organization; who owns intellectual property associated with a tcept; the products associated with the tcept; the first product based on the tcept to become available; the product line of the first product based upon the tcept; the research field the tcept is assigned to; the tcept's competitive intelligence category; the stage a tcept is in; how qualified is a tcept for investment; what field of study a tcept is related to; which intellectual property license package it is in; the techniques that can be applied to analyze a tcept; the team analyzing the tcept; the tcept's inventor; and the categories a ttx may be organized by.","There may be considerable overlap between categorizations in that one tcept, for example, may be listed under a technical categorization in each of several categorizations, and not in some others. This might lead a novice to conclude that the tcept is misfiled in some of the categorizations though it is not. It is simply that the ttx's relationship to another ttx is different in different classifications. Each cnxpt is still correct and well described, but the relationships are simply different in different fxxts.","Categorizations are needed to show which technologies are needed for solving a large business problem or are needed to produce an end product. To make the end product improve or to find a new one to takes its place, new technologies or improvements in older technologies will be needed, and some categorization of those technologies is needed to track their availability or to compare their usefulness. These categorizations form a replacement technology genealogy or technology improvement\/replacement roadmaps.","Ttx categorizations are used for, including but not limited to:\n\n","Ttx categories may be used for searching, including, but not limited to as a:\n\n","Categorization Hierarchy","As used herein, the term \u201ccategorization hierarchy\u201d refers to an ordered set of cnxpts within a fxxt after reduction to a directed graph, where each cnxpt other than a root cnxpt must be related to another cnxpt within the hierarchy by an association according to rules specified for the fxxt. While hierarchical, at the same time, categories may be located in different orderings in multiple different categorization hierarchies. In one embodiment, cnxpts may be repeated (possibly by reference only) within the directed graph so long as no cycles exist.","Where a categorization hierarchy is formed, the set of ttxs that fall into any category are those whose representative cnxpts participate in an association of the proper nature and direction with the cnxpt representing the category, based upon the fxxt specification. A cnxpt (C1) may be a category in one fxxt and have cnxpt (C2) as a \u2018sub-category\u2019 (member) in that fxxt, but in another fxxt the cnxpt (C1) may be a member of category cnxpt (C2). Cnxpts are connected by an arbitrary number of associations.","Characteristic","As used herein, the term \u201ccharacteristic\u201d, \u201ccnxpt characteristic\u201d or \u201cttx characteristic\u201d refers to an expansive set of assertions tending to describe a ttx, assigned to a cnxpt representing the ttx. In the use of the term characteristic to explain an abstract ttx, the term refers to a list of elements, including, but not limited to a cnxpt's: names, definition, description, purpose, scopx, infxtypx, occurrences involving the ttx, attributes, purlieu timeframes or contexts, cncpttrrts, and roles it plays in associations with other cnxpts or in relations with other txos.","Txo Characteristics","As used herein, the term \u201ctxo characteristic\u201d or \u201ctpx characteristic\u201d refers to an expansive set of assertions tending to describe a tpx assigned a txo representing the tpx. When applied to tpxs or txos, the term refers to a closed set of computational constructs that can serve to hold a representation of the information explaining the represented tpx, including, but not limited to: names, attributes, infxtypxs, description fields, relationship participation, and for every relationship in which they participate, their role.","Clump","As used herein, the term \u201cclump\u201d refers to one or more bundles of information that a server transmits to a client user interface that may be translated into a map easily.","Cntexxt","As used herein, the term \u201ccntexxt\u201d refers generally to a cognitive area of a CMM and thus includes the ttxs therein. A cntexxt is defined by a parent category represented by a cnxpt where all of the ttxs under consideration are represented by children or grandchildren cnxpts of the parent cnxpt. A cntexxt is not an info-item or represented by an info-item other than the parent cnxpt. To exist, a cntexxt must be identified within a categorization.","In addition, when used in the context of a CMMDB, an area of a virtual mapping of a specific categorization limited to the area defined by the visual representation of the parent cnxpt and thus including the child cnxpts therein, and necessarily includes the parent cnxpt itself.","Collaboration Blogs","As used herein, the term \u201ccollaboration blogs\u201d refers generally to a display of change history. Votes regarding, including but not limited to: ttxs, associations, or cncpttrrts form threaded lists and may be seen as a history or \u2018blog\u2019 regarding the ttx stating that changes occurred.","Collective Intelligence","As used herein, the term \u201cCollective intelligence\u201d refers generally to the ability of a group to solve more problems than its individual members can. It is argued that the obstacles created by individual cognitive limits and the difficulty of coordination can be overcome by using a commonplace or CMM. Here, it is the collected set of cnxpts, associations, occurrences, irxts, and other info-items along with votes regarding cnxpt properties, cnxpt existence, cnxpt association's strengths and existence, and occurrence's strengths and existence.","Collocation","As used herein, the term \u201ccollocation\u201d is used in its \u201cco-location\u201d sense, referring to the act of positioning dxos close together, in a grouping, or into a certain order in a visualization to indicate, including, but not limited to: similarity of meaning, common purpose, common membership, common interest, or common categorization. Collocation is also used to convey the combination, for summarization, of similar cnxpts into a single representative object. The purpose of collocation is to achieve the \u201ccollocation objective;\u201d and provide binding points from which everything that is known about a given ttx can be reached. The literary meaning of collocation as being words that are often used together is not used here except in the narrow use as a technique for semantic analysis.","Commonplace","As used herein, the term \u201ccommonplace\u201d refers to a knowledge base tuned to capture the ttxs imagined by creative thinkers and to efficiently provide detailed information to innovation and intellectual property workers about those ttxs to share, search, discuss, base calculations on, stay current with. A visualization provides an organization to the information where a user can easily understand that an \u2018outer view\u2019 can represent a field of science or top level category, or a very old predecessor technology, and that a leaf represents a newly added recent or future technology.","Social networks and communities built on the commonplace provide forums to users to collaborate and to present their questions to specific educated groups pertaining to their ttxs of interest.","Ttxs exist in the human brain. As a human invents or discovers something new, they \u2018conjure\u2019 a new mental ttx to represent it and all of the parts of it. Humans also learn about ttxs, but their learning is quite often imperfect, and again they essentially form a mental ttx that serves as a placeholder for their understanding. In any case, these mental ttxs become related to other ttxs to place it into perspective, characterize it, differentiate it from others, or to connect it to others. Commonplaces are formed where these mental ttxs are shared with others.","Common Mental Map","As used herein, the term \u201cCommon Mental Map\u201d (\u201cCMM\u201d) (sometimes referred to in the literature as a Collective Mental Map) refers to a shared collection of explanatory constructs, or a commonplace, that individuals can use to make connections with their own cognitive categories and which contains a common understanding of a domain of knowledge used to facilitate dialogue. Participants in the dialogue can establish the credibility of the data, the accuracy of the categorizations, ttxs, and relationships, and their descriptions that are critical to moving discussion toward deeper collective understandings and to reach a consensus on the language, relationships, and descriptions used.","The CMM, a specialization of a term of art, refers to the collection of data used as a basis for forming maps rather than a graphical or textual map itself. Common Mental Mapping is an attempt to foster a consensus regarding the naming and definitions of accumulated ttxs and categorizations of knowledge to facilitate the process of producing indices and for providing a structure for deeper, incremental ideas. In one embodiment, the accumulated consensus is held in the CMMDB.","The CMM paradigm provides access to information based on a model of the knowledge it contains. The basic mechanisms of CMM development include averaging of individual inputs, amplification of weak links by positive feedback, and integration of specialized sub-networks through division of labor.","A CMM can be formalized as a weighted, directed graph. (Here, weights on relationships are effectively synonymous with relationship \u2018strengths\u2019.) A CMM is composed of different element types, derived from a basic set of architectural forms, used to represent, including but not limited to: ttxs, occurrences of ttxs, and associations between ttxs. Dxos for visualizations and infrastructure txos as control structures augment the CMM. Other info-items that extend the expressive power of the CMM, include but are not limited to: information resources, purlieu, cncpttrrts, scopxs, and fxxts.","The CMM involves a series of three thesauri, organized into three interconnected levels of knowledge. The most rudimentary level of thesaurus term is a keyword phrase, which, if cleaned up and described, serves as a basic thesaurus entry. A second level thesaurus is formed by ttxs represented by cnxpts, providing a general purpose and loosely constrained structure of knowledge. The third level thesaurus is formed by a tightly controlled structuring of knowledge within a specific knowledge area, such as technology, medicine, or law, where specific relationships are useful and specific modeling or domain knowledge based prediction is possible.","Limitations of Common Mental Map Purpose","In one embodiment, strong limits are placed upon the scope of the CMM to reduce the burdens caused by over generality. In one embodiment, the purpose of the system is exclusively for mapping certain types of abstract ttxs rather than other forms of objects, such as places, general objects, materials and so on.","The CMM here is not merely a registry of change events or an edited collection of notes, it is a highly selective representation of the consensus resolved from the suggested changes of authorities (names, categorizations, relationships, etc.) regarding ttxs.","In one embodiment, this system does not attempt to understand the ttxs or to solve problems, but it does attempt to help solve the users' main problem of understanding the abstract model of the ttxs.","Common Mental Map Database (CMMDB)","As used herein, the term \u201cCommon Mental Map Database\u201d (CMMDB) refers to a stored collection of explanatory constructs making up a CMM, and all structural control and website data necessary for establishing and controlling the system. The CMMDB will hold many hierarchical structures or poly-hierarchies, but such trees are not required. In one embodiment, the ontology used will be a terminological ontology.","In one embodiment, the CMMDB may be a database, possibly distributed. In one embodiment, the CMMDB may be replicated. In one embodiment, the CMMDB may be exported in part, still retaining their nature as being a part of the CMMDB, and the export(s) may be recombined into the whole carrying any changes back into the whole in an appropriate, deterministic fashion.","A CMMDB functions first of all as a shared memory. Various discoveries by users are entered and stored in this memory, so that the information will remain available for as long as necessary.","Terminological Ontology","As used herein, the term \u201cTerminological ontology\u201d refers to an ontology described by Sowa whose ttxs and relations are not fully specified by axioms and definitions that determine the necessary and sufficient conditions of their use. The ttxs may be partially specified by relations that determine the relative positions of the ttxs with respect to one another, but do not completely define them.","The CMM will contain poly-hierarchies and is not designed to be as pure as an Axiomatized Ontology (A terminological ontology whose ttxs and relations have associated axioms and definitions that are stated in logic or in some computer-oriented language that can be automatically translated to logic.) that might be used as the basis of artificial intelligence.","Topic Map Paradigm as related to the CMM","The CMM is similar to a Topic Map as it is a container for abstract ttxs that are described to some degree. The CMM is used for the purpose of collecting what is known in specific subject areas. In one embodiment, it is to be used by those trying to invent new ttxs, and those seeking to determine if a ttx is known either within the CMMDB or in some accessible location outside of it. It is not a conforming Topic Map because not all ttxs are fully formed and there is an intention NOT to require them to be fully formed. It is a pre-resolution (some things included may not become well stated or \u2018real\u2019) map rather than a post-resolution (everything included being a current or historic description).","Assimilation theory stresses that meaningful learning requires that the learner's cognitive structure contain anchoring ttxs to which new material can be related. For this reason, Ausubel argued that \u201cthe most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach him accordingly.\u201d","The Topic Map is assimilation theory's major methodological tool for ascertaining what is already known. The CMM here focuses on the polishing of the knowledge already known, and the extension of that knowledge toward what was not known by capturing the thoughts of users early on.","Topic and concept maps structure a set of ttxs into a hierarchical framework. More general, inclusive ttxs are found at the highest levels, with progressively more specific and less inclusive ttxs arranged below them. This CMM displays Ausubel's notion of subsumption, namely that new information is often relative to and subsumable under more inclusive ttxs. The CMM here is not as constrained as a topic or concept map. Here, undirected relationships and cycles may exist, and the graph is not necessarily a tree, or even a forest of trees. The ttxs in this CMM are only forced into a hierarchical by extraction into a map.","Common Mental Map Visualization\u2192(CMMV)","As used herein, the term \u201ccommon mental map visualization\u201d (CMMV) refers to at least one of a specifically formatted visualizations resulting from the CNVP and displaying an abstract of the data in the CMMDB.","Ttx Mapping Visualization Process\u2192(CNVP)","As used herein, the term \u201cttx mapping visualization process\u201d (CNVP) refers to at least one of a specific process for developing and displaying a visualization based upon data in the CMMDB.","Communities","As used herein, the term \u201ccommunities\u201d refers to the social mechanisms allowing a user to interact with others using the system. Each community focuses the resources of the system to the defined needs and wishes of a specific group of users to heighten their perceived, real, and expected value of use and involvement. The communities are structured to be professional and social. Communities are intended to be based upon specific value models to enhance efficiency of use for the user.","Communities are website based, and integrate into the web structure of the CMM. Communities are usually tied to ttxs, such that the users interested in that ttx may join the community tied to it. This increases the efficiency of communications because the members of the community feel greater kinship as they believe that each user in the smaller community has a greater affinity for the community and greater knowledge of the ttx. As a ttx is concretized, communities are created around it. The communities may be migrated to new ttxs, and users may move their affiliation with a community to a new ttx, so long as the new ttx is a sibling or child of the ttx that the old community was tied to. This also allows the user to move his interest to ttxs that are newer offshoots of a ttx, becoming more tuned to a specific topic, narrowing the community involved to only those highly involved with a ttx, and refreshing the user's context for involvement.","Communities include mechanisms to incent a user to interact with the others using the system. Each community focuses the resources of the system to the defined needs and wishes of a specific group of users to heighten their perceived, real, and expected value of use and involvement with the system. The communities are structured to be professional and social.","The communities will be \u2018ecosystem\u2019 oriented offering services which allow a user to obtain value while in a specific phase of the innovation or development cycle, such as pre-invention (education, browsing, watching, gaming), brainstorming toward initial conjuring, ttx consortium initiation, refinement and editing, incremental innovation, business formation, team building, patent prosecution, product development, competitive analysis, investment raising, IP licensing and commercialization, information e-commerce, product sale e-commerce, project management e-commerce, roadblock busting, expertise sharing, futurist analysis, and sci-fi enthusiasts (dreaming, gaming), investor\/portfolio management (gaming, investment, data mining), policy and governance\/government, and intelligence.","The communities offer a range of ecosystem tools, including event (online meeting\/offline meeting\/public\/private\/project\/social\/multi-media\/conversation\/task\/objective\/deliverable\/etc.) management; information resource\/content management (blog\/shared wisdom, searches, tours, and link bookmarking\/project discussion\/team communications\/shared editing\/etc.); resource management (product\/project\/expertise\/license\/people\/etc.); outreach, advertising, and social tools, and other tools.","As a user moves from one phase of his involvement with a technology to the next, he will be able to migrate his community information into the community of the next phase. As a user migrates his interest in a specific tcept to one or more specific tcepts (sub-tcepts or adjacent tcepts), he can migrate his community information to the newer tcepts with ease. This migration ability keeps the user efficient and refreshed, but also moves his subscriptions, licenses, membership fees, incentive discounts, and account information from a specific tcept based community to another along the development progression of the ttx, increasing the expected value and stickiness of the system, enhancing the currency of information, and retaining cohesiveness for the user's workbench.","Communities may also be formed around map \u2018locales.\u2019 For instance, a fxxt based upon tcept timing, or timeframe of tcept fruition, might yield communities such as \u2018products available 100 years ago\u2019 or products just becoming available in 2025. A fxxt based upon geography of inventorship might yield a community of inventors in upstate New York in 1810.","Community Establishment","In one embodiment, when a new tcept is created, however it is created, a landing web page for that tcept is instantiated, along with a new set of community websites. Other community pages may be established over time. The pages and sites will available to users with proper access rights and roles.","In one embodiment, community access and authorship authorities will be sold.","A user will be able to migrate his access rights and content to deeper tcept names to focus his blog or community. In one embodiment, a user can add new tcept names to his blog or community to make it more wide in applicability and potential audience.","Forming Community","Communities involving a ttx are represented by comxos, a specialization of a txo. Communities available here are, including but not limited to:","Technology Communities\n\n","Brainstorm Contests\n\n","Outreach\/Advertise\u2014Timing for Advertising:","Concretization","As used herein, the term \u201cconcretization\u201d refers to the process of declaring that a ttx exists even if it is abstract, unnamed, or un-described. Concretization allows users to consider an abstract ttx to be real by creating a representative for it called a cnxpt in the CMMDB to act as its placeholder. For some period of its existence, the ttx represented may appear to be poorly defined, but over time, the representative, as the collection point for information regarding the ttx, will likely become more and more well defined as the ttx becomes understood or increases in importance.","In concretization, users may declare the existence of the abstract ttx to the system without knowing that they have done so in some cases. To declare to the system that a ttx exists, even before describing or naming the ttx, is to concretize the ttx and create a representative cnxpt.","Concretization is telling the system, and thus all of the users of the system, that a cnxpt exists.","Conjuring","As used herein, the term \u201cconjuring\u201d or \u201cconjure\u201d refers to a process within at the initial phase of ideation where an inventive thought comes into a person's head\u2014ideas that may not have been stated and are even poorly formed\u2014constituting a ttx formed to the point where a user could search for the ttx. This might occur prior to the person's use of the system described herein, if the person forms a complete and novel ttx prior to searching. More normally, it occurs just after the person begins wondering about the idea and performs a search for what they conceived. It may occur, during a search, where they see some additional triggering ttx, or when they revise the ttx to an alternative that is novel within the system. It may occur, during undirected perusal without a goal, perhaps where the person sees a triggering \u2018adjacent possible\u2019 or a stated need, that summons into action or brings into existence, often as if by magic, a new ttx that is novel within the system.","Here, the process is the nearly automatic means of bringing this type of thought into the system and the potential refinement of the idea during search or creation into an different ttx through exaptation. The gradual refinement of the idea into an understandable ttx after it is originally represented as a ttx is also conjuring even if separated in time and occurring after concretization.","In this description, we name the result of conjuring, or this type of thought that is near the farthest fringes of the thought process, a conjuring (noun).","Consensus","As used herein, the term \u201cconsensus\u201d refers to the result of the tallying of votes regarding, including but not limited to: the existence of a ttx or of a relationship, the importance of a ttx or a relationship, or the correctness of specific value of a description, purlieu assignment, cncpttrrt, or value of an attribute of a cnxpt, based upon and intertwined with fxxt extraction and including, but not limited to: identity indicator based subject identification, merger. The consensus incorporates crowd-sourced information to obtain the \u2018best available\u2019 result from the CMMDB until a new consensus calculation occurs.","Ttxs may be interpreted differently by different users; sometimes one user will see a differentiation that another one does not. Arguably this would invoke confusion, but it will also lead to modification, separation of ideas, decisions and consensus over time.","Only the consensus regarding a ttx should be exposed, unless a user has made a vote regarding the ttx. If a user has made a vote, the user's vote should take precedence over the consensus.","A consensus can hold only for a certain period of time. Most often, cnxpts will be consistent in meaning for a long period of time if they are on a general level, but the consensus will vary on the detailed, recent cnxpts. This detail is most often a change in an off-shoot cnxpt that is seen as a detail of the more general cnxpt category.","In one embodiment, the understanding of a ttx by the system is limited by design to recognition that one ttx is not another unless users have reached a consensus that they are the same, and that if users have reached a consensus that a ttx is related to another in a certain way, then they are. In other words, all of the work of understanding ttxs and relating them to one another depend upon users reaching a consensus about the identification, naming, meaning, categorization, or relationships of the cnxpt representing it.","The objective here is to manipulate the state of the CMMDB so that its cnxpts match those of the consensus of a set of users. This is not seen as machine learning.","Consensus Determination","As used herein, the term \u201cconsensus determination\u201d refers to the process of forming a consensus result based upon fxxt extraction and results from, including, but not limited to: identity indicator based subject identification, categorization, and merger. This collected result gives users a single interpretation of all the available information with resolved descriptions and relationships for all entered cnxpts within the fxxt specification considered. This \u2018best available\u2019 collection of information will hold for that fxxt specification until a new consensus calculation occurs for that fxxt specification.","The consensus determination is the agreement of most participants, seeking to resolve or mitigate the objections of the minority to achieve the most agreeable decision, utilizing subject identification and other available information. Private users can use fxxt arithmetic to add weight to the votes that they have entered.","Each individual user votes to move the CMMDB toward their internal map when they see a poor definition in the CMMDB. At some point, the authority of the CMMDB will improve to a point where it matches most users' internal maps. However, individual mental maps are not objective reflections of the real world, and even if they were, at some point the individual will get creative or the world will change. Thus the user's internal understanding and the CMM may always be to an important degree different. This constant differential is healthy because it means that different individuals can complement each others' weaknesses.","In one embodiment, the voting ontology mechanisms evaluate the various opinions submitted in three ways:\n\n","Consignment Data","As used herein, the term \u201cconsignment data\u201d refers to private data registered as protected-third-party-owned and offered for access, sale, or licensing as a part of a \u2018DD-DataSet\u2019.","Consortiums","As used herein, the term \u201cinnovation consortium\u201d, or \u201cconsortium\u201d refers generally to small virtual organizations formed in an attempt to invent and patent a worthwhile idea, with individuals joining by stating worthwhile additions to the patent application description, diagrams, or claims; or the design and development of the ttx; that are voted on by the other members and tracked by the system. Negotiations regarding ownership are based upon the votes by the contributors and, possibly, by the findings regarding novelty by the patent office (in accepting the various claims).","Correspondence","As used herein, the term \u201ccorrespondence\u201d refers to the degree of correctness of the definition of a txo as compared to the tpx it represents.","Crawling","As used herein, the term \u201ccrawling\u201d refers to the process of browsing the World Wide Web, a heterogeneous repository, or document management systems in a methodical, automated manner to analyze data on web pages or in corporate documents and to scrape information for import into the CMMDB. As used herein, the term \u201ccrawling\u201d also refers to the specification of what to crawl, including how, when, and other parameters for controlling the process. As used herein, the term \u201ccrawling instance\u201d refers to one execution of a crawling.","Crawl Result","As used herein, the term \u201ccrawl result\u201d is a system construct created when a user begins a new search for a ttx. Crawl results represent an uncharacterized set of information resources collected during a crawling (or scraping). A user defines a \u2018crawling\u2019 to find information resources.","A crawl result is created to hold, including but not limited to: a crawling instance identity and crawling instance status; a list of the locators of information resources found as a result set with rsxitems related to irxt info-items representing information resources found by the crawling instance; optionally a name; and optionally a description.","Crawl results may be used as input to queries, since they contain result sets.","In one embodiment, a crawl result may be intended to become an ad hoc resultant data table in which all keys are masked for externalization.","When a crawling is specified for a crawl result that matches an existing crawl result's crawling, information resources found and entered into the older crawl result are not entered into the newer crawl result even if seen.","Crowd Sourcing","As used herein, the term \u201ccrowd sourcing\u201d refers generally to the act of outsourcing the tasks of, including, but not limited to: ideation, collaboration, prediction (wisdom of crowds), valuation (options market pricing), surveying (crowd questions) and investment (crowd funding), to a wide user community (the \u201ccrowd\u201d) to tap into the collective intelligence of the public at large to speed innovation and creativity of other users and to reduce overall costs. Rather than the unrestrained model of granting access to all of the ideas coming in from crowd sourcing, here the exposure of an individual's ideas are hidden until released, but the individual's contributions still affect the collective intelligence in other important ways, including, but not limited to classification of ideas. Crowd source results speed deeper insight into what individuals need for innovation, and yet the structure present here is more narrow then open innovation. Crowd sourcing here similarly involves a narrow form of crowd-funding, and a narrow form of mass collaboration.","Currency of Information","As used herein, the term \u201ccurrency of information\u201d refers to the up-to-datedness (the property of belonging to the present time) of information held by and provided from the CMMDB or other repository. Currency may be highly important depending upon the ttx searched or the specific information need.","The evaluation of how up-to-date an information source is leads to the credibility with which it is regarded. Is the data store learning? Is there evidence of appropriate updating? Is the information in vogue? Is the information at a current state of general acceptance and use?","Currency can be measured by how new the ideas are in the CMMDB. Alternatively, currency is a measure of how precise the information about each ttx is on the basis of whether recent understandings regarding the ttx have been included into the CMMDB. Currency is an overall measure based upon segments of the data that are examined. If a user feels that any segment examined is out of date, then the user believes that the measure of the overall currency is low, even though segments may be very well updated.","A spectrum of currency ranges from \u2018clearly out of date\u2019 to \u2018just thought up\u2019.","To provide currency, a system must be updated, and the data held in it must be improved.","Any bureaucratic delays in updating the CMMDB decrease currency. If users who are experts directly update the CMMDB contents falling within their area of expertise, then the likelihood that the information is current grows. If these users consider the repository to be their tool for information storage, it is easy enough to use, and the users are otherwise properly incentivized to keep the information in it current, then the likelihood of currency again improves.","Finally, if the system becomes a search tool of choice for users, then conjuring and concretization on the basis of queries can take place. A user comes up with a thought, an idea, a cnxpt. They ask the system to find information about it. At that point, the system could just as well believe that it is receiving a description of a cnxpt it has not been given previously. This process brings a user's thoughts into the CMMDB as cnxpts as soon as they complete a query. While it is certainly true that these formative thoughts are low in quality, it is also true that they are the most current available. The more users seeking information, the more current the system is.","Improvement of data is obviously important. Once the new cnxpts are entered, they should be examined by someone to determine if they are well-formed. Here, the use of crowd sourcing coupled with the existence of the concretized idea provides improvement toward well-formedness.","DataSet","As used herein, the term \u201cDataPackage \u201d(differentiated from \u201cdata set\u201d, which is obtained or created and imported or created by a user within the system by any process) refers to an identified subset of data stored in the CMMDB offered for licensing, use, or sale. DataSets include, but are not limited to: \u201cTTX-DataSets\u201d consisting of ttx definitions, descriptions, and characteristics and related data, with specified limitations; Interest-DataSets which are TTX-DataSets bundled with, including, but not limited to, the interest data (counts of how many users viewed the ttx, including, but not limited to: Resultant-DataSets; and \u201cDD-DataSets\u201d.","Decoration","As used herein, the term \u201cdecoration\u201d refers to adornment of objects being displayed. The decoration may be a graphical texture, a \u2018skin\u2019, a covering, or another form of adornment.","Deployment","As used herein, the term \u201cdeployment\u201d refers to the process of determining the specific device to send a component or configuration specifications to, to inform that device that it needs the component, to manage the process of sending the component, to receive confirmation that the component is received, and to persist the status of the delivery.","Description","As used herein, the term \u201cdescription\u201d refers to a textual statement purporting to identify a ttx. It may take the form of an abstract or a full statement.","Descriptions are for human consumption and can contain textual strings of characters, and multimedia references to some additional textual or non-textual representations.","Descriptions exist in all shapes and forms: as formal descriptions, symbolic descriptions, technical descriptions, everyday descriptions, process descriptions, etc.","Infxtypx may be specified for descriptions, including but not limited to: base description or standard description (baseDescription) (also the default infxtypx); display description (dispDescription); technical description (techDescription); formal description; symbolic description; audio description; presentation. Default rules apply for use of other infxtypxd descriptions where a base description, display description, or technical description is absent. Other application-specific description infxtypxs may be specified. In one embodiment, zero or more descriptions of each infxtypx may be specified for an info-item.","Descriptions may be marked as invisible or may be associated with an access control list (ACL) for controlling visibility.","Where descriptions must serve as a basis for identity indicators, weights are imparted based upon the infxtypx of a description used for matching, or by fxxt specifications. Descriptions may be voted upon, and vote weights are also used for matching and relevance. Weights so imparted are summarized by an algorithm which fairly states the weight so that no bias is created when a multitude of descriptions exist for any given info-item.","In one embodiment, descriptions are held in hierarchical structures, where at the root is the base description, if one exists. A description hierarchy is also a container for any number of alternate forms (known as description variants) that may be specified for use in various contexts. Description variants may be the root of subtrees in the hierarchy. Position in the hierarchy affects the weighting of the description when used in matching, with base descriptions receiving a significantly higher weight than those within the subtree. The alternate forms of a description may be, including but not limited to: string values; or references to multimedia resources to be referenced as description variants. Base descriptions and description variants can be given a scopx in which they are valid. In one embodiment, practical limits are imposed to constrain the size and depth of description hierarchies.","Description Variant","As used herein, the term \u201cdescription variant\u201d refers generally to an alternative description, optimized for a particular purpose or containing different information, such as a technical description or a simple description; or for use in localization for a different language.","Relationship Descriptions","Relationships may be described. As a default, the infxtypx of an association is used for its relationship description.","Disaggregated Data","As used herein, the term \u201cdisaggregated data\u201d refers to data associated with cnxpts or relationships. This data may be sold or licensed within bundles called \u201cDD-DataSets\u201d that include data associated with one or more cnxpts.","Dxos","As used herein, the term \u201cdxo\u201d refers to a type of info-item: that may be displayed by the system in a visualization of any nature; that may represent any thing whatsoever, regardless of whether it exists or has any other specific characteristics; about which anything whatsoever may be asserted by any means whatsoever. A dxo is not a Topic as defined in the TNMS, but rather the base class in the display object structure, from which other displayed objects are sub-classed in a multiple inheritance object structure where either txos or relationships are the other base class.","In one embodiment, Dxos are similar to video game objects or avatars, groups of video game objects, scene graphs, images, text displays, graphic symbols in drawings, multimedia, or groups of any of these.","Displayed relationships are specializations of dxos that connect dxos (other than displayed relationships) in a visualization. Displayed relationships multiply inherit from dxos and from relationships.","Dxo Characteristics","A dxo has a dxo type specified by an infxtypx. The types in the CMM are limited to foster simplicity. Dxo types represent a typical class-instance relationship. In one embodiment, dxo types include, but are not limited to:\n\n","Dxo Graphical Representations","In one embodiment, each type of dxo may be given a graphical representation by a user or administrator. Default graphical representations are provided for each type of dxo. Individual users, in one embodiment, may also provide their own graphical representations for dxo types in filter specifications, subject to stated constraints.","In one embodiment, each dxo may be given a graphical representation by a user or administrator. In one embodiment, individual users may also provide their own graphical representations for specific dxos in filter specifications, subject to stated constraints.","Dxo Graphical Personalities","In one embodiment, each type of dxo may be given a graphical personality by a user or administrator. Default graphical personalities are provided for each type of dxo. Individual users, in one embodiment, may also provide their own graphical personalities for dxo types in filter specifications, subject to stated constraints.","In one embodiment, each dxo may be given a graphical personality by a user or administrator. Individual users, in one embodiment, may also provide their own graphical personalities for specific dxos in filter specifications, subject to stated constraints.","Dxo Decorations","In one embodiment, Decorations are used during visualization to adorn dxos. The decoration may be a graphical texture, a \u2018skin\u2019, a covering, or another form of adornment that may be offered.","In one embodiment, \u2018decorations\u2019 may be associated with dxo types or specific dxos by a user, subject to stated constraints. Default decorations may be provided for each dxo type. Individual users, in one embodiment, may also associate specific decorations with a dxo type or with specific dxos, subject to stated constraints. In one embodiment, decorations may be associated with a dxo type or with specific dxos in filter specifications, subject to stated constraints.","In one embodiment, Decorations may be used in conjunction with Graphical Representations and Personalities.","Dxo Mannerisms","In one embodiment, personalities may carry mannerisms. Mannerisms are actions of dxos that may occur at specific, planned, or random times. The actions may be in reaction to a user's action, or in reaction to another user's actions when viewing the same map in a collaboration or sharing scenario. System or external events may also cause reactions by dxos based upon the mannerisms specified for it.","Dxos, personalities, and graphical representations may, in one embodiment, be adorned by mannerisms. In one embodiment, collaborative scenarios, a map may be shared with the user's mannerism specifications attached, subject to stated constraints. In one embodiment, mannerisms are used during visualization to adorn dxos, giving them an animated effect, an aural effect, or another form of activity.","In one embodiment, \u2018mannerisms\u2019 may be associated with dxo types or specific dxos by a user, subject to stated constraints. Individual users, in one embodiment, may also associate specific mannerisms with a dxo type or with specific dxos, subject to stated constraints. In one embodiment, mannerisms may be associated with a dxo type or with specific dxos in filter specifications, subject to stated constraints.","In one embodiment, mannerisms may be used in conjunction with Graphical Representations and Personalities. In one embodiment, \u2018mannerisms\u2019 may be associated with specific Graphical Representations by a user or may associate specific mannerisms with a specific personality, subject to stated constraints.","Dxo Groups","In one embodiment, groups may be formed from dxo objects. Each of the grouped objects is connected by an \u2018anchor\u2019 to the group, in all or a set of scopx, and in all or a set of fxxts. The anchor states the position of the centroid of the object relative to the centroid of the group, in three dimensions (or more), and in all or a set of fxxts. The anchor may also describe behaviors of the included object in all or a set of fxxts.","The geometry nodes in a scene-graph may be replaced by anchors to dxos to form a group based upon scene-graph and encompassing txo or cnxpt info-items.","Alias-Hyperlink Dxos","As used herein, the term \u201calias-hyperlink dxo\u201d or \u201chyperlink dxo\u201d refers to any of various types of dxos used to show that a dxo, txo or cnxpt would be seen at the location on a visualization or list except that it already exists in the visualization or list another location. (The alias-hyperlink dxo indicates a primary location of a \u2018real\u2019 dxo, txo or cnxpt.) If a user clicks appropriately on a hyperlink dxo, the visualization or list is immediately moved to the primary location. If the alias-hyperlink dxo indicates another map or view, clicking on it displays the referenced map or view. A user is provided with a \u2018back up\u2019 tool to move back to the prior context (where the hyperlink dxo is displayed). Hyperlinks other than alias-hyperlink dxos are cross references to other \u2018pages\u2019 (html href links are an example; these hyperlinks provide a URI reference in most cases).","Display Object Inheritance Hierarchy","As used herein, the term \u201cdisplay object inheritance hierarchy\u201d refers to an ordered set of info-item subclasses and superclasses. The objects of the subclass behave, subject to the restrictions of the specialization, like objects of the superclass. Here, the dxo is but one base class in the multiple inheritance structure.","The behaviors inherited from the dxo are limited to display attributes, response to display control, susceptibility to selection, drag and drop and participation in other visualization and display structures. Here, the subclasses of the base class dxo include but are not limited to: certain txo specializations, cnxpts, goals, traits, purlieu, signposts, avatars, alerts, relationships, and information resources.","Display Object Hierarchy","As used herein, the term \u201cdisplay object hierarchy\u201d refers to an ordered set of dxos where each dxo other than a root dxo must be related to another dxo within the hierarchy. This structure is highly related to a \u2018scene-graph\u2019.","Distributed","As used herein, the term \u201cdistributed\u201d refers to a computational task or function that is broken into sub-functions or processes to execute on more than one distinct computing device so that all of the devices act harmoniously to deliver the desired result or overall function.","The term \u201cdistributed\u201d also refers to the data of a database that is spread out and resides on more than one distinct computing device, so that all of data, if collected back onto a single device, would be consistent and complete.","Distribution","As used herein, the term \u201cdistribution\u201d refers to the overall process of determining what software components, content, data, or configuration specifications should be sent to \u2018client\u2019 systems, to deploy the components to those systems, and to then set the component into execution by invoking it.","Domain Engineering and Analysis","As used herein, the term \u201cdomain engineering\u201d or more precisely \u201capplication domain engineering\u201d refers to the definition of product lines, and is divided into three primary phases: analysis\/strategy, design\/product line planning, and implementation\/productization\/product planning. Domain engineering focuses on a family of product lines and their products. As used herein, the term \u201cdomain analysis\u201d refers to the studies of a domain to define the domain, collect information about the domain, and produce a domain description, including a series of classifications for products called appcepts. Domain analysis identifies the common requirements and characteristics in a domain and the varying requirements and characteristics in the domain.","Drag and Drop, Moving Objects","As used herein, the term \u201cDrag and Drop\u201d is used collectively to refer to the process of moving objects on a map or between maps, or of selecting the properties of an object and instructing the system to use those properties for some purpose in a different context. Here, there are several uses for drag and drop, including but not limited to: when a user searches, they will sometimes drag a goal to a different category to provide more information about what they are seeking; when a user wants to re-categorize a cnxpt, they need to drag the cnxpt from one map to drop it on a cnxpt in the same or another map; when a user wants to utilize a cnxpt as a member of a group (result set, an \u2018area of consideration\u2019, etc.), they might need to drag a sphere from one map to drop it on an another map (which is the container for the \u2018area\u2019 or set); when a user wants to use a cnxpt's properties on a community or other web page, for obtaining the properties of the cnxpt for use as a basis for the content of the page, then they drop the cnxpt onto the page; when a user wants to place a \u2018DXO\u2019 next to a cnxpt for display, they need to place it onto the map near the cnxpt.","Duality Mapping & Map Dualities","As used herein, the term \u201cduality mapping\u201d refers to the process of forming a set of maps from an N-dimensional ontology where hierarchical taxonomy trees may be extracted both for a descent from general to specific (for some set of trees where the root is considered the general ttx) as well as an ascent from a specific ttx to the set of general categories it is a sub-category of (may relate too). In the descendant map, the relationships of sub-categories to other general ttxs (not being used as the root of the taxonomy hierarchy) are hidden or shown as hyperlink dxos, but are all shown in the dual ascendant map.","In one embodiment, side by side (or window within window) viewing of the descendant and the ascendant maps make it possible to provide a view analogous to what a driver of a spaceship might see at any instant both out of their front window and through their rear view mirror.","Descendent Map","As used herein, the term \u201cdescendent map\u201d refers to a visualization supporting a fly-through from general categories to very detailed cnxpts. In one embodiment, maps are often three-dimensional hierarchies. For normal use, a \u2018descendent\u2019 taxonometric tree is extracted from the ontology of the CMMDB to form a clump that will provide the information needed to produce a \u2018descendant\u2019 fly-through map from general categories to very detailed cnxpts deep within those categories.","Ascendant Map","As used herein, the term \u201cascendant map\u201d refers to a visualization supporting a fly-through from very detailed cnxpts to general categories such that the multiple categories a cnxpt is a member of, if it is, are viewable. In one embodiment, the \u2018descendent\u2019 extract is a forest of trees but the ontology is N-dimensional. Because of this, it is possible that for some cnxpt deep within the \u2018descendent\u2019 extracted tree, that the cnxpt or its ancestors will have multiple parents. For such a cnxpt, an \u2018ascendant\u2019 tree could be formed where the cnxpt is a root for the tree, where the first branches from the root connect to all of the parents (nodes on other end of the reversed directed edges), where branches from those parents connect to all their parents in turn, etc., and the leaves are the most general categories in the ancestry. This tree would be the basis of an \u2018ascendant\u2019 map.","Expertise Level","As used herein, the term \u201cexpertise level\u201d or \u201cexpertise\u201d refers to a value set as a surrogate for the true knowledge level of a user, the higher value being assigned to a user whose changes are expected to be closer to the correct answer in a circumstance, or closer to an objective assessment in nearly every circumstance.","To move from one expertise level to another in a specific cnxpt, a person (user or otherwise known by system) gains and loses points associated with expertise, as determined first by searching for or within the cnxpt, then by points awarded for, including but not limited to: interest shown by person in cnxpt, creating new cnxpts immediately related to the cnxpt, creating consortia, entities, IP applications or other activities related to the cnxpt, improving the description of the cnxpt, performing methodologies, studies, or models regarding the cnxpt, adding disaggregated data for consignment to the cnxpt, improvement in speed of completions of these activity\/progress indicators. As time passes, points are taken away from the expertise total as a recognition that a person's expertise may change or that their expertise becomes less specific if they do not show new expertise on more detailed follow-on cnxpts. This decrease acts as a penalty to provide a structure for incentive as well as a structure for recalibrating overall present expertise. The expertise level is locked at a system parameter set age of cnxpt so that for older or more general cnxpts no further experts are admitted and no further expertise data is collected. Expertise levels for those frozen cnxpts is still available by calculating expertise according to more specific cnxpts which stem from or are included in the more general.","Features","As used herein, the term \u201cfeature\u201d refers to a cncpttrrt of a tcept that a user or engineer may use to describe a tcept, product, or its abilities.","Filters","As used herein, the term \u201cfilters\u201d refers to parameterized procedures that limit the data retrieved or used for, including but not limited to: visualization displays, pages, analyses, exports, or reporting; or sets or changes positions of or alters the appearance of the data retrieved on, including but not limited to: visualization displays, pages, exports, or reports. Filters may also add style information, additional dxos, titling, legends, etc. In one embodiment, filters take effect on the data resulting from a fxxt specification resolution. Filters may be based upon, including but not limited to: fxxts, templates, visualization defaults, page designs, analysis defaults, report specifications, export defaults, result sets, attribute values, scopx, infxtypx, areas of consideration, areas of interest, access control lists (ACLs).","In one embodiment, filters can be compounded.","Query filters produce restricted subsets of resources, for example those whose language is Spanish and user profile is secondary school student.","Navigation filters allow selection of relationships to navigate by, such as \u2018prior art\u2019, \u2018cited by\u2019, \u2018sub-tcept of\u2019, \u2018solution for\u2019, and \u2018used in\u2019, or combinations of relationships.","Interest filters narrow the ttxs considered by \u2018attributes\u2019, \u2018cncpttrrts\u2019, \u2018purlieus\u2019, \u2018features\u2019, or \u2018requirements\u2019 limitation.","In one embodiment, security filters will suppress data not accessible due to lack of access permission, possibly replacing it with markers for display. Sensitivity filtering can apply changes or present markers based upon security, privacy, legal issues, or information locking of dxos or their metadata.","In one embodiment, calculation filters based upon the value of an attribute of dxos or relationships, including attributes whose values are set by calculation. Calculations may either be made at the retrieval server (often by analytics) or at the display client.","In one embodiment, extraction filters limit the data retrieved for, including but not limited to: visualization displays, analysis, exports, or reporting. In one embodiment, extraction filters only affect the data included in extract sets (clumps) from the CMMDB.","In one embodiment, Priority and Marking Filters mark displayed objects for importance or priority or other purpose utilizing shape enhancement, colors, fonts, shading, modified dimensions, etc.","In one embodiment, authorship filters, based upon the authorship of votes, allow a user's views to have priority in extraction, positioning, and display.","In one embodiment, advertising filters adjust or remove advertising for certain subscribers.","In one embodiment, the language used for names and descriptions may be changed by application of extraction or display filtering, or by fxxt resolution.","Display Filters","In one embodiment, filters may be applied to affect displays at the display level.","Display filters provide for, including but not limited to: information hiding; dxo highlighting; customizing of display language, styles to improve the map design, fonts, dxo images, lines, and background; forcing the sort or display order of the visualized data; limiting, altering, or enhancing the data used for, or the appearance on, including but not limited to: visualization displays, analysis, exports, or reporting. Display-filtering may, including but not limited to: set or adjust positions for the data; add style information; additional dxos; titling; legends, etc.","In one embodiment, display-filters provide dynamic view-filtering to allow a user to change 1) how dxos are displayed, and 2) which dxos are displayed. These filters will be applied to the dxos late in the visualization stage, acting after the extraction of dxo information from the ontology and after the calculation of positioning of the dxos. These filters only affect the presence or look of the data displayed by the user, not the data stored in or retrieved from the CMMDB.","In one embodiment, information hiding is provided by limit filtering to eliminate from the display all elements that are not selected by a limiting filter specification. Filters can be based upon, including but not limited to: scopx and infxtypx of relationships, generality, user identity or type, date of relationship, or metrics on relationships. Filters act on, including but not limited to: dxos, relationships, rsxitems, parameters, templates, display graphics, and database values.","In one embodiment, filters highlight dxos to show importance or priority utilizing, including but not limited to: shape enhancement, colors, fonts, shading, modified dimensions. Filters can adjust the display image of each type of dxo. For each dxo type, a template will be provided for each type of output (export, report, visualization). In one embodiment, each template can be overridden by the user by filter settings, and each override can be saved and named.","Filtering","As used herein, the term \u201cfiltering\u201d refers to the application of filters. In one embodiment, filtering is the application of filters to data resulting from a fxxt specification resolution.","Finding","As used herein, the term \u201cfinding\u201d refers to a specific form of searching consisting of entering a (wild-carded) \u2018find\u2019 string to find each location (the next instance) of a combination of any characters, including uppercase and lowercase characters, whole words, or parts of words, or regular expression in the data or info-item names\/titles or information within a view.","Forgetting","As used herein, the term \u201cforgetting\u201d refers to a specific form of ideation where certain details get integrated and lose their individual identity. Often, humans combine categories to remember the ttxs within the categories, or when learning of a new detail they combine it into a broader ttx. In each case, the meaning becomes undifferentiated and is lost for analysis. Luckily, the loss of the specific information sometimes leads a user to think of new information, so forgetting may spur creativity.","Goals","As used herein, the term \u201cgoal\u201d is an info-item system construct created when a user begins a new search for a ttx. Goals represent a ttx in the mind of the user that could potentially be represented as a cnxpt. A user defines a \u2018Search Goal\u2019 or \u2018Goal\u2019 based upon some felt need to find out about the ttx, whether or not the ttx is represented by a cnxpt, possibly without being able to state the ttx, and possibly without being able to name the ttx. A user's stating of a goal most often implies that the user is thinking of a ttx, even if it is abstract, unnamed, or un-described. Goals allow users to see something to represent the abstract ttx. The user attempts to describe, in a goal, a ttx that may exist and that they are interested in, then starts searching for that ttx, even if it has not yet been created in the CMM, and even if they change their own understanding of what they are interested in as they progress.","In one embodiment, in searching, a user forms queries within a goal to find information.","During the searching and querying process within the goal, the user's original idea, or personal ttx may undergo change (exaptation) as the user continues thinking. Put a different way, the goal serves to collect all of the searching and querying that occurs to attain the goal, and then encapsulates the result into a cnxpt that represents the ttx actually resulting after the user resolves his thoughts.","At a point of acceptance that the goal has been met by its categorization placement and that no such idea was previously entered (the idea is real and novel), the goal is concretized as a ttx by converting the goal to a cnxpt or by creating a representative cnxpt to replace the goal. For some period of its existence, the ttx represented may appear to be poorly defined, but over time, the representative, as the collection point for information regarding the ttx, will likely become more and more well defined. Goals thus may declare the existence of the abstract ttx to the system without the user knowing that he has done so. The goal may later become a variant of an existing cnxpt, subject to later merger, but is then essentially considered the same by the user and visually overlaps the existing cnxpt on visualizations.","In one embodiment, the searching is carried out through the goal, by navigating, searching, meta-searching, by analytic, or manually.","In one embodiment a goal is created to hold, including but not limited to: a query script consisting of one or more of queries and the result sets resulting from each such query; other result sets, navigation tours taken by the user during the search; user indications from a navigation; optionally a name; and optionally a description. Goals are also displayable objects.","Goals and cnxpts may be used as input to queries, since they may be considered single rsxitems, they may contain result sets and they may have occurrences.","In one embodiment, a goal may be intended to result in a cnxpt with a new scopx and not intended to represent a cnxpt with an existing infxtypx.","In one embodiment, a goal may be intended to result in an ad hoc resultant data table rather than a cnxpt.","In one embodiment, when a query is specified for a goal that matches an existing cnxpt's query, relationships are created between the goal and the existing cnxpt. The utility of this is that scripts that yield result sets specifically containing occurrences usable for describing cnxpts may be used to initiate the definition of a new cnxpt.","Graphical Personality","As used herein, the term \u201cgraphical personality\u201d refers to the sum of the ways that a dxo may, including, but not limited to: act, respond, animate itself, enunciate, etc.","Graphical Representation","As used herein, the term \u201cgraphical representation\u201d refers to the look of a dxo on a display.","Harmonization","As used herein, the term \u201charmonization\u201d refers to the systematization, regulation, standardization, management, reconciliation, and coordination of the classification and codification for all txo identities, their definitions, and any associated information placed into the central CMMDB and affiliated CMM ontologies to ensure that redundancy and confusion are removed and\/or minimized. harmonization is permanent.","The CMMDB will contain private data that must be held confidentially and unpublishable. The affiliated CMM ontologies, located elsewhere, contain other private data under the care of a customer but still requiring harmonization when portions of that data are released into the CMMDB or otherwise. Upon harmonization, confidential and other items are merged into the CMMDB commonplace while still being kept confidential and unpublishable, so that the categorization on the central system can be used for categorizing information on the affiliated ontologies as well. Upon authorized release, the confidential and unpublishable items, one at a time, will be made available for other users. Prior to that, the information may be seen, at most, as an empty sphere on the map, according to the instructions of the user.","Heuristic","As used herein, the term \u201cheuristic\u201d refers to either a simple experience based algorithm or a more complex user specified or system tuning algorithm applied to base data, and changed as needed to improve the effect of the overall operation of the system or the operation as applied to a specific user's need. Heuristics are cataloged for ease of controlled and transparent alteration.","Hierarchy","As used herein, the term \u201chierarchy\u201d refers to an ordered set of objects where each object other than a root object must be related to another object within the hierarchy. A forest, where there are multiple root objects, is considered a hierarchy in general.","Horizon","As used herein, the term \u201chorizon\u201d refers to a context in time for which to predict the expected state of gestation of all tcepts in a fxxt. The horizon is stated as a parameter to a model based upon a user or plan requirement. It is either in the future or the past. A horizon timeframe is a specific time plus or minus a prediction error, and can also be indicated by use of a time differential from a current date.","Identification","As used herein, the term \u201cidentification\u201d refers to the capability used to find, retrieve, report, change, or delete a txo representing a specific tpx without ambiguity, or to distinguish between two tpxs that are similar. Because of the general nature of the term, we subdivide it into \u201cinfrastructure identification\u201d, \u201cttx identification\u201d and \u201cinfo-item identification\u201d to be specific.","Info-Item Identification","Info-items must all be non-ambiguously identifiable for internal addressing. Info-items should normally be identifiable by a human by a name.","Infrastructure Txo Identification","As used herein, the term \u201ctxo identification\u201d refers to the use of identity indicators to improve the correspondence between a tpx and its representative txo; to inform the user about what the ttx represented actually is, and to serve as a specific subject where used as a property or characteristic of other tpxs or ttxs.","The objective with topic maps, as it is with the infrastructure info-items here, is to achieve a one-to-one relationship between topics and the subjects that they represent. Identity by indicators enables mergers for topic maps as it does for the infrastructure txos here. Before topic map merger, the same subject may be represented by more than one topic. It is crucially important to know when two txos represent the same tpx when aggregating information (for example, cncpttrrts, purlieus, information resources, or scopxs from a private CMM into the central CMMDB), or matching vocabularies; when merging categorization schemes and indices into the CMMDB, when comparing an infrastructure tpx to determine if it matches an existing tpx; or when comparing ontologies. To achieve this, the correspondence between a txo and the tpx that it represents needs to be made clear. This in turn requires tpxs to be identified to a sufficiently non-ambiguous degree by information other than their unique item identifier (ID). This objective is not achievable to perfection, but refinement by respected experts and staff, and the use of identity indicator ranking by weights leads to a high degree of clarity as well as a means to direct attention to poor specification. Identity indicators provide an information basis for the identification mechanism that resolves agreement on the identity of txos by administrators and expert users who most often administer the infrastructure. Identity indicators assist in automatically determining the degree of dissimilarity of infrastructure info-items to alert administrators of confusion in the infrastructure.","The Identification of Ttxs in Crowd Sourcing","Direct Ttx Identification","As used herein, the term \u201cttx identification\u201d refers to the use of identity indicators to inform the user about what the ttx represented actually is by detailing the cnxpt and differentiating it from others; in merging categorization schemes and indices into the CMMDB; for comparing a user idea to determine if it matches an existing idea; and indirectly, to show where the ttx should be on visualizations relative to other ttxs.","The objective of the present system in ttx identification is different from that of a topic map in that the subjects\u2014the ttxs\u2014are not well understood for cnxpts. There is still the need to achieve a one-to-one relationship between cnxpts in the CMMDB and ttxs that they represent, but because the ttxs are still formative, the need is defined by: what the user was originally thinking; what the user might have been thinking; what the system could add to the user's thinking to create some original idea; what the user was or might have been looking for; what the user refined his thoughts to be; and what the consensus view of the ttx became, in order to ensure that all knowledge about a particular ttx can be connected properly to the representative cnxpt. Note that these are not identities as used in topic maps, and the more important issue here is deep categorization and differentiation of ttxs.","A second objective in aggregating ttx information is to reduce redundancy by refining the vast set of merged entries into a reduced collection of concisely described and understandable ttxs. Ttxs will be obtained from many sources in this system. Some will be well defined, such as by patents. Others will be simple category names which might be meaningless to anyone other than the author.","Fuzzy Ttx Identification for Collocation","To promote the ability to see \u2018nearly identical\u2019 ttxs to allow crowd sourced cleanup or to highlight interesting differences, the system must achieve a \u201ccollocation objective.\u201d To do so, one or more of five methods may be utilized to obtain additional identity indicators: to measure the semantic difference between two ttxs; to accept arrangement information from users stating that the ttx is a sub-ttx of another; to accept similarity or differentiation information from users stating that the ttx is similar\/identical to another or that there is a definable difference between them; or to accept relevance information from users stating that some information external to the ttx is relevant to describing the ttx.","To implement semantic differences, pairwise analysis between descriptions must be performed efficiently and results summarized.","To implement the arrangement method, it is necessary to allow general and specific ttxs, where the general ttx is a categorization of more specific ttxs, and to allow a user to move a cnxpt into or out of a category.","To implement the relevance method, binding points must be provided from which everything that is known about a given ttx can be reached. In topic maps, binding points take the form of topics that represent the subject for which the bound information is relevant; for a topic map application to fully achieve the collocation objective there must be an exact one-to-one correspondence between subjects and topics: every topic must represent exactly one subject and every subject must be represented by exactly one topic. In a crowd sourcing system where consensus must build in the definition of a ttx that is most often extremely nebulous at its inception, the objective is to manage the refinement, allowing and expecting that most recent ttxs will not have an exact one-to-one correspondence between ttxs and cnxpts. Collecting and managing information resource indicators is beneficial. Pragmatically, any cnxpt may represent one or more ttxs, and any ttx may be represented by more than one cnxpt, at least for an initial period.","Here, imprecision will definitely exist, and when a cnxpt representing a ttx is recognized as imprecise, refinement by users, including inexpert users, may provide, including but not limited to: definition improvement; subdivision by creation of two more precisely identified cnxpts that become children of the original cnxpt; combination with another cnxpt; or deletion. The use of identity indicator ranking by weights leads to a higher degree of clarity by ranking, and the use of fxxts reduces conflicts between meaning confusion caused by similarity of terms across different categorization bases.","In one embodiment, a single cnxpt results from combining the characteristics of the two cnxpts only if all of the characteristics are the same, but where a substantial disagreement is seen regarding the characteristics of a cnxpt, a workflowed suggestion is made that the cnxpt be split into three cnxpts, where one parent is formed from the characteristics in the intersection of characteristics (those agreed upon), and two child cnxpts having the characteristics in dispute on each side.","Identity","As used herein, the term \u201cidentity\u201d refers to the set of all indicators of an info-item usable for identification.","Info-Item Identities","All info-items must be identified non-ambiguously for internal addressing. This is accomplished by assignment of a unique item identifier (ID) to every info-item. This unique ID is not assigned by meaning but is rather an identity for computer processing of info-items. It has an internal and an external form.","Names are used on most info-items to provide user recognizable identities, but are not un-ambiguous due to issues with language.","Identity Indicator","As used herein, the term \u201cidentity indicator\u201d refers generally to any one of a set of specific indications from data and relationships in the CMM that tends to establish a compelling and unambiguous identity of a tpx to humans, to establish that the txo representing a tpx has a correct correspondence to the tpx, and to establish the same identity for two seemingly disparate txos which are actually representing the same subject. Subject indicators are but one form of identity indicator used here. An identity indicator is distinct from the item identifier (unique ID) of the info-item.","Identity indicators provide an information basis for the identification mechanism that resolves agreement on the identity of ttxs by all users. For ttxs and cnxpts, the subject indicators address the primary issues here of whether a goal matches a cnxpt and the degree of similarity between ttxs. Where applied to a ttx or a cnxpt, identity indicators may be scopx and fxxt specific so that the indications tend to establish a compelling and unambiguous identity of the ttx to humans in certain aspects but not in others according to the fxxt specification (which includes the scopx effects).","Identity indicators assist to enable comparison of goals to cnxpts and differentiation of cnxpts based upon a \u2018fuzzy\u2019 degree of similarity. Identity indicators establish that the cnxpt representing the ttx has a correct correspondence to the ttx, to establish the differential between two disparate cnxpts which have nearly the same characteristics, and to identity seemingly disparate cnxpts which are actually the same even though their (pre-fxxt calculation) characteristics are somewhat different.","The same identity indicator may be specified for multiple txos to allow, including but not limited to: relationship voting, fuzzy logic based comparison, matching, and merging, and accommodation of versions and temporary txos, goals, and cnxpts. Specifically, the same subject indicator may be specified for (or related to) more than one cnxpt.","In one embodiment, if two cnxpts have all of the same identity indicators in a resolution of a fxxt specification, then by definition they should represent the same ttx within that fxxt, even if not actually the same. In one embodiment, if two cnxpts have all the same identity indicators in a resolution of a fxxt specification, then by definition they should represent the same ttx within that fxxt only if they share the same identity indicators in all fxxts. In one embodiment, where two cnxpts share the same identity indicators in all fxxts for longer than a set period, then a to-do tickler alert or other call for action is created for attention by administrators or the crowd. In one embodiment, and in the present description, if two cnxpts share the same identity indicators in a resolution of a fxxt specification, they are merely presumed to represent the same ttx in that fxxt and are no more than temporarily considered to be very strongly related, so that they are not considered identical generally.","General Forms of Identity Indicators","A txo can have zero or more of each of the following forms of subject identity indicators, and thus can be identified by a number of different indicators, including but not limited to:","Characteristic Identity Indicators","As used herein, the term \u201ccharacteristic identity indicators\u201d refers to those info-item characteristics such as attribute values, names, and descriptions, each optionally with a scopx, which may be useful to indicate that the info-item represents something specific, and which are thus usable for identification.","To determine identity similarity and differentiation automatically, characteristic identity indicators are used in pairwise analysis of txos, often to determine \u2018semantic distance\u2019.","Characteristic identity indicators include but are not limited to: a human-readable label, an attribute value, a textual definition, description or name; a visual, audio or other representation; a consensus vote toward similarity, a ranking of semantic similarity recognized as generally accurate; or some combination of these. Txo description and name variant characteristics may each be optionally assigned one or more scopxs. Cnxpt description and name variant characteristics may each be optionally assigned one or more scopxs and one or more fxxts. In one embodiment, txo attribute characteristics may each be optionally assigned one or more scopxs and cnxpt attribute characteristics may each be optionally assigned one or more scopxs and one or more fxxts.","Names, labels, and descriptions act as one or both a human readable subject indicator or a basis for semantic comparison resulting in an affinity relationship when compared to other names, labels, or descriptions.","Subject Identity Indicators","As used herein, the term \u201csubject identity\u201d refers to an identity indicator established by some further detail, held in a separate info-item, that somewhat describes an info-item's subject. The further details might include, but are not limited to: a characteristic of the separate info-item such as a description, name, or value, or an external identifier like a social security number or the address of an information resource known as an addressable information resource (an \u201caddressable subject\u201d). A subject identity is useful because it is a pointer to the separate info-item and the pointer is a unique and comparable resource as a surrogate of the detail. For example, a cnxpt may reference a patent to unambiguously show to a user that the cnxpt represents the ttx as described by that patent.","Example: Identifying the Ttx \u201cApple\u201d","Subject identity is implemented here by an occurrence relationship to a subject indicator info-item of some type. This states: \u201cThis cnxpt (or txo) is identified by the characteristics of that info-item\u201d or \u201cThis cnxpt (or txo) is identified by the information resource as represented by that info-item.\u201d","Subject indicator info-items can be used to hold indicator characteristics directly, such as a name, a description, an external identity value, or an information resource address locator. Infrastructure txos may represent internal tpx such as traits, purlieu, or other tpx, and are useful as subject indicators. Other information resource subject indicator info-items provide external reference identities or addresses. Many of the things that a cnxpt (or txo) can represent are not things that a computer can resolve a reference to. For example, a person may have any number of database records about himself or online biographies or pictures, but none of those addressable resources are the person\u2014they are merely some form of descriptor for the person. Yet, the person may have a social security number, or an external identification. These descriptors are enclosed into the subject indicator info-item as descriptions or characteristics to improve the related cnxpt's (or txo's) correspondence with the ttx (or tpx) that the cnxpt (or txo) represents.","Occurrences as Indicators","All occurrences are identity indicators because they indicate a relationship between the cnxpt (or txo) and some detail relevant to, but not actually describing the ttx (tpx or subject), that a user believes relates to the subject, such as by narrowing the subject or by referencing differentiators. A very high weighted occurrence relationship is intended to show that some info-item is very relevant to the ttx (tpx or subject). A highly negative occurrence weight would show a strong differentiator. The identity given by the individual occurrences is greatly improved when the occurrences are considered as a group, and here the weighting of occurrences improves the identification accuracy further. An occurrence is useful because it is a pointer to the separate info-item and the pointer is a unique and comparable resource as a surrogate of the relevant information.","The relevant details might include, but are not limited to: a characteristic of the separate info-item such as a description, name, or value, a description of a trait, requirement, or need; a purlieu; or the characteristic of another infrastructure txo.","Associations as Indicators","Associations are, only indirectly, identity indicators because they assist in discriminating between similar cnxpts (or txos), or in showing strong affinity which juxtaposes the cnxpts closely on displays. In the aggregate, associations, when considered as a group, also form a differentiator in comparing two similar cnxpts (or txos), and the weighting of the associations improves the accuracy further. The effects of hierarchical and affinitive associations on identity are different, with hierarchical associations more directly indicative of identity for child role cnxpts. After fxxt analysis, the hierarchical associations are more indicative.","Published Subject Indicator","As used herein, the term \u201cpublished subject indicator\u201d refers generally to a subject indicator that is published and maintained at an advertised address for the purpose of facilitating topic map interchange and mergeability.","Subject Identifier","As used herein, the term \u201csubject identifier\u201d refers generally to an occurrence relationship (rather than a property as in the TNMS) that relates a cnxpt (or txo) to a subject indicator info-item. A subject identifier occurrence relationship is often given a higher weight than some other forms of occurrence because subject descriptions are a stronger indicator of a subject's true identity than, for instance, a trait or a purlieu.","Subject Locator","As used herein, the term \u201csubject locator\u201d refers to an indicator usable for identification directly based upon the address of an information resource known as an addressable information resource (an \u201caddressable subject\u201d) that is the subject of a topic. Subject locators are not implemented specifically here, their function being subsumed by subject indicators. The use of the term \u2018subject locator\u2019 is merely for convenience otherwise.","In general, subject indicators are related to cnxpts (or txos) by subject identifier occurrence relationships. The weighting of the occurrence relationships indicate which occurrence is most strongly believed to be the true identity or best possible description for the ttx represented by the cnxpt (or tpx for a txo). If there is one such highly weighted occurrence, then it is the subject locator.","In deviation from the TNMS, where a subject is often described fully by one information resource, here multiple information resources may be relevant to the described tpx. When only one information resource is in an occurrence relationship with a txo or cnxpt, the address of that information resource is called a \u2018subject locator\u2019 in conformity with the TNMS unless marked otherwise. A user may vote to mark an information resource as a \u2018subject locator\u2019, and the \u2018subject identifier\u2019 occurrence relationship with the irxt representing the information resource would receive a high weighting. Where no single information resource is apparent, and thus there is no single unambiguous and resolvable address, the identity of the ttx can only be established indirectly through the notion of identity indicators, one type of which is the subject indicator information resource.","Item Identifiers","As used herein, the terms \u201citem identifier\u201d, \u201cunique identifier\u201d (\u201cID\u201d) or \u201cunique ID identifier\u201d refer to a unique, internal, numeric format database identities (UID) of an info-item that facilitates its addressing by, including but not limited to: relationships, processing functions. The ID is not assigned by meaning but is rather an identity for computer processing of info-items. Info-item identification by Unique ID Identifiers is differentiated from \u201cidentification\u201d here as it is not based upon the meaning of objects.","In one embodiment, the unique internal ID is converted to be an external (export) ID prior to exposure outside of the CMMDB by the \u2018key encryption process\u2019 so that the CMMDB may not be copied. On re-import the altered IDs will be reconciled with the internal database identities.","The unique external (export) ID that is unique across that CMMDB and all exports is a unique generated key consisting of:\n\n","In one embodiment, Unique IDs are collected from remote systems and reconciled. Unique ID Identifiers are not identity indicators.","Impulse Retrieval","As used herein, the term \u201cimpulse retrieval\u201d refers to a spontaneous recognition of interest by a searcher in a ttx that the searcher hadn't queried for when they began their search. As a user visually traverses a visualization map, following the elements in a field of view, s\/he may add info-items found to their goal result set.","Users are not always aware of the reasons why they look at \u2018off topic\u2019 items as they browse, but it is largely because they have not been able to properly state a query or that the query mechanism is simply too constraining to return all of the ttxs that the user really wanted to see. However, when they click through the visualization, they are seeing the breadth of the ttxs available. Where ttxs are the analog to both the categories and the products on the on-line catalog, searches (queries) will not yield any more than a starting point for the user's effort, and that their traversal through the categories will take them to the ttx they are really seeking or to ttxs that are even more interesting.","In reality, very few users are \u201csearch dominant\u201d where they always use search, no matter what the catalog design. No users use search exclusively. It is the design of the site that drives users to decide whether to use categories or search to locate products.","This type of action is referred to as Impulse Retrieval because of its similarity to an Impulse Purchase. Impulse Retrieval was found to be an effective tool for users of card catalogs in libraries. Some new library systems provide improved searching systems that improve on co-location cataloging, but the CMM is designed to improve on those facilities by providing very deep (multiple level) co-location facilities.","Incentivize","As used herein, the term \u201cincentivize\u201d refers to a management tool for increasing the desire of users to participate effectively by offering a tangible reward based upon the completion of a specific achievement. In addition, the term \u201cIncentive Programs\u201d includes the convincing showing that a tangible or intangible result will be received by the participant based upon the completion of a specific achievement, even if a specific reward is not offered. Incentivization is aimed at, including but not limited to: greater intensity of use by each user; quality improvements for the data; map improvement based upon Thinking Style; greater investment, more outreach; more excitement; expanded resources such as methodologies, analytics, surveys, DataSets. Incentives are offered to users to entice them into adding information and into using the information available through the system. Increased use will yield refinement of information more rapidly and a greater base of users. Incentives are provided to improve the quality, quantity, and understandability of the data in the CMMDB. Compensation is provided to obtain effort by a user on a specific task or within a specific consortium. Major incentives will be offered for users who disclose new novel tcepts because they may be valuable as Intellectual Property. Communities increase value to users and channel users toward transactions; registries to take in information about users, their needs, or their offerings; a storefront as a charging control mechanism for fee based services; and multitier ownership of data for private information control.","Incentives, include but are not limited to:\n\n","A significant source of incentives stem from a community based approaches, including communities aimed at: inclusion, information input, information use, attribution, acknowledgement, common goals (to make it correct), pride of authorship, pride of inventorship, making something available, inventing something needed, ego attachment, (quasi) gambling through investment (shares), collaboration, and fundraising.","To incentivize viewing we specifically incentivize the user by empowering them to obtain pertinent and high quality data quickly (immediate and rapid gratification), to increase their knowledge breadth and depth, to assist in context management and process management, and to keep their burdens low, enthusiasm high, to raise expectations of more to come back to, including but not limited to:\n\n","When the technologies are out, they can be viewed by any number of investment bankers\/people wanting to buy\/commercialize the new technology. The inventor has choice depending upon their objectives at each point of this process to choose if they would like to sell\/patent\/license\/commercialize their technology. When the technologies are out, they can be viewed by recruiters searching for creative talent.","Enticement and Viral Marketing Incentives","As an incentive for use and an additional value stream, a feed of teaser stories about, including but not limited to: new inventions; new investments; new investment \u2018value events\u2019; new inventors; each providing a short headline, story line, and links to a ttx on visualization and community page for the ttx to provide a news feed for use by other sites.","For notification and to expand the user base, an outreach mechanism to notify those whose works are added to the CMM as information resources that their contributions are being cited. The mechanism includes email outreach, \u2018friend\u2019 outreach, and entries on each of organization based \u2018feed\u2019 and \u2018blog\u2019 to notify colleagues of the attributions of works.","For notification and to expand the user base, an outreach mechanism to notify friends of those whose works are added to the CMM as information resources, new ideas, or inventions that the work is being included into the CMM. The mechanism includes email outreach to those who have not \u2018opted out\u2019 and have shown interest in a related technology area or in the author\/contributor outside of the use of the CMM, and are not present users of the CMM.","Paid Incentives","Companies can pay for brainstorming by others, and can put the brainstorming into a game context. Brainstorm or online development games will provide spectator and player excitement and increase the quantity of ideas in the system. The players and spectators may pay a fee to help cover the cost of the \u2018purse\u2019 paid to the winner. The payments may take on a speculative nature in support of the higher perceived expertise of certain players. The appearance of this type of game will be as a Reality TV show where a spectator can watch the contestants think and create.","Brainstorming Game","The brainstorming game is essentially to ask the player to describe an \u2018game entry\u2019 idea that would be suitably categorized as being within the parent cnxpt identified, where the idea was differentiable from the cnxpts already in the parent cnxpt. A sort of \u2018pin the tail on the donkey\u2019 choice of the category selection to choose a parent could substitute for the specific identification of a parent by the game moderator.","Incentive Indications","Question Mark Bubbles serve as the user's indicator of an incentive to add or define a cnxpt, or as a place to enter a game entry in the Brainstorming Game. Once a description is entered by a user, the Question Mark Bubble would change to a different indicator showing an answer being given. A portfolio list of Question Mark Bubbles would be available to players. Users would be able to sort the portfolio list by value of incentive, or could, including but not limited to: limit it by game involved. Question Mark Bubbles carrying an incentive other than a mere game reward show desired areas of the fxxt where contributions are desired or where work is requested. Workflows are involved when entries are made by a user in game or incentivized Question Mark Bubbles.","Money Mark Bubbles serve as the user's indicator of fertile areas for innovative thought. A Money Mark Bubble shows that the parent cnxpt should have more children.","Suggestion Bubbles serve as the user's starting point for thought toward innovation. A Suggestion Bubble has a description that is machine generated and likely not a proper description of anything. Such generated suggestions are of the nature of \u2018TRIZ\u2019 suggestions where a differentiator is stated within a context of a cnxpt. TRIZ or its derivatives have defined a concept of \u2018contradictions\u2019 in design criteria that lead to \u2018inventive situations\u2019. TRIZ \u2018system features\u2019 lead a designer or inventor to consider specific limited improvements with the understanding that contradictions may or may not be solved. These \u2018system features\u2019 are a type of \u2018differentiation\u2019 that could trigger an inventor to think in a certain direction toward innovation. Differentiations, keyword triggers, gaps, TPL change triggers, or some other triggering thought that a user could form into an actual innovative concept are generated by methodology based generation algorithms developed and added to the system, including but not limited to TRIZ, TPL, Feature Differentiators, vocabulary trigger generators. The number of such available suggestions is a predictor used to show fertility of a category, whether or not they are all displayed.","Fun Incentives","Games such as expert watching or investor watching can be expanded to \u2018fantasy investor\u2019 games.","Single person games such as \u201cAre you thinking like a great innovator?\u201d can offer students a challenge. \u2018View Innovation Pulse\u2019 is a viewing of a display of activity; by community interaction, by investment; by value growth; of some system data.","Users may Opt-in to be \u2018Followed,\u2019 (possibly for an incentive discount), and allow for establishment of personal ratings. Trust and Expertise Ratings provide for reporting on statistics of prior system interaction results; Trust Story anecdotes or reviews; Experience measures (such as What they looked at; What they are interested in)","Invention tracking is a spectator sport where a user is informed of the progress of an invention, tcept, investment, investment pool, or investment team. People can watch experts, and even \u2018guide\u2019 them or bet on them to be able to come up with a new concept.","One Reality TV show could be \u2018watch the inventor action\u2019, where a challenge is set up to rapidly improve on an idea within some specific set of constraints (solve this appcept, make this cheaper, etc.).","Another will be \u2018watch the investor action\u2019 where new private placements are published and spectators bet on the investment level made, time to close, etc.","Indication","As used herein, the term \u201cindication\u201d refers to the act of informing the system through the user interface that a specific dxo or relationship is to be acted upon based on a request to the system for action.","Ideas\u2014Subjects, Topics, Ttxs","Tpx\u2192Represented by Txo","As used herein, the term \u201ctpx\u201d refers to anything whatsoever, regardless of whether it exists or has any other specific characteristics, about which anything whatsoever may be asserted by any means whatsoever. A \u2018tpx\u2019 corresponds exactly to the term \u2018resource\u2019 in RDF (defined in RFC 2396 as \u201canything that has identity\u201d). The address of a tpx that happens to be an information resource is called a subject address.","The TNMS's subject is a tpx in the sense used here.","Concept\u2192Ttx\u2192Represented by Cnxpt","As used herein, the term \u201cttx\u201d refers to a cognitive unit of meaning. It is an abstract idea of something formed by combining a set of characteristics. Ttxs are perceived regularities in events or objects, usually designated by a label in a language. Ttxs are also thought of as categories. As categories, they may hold sub-categories. Each ttx may additionally be described by its relationships to other ttxs in a categorization or classification structure, and by its characteristics. Each ttx may be additionally described by (including, but not limited to): name variants, descriptive information, description variants, relationships to other ttxs in a knowledge domain (e.g. in a classification hierarchy), purlieus, cncpttrrts, scopxs, information resources, and attribute values. Ttxs need not be fully described or given names during their infancy. Identity indicators apply to ttxs. In one embodiment, strong limits are placed on what may be defined as being a ttx to reduce the burdens caused by over generality.","Technology Concept\u2192Tcept\u2192Represented by Txpt","As used herein, the term \u201ctcept\u201d refers to a cognitive unit of meaning or knowledge perception of at least one of a field of science, a scientific discovery, an industrial design, a business process, a procedure, a tcept category, an innovation, an invention, a utility patent invention, a means, a method, a tcept with an additional or changed feature from another tcept, a generic branding. Tcepts are elements of scientific knowledge or creative ideas for techniques or apparatuses from the human mind. Tcepts are the application of knowledge and understanding, embodied into a piece of equipment or a technique for performing a particular activity in order to control processes and\/or fabricate products. They each represent the sum of the study of a specific technique, method, procedure, formula, device, means, or apparatus, but need not consist of any more than a simple info-item identifier (for internal identity) and a simple characterization by a set of characteristics such as a definition or name (for external identity indication).","Tcept examples include but are not limited to: pencils; paper; devices, tools, systems, or equipment; techniques, products; processes, procedures, programs, or methods; drugs; reagents, compounds; diagnostics, metrics, or indicators; organizational styles or managerial system, etc. They might be cutting-edge products, or broad fields of technology. They need not be commercially available or feasible. They need not be concrete at present, nor do they need to be well defined or meet a human need. They may or might not represent advances in theoretical knowledge, tools and equipment. They might be considered to fall within any technological or scientific field, including but not limited to communications, media, transportation, energy, computing, chemistry, biotechnology, etc. Tcepts are not the use of, purpose or result (artifact) of a process or application of a device.","Tcepts do not define property rights but can be the basis of definitions for creative ideas of the human mind that have commercial value and could receive the legal protection of a property right under the legal mechanism of a patent or a trade secret. If an idea is patentable, then it can be a tcept.","Each tcept may be named and described by, including, but not limited to: name variants, descriptive information, description variants, its relationships to other ttxs in a knowledge domain (e.g. in a classification hierarchy), its purlieus, cncpttrrts, information resources, and attribute values, or by combining a set of characteristics that includes what are here called features. Each tcept is also a ttx.","Application of Technology Concept\u2192Appcept\u2192Represented by Axpt","As used herein, the term \u201cappcept\u201d refers to a cognitive unit of meaning or knowledge perception of at least one of a potential purpose, need, or use for technology, system, or product, probably to help to solve human problems or to create a result or product, or where needs for technologies share relevant commonalities; or a categorization of needs for a technology. It is the problem that someone believes can be solved by a technology. Appcepts are represented by axpts. Axpts are specializations of cnxpts.","Each appcept may be named and described by including, but not limited to: name variants, descriptive information, description variants, its relationships to other ttxs in a knowledge domain (e.g. in a classification hierarchy), its purlieus, cncpttrrts, information resources, and attribute values, or by combining a set of characteristics that includes what are here called needs or requirements. Each appcept may also be a tcept.","Because appcepts may be seen as tcepts, it is possible to use an appcept one day as an application without a solution, and at a later time as a tcept potentially satisfying the requirements of another appcept\u2014in other words, an appcept, such as a \u2018display screen\u2019 needed to show the results of a computer program, would later be a tcept used as a part of a computer.","Because appcepts may be Application Domains, or may be one of the applications in an Application Domain, appcepts may form trees consisting of only appcepts, where one appcept, such as a domain, may be seen as encompassing several more specific applications and thus be a root. Also, a tree may be formed where an appcept not a domain is a root, and several domains may be leaves.","Special relationships may exist between appcepts and tcepts to show that the tcept may be a solution for the application. These include but are not limited to imputed associations based upon \u201capplication suitability matching\u201d, gap relationships, roadblock relationships, derived value relationships, and dependency relationships.","Appcepts and their connections to tcepts are one example of a structure used for determining predictions regarding one type of cnxpt because of relationships with another type of cnxpt.","Keyword","As used herein, the term \u201ckeywords\u201d or \u201ckeyword phrases\u201d refer to phrases found in, including but not limited to: info-item descriptions; info-item names; queries; information resources, collected to serve to index other information or provide a basis for semantic distance calculation or syntactic analysis. Keyword phrases may be thesaurus entries. Keywords and keyword phrases are not considered to be ttxs in that they are not described in the CMM unless they are also included into a thesaurus made for viewing by users. The keywords phrases may significantly overlap in similarity of naming to other ttxs, but no significance should be attached to this overlap. Use of information collected regarding keywords may, in one embodiment, be useful in populating information in a cnxpt regarding a ttx.","Purlieu\u2192Represented by Purxpt","As used herein, the term \u201cpurlieu\u201d refers to a context either in time or in some other aspect or regime. A horizon purlieu is a timeframe for which to determine or relate an expected state of gestation of a tcept in the future or past. A geographical purlieu might state that tcepts are useful in a region. A stage of development purlieu might state that tcepts are very new or, alternatively, already a product. A patent effectiveness period provides a basis for a purlieu for a technology cnxpt.","Trait\u2192Cncpttrrt\u2192Represented by Trxrt","As used herein, the term \u201ctrait\u201d or \u201cCncpttrrt\u201d refers to an assertion regarding a ttx, including, but not limited to: discrete value attributal information or descriptive information. Specializations of cncpttrrts include, but are not limited to: consignment data, features, needs, or requirements.","The cncpttrrts may significantly overlap in similarity of naming to other cncpttrrts and ttxs, but no significance should be attached to this overlap.","Info-Item","As used herein, the term \u201cinfo-item\u201d refers to a system data object or an attribute if used to refer to a specific form of data object. The term is equivalent to \u201cinformation item\u201d or \u201citem\u201d in the Topic Navigation Map Standard.","Some info-items may be locked to improve reliability of information and efficiency of operations. Note that this does not imply that a locked cnxpt may not have new hierarchical associations added to it, since hierarchical associations with a locked cnxpt (or txo) in the parent (supertype, predecessor, etc.) role may be added to the locked cnxpt (or hierarchical relationships for a locked txo).","Info-items for Ttxs, Topics, and Representing Other Information","Info-items fall into one or more categories generally of \u2018infrastructure\u2019, \u2018categorizable\u2019, \u2018displayable\u2019.","Topic Info-Item\u2192Txxo","As used herein, the term \u201ctxxo\u201d refers to a type of knowledge info-item as defined in the ISO's Topic Navigation Map Standard (TNMS) (ISO 13250) and is a symbol used within a topic map to represent one, and only one, subject. A txxo is a machine-processable representation of a unique, clearly identified, and non-ambiguous subject. The set of subjects that can be represented by txxos is not restricted in any way other than needed for civility and legality. Txxos can be used in the CMM to represent tangible things and things that have no tangible form at all, but txxos are not supported by most of the facilities of the CMM, since the \u201ctxo\u201d is available.","Txo Info-Item","As used herein, the term \u201ctxo\u201d refers to a type of stored knowledge info-item, that may be instantiated in the CMMDB, intended to represent one and only one tpx in order to allow statements to be made about the tpx, or a category of other tpxs in order to allow statements to be made about the tpxs in the category in general. Txos share some similarity to txxos, but a txo is not a \u2018txxo\u2019 as defined in the TNMS. A txo is a machine-processable object that is intended to represent a non-ambiguous tpx. Some specializations of txos, herein called cnxpts, while merely intended to represent non-ambiguous ttxs, are expected to represent less clearly delineated tpxs for the early portion of their existence. The set of tpxs that a txo may represent is not restricted in any way. Txos can be used to represent tangible things and things that have no tangible form at all.","Txos serve as \u2018Infrastructure Concepts\u2019 so that an info-item is available to represent a person, company, product, project, or some other entity not directly addressed or categorized as a cnxpt would be. Specializations of txos also provide for management of infrastructure of the system.","To avoid confusion, the mapping between tpx\u2014txo, and ttx\u2014cnxpt are distinguished. To conform with the standards, here we formally uses the name txxo where the standard would use the term \u2018topic link\u2019 and the name tpx where the standard uses the term \u2018subject\u2019. While topic maps have no predefined set of infxtypxs because they are not domain-specific, in one embodiment, the CMMDB relies upon a number of predefined infxtypxs: cnxpts are defined to be representatives of ttxs.","In the CMM, txos provide a structure for the system, while cnxpts are used to represent user domain data. Specializations of txos represent, including but not limited to: scopxs, infxtypxs, irxts, comxos, rexos, fxxt specifications, data sets, result sets, rsxitems, goals, query scripts, methodologies, analytics, workflows, workflow \u2018To Do\u2019 items.","Cnxpt Info-Item\u2192Cnxpt","As used herein, the term \u201ccnxpt\u201d refers to a type of knowledge info-item that represents a ttx. The invisible heart of every cnxpt is the ttx that its author had in mind when it was created. A cnxpt is more a container for an idea or the placeholder for an idea.","Cnxpts also represent ttx categories. Each cnxpt may additionally be described by its relationships to other cnxpts in a categorization or classification structure, and by its infxtypx, scopxs, purlieus, cncpttrrts, characteristics, and attribute values. Cnxpts are restricted specializations of txos, designated by a infxtypx.","In one embodiment, a cnxpt is merely intended to represent a unique, clearly identified, and non-ambiguous ttx.

Axpts represent perceptions of, including but not limited to: an application domain, product domain, product line, a generic market, a benefit from technology, a problem that a tcept could solve, a purpose for use of technology, a grouping of requirements that a tcept should address, or a mere bundle of needs. Each axpt may be named, and may be described by one or more of: a textual description; an abstract; by its relationships to other axpts, txpts, tplxpts, or core asset descriptions; purlieus; or by its cncpttrrts (here often referred to as requirements or needs), or attribute values. Appcepts are often considered to be tcepts because the application, if solved, could be utilized to solve a \u2018larger\u2019 problem, and thus appcepts may be also and additionally described as tcepts are described, and may be converted to tcepts or play the role of tcepts in various contexts.","TPL Cnxpt Info-Item\u2192Tplxpt","As used herein, the term \u201ctplxpt\u201d refers to a type of stored knowledge info-item that may be instantiated in the CMMDB and represents a TPL.

A horizon purxpt is a CMM info-item representing a timeframe for which to determine or relate an expected state of gestation of a tcept in the future or past.","Purxpts may be related to cnxpts due to user suggested purlieu relationships.","Purxpts are specializations of txos. Characteristics of purxpts include but are not limited to named value attributal information, textual descriptive information, and information resources. Purxpts provide greater flexibility than merely relying upon attributes held within the cnxpt for stating contexts, since the purlieu may be specified for multiple cnxpts, may have a scopx different from the cnxpt, and many purxpts may be related to a single cnxpt, representing different contexts that a cnxpt is related to.","Purxpts may participate in linear lists and hierarchies in the same nature as cnxpts and other specializations of cnxpts normally do. Horizon purxpts are arranged in a list or hierarchy by directed temporal order relationships and undirected concurrent relationships.","Trait Info-Item\u2192Trxrt","As used herein, the term \u201cTrxrt\u201d refers to a type of stored knowledge info-item that may be instantiated in the CMMDB and represent cncpttrrts. Trxrts are specializations of txos and represent cncpttrrts. Characteristics of Trxrts include but are not limited to named value attributal information, textual descriptive information, and information resources. Trxrts provide greater flexibility than merely relying upon attributes held within the cnxpt, since the cncpttrrt may be specified for multiple cnxpts, may have a scopx different from the cnxpt, and many cncpttrrts of the same type, possibly having different scopxs, may be related to a single cnxpt.","In one embodiment, cnxpts may have cncpttrrts because more is known about specific aspect of a cnxpt, and that specific aspect may be characterized in a self-contained manner.","While trxrts are specializations of txos, trxrts are not considered to participate in hierarchies in the same nature as cnxpts and other specializations of txo do. That said, nothing here limits the trxrts to be treated as other txos or from being involved in hierarchies which consist of only trxrts.","For tcepts, features are represented by specializations of trxrts known as feature trxrts. The feature trxrt should be tightly associated with a cnxpt in the CMMDB to specifically state that the cnxpt has a specific feature. A single feature trxrt may be related to more than one specific cnxpt, showing that two different tcepts have the same feature.","In one embodiment, requirements may be tightly associated with an appcept cnxpt in the CMMDB to specifically state that a specific need or requirement is or should be fulfilled by the appcept. These requirements are represented by specializations of trxrts known as requirements trxrts. A single requirements trxrt may be related to more than one specific appcept, showing that two different appcepts have the same requirement.","Authors of trxrt descriptions may make additional statements or otherwise improve on the description and attribute values. Care must be taken to allow for notification to other users making comments about a trxrt or users initiating relationship connecting a trxrt to a cnxpt that the trxrt has been changed, so votes about a trxrt are threaded additions to the trxrt, and comments may be changed by an author. Comments and change histories are provided as a collaboration blog.","Consortium Txo->Conxtv","As used herein, the term \u201cconxtv\u201d refers to a type of knowledge info-item that represents an innovation consortium. It is a specialization of a txo. Conxtvs do not participate in hierarchies.","Registration Txo\u2014rexo","As used herein, the term \u201crexo\u201d refers to a type of knowledge info-item that represents registration associated with a ttx. It is a specialization of a txo. Rexos are further specialized by infxtypxs into info-items representing, including but not limited to: people, companies, business plans, portfolios, portfolio items. Rexos do not participate in hierarchies.","Community Txo\u2014comxo","As used herein, the term \u201ccomxo\u201d refers to a type of knowledge info-item that represents a Community. It is a specialization of a txo. Comxos are further specialized by infxtypxs into info-items representing, including but not limited to: interest based communities, investment communities, ecosystem communities. Comxos may participate in hierarchies of comxos. Consortia, companies and individuals can participate in communities.","Product Txo","As used herein, the term \u201cproduct txo\u201d refers to a type of knowledge info-item that represents a product. Product txos may participate in hierarchies of product txos.","Dxos","Dxos, defined above, are info-items of a general nature used for display control. Dxos may participate in hierarchies of dxos.","Info-Item Object Inheritance Hierarchy","As used herein, the term \u201cinfo-item object inheritance hierarchy\u201d refers to an ordered set of info-item subclasses and superclasses, where the superclass-subclass relationship shows that the definition of the subclass is a specialization of the superclass, or the subclass is \u201ca kind of\u201d or \u201cinstance of\u201d its superclass. The objects of the subclass thus behave, subject to the restrictions of the specialization, like objects of the superclass. Here, the subclasses of the root superclass txo include but are not limited to: scopxs, infxtypx, fxxt specifications, data sets, result sets, rsxitems, query scripts, methodologies, analytics, workflows, workflow \u2018To Do\u2019 items, goals, cnxpts, conxtv, and irxts. The subclasses of the superclass cnxpt include but are not limited to: kwxs, purxpts, trxrts, txpts, and axpts. The subclasses of the superclass txpt include but are not limited to: axpt.","Information Resource","As used herein, the term \u201cinformation resource\u201d refers generally to, including but not limited to: a \u201cnetwork retrievable information resource\u201d, or any internal resource that is useful as an information resource. It is not a \u2018resource\u2019 as defined in RDF (see RFC 2396). An information resource, if still available at its recorded address and not altered, can be retrieved and displayed, but, importantly, its address can be used as a unique identity indicator. Both its address and, more efficiently, its assigned info-item identifier can be used for the purpose of automated merging. Information resources include, but are not limited to: documents, web pages, articles, diagrams, photos, hyperlinked pages, cached web pages, metadata regarding the documents or pages, etc. Information resources may be external or internal to the CMMDB.","Collateral Information Resource","As used herein, the term \u201ccollateral information resource\u201d refers generally to an information resource that tends to explain a ttx or is at least considered relevant to the ttx. The information resource is similar to an \u201caddressable subject\u201d (in the TNMS) that enables \u201csubject identity\u201d but the collateral information resource cannot be relied upon to rise to the ability of a TNMS \u201csubject indicator\u201d to be \u201ca resource that is intended . . . to provide a positive, unambiguous indication of the identity of a subject.\u201d Nevertheless, in one embodiment, the collateral information resource is considered to be a \u201csubject indicator\u201d here, useful as an identity indicator. The collateral information resource is represented by a stored info-item called an irxt. Irxts are linked with cnxpts by occurrence relationships.","Information Resource Info-Item\u2192Irxt","As used herein, the term \u201cirxt\u201d refers to a type of knowledge info-item that represents an information resource. It is a specialization of a txo. Irxts serve as surrogates or placeholders for, including but not limited to: externally or internally held collateral information resources; internal resources which serve additionally as information resources.","Irxts are used to maintain identity by reference. When an irxt is used to represent a resource that already has its own unique URI, that URI can be used as an identity indicator of the txo having an occurrence relationship with the irxt. In the topic map standard, this form of identity indicator is closest in meaning to a subject locator if the indicator specifically defines the tpx, or a subject indicator if it is merely relevant. Here the addressability of the irxt itself, the info-item identifier, is used to provide a surrogate of the subject locator address or subject indicator. The info-item identifier address is used in an subject identifier occurrence relationship role. Irxts may participate in hierarchies of irxts where an information resource is available in separately locatable sections.","Internal Resources Serving as Information Resources","As used herein, the term \u201cinternal resource serving as an information resource\u201d refers generally to an item stored in the system knowledge base that tends to be relevant in describing a ttx. Examples include, but are not limited to: a document registered by a user to explain his business idea (medium weighting); resumes of individuals in the field (low weighing); thesaurus listing (relevance weighting); registered \u2018consortium\u2019 mission statement (very high weighting); idea contest entries (weightings based upon ranking in contest); interest statements (relevance ranking weighting based upon readership); blog entries commenting on an information resource or the ttx; Class, Meetup, Event, Conference descriptions (medium weightings depending upon number of experts viewing event listing).","Infrastructure Software","As used herein, the term \u201cinfrastructure software\u201d refers generally to programming, documentation, rules, configuration settings and configuration policies, and more specifically to framework components. Framework components in combination enable the operation of the system apparatus. Application elements and analytics are invoked by infrastructure software. Infrastructure software, when deployed to the various components of the framework, customize and configure the framework to enable information entry, retrieval, and editing; to manage data storage, to communicate and to manage communications with other framework components, and to display information to or to receive information from the user.","Innovation Consortium Contributor","As used herein, the term \u201cinnovation consortium contributor\u201d refers to a person who wishes to contribute ideas or other intellectual input for an ownership proportion of the proceeds from licenses of a tcept may seek to participate in an Innovation Consortium.","Innovation Consortium Investor","As used herein, the term \u201cinnovation consortium investor\u201d refers to a person who wishes to invest money for an ownership proportion of the proceeds from licenses of a ttx by seeking to invest in an innovation consortium.","Interest Information","As used herein, the term \u201cinterest information\u201d refers to the collected information on use of the system, including but not limited to interest shown in: ttxs visited, relationships traversed. Interest information is collected in interest relationship records.","Innovation Investment Pool","As used herein, the term \u201cinnovation investment pool\u201d or \u201cinvestment pool\u201d refers to a securitization mechanism, governance rules, reporting structures, and market that 1) transfers a future right in the value of an idea to the pool; 2) transfers present value or a promise to develop an invention to the inventor; 3) transfers a determinable amount of risk to the pool; 4) acts as a shield to isolate the pool of assets from selling inventors or their assignees; 5) acts as a shield between investors and the sellers; 6) makes a particular investor's ownership in the pool transferrable without regard to the pool's ownership of a property right in any particular invention in the pool; 7) establishes any needed legal structure for the pool; 8) provides for value (bid\/ask) reporting, investment participation transfers, and sales transactions. The effect of this process is that a number of positions in ideas may be bundled and the bundle offered to investors in a market for price determination, creating the market, and letting inventors obtain liquidity early on.","Prediction by Investment Pool","To be sustainable, users must enter new ideas. Incentives are provide to the users to do so, one of which is that they can determine that that their idea is or is not \u2018known\u2019 (the user confirms to the system that the idea is not known). At that point, some prediction of when the \u2018parent\u2019 cnxpt will come about and some prediction of its applications' value probably exist, and that prediction can be inherited by the new idea, with an \u2018incremental\u2019 period added on and a decreased value (the other sub-types of the category have value too).","Funding is also an incentive. Sustainability requires vetting of the idea, to qualify it for investment. Crowd sourcing is appropriate to this, so long as the system does not misinform users to a point where they blindly trust the mechanism. Investment pool methodologies provide a user learning and self-evaluation tools to allow them to graduate to higher level pools, leaving behind a trail of documentation for further comparison and qualification. Ideas are later evaluated by trusted others, allowing graduation from very low level investment pools to higher ones. Entities (the assignee) can be formed and their value can be determined in an options market style by the negotiation process connected with graduation. The investment pools are milestone specific. When the graduation occurs, a negotiation takes place, giving a value for an entity at that point in time. These negotiations are extremely loosey-goosey at the lowest level, and much tighter in higher levels of investment pools. The results from these predictions are combined with the results of prior predictions for the higher level categories around the technology, and with predictions about what applications of the technology would have, and a better prediction of value and time of fruition are formed.","The prediction of the higher levels (the categories, and applications) thus also help to form a basis for values of the new ideas and in the investment pools based upon them. It generates new interest because of the excitement in specific markets. The predictions of the past give presumptions to the predictions of the future (incremental ideas) and thus also the value of an investment pool (where other factors are also considered). It does not matter that some pools are charitable, are \u2018virtual games\u2019, or are \u2018test markets\u2019. Each can cause a prediction and the ones where real money are involved are \u2018market based\u2019 predictions with a higher probability of being accurate.","By the time that an \u2018entity\u2019 gets to the investment pool level just below the \u2018Crowd Funding\u2019 (under JOBs act) stage, an understanding of their value, their positioning versus others, their amount of progress made, etc. will be in the system, including documentation, level of communication, etc. This allows for the \u2018vetting\u2019 and qualification required by the law.","Investment; Markets; Exchanges","Markets","Markets for very early valuation of technologies and for rapid creation of liquidity. Overall, the exchanges and markets comprise options markets for price setting of innovations by market value estimation and negotiation.","Real-Money Exchange","The real-money exchange provides a real-life market for valuing and securitizing ideas. By submitting a technology and providing an ownership assignment, the owner 1) gains assistance in establishing a business entity around the innovation; 2) obtains an ownership position in a business entity; 3) allocates a part ownership in an entity to a pool managing special purpose vehicle; 4) obtains assistance available only for pool members; 5) obtains objectives to meet to progress into higher value pools where greater liquidity becomes available along with opportunities for greater investment or transfer.","Prediction Gaming Virtual Value Market","The Prediction Gaming Market is a shadow (or virtual) market for playing an investment game. The range of technologies for which an investment may be made is much wider than those available in the real-money exchange. Shadow markets assist the real-money markets in valuation establishment by establishing rough valuations earlier in the innovation lifecycle.","Prediction Gaming Market","The Prediction Gaming Market is a speculative or betting market created to make verifiable predictions on outcomes, based upon the game. Market participants bet by answering questions like: \u201cWhat will the future value of a technology be at gate \u2018X\u2019.\u201d \u201cWhich tcept do you think will first satisfy the requirements stated by this appcept?\u201d etc. and models predict the outcomes based upon wisdom of crowds input and exchange activity. Assets are cash values tied to specific outcomes (e.g., Tcept X will win by satisfying the need) or parameters (e.g., appcept Y represents $Z revenue in the horizon 4 years from now). The current market prices are interpreted as predictions of the probability of the event or the expected value of the parameter.","Other Markets","The tech transfer market offers the ability to advertise, buy, sell and license patents. This makes the ownership of patents more liquid, thereby creating incentives to innovate and patent.","Aggregating patents in the hands of specialized licensing companies facilitates access to technology by more efficiently organizing ownership of patent rights.","Key Encryption Process","As used herein, the term \u201ckey encryption process\u201d refers to a security procedure in which a translation from a unique internal format database ID for an info-item to a unique external (export) ID occurs at the central system, and involves an obfuscation process carried out on info-item identifiers (unique ID identifiers) or other system identity \u2018keys\u2019 to cut-off the ability to recombine exported data sets into a re-creation of the central CMMDB.","Keyword Index","As used herein, the term \u201ckeyword index\u201d refers to a list of phrases found in, including but not limited to: info-item descriptions; info-item names; queries; information resources, and that serves as an index for the referenced information. Keyword phrases are thesaurus entries. A keyword phrase in the list is represented by a kwx specialization of a txo.","Locale","As used herein, the term \u201clocale\u201d refers to an area of the map formed from one fxxt analysis.","Mannerism","As used herein, the term \u201cmannerism\u201d refers to actions dxos may perform at certain or random times. The actions may be in reaction to a user's action or to a system or external event.","Map","As used herein, the term \u201cmap\u201d refers both to the visualizations which result from the mapping process, as well as the information held in the CMM which is used as a basis for the mapping process. A fxxt may be used to provide context for the organization of the map. A list of tpx info-items may be used as a top level for a map in a portfolio.","Ttx Map","As used herein, the term \u201cttx map\u201d refers to a visual aid for understanding ttxs and their interrelationships as developed from and based upon the contents of the CMMDB by at least one Ttx Mapping Visualization Process.","Result Set Map, Selection Set Map","As used herein, the term \u201cResult Set Map Object\u201d or \u201cSelection Set Map Object\u201d refer to visual aids for understanding info-items and their interrelationships as developed from and based upon the contents of the CMMDB by at least one Set Mapping Visualization Process.","Area Map","As used herein, the term \u201cArea Map Object\u201d refers to visual aids for understanding info-items and their interrelationships as developed from and based upon the contents of the CMMDB by at least one Set Mapping Visualization Process operating upon an Area of Consideration or an Area of Interest.","Portfolio Map","As used herein, the term \u201cPortfolio Map\u201d refers to visual aids for understanding info-items and their interrelationships. Each portfolio is a collection of cnxpts of a set type marked with a set fxxt for the portfolio. The highest level of the portfolio is a list of tpx info-items. The cnxpts related to a tpx info-item in the list and within the fxxt of the portfolio are in a map accessible via the list item. Each portfolio fxxt is \u2018built\u2019 starting with this initial collection and augmented, as specified in the fxxt specification, with other info-items. The map formed contains all of the cnxpts related to the list items and in the fxxt, but is subdivided according to the list to show the cnxpts by the list items.","Mapping","As used herein, the term \u201cmapping\u201d refers to the process of forming a textual or graphic image to convey information about ttxs, other dxos, and the relationships between them. The visualization of the map is a communications medium that provides a sense of co-location based upon an underlying nearness of the pictured ttxs and display objects based upon the strength of relationships between the cnxpts or dxos representing the displayed objects. The map user \u201creads\u201d the visualization of the map and interprets its information content in the context of his or her own objectives and knowledge of the knowledge domain and the real or abstract relationships that the map is intended to describe. In this way, the visualization of the map is an outward manifestation of the map, so the visualization of the map is a map. For this reason, here the use of the word map refers both to the information prior to the mapping process and the result.","Maps and Communication","Map Development for User Expectations","To form a map, spatial relationships among the individual pieces of data have to be set, since the ttxs have no geographic nature. The positions are developed based upon the relationship information present and by fxxt analysis, Merger and Comparison, and ontology reduction.","Focusing can be accomplished in many ways. When contexts are categories and the categories have sub-categories, then the focusing can be accomplished by moving from a display of the categories to a display of one (or more) category's sub-categories.","When two or more map visualizations are displayed by a user, the user may select a cnxpt info-item on one map and \u201csync\u201d one or more other visualizations in order to move the focus of display of the other map to be the cnxpt selected on the first, regardless of the fxxt of the other map. If that cnxpt is not on the other map, the focus is moved to a cnxpt in the fxxt of the other map where the cnxpt is a parent of the selected cnxpt in the first map. If the focus cannot be moved because a cnxpt cannot be found to serve as the focus, then the user is informed. Other info-items may be focused upon.","Different maps may be formed for different fxxts. Multiple types of visualizations provide for the display of the various relationships held in the Map. Each visualization type emphasizes a certain set of relationships between cnxpts as defined by the fxxt specification. A visualization of cnxpts based upon nation of invention will be very different from a visualization of cnxpts ordered by field of study only (unless, of course, the countries are focused on specific technologies and monopolize research on them). Each visualization type generalizes the information available from the Map, omitting certain features from the display to simplify and rapidly convey the context of the content.","Maps in this System","In one embodiment, the map can be re-arranged and new objects can be created, or \u2018concretized\u2019. Context-clicking anywhere on the map screen allows the addition of a new ttx, either by starting a goal, or new query within a goal, or by providing a shell for a ttx to be described. It is also possible to create mashups on the visualizations, adding, including but not limited to: knowledge in the form of links, videos, text, web pages, figures, tables, graphics and sound. Ttxs are linked easily to other ttxs to define relationships when the user drags them into another map or list in another window. This information is entered into the CMMDB that the map is derived from, so the map is updated.","In one embodiment, maps can be shared and collaborated upon. View positions and tours (animations showing the process of navigation) of maps may be sent to other users. Written collaboration discussions are retained by the use of votes and discussion threads that can be seen reflected on the map.","Maps by Age","Maps are based upon data from a fxxt as extracted from the CMMDB. In an example of a fxxt, in one embodiment, a map of ttxs anticipated to exist at a set time in the future may be available. As an example of the utilization of dxo personalities and graphical representations, this same map may be displayed in a way that the user will see mannerisms manifested by the personalities of the dxos on the visualization in a way that actions taken by the user within the visualization may cause reactions from the dxos.","Value of Maps","The work of many people goes into each map. Since the map is constructed from data that is obtained from many sources, only small additions to the map (through the CMMDB) will have to be constructed by any individual. This is a form of reuse of prior contributor's efforts.","Data can be collected by importing other categorizations and rationally merging it with existing conceptual information based upon the expertise weighted voting and consensus facility. Maps can be exported for use in organizing other work and for driving drill down analysis in areas such as competitive intelligence and prior art studies.","Mapping by Ttx and Ttx Mapping Design Process","As used herein, the term \u201cttx mapping\u201d and \u201cttx mapping design process\u201d refer to a specific design process for developing visual aids for understanding ttxs and their interrelationships. In one embodiment, the Ttx Mapping Design Process will produce one or more designs for visualizations of the ttxs in the CMM, involving but not limited to: dxo positioning, dxo behavior, visualization selection, and visualization content design. In one embodiment, the Ttx Mapping Design Process will produce one or more designs for visualizations of the cnxpts in the CMMDB.","Mapping Relationship","As used herein, the term \u201cmapping relationship\u201d or \u201cmapping function\u201d serves similarly to the mathematical concept of function. A mapping relationship can be thought of as an edge that is also a computing stage that takes an input and produces a single output. For example, a temperature mapping relationship takes an object as input and returns the temperature of that object. A mapping relationship that represents a function that could return multiple objects can instead return a single object representing a single set containing those objects. Mapping relationships, like other relationships, associate two txo info-items.","Traditional mapping relationships have directionality to show that they perform a computation from one object to another, but this directedness is not presumed in this invention, since fxxt specifications may provide roll-ups of various natures and mapping relationships may be used to effect them, resulting in a different directionality in different fxxts.","Matching, Merger and Comparison","As used herein, the term \u201cmatching, merger and comparison\u201d refers to the three main processes for automatically determining semantic closeness and reducing the number of info-items a user would see as redundant in a map derived from the CMM. When multiple users concretize ttxs, inevitably there will be redundancy. It may be due to language, laziness, low expertise, etc., but the important contributions users make will usually contain indications of the differences in the ttxs. These differences, or disagreements must be addressed over time, without delaying a user in their work. The automatic operations attempt preliminary actions to work with or around the less than perfect information, and also prepare \u2018ticklers\u2019 or \u2018to do\u2019 items to provide an opportunity to have a human (one of the crowd) work to review the differences to repair them at a later time.","Merger","As used herein, the term \u201cmerger\u201d or \u201ctxo merger\u201d refers to the process of merging two info-items (esp. txos) that are known to represent the same \u2018thing\u2019 (esp. the same tpx). The CMMSYS facilitates merging of info-items without requiring the merged info-items to be copied or modified. Merging occurs prior to and without regard to fxxt analysis.","Identifying when two infrastructure txos represent the same tpx is achieved by applying heuristics without weights and without regard to fxxts:\n\n","Matching","As used herein, the term \u201cmatching\u201d refers generally to the setting of a value for the closeness of in meaning between two info-items of the same type to provide an identity indicator.","Trait and Suitability Matching","As used herein, the term \u201ctrait matching\u201d or specifically \u201ccncpttrrts matching\u201d refers generally to the setting of a value for the closeness in meaning between two cncpttrrts. In one embodiment, in the included specializations called \u201csimilarity matching\u201d or the deeper specialization \u201cfeature matching\u201d, two cncpttrrts are close if they are semantically similar, such as where a cncpttrrt of a car may be \u2018tan\u2019, while another car may be \u2018light brown\u2019, and those cncpttrrts would thus be given a high value for closeness. In one embodiment, in the specialization called \u201csuitability matching\u201d or \u201capplication suitability matching\u201d, closeness is measured by satisfaction rather than similarity. As an example, where an appcept calls for high temperature resistance, and a feature cncpttrrt of a candidate tcept states that the components made from that tcept will melt at room temperature, the trxrt representing the requirement and the feature trxrt represent the tcept's ability will have a very low \u2018closeness\u2019 relationship to show that feature fails to meet or satisfy the requirement even though the trxrts each refer to operating temperature.","In one embodiment, where multiple trxrts of a single ttx are similar, as found by users or automatically, a suggestion to users to merge the two trxrts is generated.","In one embodiment, in the specialization called \u201ctpx trait matching\u201d, a trait of an infrastructure txo is compared against a trait of another txo.","Trait and TPL Matching","As used herein, the term \u201cTPL matching\u201d refers generally to the setting of a value for the closeness of an implementation of a technology to a design criterion caused by addressing a TPL (theory, principle, or law of science). In one embodiment, in the included specializations called \u201cconformance to science\u201d, two cncpttrrts are close if the technology trait addressed with significant care a scientific principle and achieved the implemented design to maximize performance with that scientific principle in mind regardless of whether other scientific constraints were also considered in the implementation. An example is the design of a wing where the principles of aerodynamics available at a specific timeframe were considered. A match would exist between the traits of the wing such as the surface design and specific principles of aerodynamics. A match might not exist or be considered strong between a principle of aerodynamics that was disruptive to the field and was discovered far after the design of the wing occurred. In one embodiment, in the specialization called \u201cconformance to science\u201d, closeness is measured by satisfaction rather than similarity. As an example, where an law of science describes high speed flight and a plane is ill-designed for it due to other factors such as a requirement for low fuel consumption, the trxrt representing the \u201cconformance to science\u201d and the feature trxrt represent the tcept's ability to fly fast will have a very low \u2018closeness\u2019 relationship to show that feature was not designed to answer the scientific principle.","Semantic Matching","As used herein, the term \u201csemantic matching\u201d refers generally matching of info-items on the basis of semantic distance calculations on their descriptions. Where the descriptions of two ttxs are very close semantically, then the two are matched, and, in one embodiment, a suggestion to users to merge the two ttxs is generated.","Interest Matching","As used herein, the term \u201cinterest matching\u201d refers generally to assessing the closeness of two ttxs where a number of users who have stated a similar search goal normally visited a specific set of ttxs, implying that they found that the specific set of ttxs were apparently relevant to their goal. Where users often visit, somewhat equally, one or another of two ttxs after stating similar goals, in one embodiment, a suggestion to users to merge the two ttxs is generated.","Comparison","As used herein, the term \u201ccomparison\u201d, \u201ccnxpt merger\u201d or \u201ccnxpt comparison\u201d refers to the process of determining if two cnxpts represent the same ttx. Comparison is based upon a resolved fxxt (a derived ontology resulting from a fxxt analysis). Because of the dependence upon the fxxt analysis process, it is impossible to state that two cnxpts represent the same ttx in all circumstances unless all fxxts would allow that conclusion.","In one embodiment, the CMMDB will, at one point or another, contain info-items that appear to represent the same ttx. In one embodiment, the CMMDB will, at one point or another, contain occurrences related to two or more info-items. The info-items in each case might appropriately be merged, or it may be premature to merge the info-items until it is quite clear that no differential in meaning represented is present.","In one embodiment, a single cnxpt results from combining the characteristics of the two cnxpts only if all of the characteristics are the same, but where a substantial disagreement is seen regarding the characteristics of a cnxpt, a suggestion is made that the cnxpt be split into three cnxpts, where one parent is formed from the characteristics in the intersection of characteristics (those agreed upon), and two child cnxpts having the characteristics in dispute on each side.","The matching process is completed prior to comparison, for any given comparison.","Visualization Structuring Propositional Relationships","As used herein, the term \u201cVisualization Structuring Propositional Relationships\u201d refers generally to a system of relationships needed to extract a visualization from the CMM. Each knowledge domain has more specific relationships, but those relationships, when summarized, must provide a set of specific relationships:\n\n","Knowledge Domain Centric Visualization Structuring Propositional Relationships","Knowledge Domain Centric Visualization Structuring Propositional Relationships in the CMM for technology mapping will at least include the following types:\n\n","Meta-Search","As used herein, the term \u201cMeta-search\u201d refers to getting the best combined results from a variety of search engines. Meta-searches allow users to find relevant information from, including but not limited to: leading search engines (Google, Yahoo! Search, and Bing), specialty engines, internal knowledge bases, internal analytics, internet servers, cloud servers, database providers, newsgroups, patent databases, local files, internal drives, file servers, and corporate sources. The meta-search engine, in one embodiment, returns information resources or links to information resources, as well as information resource metadata. In one embodiment, meta-searches are used within queries.","In one embodiment, the meta-search will result in a ranking of the rsxitems in the result set according to relevance, and possibly according to which search engine or database the rsxitem was found in. In one embodiment, the meta-search will combine, and raise the relevance of duplicates in the result set, and the most relevant rsxitems will be sorted to appear at the top of a result set display for culling.","In one embodiment, more complex \u2018meta-searches\u2019 return result sets consisting of cnxpts and information resources which are called \u2018scanning hits\u2019, and which are information resources which previously existed in the CMMDB or were formed to reference newly found external information resources (in other words, locators of external resources newly found or already known) from one or more search engines. The \u2018scanning hits\u2019 rsxitems are all related as occurrences to the goal through the result set of the meta-search. The cnxpts are all related as associations to the goal through the result set of the meta-search.","In one embodiment, meta-searches include structured or unstructured data queries, or information resource queries.","Methodology","As used herein, the term \u201cmethodology\u201d refers generally to a system of methods used in a particular area of study or to complete a specific task. A methodology entails a description of a generic process for carrying out a coherent concept or theory of a particular discipline or inquiry, or the rationale that underlies a particular study. Here, it provides a set of defined steps for one or more users to carry out to achieve a specific status, level of understanding, or result, and may support workflow.","In one embodiment, users would pay for the steps in a methodology and the system would assist them by workflow management, such as \u2018tasks\u2019 and \u2018status\u2019. The fees would be for the use of the methodology or for costs associated with submissions of documents or services.","Methodologies provide a framework to each user and explain the \u2018best practice\u2019 approach to using the system, assist in tracking their work and incentivize them to keep going, measure their use, set their expectations, and do training.","Examples of methodologies include but are not limited to:\n\n","Mid-Tier","As used herein, the term \u201cmid-tier\u201d refers to a computer system dedicated to a customer to allow the customer to retain private data related to and usable in conjunction with the data in the CMMDB. The data in the mid-tier system is under the company's control, and may be released to the central system only when the company chooses to do so. It may include private information resources which may be searched and which may become collateral information resources represented in the CMMDB.","Modeling and Outcomes","Outcome","As used herein, the term \u201coutcomes\u201d refer to specifications of modeling conditions that, if met, imply that the outcome will occur. Outcomes provide a result name for calculations for expected monetary values, decision analysis with risk\/reward, and competitive scenario gaming. The likelihood of the actuality of the state of the future (or of who will prevail) is calculated based upon the base data and base assumptions, fxxt definitions, fxxt summarizations, extraction descriptions, primitive's properties, primitive's associated spreadsheets, and \u2018Modeling Rule\u2019 descriptions.","Models","As used herein, the term \u201cmodel\u201d refers to a prescribed framework for calculating an economic, benefit, or other form of value or prediction. The activity includes planning, constructing, and executing the process for automatically completing the analysis.","Modeling Rules","As used herein, the term \u201cmodeling rule\u201d refers to a formula for calculating, including but not limited to compute: the weight of the relationship, expected monetary values, decision analysis with risk\/reward, and competitive scenario gaming, based upon CMM data to which they are associated with.","Modeling Rules provide a modeling structure. The definitions may be associated with, including but not limited to: txos, relationships, cnxpts, axpt, txpt, tplxpts, tcepts, appcepts, fields of science, dxos, as well as to spreadsheets attached to those info-items. These connections may be reconfigured to change the basis for the Modeling rule. Modeling Rules may be re-associated to change the basis for the Modeling Rule.","The formulas specified will generally follow the style used for spreadsheet formulas, where relationship infxtypx reference iterators are similar to range specifications and specify, including, but not limited to a: relationship infxtypx, fxxts, scopxs, relationship role, relationship list; and cnxpt infxtypx references are similar to cell specifications and refer to, including, but not limited to: characteristic references, scopxs, cnxpt ranges, cnxpt lists, cnxpt characteristics, fxxts, txos, infxtypxs, txo characteristics, txo lists, and qualifications by txo characteristic.","Calculations are performed on the CMM data based upon, including but not limited to: base data and base assumptions, fxxt definitions, fxxt summarizations, extraction descriptions, primitive's properties, primitive's associated spreadsheets, and \u2018Modeling Rule\u2019 descriptions.","In one embodiment, relationships may be mapping functions that serve similarly to the mathematical concept of function.

Derivation trees are based upon derivation relationships between txos. Automatic re-computation based on dependencies among txos (cells) reduces the burden of invocation by users.","Fxxt Based","Fxxt based modeling rule formulas are applied on the relationships as mentioned, but note that depending upon the fxxt chosen, the relationships may apply in different directions depending upon how the Descendant Trees are formed, since directionality does not have to be stated on relationships of this nature, and the endpoint that is a child is determined from the result of the Spanning Tree operation for the Descendant Tree. That means that in one fxxt a sum of children could be of one set, while in another, the sum could be of another set of children.","Fxxt Specified","Modeling rule formulas for relationships may be specified to be applied on the relationships of an infxtypx globally, by scopx, or on a relationship directly (single relationship specific), by relationship scopx in fxxt specifications on a specific fxxt calculation step of the fxxt specification or globally for the fxxt.","Fxxt specified modeling rule formulas for cnxpts (or, in some cases, txos) may be specified to be applied on the cnxpts (txos) of an infxtypx globally, by scopx, or be specified for a type of cnxpt or a single cnxpt instance (txo) directly (single cnxpt (txo) specific), by scopx or infxtypx, or to be applied in fxxt specifications on a specific fxxt calculation step of the fxxt specification or globally for the fxxt.","Ontology Txo Constraint Modeling Rule Formulas","Constraints are rules that are declared once and then maintained by the system. Characteristics of ontology txos or relationships may be constrained by equations and inequalities.","Changes requested by users or the system which would cause the constraint to no longer be met would be blocked by the system and cause a to do list entry or a problem entry.","During calculations on the tree or summarizations of relationships, constraints may be used to, including but not limited to: force values, to nullify a characteristic, to remove an relationship or txo from inclusion or consideration, etc. The constraints will not be allowed to stop a calculation during a summarization or tree formation process for mapping.","Constraints may be either one-way (using single-direction data propagation) or multi-way (where data propagation occurs in both directions).","Fxxt Based","Fxxt based equality or inequality rule formulas are applied on the relationships as mentioned, but note that depending upon the fxxt chosen, the relationships may apply in different directions depending upon how the Descendant Trees are formed. In different fxxts a constraint would apply to different sets of children.","Fxxt Specified","Constraint equality or inequality formulas for relationships may be specified on the relationships by infxtypx globally, by scopx, or on a relationship directly (single relationship specific), by relationship scopx or by relationship in Fxxt Specifications on a specific fxxt calculation step of the Fxxt Specification or globally for the fxxt.","Constraint equality or inequality formulas for txos may be specified on the txos by infxtypx globally, by scopx, on a cnxpts (or in some cases, txos) directly (single cnxpt (txo) specific), by scopx or infxtypx in Fxxt Specifications on a specific fxxt calculation step of the Fxxt Specification or globally for the fxxt.","Operators Using Iterators on Objects","Iterators provide access and traversal control over a collection of objects.","Iterative Modeling Rule Formula for Txo Oriented Calculations","The system provides for iterator formulas on cnxpts (or in some cases, txos) such as:\n\n","Iterative Modeling Rules for Relationship Oriented Calculations","The system provides for iterative modeling rule formulas on relationships such as:\n\n","Naming","As used herein, the term \u201cname\u201d refers generally to zero or more labels for an info-item.

Default rules apply for use of other infxtypxd names where a base name, display name, or sort name is absent. Other application-specific name infxtypxs may be specified. In one embodiment, zero or more names of each infxtypx may be specified for an info-item.","Names may be marked as invisible or may be associated with an access control list (ACL) for controlling visibility.","Where names must serve as identity indicators, weights are imparted based upon the infxtypx of a name used for matching, or by fxxt specifications. Names may be voted upon, and vote weights are also used for matching and relevance. Weights so imparted are summarized by an algorithm which fairly states the weight so that no bias is created when a multitude of names exist for any given info-item.","In one embodiment, names are held in hierarchical structures, where at the root is the base name, if one exists, which has a string representation. A name hierarchy is also a container for any number of alternate forms (known as name variants) that may be specified for use in various contexts. Name variants may be the root of subtrees in the hierarchy. Names in the hierarchy that serve as the root of a tree or subtree represent the group of name variants below them. Position in the hierarchy affects the weighting of the name when used in matching, with base names receiving a significantly higher weight than those within the subtree. The alternate forms of a name may be, including but not limited to: string values; references to resources; representations such as icons or sound clips to be referenced as name variants. Base names and name variants can be given a scopx in which they are valid. In one embodiment, practical limits are imposed to constrain the size and depth of name hierarchies.","Txo Names","Normally tpxs have explicit names, since that makes them easier to talk about. However, tpxs don't always have names: goals need not be named, confidential and unpublishable tpxs need not have a visible name, tpxs may not have a name in every scopx.","The ability to be able to specify more than one txo name can be used to name tpx within different scopxs, such as language, style, domain, geographical area, historical period, etc. The scopx mechanism allows for the case of homonyms (where a single word is used to refer to two or more different ttxs).","In one embodiment, base names within the same scopx need not be unique.","Dxo Names","A dxo can have a name or more than one name.","In one embodiment, dxos have explicit user given names, since that makes them easier to talk about. However, dxos don't always have names: A simple cross reference, such as a hyperlink (more generally than mere \u201calias-hyperlink dxo\u201d) (\u201csee URL . . . \u201d) is considered to be a link dxo that has no (explicit) name.","Name Variant","As used herein, the term \u201cname variant\u201d refers generally to an alternative form of a name, optimized for a particular computational purpose, such as sorting or display or use in localization for a different language.","Relationship Names","Relationships may be named. As a default, the infxtypx of an association is used for its relationship name. The relationship does not directly have this name assigned. The scopx of a relationship is used as a qualifier of the display name as a default. Simple tpx cross references are considered to be a link that has no explicit name.","Bidirectional Association Names","As used herein, the term \u201cbidirectional name\u201d refers generally to a name for an association derived from the association infxtypx and scopx, and used to label or express the relationship in either direction and for each role.","Directed Association Names","As used herein, the term \u201cdirected name\u201d refers generally to a name for an association derived from the association infxtypx and scopx. For describing the endpoints, the role infxtypx of the \u2018from\u2019 role is appended when describing the \u2018from\u2019 ttx, or the role infxtypx of the \u2018to\u2019 role is appended when describing the \u2018to\u2019 ttx. So the \u201cemploys\u201d association with the role types \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d should have a name \u201cemployed by\u201d which is in the scopx of \u201cemployee\u201d.","Neighborhood","As used herein, the term \u201cneighborhood\u201d refers generally to a cognitive area of a CMM and thus includes the ttxs therein, which is near, in some semantic sense, an area or ttx that is under consideration, but does not necessarily include the ttx under consideration.","In addition, when used in the context of a CMMDB, an area of a virtual mapping and thus including the cnxpts therein, which is near, in some sense as defined by the user, an area or cnxpt that is under consideration, but does not necessarily include the cnxpt under consideration itself.","Occurrence","As used herein, the term \u201coccurrence\u201d refers to an information resource or another object or entity of some type that is relevant to the description of a ttx, trxrt, purxpt, or other info-item, and is related by an occurrence relationship to the cnxpt, trxrt, purxpt, or other txo representing the info-item.","Ontology","As used herein, the term \u201contology\u201d refers to a data structure of information where \u2018nodes\u2019 (here, \u2018txos\u2019) may be linked by \u2018edges\u2019 (here, \u2018relationships\u2019) to represent an N-dimensional knowledge domain and information regarding it.","Because ontologies do more than just control a vocabulary, they are thought of as knowledge representations. The oft-quoted definition of ontology is \u201cthe specification of one's conceptualization of a knowledge domain.\u201d","In one embodiment, the CMMDB is an ontology used to store the various categorizations in their various fxxts. Ontology nodes of this ontology may represent, including, but not limited to: txos, dxos, and the specializations of each.

The system will use viral marketing approaches to provide an ability for user to reach out appropriately, including, but not limited to:\n\n","Patent Preparation","As used herein, the term \u201cpatent preparation\u201d refers to the development of a mere idea into a patent application, including but not limited to: the development of the idea, its productization and commercialization, preparation of its patent application, fund raising. The effort may be eased by system staff that are licensed as patent agents, and may be paid by investments from the contributors or others wishing to share in the ownership.","Path","As used herein, the term \u201cpath\u201d refers to the ordered set of visits made by a user to ttxs in, including but not limited to: a navigation of a visualization, a reviewing of a result set, a review of an Area of Consideration or interest.","Placing","As used herein, the term \u201cplacing\u201d refers to the creation of a ttx by pointing to an unoccupied location on a visualization and stating that the ttx should exist at that location. \u201cPlacing\u201d also refers to the creation of a goal by pointing to an unoccupied location on a visualization and stating that the user believes that the ttx he is thinking about and which is the goal should be near that location or within the category.","Prediction","As used herein, the term \u201cprediction\u201d refers to the ability to determine a value that a user will find useful as an indicator of the strength, timing, probability, value, or some other relevant quantitative statement about the way things will happen in the future, or a probability of an outcome.","Here, prediction may result from, including but not limited to: a model or analytic, or a summarization of user inputs, or an analysis of a forest produced from a fxxt specification or the map resulting from it.","When the forest is analyzed, the prediction may stem from the structure forming the trees or the maps, or it may be based upon that structure but use data separate from the data used to form the trees or the maps. For instance, the prediction may be based upon the size of a display object after the formation of the map, or it may be based upon data not used to form the forest or the map but summarized or viewed in a certain way because of the structure of the map. An example of the former is the prediction of the gestational ordering of technologies, and an example of the latter is the prediction of value of a technology based upon the position of the technology plus its suitability for an application of technology where the added data is the strength of connections to appcepts from the leaf tcepts.","Predictions can be inherited, to some degree, from the predictions of the context where a cnxpt exists in a fxxt. This implies that a prediction for a cnxpt may be different for different fxxts because the context is different in a second fxxt. This provides a technique for determining an average or weighted average for the prediction based upon multi-fxxted analysis\u2014the analysis of multiple fxxt specifications. To calculate the weighted average, the fxxts used for a basis are selected and given a weighting coefficient and the total is summed and normalized. More specific algorithms are discussed below.","Predictive Intelligence","As used herein, the term \u201cpredictive intelligence\u201d refers to the ability to predict the future presence of a tcept. A system is more intelligent than another system if in a given time interval it can better predict if and when a tcept will appear or other related metrics such as whether more purchases of one product will be made than another. A group can then be said to exhibit collective intelligence if it can more accurately predict than the average of the members working individually. Prediction based upon a map of ttxs and true Wisdom of Crowds yields a \u2018collective best guess\u2019 of each technology horizon that evokes further opinion and refinement of near in dates and values as time passes:\n\n","Predictor","As used herein, the term \u201cpredictor\u201d refers to a weighted summarization of modeling formula results for a fxxt.","Prediction of Gestation Period","As used herein, the term \u201cgestation prediction\u201d or \u201cprediction of fruition\u201d refers to the calculation of how and when some element of \u201cthe\u201d future will, in fact, materialize, by calculating for a target tcept as a basis, including but not limited to: when the most recent productized predecessor of a predecessor tcept became real by when a product utilizing that tcept was delivered or when that tcept was used in production; what the patent status is for a predecessor or target tcept; what the research status is for a predecessor or target tcept; what the rate of innovation has been for the incremental innovations prior to and in the ancestry of the target tcept, and generating a timeline for the timing of gestations of the target and the predecessors between the known productized predecessor and the target tcept.","Accurate assessments of the probability that a ttx will become real are developed through teasing out predictors of a ttx's fruition and summarizing those predictors to a series of probabilities for timeframes, resulting in a best available overall prediction of the status of each tcept based upon a mass incremental characterization;","The nature or description of tcepts are not conjured by the mapping system any more than oil is generated by an oil field mapping system.","Prediction of gestation extends to prediction state of a tcept or the satisfaction level of an Appcept by, including but not limited to: predicting the state of a complex environment by predicting the inception or state of its components; predicting the state of the components of a complex environment by incremental extrapolation from predictions of its predecessors or from requirements as seen from successors.","Prediction by Space","As used herein, the term \u201cprediction by space\u201d refers to the calculation of value by space consumed on a map of tcepts. Space taken is related to innovation that has taken place in each area of technology, up to the horizon shown, or can be based upon, including but not limited to: interest shown, known investment made, market size per past product sales, predictions of satisfaction of appcepts, present market size according to current values for sales (market demand) of appcepts, future market size by estimates of demand for appcepts by planning horizon. The proportion of space allotted to a tcept, in specific fxxts, can be based upon, including but not limited to: value, interest shown, how well one tcept satisfies an appcept relative to other candidates, stage of gestation or stage of or other metrics. The resulting size for a tcept can be used as a basis for predicting, including but not limited to: future market demand, investment value, specific tcept future value, when a projection is available for the overall demand, funds available for investment, or of a metric such as GDP. The calculation is straight forward, where the proportion of space actually occupied by a tcept is multiplied by the projected metric for the total to be used. Roll-up is straightforward, by the ttx categories used in the fxxt.","The calculations are akin to those used to predict value of oil field prospects.","The calculation of predictions by space may require turning off or customization of the fxxt roll-up and positioning heuristics below.","Prediction of Satisfaction","As used herein, the term \u201cprediction of satisfaction\u201d refers to the calculation of the likelihood that a tcept will actually satisfy\/solve an appcept in a certain timeframe from Modal Logic possibility, probability, and necessity estimates as used to determine if a technology horizon will contain certain or other tcepts. The satisfaction predictions are used to generate weighted relationships used for later calculations of tcept display size relative to other candidates where the display size is to represent market share for a tcept based upon appcept market demand.","The satisfaction predictions may be generated from imputed suitability association in combination with user input data stating that a roadblock or a gap exists affecting the tcept, or that a value strength should be applied during the use of an appcept's value to determine the tcepts value, and interest data collected tending to elevate the value.","Prediction of Innovation Gap","As used herein, the term \u201cPrediction of Innovation Gap\u201d refers to the identifying of technological gaps to allow more pointed inspiration toward entrepreneurial activity, where a tcept is unavailable to fill the requirements of an appcept. Gaps can also be stated by users manifesting a belief that the tcept will not fulfill the requirements of the application for a specific reason.","Prediction of Innovation Gap By TPL","TPL methods and suggestion generation methods provide additional predictors for gap prediction. A lack of TPL or TRIZ method suggestions suggest a need for more innovation and thus specific gap areas. TRIZ \u2018Laws of Technical Systems Evolution\u2019 are methodologies also useful to predict how much innovation is not yet completed in a technical area.","Prediction of Tcept Roadblock","As used herein, the term \u201cPrediction of Tcept Roadblock\u201d refers to the identifying of tcepts failing to meet the requirements of an appcept even though anticipated. The roadblock may be stated by a user to manifest a belief that a tcept may not occur until a problem is solved, and the roadblock may be placed between any two tcepts, one or more of which have not come to fruition, so that the roadblock affecting the fulfillment of an appcept may be affected by a roadblock that is not connected to it but is connected to a predecessor technology.","Prediction of Value","As used herein, the term \u201cprediction of value\u201d refers to the calculation of, including but not limited to: product demand, investment expected return on value; investment value at a point in time; market price per unit; market share; in future tcepts relying upon the \u2018best available data\u2019 of the refined list of innovative future tcepts (cnxpts), including but not limited to: interest shown; negotiated transfer value; investment buy in prices; relationships to other cnxpts; stated user estimates of their, including but not limited to: value, status, progress; and related information to form a basis for prediction.","Prediction of Features Available","As used herein, the term \u201cprediction of features available\u201d refers to the process of producing a timeframe-based list of features implemented in a product or product line useful in, including but not limited to: comparing products over time; product line comparisons between competitors; satisfaction by a product line of: predicted market drivers, competing efforts, business objectives; and technology forecasts of expected future tcepts, by analyzing the commonality of cncpttrrts that two products or two tcepts share and the ways in which they vary at a point in time.","Prediction of Trends","As used herein, the term \u201cprediction of trends\u201d refers to the process of identifying and estimating predictions of technology trends regarding contextual areas of a complex environment based upon first predicting the state of being of related components. Example of trends include but are not limited to:\n\n","Prediction by Interest","As used herein, the term \u201cprediction by interest\u201d refers to the process of estimating the value of a technology by evaluating the interest shown in, including but not limited to: each technology, in applications of that technology (cnxpt), in applications related to the technology's predecessor cnxpts and the technology's category cnxpts (may be multiple levels of categorization). Interest is shown in a cnxpt (technology, application, or other) by, including but not limited to: finding of, searching for, querying for, or retrieval of data either inside the category cnxpt or the cnxpt itself; use of the cnxpt in a model; ideating within a category cnxpt; improving a cnxpt; discussing or participating in a community related to a cnxpt; investing in a pool related to a cnxpt; comparisons of cnxpt traits with axpt requirements; development status of the cnxpt; progress of entities formed from the cnxpt; negotiated pricing from investment vehicles in transfers of entity shares between vehicles; presence of articles, documents, blog entries, patents, discussions regarding the cnxpt; investments in the cnxpt; game play regarding the cnxpt; seeking or advertising a product, service, or project related to a cnxpt.","Private Data","As used herein, the term \u201cprivate data\u201d refers to data including, but not limited to: attributes of cnxpts, txos, dxos, or data associated with relationships, which may be registered as private and stored confidentially and unpublishable for access only by the owner or specifically authorized others.","Querying","As used herein, the term \u201cquerying\u201d refers to performance of one or more queries. If a query is requested and no context indicates that the query is attached to a goal or a cnxpt, then a new goal is created to provide the needed framework. Querying refers to the finding and retrieval of data either inside the CMM, hidden in any number of fields in the CMMDB, or outside the CMM. See also \u2018Goals\u2019.","Query","As used herein, the term \u201cquery\u201d refers to 1) a type of search that has the intention to find information (normally, but not limited to cnxpts that represent ttxs) that the user wishes to know about or to define a set of results that are relevant to a goal the user has in his\/her mind; and\/or 2) a request for information from a set of sources. In one embodiment, queries are used within goals explicitly or implicitly.","One purpose of querying is to find relevant information using a sophisticated structure of commands through parametric query operations. The result of the query depends upon the query type and query parameters used. Queries result in result sets containing rsxitems. Rsxitems may represent any info-item type or a string value with an identified source.","In one embodiment, queries may involve multiple steps. Each step would produce a result set or alter a previously existing result set. The result set is a central focus of managing query operations in that the result set often becomes the basis, referenced as a parameter, for a subsequent step. By querying, he user is seeking to add rsxitems obtained result set only if they are relevant, along some nature of relationship, even if merely generally germane. The user normally will cull out rsxitems which are not relevant.","Each of these steps is defined by its own query specification, and together the steps combine into a Query Script. Scripts which are still being created and which do not yet have a final result set defined may still be considered a Query Script.","In one embodiment, query scripts may be copied, altered, and shared with others.","Queries and query steps are represented by specializations of txos, each having a specification. Queries may be related to goals or cnxpts. In one embodiment, queries may be lists of labeled steps with named results, such that the query steps are to be executed in a specific order or by a specific algorithm.","Query steps may include but are not limited to: meta-search specification, analytic invocation, result set culling operation. Each command takes a set of parameters and produces a result set. The parameters and type of result set differ for each command. Algorithms for interpreting query steps may be added to the system.","Query step commands may be entered interactively and recorded into a script as it is entered. Each entered command is normally executed interactively and the results returned. In one embodiment, query scripts may be edited in several ways. Query scripts may be re-executed, generating new versions of the result sets, and can be reused on existing result sets to find changes.","Queries are general because they have many possible steps and interpretation methods. Queries may request information from a database, a document management system, the internet via meta-searching, data abstraction sources, or the ontology itself. Query steps may perform Boolean arithmetic on result sets, and may perform automated culling on previously created result sets, or repeat previously performed culling on result sets.","Complex query script results may be based upon, including, but not limited to: prior goals and cnxpts; fxxt specifications; the multiple queries stated as applying to the goals\/cnxpts; use of site\/engine specific query mechanisms; meta search techniques; DeepWeb and Database techniques; use of a result sets, result set culling, and result set manipulation by \u2018result set arithmetic\u2019; re-running of queries and culling; optimizing of queries where search engine subscription is available and payment rules are set; query partitioning for incremental innovation splitting; use of cluster analysis, cross citation analysis, within goals; and anticipatory site indexing and scraping.","In one embodiment, the user may invoke analytics as part of the query process, which then return newly created result sets (or item lists that can be used as rsxitems).","In one embodiment, the user may find information resources in any data or document management systems that can be accessed.","In one embodiment, the user may query against structured data (internal or external database data, including information resource metadata). The utility of this is that it provides a range of customizable database query options that is broad and flexible enough to allow users to produce query results that are useful and accurate.","Structured Query","As used herein, the term \u201cstructured query\u201d refers to queries against structured data, including but not limited to: internal or external database data, deep web data, information resource metadata; resulting in result sets of data items which may or may not be useful as information resource or rsxitems referencing cnxpt.","DeepWeb Query","As used herein, the term \u201cDeepWeb query\u201d refers to queries databases accessible on the internet through a website, on a private system, or associated with the CMMDB. The objective is to find data matching the command criteria by use of one or more analytics.","The utility of DeepWeb and database searching is that it allows for a wealth of search structures for obtaining both ttx description and characteristic data, including, but not limited to: DeepWeb data related to ttxs, unstructured database searches, structured data searches with SQL-like (FROM and WHERE clauses) search requests returning information resources, topic map searching, private and custom knowledge base and database searches, and combinations thereof.","In one embodiment, the analytic may be within the system or external.","Unstructured Query","As used herein, the term \u201cunstructured query\u201d refers to queries against unstructured data, including but not limited to: documents, hyperlinked pages, web pages, cached web pages, including metadata regarding the documents or pages, by Boolean, keyword, natural language, or other forms of searches to form information resource rsxitems with locators.","Result Track","As used herein, the term \u201cresult track\u201d or \u201ctrack\u201d refers to a saved execution of a query script.","In one embodiment, a saved \u201cproject file\u201d is created for each query. A user is able to close their work on a query and re-open it at a later time, thus saving culling status on result sets and query states. Tracks may be retained for a specific execution of a script. If another execution occurs, the results of a saved track are protected by renaming the result sets as they are built and stored in the second track. For parameterized analytics, result set operations, and query commands, the parameters used will be stored in the history for each step of the script.","Reduction","As used herein, the term \u201creduction\u201d refers to the extraction, or identification in place, of objects useful and appropriate to exist in a result, along with the calculations needed to determine how they will participate and where the objects will be in the result. Reduction is temporary and used to, including but not limited to: extract one scopx from the ontology; extract one hat from the ontology; extract one hierarchy for scene-graph production; reduce clutter in the visualization; extract a filtered result for display.","Registries\u2192Rexo","As used herein, the term \u201cregistries\u201d refers to opt-in or sign-up facilities of a website to allow users to, including but not limited to: gain access to community features and services; post specific interests, specific content, etc.; obtain benefits; participate in collaboration; manifest acceptance of an agreement; participate in contests; take on tasks. Users may register for a community or register by migration. The may opt-in or opt-out, and may control the access to them or set\/pay for access to features of the community. They may migrate their communities progressing forward in phase and forward in tcept specificity. In one embodiment, users may not migrate back beyond the generality of the tcept that they joined initially. Registrations in the registry are represented by \u2018rexo\u2019 info-items.","For instance, a user in a ttx consortium initiation phase may define the parameters of the consortium for confidentiality, publishing, contract, etc.; a user building a team may post a position description; a user interested in raising investment may post a business plan; an inventor or agent may register an idea, description and claim for filling out a patent application; a founder may post a private or public placement memorandum; a company may post a product for sale; a writer may post content for sale; a company may post a \u2018brainstorming project meeting\u2019 for initiating a brainstorming event on a ttx, and users may register to be gain access to the brainstorming meeting and to be compensated if their results are of value; etc. Projects may be registered for research and analysis, for prior art searching, competitive analysis, games, course material control and access, shared access, corporate security and control over results of studies, etc.","Game registration may involve establishing a team, registering a handicap, such as year in school or prior scores, joining a team, putting up a contribution toward a \u2018purse\u2019, registration as spectator, etc.","Many registrations will require a fee. Some registrations may result in payment of compensation or discounts. Some registrations may have multi-level fees where, for instance, the outreach for a business plan may increase with a higher fee, or the number of tcepts a business plan is applied to may be higher where a higher fee is paid.","Registrations involving a ttx are represented by rexos, a specialization of a txo.

In the TNMS, the act of reification is the act of making a txxo represent the tpx of another topic map construct in the same topic map, and thus also provides support for flexible typing. A txxo reifying a topic map construct actually represents the real-world thing represented by that topic map construct. Here, while the function of reification for attaching additional information to info-items is provided and useful in the best mode, the reification function is extended to allow for changing of infxtypxs dynamically. To reduce confusion, the txo info-item is retained for this purpose, and cnxpts may not reify other info-items.","In one embodiment, reification is utilized for the general purpose as specified in the TNMS of providing flexible typing of an info-item.","Relationships","As used herein, the term \u201crelationship\u201d refers to an edge in the CMMDB ontology between nodes of specific types, including, but not limited to txos.","Relationships can be asserted conforming to the following rules:\n\n","(This definition does not constrain the physical implementation, where a relationship can be implemented in a list of tuples, all under a single entity which occupies one role, or in a relational schema.) Associations are specific specializations of relationships.","Ttx Associations","As used herein, the term \u201cassociation\u201d, \u201cttx relationship\u201d, or \u201ccnxpt relationship\u201d refers generally to a infxtypxd relationship representing an n-ary aggregate of cnxpts. Associations are the general form for the representation of relationships between cnxpts. That is, an association is a grouping of cnxpts with no implied direction or order, and there is no restriction on the number of cnxpts that can be grouped together.","An association can be assigned a infxtypx that specifies the nature of the relationship represented by the association. In addition, each cnxpt that participates in the association plays an infxtypxd role that specifies the way in which the cnxpt participates.","For example to describe the relationship between a person, \u201cJohn Smith,\u201d and the company he works for, \u201cABC Limited,\u201d we would create an association infxtypxd by the cnxpt \u201cEmployment\u201d and with role infxtypxs \u201cEmployee\u201d (for the role played by \u201cJohn Smith\u201d) and \u201cEmployer\u201d (for the role played by \u201cABC Limited\u201d).","Associations may be directed, bi-directed, undirected, or symmetrical (optionally directed). They may have a weight associated with them, and may also have other characteristics such as, including but not limited to: infxtypxs, scopxs, values, or attached info-items such as trxrts and purxpts. In one embodiment, the objects at each endpoint of an association have roles as defined collectively by:\n\n","Associations are formal representations of relationships between ttxs, represented by ontology edges between cnxpts that assert the relationship between the two ttxs. Ttx associations are completely independent of whatever information resources may or may not exist or be considered as occurrences of those cnxpts.","Associations can be grouped according to infxtypx, including, but not limited to: categorical, affinitive, other. Ttx associations may have other characteristics such as, including but not limited to: values, scopxs, date applicable, timeframe applicable, horizon applicable, date created, creator, infxtypx.","Associations may be established manually by authorized users. In one embodiment, associations may be established by automated analysis, including but not limited to: semantic distance calculation, relevance analysis.","The Ttx association between two cnxpts can be asserted using an association that conforms to the rules for all relationships, and the following:\n\n","Scopx applies to this association type in the same way as it does to any other.","Association Roles","Each cnxpt that participates in an association has a corresponding association role which states the role played by the cnxpt in the association. In the case of the relationship Fred was born in Canada, expressed by the association between Fred and Canada, those roles might be person and birthplace. Roles may become acceptable endpoint types for an association type in a Fxxt Specification.","Association Direction","Associations may be directed, quasi-symmetrical, or symmetrical in the sense that in a symmetrical relationship the nature of the relationship is the same whichever way you look at it. Associations are symmetrical in the sense that the strength of the relationship is the same either way it is viewed. For example, a directed association is present where a cnxpt is in a category represented by a second cnxpt. An example of a symmetric association is collaboration, so that the corollary of \u201cLorca collaborated with de Falla\u201d would (likely) be that \u201cde Falla collaborated with Lorca\u201d. Sometimes the anchor roles in a symmetrical relationships are the same (in this case: collaborator and collaborator), sometimes they are different (as in the case of the husband and wife roles in a married-to quasi-symmetrical affinitive association).","Association Transitivity","Other association types, such as those that express class\/instance and part\/whole (meronymy\/holonymy) relationships, are transitive: If we say that Lorca is a poet, and that a poet is a writer, we have implicitly said that Lorca is a writer. Similarly, by asserting that Granada is in Andalusia, and that Andalusia is in Spain, we have automatically asserted that Granada is in Spain and any Topic Map-aware search engine should be able to draw the necessary conclusions without the need for making the assertion explicitly.","Ttx Categorical, Classification, Membership, Hierarchy, Type-Instance, Class-Instance Relationships","As used herein, the term \u201chierarchical relationship\u201d, \u201ccategorical association\u201d, \u201cclassification association\u201d, \u201cmembership association\u201d, or \u201chierarchical association\u201d refer to a infxtypxd relationships each representing a parent child relationship, and collectively forming hierarchies. Hierarchical relationships are of several kinds, the primary ones being: genus\/species and whole\/part. When used to describe relationships between cnxpts here, the \u201chierarchical association\u201d specialization is most accurate.","The classic rule for validity in hierarchical relationships may be stated as: \u201cTerms are hierarchically related only if both are members of the same fundamental category (fxxt); that is, they represent entities, activities, agents, or properties, etc.\u201d Here, \u201csubjective\u201d hierarchies created by consensus building by votes and crowdsourcing cause this rule to be violated and the CMM is thus more adaptable.","Ttx categorical, classification, subsumption, membership, hierarchy, Type-Instance, and Class-Instance relationships may be established manually by authorized users.","Hierarchical\u2014Broader\/Narrower Term (BT\/NT)","As used herein, the term \u201chierarchical\u2014broader\/narrower term\u201d, or \u201cBT\/NT\u201d refer to a infxtypxd relationship expressing a hierarchical relationship based on levels of superordination and subordination, where the superordinate term represents a class or a whole and is labeled as the broader term (BT), and subordinate terms refer to its parts, or narrower aspects of the class (NT).","Broader Term (BT) and Narrower Term (NT) relationships are shown through hierarchies in classified tools and with Broader and Narrower Term codes in alphabetical tools.","Hierarchical\u2014Partitive (Whole\u2014Part)","As used herein, the term \u201chierarchical\u2014Partitive\u201d, or \u201cWhole\u2014Part\u201d refer to a infxtypxd relationship expressing a hierarchical relationship between tpxs of the same type, where \u2018the name of the part implies the name of the possessing whole in any context\u2019.

Instances may include \u2018Variant of a Technology\u2019 where the \u2018Class\u2019 is the ttx defining the tcept and the Variant tcept is the \u2018Instance\u2019.","Cycles in this relationship are allowed, and should be interpreted to mean merely that different rationales exist for the inclusion of one ttx as represented by a cnxpt into a category as represented by another cnxpt, where one rationale conflicts with another.","The type-instance association is not transitive. That is, if B is an instance of the type A, and C is an instance of the type B, it does not follow that C is an instance of A.","Temporal Order Association","As used herein, the term \u201ctemporal order association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that reflects a relationship based upon whether one cnxpt occurred or will occur after another cnxpts. Example: \u201csteel furnaces occurred after copper smelting techniques\u201d.","Cause and Effect Association","As used herein, the term \u201ccause and effect association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that reflects a relationship based upon whether a ttx was the cause for another or effected another ttx. Example: \u201cis propulsion of\u201d.","Ttx Citation (Cited-Citing) Associations","As used herein, the term \u201cttx citation association\u201d or \u201cttx citation hierarchical association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represents the referencing or citation in a description of one ttx (the citing ttx) of the other ttx (the cited ttx as a whole) by specific referencing of the cnxpt's description (as a whole). A ttx citation association is a directed association, but not necessarily a reliable hierarchical association. Specializations of the ttx citation association provide for heightened accuracy based upon the nature of the citations and references and who created them. Ttx citation associations are given weights, depending upon the nature of the citation. Where a high weight is provided, the relationship is seen as more reliable as a hierarchical association, and is interpreted as a \u201cttx citation hierarchical association\u201d.","The reference may be in the form of a \u201cttx description content reference citation association\u201d. Any citation in a \u201cttx description content author-placed reference citation tag\u201d found may only serve as a basis for a weaker association and thus are not to be considered as a basis for a hierarchical association, unless the user specifically states a very high weight.","In the general case, the cited ttx, or at least something seemingly related to it, must have been known by the author of the citing ttx description. Because an inference or presumption could be made that the cited ttx existed before the citing ttx, a \u201cttx citation association\u201d representing that the cited ttx's cnxpt was relevant to the citing ttx's cnxpt is appropriate and relevant, and a \u201cttx citation hierarchical association\u201d representing that the cited ttx's cnxpt was a predecessor (or category) of the citing ttx's cnxpt may be appropriate and relevant. Weights assigned are established by system parameters set and altered over time and the nature of the reference.","Ttx citation associations may be established manually by authorized users with restrictions.","The ttx citation association is not based upon any occurrence relationship. A different form of hierarchical association called an \u201cimputed cnxpt citation association\u201d is automatically created, prior to map generation, between cnxpts based upon citations between occurrence items.","Ttx Description Content Reference Citation Associations","As used herein, the term \u201cttx description content reference citation association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represents the referencing or citation in a description of one ttx (the citing ttx) of specific content in another ttx's cnxpt's description by specific citation. It is a specialization of a \u201cttx citation association\u201d.","The cited cnxpt description must have been known by the author of the citing ttx description. Because the cited ttx existed before the citing ttx, a \u201cttx description content reference citation association\u201d representing that the cited ttx's cnxpt was a predecessor (or category) of the citing ttx's cnxpt is appropriate and relevant. Ttx description content reference citation associations are given substantially higher effective weights than other ttx citation associations. Weights assigned are established by system parameters set and altered over time and the nature of the reference.","Ttx description content reference citation associations may be established manually by authorized users only where a translated name is in the citing document because it would not be caught automatically.","Cnxpt Name Reference Citation Associations","As used herein, the term \u201ccnxpt name reference citation association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represents the referencing or citation in a description of one ttx (the citing ttx) of the name of another ttx's cnxpt (the cited ttx) by specific use. It is a specialization of a \u201cttx citation association\u201d.","The cited ttx, or at least something seemingly related to it by common name, must have been known by the author of the citing ttx description.

Examples: \u201cpersonal computers were the replacement technology for manual typewriters\u201d; \u201cdigital electronic imaging has substituted for Daguerreotypes\u201d. In one embodiment, the discontinuity in innovation association refers to an infxtypxd, directed, ternary association between two txpts and one appcept that reflects a relationship based upon whether a tcept was the discontinuous successor for another tcept where addressing a need stated by an appcept. Examples: \u201cpersonal computers were the replacement technology for manual typewriters for production of correspondence, creating broader market\u201d; \u201cdigital electronic imaging has substituted for Daguerreotypes for family photography, as a substitute\u201d.","The nature of the discontinuity is an important attribute or trait of the discontinuity in innovation association, stating, including but not limited to: is the discontinuity a substitution, create a broader market, affects competitive competences.","Technological innovation is not entirely incremental. Disruptive tcepts may substitute for a certain appcept, may solve a wider requirement than for a specific appcept, and may enhance or destroy the competence established firms have in an appcept family. Periods of market continuity, during which innovation is incremental, and rates of innovation remain steady, and significant product or market changes are infrequent, may end abruptly, giving way to periods of discontinuity, where businesses transform or die, new businesses thrive, and major product and process changes occur.","Field of Study Association","As used herein, the term \u201cField of Study Association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that reflects a relationship based upon whether a ttx is taught in a particular field of study that is described as another ttx. This is a directional association.","For example, \u2018computer programming techniques\u2019 are taught in engineering, mathematics, business, etc. This would illustrate that those three fields of study are related indirectly by the second level of a hierarchy consisting of a ttx called \u2018computer programming techniques\u2019.","Instruments Association","As used herein, the term \u201cInstruments association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that reflects a relationship based upon whether a ttx was instrumental in producing another ttx.

(teaching\u2014overhead projectors).","Materials Association","As used herein, the term \u201cmaterials Association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represent relationships based upon whether a ttx defined a material used in another. Materials Associations state that one ttx is used to construct another. Example: plastic film\u2014transparencies.","Product of or By-product of Association","As used herein, the term \u201cproduct of or by-product of Association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represent relationships based upon whether a ttx was a \u201cproduct of\u201d or \u201cby-product of\u201d another. This relationship states that one ttx is produced by another, hence requiring a parent-child direction.","Satisfies Requirements Association","As used herein, the term \u201cSatisfies Requirements Association\u201d refers to a weighted, scopxd, infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that reflects a relationship based upon whether and the degree to which a tcept will satisfy requirements as stated for an appcept. This association states that a tcept can be used to solve the needed function for an appcept's purpose. The weight is a projection or an entered estimate of the ability to solve the requirements successfully relative to all other competitive tcepts. This association may be added manually or automatically based upon trait matching. It is directional.","Subsumption Associations","As used herein, the term \u201csubsumption Association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represent relationships based upon whether a ttx is more specific and included in the parent ttx (subsumption, categorization, classification). This is a general form where a more specific reasoning for a more specific scopx and infxtypx of relationship may not be available. This could be the case when a categorization from another source is being used directly. This is a directional relationship.","Document-Retrieval Definition of Subsumption Association","As used herein, the term \u201cdocument-retrieval subsumption Association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represent relationships based upon whether a ttx is narrower than its parent according to the document-retrieval definition of \u2018broader-narrower\u2019:","\u201cTtx A is broader than ttx B whenever the following holds: in any inclusive search for A all items dealing with B should be found. Conversely B is narrower than A.\u201d","This is a directional relationship. This definition introduces subjectivity. Concrete hierarchical links are backed up by a majority count based on expert judgments or an analysis of search requests.","Extensional Definition of Subsumption Association","As used herein, the term \u201cextensional subsumption Association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represent relationships based upon whether a ttx is narrower than its parent according to \u201clogical considerations\u201d. These occur when other labels for \u2018broader-narrower\u2019 such as \u201cgenus-species\u201d or \u201cis kind of (for \u2018broader\u2019) are used to characterize the generic hierarchy relation.

This relationship states that a ttx is a subclass or a superclass of another ttx. This is a directional relationship. Example: Instance of: John F. Kennedy is an instance of Person, which implies that he is also an instance of Living Thing. The converse is not necessarily true. A type may have any number of subtypes and supertypes. The supertype-subtype relationship is transitive, which means that if B is a subtype of A, and C a subtype of B, C is also a subtype of A. Example of \u2018is subclass of\u2019: Pope is subclass of Person, and Person is a subclass of Living Thing, etc.","Cycles in each of these relationships are allowed, and (contrary to TNMS) must not be interpreted to mean that the sets of ttxs included in the relationships are in any way the same.","Category-Member Hierarchical Association","As used herein, the term \u201cttx category-member hierarchical association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represent a relationship between a category of ttxs (a categorization or classification) and a member of that category (another classification or the member ttx) within a scopx and fxxt. The converse is not necessarily true. A category may have any number of members and supertypes. Example of \u2018is component of\u2019: CPU is a component of Computer, etc. (express part-to-whole relations)","The category-member relationship is transitive, which means that if B is a member of A, and C a member of B, C is also a member of A albeit indirectly through B. The category-member-subtype relationship is also transitive, such that if B is the member of A, it follows that every subtype of B is also a member of A. Example of \u2018is member of\u2019: Braun is member of Government of Germany, etc.","Predecessor-Successor Hierarchical Associations","As used herein, the term \u201cttx predecessor-successor hierarchical association\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between cnxpts that represent a relationship, within a scopx and fxxt, between a pre-existing ttx (as in prior art for tcepts) and a later defined ttx whether or not stemming from of that pre-existing ttx.

Affinitive associations are not necessarily directional in nature. At one extreme, an RT may represent nothing more than an extremely vague \u2018See-also\u2019 connection between two ttxs. At the other extreme, it would represent absolute and proven equivalence of the two ttxs, within a constraint of a scopx or fxxt.

It is anticipated by that product or reference.","Such a statement (and the relationship caused by it) may be used by an examiner or patent professional as a first step toward understanding the true nature of the real read on relationship, and would be useful for tracking workflow during that checking process and as a historical record of the work that went into the checking process. It can also be used for patentability opinion conversations and opinion formation workflows.","Non-professionals may add such relationships. Authors of relationships may make additional statements or otherwise improve on the relationship description and attribute values.

This is a directional relationship because the reciprocal\u2014to display the second dxo by the first\u2014is not established. This is a vote, but strict rules apply for authorization to place or move certain dxos. User suggested\u2014dxo alignment affinitive relationships may be established by authorized users, and are marked with the user as creator, a weight, and possibly a fxxt and\/or scopx.

This is a directional relationship.","Syntactic Relationships Suggesting Hierarchical Relationships","As used herein, the term \u201cSyntactic Relationships Suggesting Hierarchical Relationship\u201d refer to specific syntactic relationships that denote a categorization between otherwise unrelated topics. Examples are:\n\n","Syntactic relationships are displayed according to the syntax of a normal sentence, either through the syntax of the subject string (in precoordinate indexing), or through devices such as facet indicators (in postcoordinate indexing).","In older search engines, postcoordinate index system were used, assigning a document terms like \u201caluminum\u201d and \u201cwindow\u201d without the relationship given by their use in the title or in the query. The user conducting a search would finds documents that include one or both of the terms, regardless of the meaning. This provides an expansive model.","In newer search engines, and here, keywords are used as index terms, and repetitive use provides a training as if the collective user set were a single expert indexer who has stated by use that an ordered relationship exists between the keywords. In a precoordinate index system, a document is indexed in using the subject terms. \u201cBooks\u201d and \u201cEnglish\u201d are combined as subject and sub-heading (e.g., \u201cBooks\u2014English\u201d).","The result of not providing for the display of syntactic relationships in postcoordinate systems results in users not being able to distinguish between different contexts for the same term. Here the combination of postcoordinate indexing for expansive searching and precoordinate for identity indication are used.","Special Feature Hierarchical Relationships","As used herein, the term \u201cspecial feature hierarchical relationship\u201d refers to an infxtypxd binary relationship between txos that relate descriptive elements by directed but not necessarily parent child relationships that can only be used in form hierarchies in certain cases.","Document Reference Relationships","Ttx Description Content Author-Placed Reference Citation Tags","As used herein, the term \u201cttx description content author-placed reference citation tag\u201d refers to a citation marker made in a document regarding or citing specific content in another ttx's cnxpt's description by specific citation or referencing, or specific content in an information resource (because the information resource may actually be or become a ttx description).","These markers are especially important because of the overt referencing by the author. These markers may appear in many forms, stating general relevance or encompassing a thought, a passage, a word, or a document location in the document where it is placed. It may merely point to the cited cnxpt or a document describing the cnxpt or a document relevant to the cnxpt.","The cited cnxpt description or information resource must have been known by the author of the citing document. Because the cited ttx existed before the citing ttx, a reference citation association is highly appropriate and relevant.","Often, a document containing such citation tags will be found and added to (or a reference will be added to) the CMM. These tags have such potential import that, even if the cited document is not yet in the CMM, that the mere failure to anticipate that it will be added would cause an inefficiency in many (but certainly not all) situations.

The tags are associated with the document and\/or associated with the document reference. This provides a facility to pinpoint where a general or specific citing of a ttx or an information resource is being made in and existing document. These non-author citations DO NOT presumptively show that the cited document existed before the document where the tag is placed, but they show that an inference could be made that the citing document was highly relevant to the cited cnxpt, and vice-versa. These tags are thus useful for irxt and cnxpt citation association building.","On occasion, such citation tags will be added before the cited document is in the CMM. The mere failure to anticipate that it will be added would cause an inefficiency in many (but certainly not all) situations.

These relationships are reinforcing or negating to the original relationship. If a comment relationship is reinforcing, suggesting that the basic relationship exists, but that something about its description or attribute values can be improved, than it counts as an additional vote in favor of the original relationship, strengthening it. If it is negative, then the impact is the opposite, but has a greater impact because negatives carry more weight.","Comment relationships may be used for tracking workflow while a user improves their thinking and as a historical record of the work that went into the process.","Authors of relationships may make additional statements or otherwise improve on the relationship description and attribute values. Care must be taken to allow for notification to other users making comments about a relationship that the relationship has been changed, Votes about a relationship are actually relationships themselves or are threaded comments connected to a relationship, and thus a comment may be changed by its author after a notice (alert) stating that a change\/improvement occurred.","Comment relationships may have other characteristics such as, including but not limited to: values, scopxs, date applicable, timeframe applicable, horizon applicable, date created, creator, infxtypx.","Generic Relationship","As used herein, the term \u201cgeneric relationship\u201d refers generally to a vote stating that some unknown relationship exists, but it has to be examined to determine what is represented. Such relationships are queued into the crowdsource review workflow so that someone may earn an incentive by considering the relationship.

By definition, these relationships do not include cnxpts as their similarity is directly addressed by \u201cDocument Level Relationship Generation\u201d. (as a practical matter, the two forms of relationship building are different because the latter allows for direct imputing of associations and better handling of changes to metadata.) These relationships are not scopxd or fxxted. These relationships are used as a basis for, including but not limited to: searching, querying, relevance measurement, semantic differencing, and identification. Commonality relationships may have other characteristics such as, including but not limited to: values, date applicable, timeframe applicable, horizon applicable, date created, creator, infxtypx. Commonality relationships are formed automatically by, including but not limited to: semantic distance calculation, clustering, citation analysis. Commonality relationships are appropriate where the information needed to determine the relationship is known within stored data in info-items, and it would be inefficient to dedicate a more complex stored relationship. Commonality relationships are inappropriate where the number of relationship is sparse for the number of info-items of the type. Commonality relationships are stored as summations of weights and utilized to create imputed associations or summary associations. Commonality relationships may not be created by users, but may be based upon user created relationships.","The set of commonalities include but are not limited to:","Irxt to irxt","Purxpt to purxpt","Trxrt to trxrt","Keyword to keyword","Txo of specific type (non-cnxpt) to txo of the same specific type","Txo of one specific type (non-cnxpt) to txo of a different specific type (non-cnxpt)","Result Set to Result Set","Result Set Membership Commonality Relationships","As used herein, the term \u201cresult set membership commonality relationship\u201d refers to a relationship internally maintained between two irxts stating that the information resources represented by and referenced by the two info-items both occurred as relevant in two or more result sets.

One role of the relationship is filled by the info-item identifier of a user txo. The type of user and, optionally, their expertise, etc. are given by the user txo.","Relationship Source Role","The relationship source role states where relationship information was obtained. One role of the relationship is filled by the info-item identifier of a data set, a Result Set, a business, a URL (base site only) or some other source represented by a source txo. The type of source and, optionally, its usability, quality, expertise, etc. are given by the source txo. The relationship source is optional where a user is marked as creator.","Repository","As used herein, the term \u201crepository\u201d refers to an electronic or non-electronic knowledgebase holding repository documents, files (from file managers), articles (objects warehoused as indexed in a document manager), web pages, web based research papers, patents, information services and products, tpx listings (such as directories), etc. Heterogeneous repositories hold one or more document, article, or object types.","Requirement or Needs","As used herein, the term \u201crequirement\u201d or \u201cneed\u201d refers to a trait of an appcept that a user or engineer may use to describe requirements of an appcept, application domain, or product line, or a need or other requirement.","Result Sets","As used herein, the term \u201cresult set\u201d refers to the data returned from the successful execution of an operation including, but not limited to: a query, an import, an analytic execution, a manual creation, and a culling of a predecessor result set. Result sets provide for manageable lists of rsxitems of many natures, including but not limited to: environmental scanning scan hit tracking, query retrieval lists.

In one embodiment, result sets may be named and may be exported, imported, deleted, and saved. The characteristics of the items in a result set are uniform to some specific degree for each type of result set. Result sets may contain many items of one type, or may contain items of different types that share some characteristic that allows the query to find them all. Any kind of result set may be formed as long as the items found can be referenced in some way by (internally linked to) rsxitems.","Result sets are related by result set relationships to, including but not limited to: queries, goals, or cnxpts. Result sets may be considered to represent groupings of ttxs where they contain cnxpts. Result sets containing cnxpts may be considered to represent sets of ttxs which are successors, children, or subtypes of a target ttx (represented by a goal of a cnxpt), sets of ttxs which are predecessors, parents, or supertypes of a target ttx, or simply without any consideration about relation direction.","The query command is simply one way to initially populate a result set. Result sets, in one embodiment, can be manipulated manually (culled) and combined using Boolean operations, etc.","Culling allows adjustment of relevance of rsxitems. In one embodiment, the user may alter the relevance ranking of all rsxitems by culling.","In one embodiment, as the user clicks on an entry in the result set, the user's click will be recorded as a vote for the listed item's relevance. The utility of this is that the user will be assisted in weeding out irrelevant \u2018matches\u2019. In culling, a Rsxitem may be \u2018added\u2019, \u2018seen\u2019 (displayed in the listing page as in a present day search engine result page listing), \u2018touched but not rejected\u2019 (clicked on as in a present day search engine result page listing), \u2018rejected\u2019 (marked as not relevant), \u2018relevant\u2019 (marked as relevant), \u2018deleted\u2019, or merely \u2018kept unseen\u2019. Each of these yields a strength of relevance for the relationship of the item to the goal.","In one embodiment, when the result set contains cnxpts, the culling tool will show the result set as a visualization of the Area of Consideration, offering the user the opportunity to transform the area into an Area of Interest by marking cnxpts as relevant or less germane. As the user clicks on an info-item in a visualization or an entry in a list of info-items, the user's click will be recorded as a vote for the cnxpt's relevance to the goal. The utility of this is that the user will be assisted in weeding out irrelevant cnxpt \u2018matches\u2019. These culling operations result in relevance setting script commands.","In one embodiment, when the result set contains information resources, a list of locators are collected into the result set and the culling tool will show the result set so that it appears, in one embodiment, to a user like the traditional search result page. In one embodiment, the user reviews the list to cull the result set in a manner that is familiar to users using traditional web search engines. As the user clicks on an entry, the user's click will be recorded as a vote for the information resource's relevance. The utility of this is that the user will be assisted in weeding out irrelevant information resource \u2018matches\u2019.","In one embodiment, these culling operations result in relevance setting script commands which are added to the query script, such as add and remove script commands, and the Boolean operations are added as set operation script commands.","In one embodiment, result set rsxitems are workflow process managed, such that a workflow for an rsxitem type may be defined, and that rsxitem will be \u2018flowed\u2019 through the workflow process.

In one embodiment, this would also form an occurrence relationship vote between the goal or a resulting cnxpt and the txo. Existing txos would be used rather than creating new txos where they exist for the tpx.","The appropriateness of the tpx relationship to the ttx remains unsettled until further action is taken by a user, and thus given a very low weighting, until the user examines the item during the process of result set culling. The txo's inclusion in the result set and its occurrence relationship with the goal are tentative, since the user may not have been pleased with the results found. If the user has an opportunity to cull (pick and choose from) the result set, a weighting is given to the relationships between the txo and the goal\/cnxpt based upon whether the item is irrelevant (a negative weight), relevant (a medium weight), or fully define (high weight) the ttx according to the nature of the query, then he will be setting relevance ranks for the items in the result set and also establishing more permanent relationships between the items and the resulting cnxpt. This process refines the ontology's understanding of the ttx as he means it by connecting relevant occurrence items to the goal.","Information Resources Result Sets","As used herein, the term \u201cinformation resources result set\u201d refers to a list of temporary irxts for newly added information resources produced from, including but not limited to: creation of a result set, execution of an analytic, or an import; and marking of info-items as rsxitems.","In one embodiment, an irxt, with descriptive summary information about the information resource (metadata), may be created by a query and marked as an rsxitem.

This process refines the ontology's understanding of the ttx as he means it by connecting relevant occurrence items to the goal.","Ad Hoc Resultant Data Tables","As used herein, the term \u201cad hoc resultant data tables\u201d refers to a special form of Result Set formed from a data table created by, including but not limited to: a result of a specific analytic, or an import. The tables are created as needed. The data is marked with a source attribution, a source script ID, etc. The structure of the table is based upon the data obtained but is specified by the analytic or import module, and has a form akin to a Result Set, where the rsxitems have characteristics defined by the specific analytic or import and values from the analytic or import.","Result Set Arithmetic","As used herein, the term \u201cresult set arithmetic\u201d refers to the merging into a single result set one or more other goal result sets, query result sets, or other result sets, or selection sets, according to, including but not limited to: a Boolean logical formula.","Resultant-DataSets","As used herein, the term \u201cresultant-DataSet\u201d refers to a DataSet packaged from, including but not limited to: a result set, an ad hoc resultant data table, a result of a specific analytic, or an import; and registered as confidential and unpublishable, and offered for consignment sale. The tables are created as needed. The data is marked with a source attribution, a source script ID, etc. The structure of the table is based upon the data obtained but is specified by the result set structure, the analytic, or the import module.","Scanning Term","As used herein, the term \u201cscanning term\u201d refers to a search term used in environmental scanning (the searching of the \u2018world\u2019 for competitive information), for which the returned results (scan hits) must be managed during the query process and a record of the query term and results are kept for reference.","Scopxs, Access Control Lists, and Fxxts","Scopx","As used herein, the term \u201cscopx\u201d refers to an external markup mechanism based upon a context in which a statement is true about a ttx or a characteristic of the ttx. The scopx represents the context within which a statement is valid, or a negative scopx represents the context within which a statement is false or invalid in a context, may be specified, but it is impossible to apply both a positive and a negative scopx for the same scopx. Outside the context represented by the scopx the statement is not known to be valid, but may still be useful in a circumstantial inference. Definitions of info-items which are statements which may have a scopx constraining the usefulness of the statement to a context include but are not limited to whether: the ttx exists within a scopx; a ttx has a particular characteristic; a ttx attribute has a certain value; a name, description, or an occurrence is assigned to a given ttx; a relationship exists within a scopx; two ttxs are related through an association; a ttx exists within a scopx where an attribute value of a cnxpt satisfies a criteria; or a relationship is valid in the scopx where an attribute of the relationship satisfies a criteria. Scopxs are intended to apply to ttx related information rather than structural tpx information, with the exception that structural tpx information (including txos and relationships) are scopxd where it is related to, including but not limited to: localization, system customization, and versioning.","This definition varies from the TNMS description of scopes. Unlike the TNMS, here a scopx is specified in a single scopx txo that defines the context. The multiple scopx specifications defined in the TNMS are defined here by the fxxt. That is, a statement here is known to be valid in the context specified by the scopx where the tpxs represented by the scopx txo are applied, regardless of whether other scopx txos apply. A fxxt defined on a set of scopx txos together define a context. That is, the statement is known to be valid only in a context defined by a fxxt where all the scopx tpxs represented by scopx txos in the fxxt formula, in that combination, apply.","As used herein, the term \u201cscopx\u201d is also intended to refer to entity facets or attribute facets as may be commonly defined elsewhere (in older versions of the Topic Map standards).","Context scopxs are additionally used to facilitate, including but not limited to: the extraction of multiple, concurrent views of sets of info-items; extraction of corporate or personal views of sets of info-items; utilization of multi-lingual variants; qualifying the content and\/or data contained in info-items as specialized ttxs or relationships to enable analysis and varied treatment; bringing ttxs nearer to each other to enable navigation between them; filtering to create views adapted to specific users or purposes; structuring unstructured info-items, or merging unstructured information bases with structured ones. Multi-lingual variants allow, as an example, the ttx \u201cDog\u201d to have the label \u201cdog\u201d in the context of the English language, \u201cle chien\u201d in French, and \u201cdas Hund\u201d in German.","Concurrent views may be, including but not limited to: ad hoc, object oriented, relational, hierarchical, filtered, or a combination of these. Scopx properties assigned to info-items support:","Personal Scopxs","As used herein, the term \u201cpersonal scopx\u201d refers to a specialization of a scopx by who has defined the scopx. Scopxs can be defined and utilized by a user; a user may share and make public scopx definitions. A user may define a scopx and apply it to any set of ttxs, relationships, or other information that is susceptible to scopxing and that a user is authorized to apply.","Scopx Info-Item","As used herein, the term \u201cscopx info-item\u201d refers to a specialization of a txo that represents the applicability of a constrained statement specifically to another info-item or characteristic it is assigned to. Scopx contexts are defined by a collection of such txos that each can be assigned to an info-item. To apply a particular scopx to a ttx or characteristic, a scopx txo name is assigned to, including, but not limited to: a cnxpt, a cnxpt name, a cnxpt attribute, a purlieu relationship, a cncpttrrt relationship, an occurrence relationship, or an association so that the statement is true for all cnxpts in the association, or, in the case of attributes where a criteria is specified for the scopx, whether the attribute value meets the criteria. The default scopx is where no scopx is assigned, and is known as the unconstrained scopx. An unconstrained scopx implies that no specific context statement is true for the object, but also that no specific context statement is false for the object. An example of the use of scopx is in language. For Finnish, \u201cSuomi\u201d is the name of the country Finland. This corresponds to assigning the cnxpt name \u201cSuomi\u201d to a cnxpt representing Finland, and scopxing it with a scopx txo representing Finnish.","Security Scopx","As used herein, the term \u201csecurity scopx\u201d, \u201caccess control list\u201d, or \u201cACL\u201d refers to a specialization of a scopx by who has access to information controlled by the scopx. Security Scopxs implement one access control mechanism on the CMMDB data.","Fxxt","As used herein, the term \u201cfxxt\u201d refers to a way in which txos and relationships can be classified. Fxxts are calculated partitionings, based upon specifications. Fxxts are also tags which may be assigned to info-items and relationships. Scopxs and fxxt tags, and calculation specifications are used to define fxxts, to create a second level external markup mechanism for the CMM. Fxxt specifications specify the fxxt and scopx tags which define the partitioning, but fxxt specifications may also involve \u2018soft\u2019 requirements where info-items are selected-in by property values and where fxxt partitions are subject to set arithmetic to form a resultant partitioning. An info-item or relationship may lie in more than one fxxt. Fxxts provide for pre-filter extraction based on properties of the cnxpts and the relationships they are involved in.","The \u2018blank\u2019 fxxt includes all instances of info-items of all info-item types for which a fxxt may be specified. Where a \u2018blank\u2019 fxxt is specified on an info-item, that info-item is simply not being defined in a fxxt. Where a \u2018blank\u2019 fxxt is specified in a search criteria, the search is not constrained by fxxt.","At any specific time, a fxxt contains a class of cnxpts and associations, the members of which share characteristics that distinguish them from members of other classes. Specifically, the membership in the grouping of cnxpts is determined by meeting one or more of the following criteria as stated in the fxxt specification:\n\n","Inclusion into the class may also occur by \u2018inverse extension\u2019 whereby cnxpts within the fxxt are \u2018children\u2019 of cnxpts not already in the fxxt, but the parent cnxpts are added to the fxxt because of the relationship relative to the fxxt. For fxxts based upon relationship participation, the relationships in which the cnxpts participate in the way specified are also a part of the fxxt.","A cnxpt may lay in more than one fxxt. Fxxts may be merged to form other fxxts. Two fxxts may be combined or operated on by Boolean operations to form other fxxts. Combined fxxts include the relationships which were in either of the combined fxxts and which relate cnxpts which are members of the combined fxxt after the operation.","Derived ontologies may be defined as external markup mechanism \u2018containers\u2019. A fxxt is not a real \u2018container\u2019 but is a \u2018virtual derived ontology\u2019. The \u2018blank\u2019 fxxt is one \u2018virtual derived ontology\u2019.","Categorizations are not always agreed upon by multiple users. Worse yet, as deep categorization is used, the disagreement grows in a fashion that a mechanism needs to be used to manage the consensus building. When different fxxts of categorization are used, the need expands exponentially.","Hierarchies in the CMM are often partial orderings of the CMM cnxpts in that a hierarchy built from one relationship scopx and infxtypx and txo type may not encompass a vast majority of the ttxs in the CMM. Fxxts provide a structure for grafting together various relationship to form deeper hierarchies for display and other use. Hierarchies extracted from the CMMDB ontology may contain many contradictory relationships, and the ordering of categories may change from one extraction to another regardless of fxxt.","As used herein, the term \u201cfxxt\u201d is not intended to refer to entity facets or attribute facets as may be commonly defined elsewhere. Fxxts here deviate significantly from facets as defined in various Topic Map standards.","In one embodiment, the contents of the CMMDB may be viewed by fxxt. Viewing by a fxxt is an extracting process where the extract contains a subset of the txos and relationships from the CMMDB which are defined to be in that fxxt according to a Fxxt Specification. To use a fxxt as a base of a search, find, or query is the equivalent of limiting the information to be retrieved by what is classified as being in the fxxt.","To use a fxxt as a base of a search, find, or query is the equivalent of limiting the information retrieved by what is considered to be in the fxxt.","Fxxt analysis provides for changing the type of data retrieved with regard to:\n\n","Personal Fxxts","As used herein, the term \u201cpersonal fxxt\u201d refers to a specialization of a fxxt by who has defined the fxxt. Fxxts can be defined and utilized by a user; a user may share and make public fxxt definitions.","Fxxt Calculation Scripts","Fxxt calculation scripts are made up of fxxt calculation step descriptions, one per step in the script.","Fxxt calculation step descriptions for info-item validity, existence, membership in a fxxt, Fxxt Calculation Step, generation, and summarization each contain a three part test. Part one (\u2018search criteria\u2019) is a general search criteria for locating cnxpts to test, part two (\u2018necessary criteria test\u2019) specifies all test criteria that must be satisfied by an info-item, and part three (\u2018action to take\u2019) states the precise action to take if an info-item found by the \u2018search criteria\u2019 actually satisfies all necessary criteria.","To generate the list of cnxpts in a fxxt based upon calculated fxxts, for each non-base fxxt, the fxxt specification based calculation is executed on each info-item meeting the general search criteria of part one to determine if the info-item is to be subject to the more specific tests of part two, and then the precise action to take in part three of the step.","Derived Ontologies","In one embodiment, derived ontologies are utilized to control fxxt membership setting on a \u2018set\u2019 basis. Derived ontologies are the result of a fxxt calculation. Derived ontologies are initially empty, and are filled or otherwise altered by the fxxt calculation. More than one derived ontology may be created or utilized during a Fxxt Specification analysis. A resulting derived ontology may exist prior to the step or may be newly created by the step.","In one embodiment, derived ontologies are constructed by marking of additional elements in the fxxt summaries tuples with a derived ontology identifier which identifies a derived ontology txo specifying a fxxt identifier and Fxxt Calculation Step identifier generating the derived ontology.","In one embodiment, derived ontologies are constructed by marking of info-items in the CMMDB with an additional txo property implemented by a tuple consisting of derived ontology identifier, fxxt identifier, Fxxt Calculation Step identifier generating the derived ontology, weight.","A fxxt calculation step is an operation on a derived ontology, according to a step's description, to combine derived ontologies from prior fxxt calculations, to alter a derived ontology by, including but not limited to: an extension step causing the inclusion of more cnxpts and relationships from the ontology into the fxxt, a generating step adding new temporary cnxpts or relationships, a combination step performing a Boolean operation on then existing derived ontologies, an elimination step, a weighting step, a summarization step, or a consensus tallying step. Each of the fxxt calculation steps operates on the derived ontology as constructed by the previous step(s) in the script.","Fxxt Calculation Step Types","Ontology Combination Steps","In one embodiment, derived ontologies resulting from prior fxxt analysis or from a prior calculation step may be combined according to a Boolean logical formula to form a derived ontology.","Combined fxxts include the relationships which were in either of the combined fxxts and which relate cnxpts that are both members of the combined fxxt after the operation. If the same relationship is found in two or more of the fxxts being combined, then the \u2018committed differentiations\u2019 of the fxxts are re-combined into a new \u2018committed differentiation\u2019 for the combined fxxt.","Generation Steps","Additional cnxpts and relationships may be generated during the resolution of a fxxt specification, where, including but not limited to: an analytic is applied during the fxxt calculation, summarizations are performed.","Extension Steps","In one embodiment, an extension fxxt calculation step describes a set of cnxpt and relationship info-items valid in a specified combination of infxtypxs and scopxs in the source, and a specified set of rules for treatment of cnxpt and relationship info-items with unconstrained scopx in the source, to merge into the resulting derived ontology for the fxxt. The source of the info-items may be the full CMMDB or a derived ontology resulting from a prior fxxt analysis or from a prior calculation step.","For fxxts based upon relationship participation, the way that a relationship is used in the addition of a cnxpt must be taken into consideration throughout the use of the fxxt. To do so, relationships are given \u2018committed differentiations\u2019 for each fxxt if a difference between the basic relationship and the meaning used to make the Fxxt Calculation Step is found. These exist for the life of the fxxt, but are used as steering hints for each reconstruction of the fxxt and for other new fxxts to provide a familiarity to the user viewing the CMMDB through the use of the fxxt. This technique has the utility of allowing a user to more easily match his mental map (as previously learned) to the present CMMDB.","Access and Retention Steps","Fxxt calculation step descriptions provide rules for granting accessibility and retention specifications.","Weighting Steps","In one embodiment, weighting factors may be specified in the fxxt calculation step description for increasing or decreasing importance of, including but not limited to: relationships, identity indicators, similarity strengths, votes.","Ordering Steps","In one embodiment, ordering rules may be specified in the fxxt calculation step description for, including but not limited to: information prioritization for reduction, path reordering, title or name ordering; relationship elimination priority, cnxpt elimination priority, dxo elimination priority; path construction decisions.","Summarization Steps","In one embodiment, summarization rules may be specified in the fxxt calculation step description for, including but not limited to: information hiding, information reduction, path shortening, title or name shortening; relationships elimination, cnxpt elimination, dxo elimination, interest information reduction, identity indicator alteration or reduction, similarity strengths summarization, vote summarization.","Fxxt Calculation Step Parameters","Each fxxt calculation step description takes a set of parameters.

In another embodiment, the specification states how the added cnxpts and relationships are to be treated.","Fxxt Based Inheritance","As used herein, the term \u201cfxxt based inheritance\u201d refers to inheritance from parents to children only within a fxxt.","Fxxt Based Inverse Inheritance","As used herein, the term \u201cfxxt based inverse inheritance\u201d refers to inheritance from children to parents only within a fxxt.","Fxxted Classification","As used herein, the term \u201cfxxted classification\u201d refers to a subdivision of the CMMDB by those info-items in and not in the fxxt, and then the determination of hierarchy based upon the association and imputed categorical associations between cnxpt info-items in the fxxt. It also refers to the description of the resulting hierarchy by use of a fxxt name where a cnxpt is a member of more than one referenced fxxt or of more than one scopx included in the result of the fxxt analysis, such as Tatented:Applications' which refers to those cnxpts which are patented and which are axpts.","Unconsidered Fxxt Relationships","As used herein, the term \u201cunconsidered fxxt relationships\u201d refers to the set of relationships \u201cnot considered\u201d to be in a fxxt (the \u201cnot considered\u201d set also including the set of \u201cundifferentiated\u201d meanings of relationships where a \u201ccommitted differentiation\u201d is already present in the fxxt). Due to the ordering of operations used to combine fxxts, in some fxxt analyses it is possible that relationships that were not present in either source before the operation might properly be considered a part of the combination step result. The order of operations for combining fxxts may be changed to result in their inclusion. Those relationships (or certain relationship meanings) that could be included in a result but are not because of the ordering of operations are defined to be \u201cnot considered\u201d.","Fundamental Fxxt Category","As used herein, the term \u201cfundamental fxxt category\u201d of a hierarchy within a specific fxxted classification refers to the highest parent in that hierarchy. That category must be a cnxpt in a fxxt, and must not be a child of any cnxpt in that fxxt.","Searching","As used herein, the term \u201csearching\u201d refers to the finding and retrieval of data inside the CMM, hidden in any number of fields in the CMM. The result of the search depends upon the search type and search parameters used. See also \u2018Finding\u2019, \u2018Querying\u2019 and \u2018Goals\u2019.","Searching retrieves data into a result set, and the data may be outside of the view presently holding the focus, either increasing the content of the view as needed or generating a new view where the data in the view includes all info-items containing the search string.","Selection Set","As used herein, the term \u201cselection set\u201d refers to those dxos and txos that have been selected on a visualization or added manually.","Operations can be performed on selection sets. Selection Sets may be named, saved, referenced, visualized, exported, imported, and restored. Selection Sets may be added to, or converted to or from, including but not limited to: results sets, areas of interest, areas of consideration.","A user indicates that one or more displayed objects are important or are to be the subject of a user action. At times this selection set may get very large due to the use of \u2018find's or other tools. No user wants to lose the work involved in building and using these selection sets. Often, the user will want to make use of a selection set on multiple views or different basic sets of data. They may also want to save the selection set across sessions.","A selection set is a super-type of, including but not limited to: Area of Interest, Area of Consideration, Result Set.","Serendipitous Discovery and Update","As used herein, the term \u201cSerendipitous Discovery and Update\u201d refers generally to the user's ability browse displayed ttx areas and discover ttxs that are tangentially related, but important to their search goal. It also includes the user's determination that a ttx is missing or not apparent where it should be, thus then allowing for the ttx's entry or update to make it appear where it should be.","Software","As used herein, the term \u201csoftware\u201d refers generally to programming, documentation, rules, configuration settings and configuration policies, and more specifically to framework components. Framework components in combination enable the operation of the system apparatus as defined below. Software is comprised of analytics, scripts for methodologies, surveys, workflows, websites, configuration information, knowledge content, applications, or infrastructure software.","Statement","As used herein, the term \u201cstatement\u201d refers to a claim or assertion about a ttx. Statements include but are not limited to: ttx characteristics, descriptions, names, name variants, occurrences, purxpts, trxrts, and associations; whereas assignments of identifying locators to cnxpts are not considered statements.","Stigmergy","As used herein, the term \u201cstigmergy\u201d refers generally to the simple rules used to coordinate the efforts of many individuals without heavy controls. The term, whose Greek components mean \u201cmark\u201d (stigma) and \u201cwork\u201d (ergon), is where individuals who follow extremely simple rules and have no memory of either their own or other individual's actions still manage to coordinate their efforts so as to produce a collective result. They coordinate their actions without direct communication.","Survey","As used herein, the term \u201csurvey\u201d refers generally to a series of questions about a ttx, or about the parts or particulars of a ttx, to assist a user in developing including but not limited to: a description, or ascertaining characteristics, attributes, relationships, or the condition, quantity, or quality, such as to find the contour, dimensions, position, or other particulars of the ttx, or to find new alternatives or extensions of a ttx, by asking a series of probing \u2018closed\u2019 questions. It may also seek answers regarding a wide array of other information regarding plans, approaches, etc.","Examples of surveys, include but are not limited to: Methodology Questionnaires; Incomplete Answer Questions.","Template","As used herein, the term \u201ctemplate\u201d refers generally to a starting point provided as a basis for each customer defined object, request, etc.","Topic Navigation Map Standard (TNMS)","As used herein, the term \u201cTNMS\u201d refers generally to the Topic Navigation Map Standard, an international industry standard (ISO 13250) for information management and interchange. Because the logical objects of the present invention may easily be compared against the standard's TNMS Data Model, here the mapping to that model is given specifically.","Topic Map Fundamentals","Topic Mapping is an attempt to capture the essence of these models of the structures of knowledge to facilitate the process of merging modeled indexes together. The core of topic maps can be summarized very succinctly: a topic map consists of a collection of topics, each of which represents some subject. Topics are related to each other by associations, which are typed n-ary combinations of topics. A topic may also be related to any number of resources by its occurrences.","Thesaurus","As used herein, the term \u201cthesaurus\u201d refers to the browsable, interactive, expandable list of word and terms used to suggest related keywords based upon those used by other users. A Context Thesaurus shows keywords that exist in the result set under review. Keyword phrases are thesaurus entries, not cnxpt names.","A thesaurus can act as a search aid by providing a set of controlled terms that can be browsed via some form of hypertext representation. The CMM provides this sort of thesaurus by the display of related ttxs\u2014siblings or dxos that are related as shown by proximity on the map. This can assist the user to understand the context of a ttx, how it is used in a particular thesaurus and provide feedback on number of postings in the thesaurus for terms (or combinations of terms). The inclusion of semantic relationships in the index space, moreover, provides the opportunity for knowledge-based approaches where the system takes a more active role in building a query by automatic reasoning over the relationships. Candidate terms can be suggested for a user to consider in refining a query and various forms of query expansion are possible. For example, items indexed by terms semantically close to query terms can be included in a ranked result list and imprecise matching between two media items is useful in \u2018More like this\u2019 options that may be presented to the user. The basis for such automatic term expansion is some kind of semantic distance measure, often based on the minimum number of semantic relationships that must be traversed in order to connect the terms. This system provides the ability for the user to simply hide all of these types of result sets until they \u2018take a turn\u2019 in traversing to begin flying thru a nearby ttx rather than continuing their fly-through directly deeper into the 3D map.","Themes","As used herein, the term \u201ctheme\u201d refers to members of a set of scopxs where a scopx is specified as consisting of a set of topics. Each theme contributes to the extent of the scopx that the themes collectively define; a given scopx is the union of the subjects of the set of themes used to specify that scopx. The theme is a carryover from the Topic Map Standard (ISO 13250, 1999).","Ttx Hunting","As used herein, the term \u201cttx hunting\u201d refers to the process of finding ttx identified, present in, connected with, or cited by a source. In one embodiment the sources may include, but are not limited to: a website, a search engine, submissions, surveys, or a document management system.","Tour","As used herein, the term \u201ctour\u201d refers to the ordered set of visits made by a user to dxos in a visualization. Another way to think of a tour is what a user would see as they navigate through a visualization during some period of time. Tours may be recorded, saved, and named. Named tours may be used by those sharing a map so that one user may properly describe what they see to another user viewing a map simultaneously or on a different display or at a different time.","TPL","As used herein, the term \u201cTPL\u201d or \u201cTheories, Principles, Laws\u201d refers to an innovative methodology to utilize changes seen in scientific theories, engineering principles, or laws of nature to determine the aging of a technology engineered to operate in a use or environment where those theories, principals, or laws must be reckoned with to achieve design success. The methodology is evident where the example of where the theory of wingtip vortices improved and thus winglets were added as design features, and an older aircraft wing design became obsolete, requiring engineering changes. This example shows that a predictor is available from detecting significant changes occurring in the theory applicable to the design, here such as the theory of wing vortices. The design of wings must also take into consideration laws of aerodynamics, low and high temperature principles, etc. As each of these theories, principles, or laws is developed, some \u2018tweak\u2019 of the basic technology is needed to improve or modernize the technology. As a large number of important changes are seen, the older technology will be inefficient and obsolete. If the rate of change in a \u2018relevant\u2019 theory, principle, or law is high, the rate of innovation should be high if the market is in need of solutions. This technique varies from the TRIZ \u2018Laws of Technical Systems Evolution\u2019 which is also useful in prediction (see below). In a limited view, the TPL methodology is similar to the use of \u201cscientific effects\u201d of TRIZ to determine \u2018ideality\u2019, but TPL analysis varies as it provides an indicator of a gap based upon an unaddressed new understanding of a theory, law, principle, practice, or other guiding framework which forms a design criterion.","TPL methodologies are also applicable to legal work and this system's applicability there. If the rate of change in a legal theory of a case is rapid, the theory needs work. If the law changes rapidly, those affected must be in tune with the changes.","TPL theories, principles, and laws are represented by tplxpt cnxpt info-items and associated with other cnxpts.","TRIZ","As used herein, the term \u201cTRIZ\u201d refers to a methodology where universal principles of creativity are culled to form a basis for suggesting creative innovations because problems and solutions are repeated across industries and sciences, the \u201ccontradictions\u201d predict good creative solutions to that and thus other problems, and creative innovations often use scientific effects outside the field where they were developed.","Types->infxtypx","As used herein, the term \u201ctype\u201d refers to the indication that an info-item is a specialization of a native info-item into an instance with specialized properties as defined for the \u2018type\u2019. A infxtypx is a tpx that captures some commonality in a set of tpxs. Any tpx that belongs to the extension of a particular infxtypx is known as an instance of that infxtypx. A infxtypx may itself be an instance of another infxtypx, and there is no limit to the number of infxtypxs a tpx may be an instance of Native info-items which may be typed include but are not limited to: txos, dxos, and relationships. The types of an info-item define the class (or classes) of tpx that the tpx represented by the info-item belongs to. Types are treated in topic maps as ttxs in their own right; hence every type is represented by a topic in a topic map, and here, every infxtypx is represented by a txo. The infxtypx of a txo is specified simply by a privileged form of relationship between the info-item and the specialized txo that represents the infxtypx. The relationship between a txo and its type is a typical class-instance relationship, where an instance (the sub-class type) inherits properties of the class, but different instances (different sub-classes) may inherit different properties.","Infxtypxs are severely limited in meaning, characterizing txos to be of one broad knowledge domain construct or another, but not as being a categorization tool for ttxs where other approaches to characterization would be more efficient. Any given txo is an instance of zero or more infxtypx. Here, the use of types is limited to expression of system structure, and while ttxs can be categorized according to their kind, infxtypx are not used to indicate ttx categories other than those in the inheritance hierarchy for the native info-item.","Thus, Puccini would be a cnxpt of type \u201ccomposer\u201d, Tosca and Madame Butterfly cnxpts of type \u201copera\u201d, Rome and Lucca cnxpts of type \u201ccity\u201d, Italy a cnxpt of type \u201ccountry\u201d, etc. in a CMM for a knowledge domain directly involving music and its local. In a CMM about medicine, Puccini would be a cnxpt of type \u201cperson\u201d, Tosca and Madame Butterfly would not be cnxpts, Rome, Lucca, and Italy would be cnxpts of type \u201clocation\u201d (and have roles in a ttx hierarchy regarding locations), etc.","Core Subject Identifiers","The system of this application relies upon the use of core identifier attributes for specifying identities for infxtypxs, similar to as in the TNMS, to ensure system-wide consistency for typing. All core identifier attributes are distinct, that is, txos representing these tpxs cannot be merged with one another.","In one embodiment, the type-instance relationship is not transitive. That is, if B is an instance of the infxtypx A, and C is an instance of the infxtypx B, it does not follow that C is an instance of A.","Relationship Types","In one embodiment, specializations of relationships are edges between txos of specific infxtypxs, including, but not limited to: association, occurrence, imputed categorical, temporal, purxpt, affinitive, trxrt, scopx, fxxt specification, nexus, query, result set, derivation, internal information resource, citation, and interest relationships.","Association Types","Associations can be grouped according to a type called \u2018role\u2019 according to the roles of the objects at an endpoint of a relationship opposite from a cnxpt, association roles include but are not limited to:\n\n","In one embodiment, association types determine the weighting of the association as an identity indicator.","Occurrences Types","Occurrences can be grouped according to a type called \u2018role\u2019, including, but not limited to: relevant page, patent, patent claim, mention, research paper, precise ttx definition, article, and commentary, or other tpx. In one embodiment, occurrence types determine the weighting of the occurrence as an identity indicator.","Cross References","As used herein, the term \u201ccross reference\u201d refers to an (an informal link), the anchors (or end points) of the hyperlink occur within the information resources (although the link itself might be outside them). It may be a URI.","Visit","As used herein, the term \u201cvisit\u201d refers to the bringing into narrow focus of a dxo or the moving of the visualization viewpoint to the proximate location of a dxo. Where applied to txos, the term \u201cvisit\u201d refers to the touching of or processing of a txo or cnxpt while traversing the CMMDB ontology.","Visualization","As used herein, the term \u201cvisualization process\u201d (or \u201cvisualization\u201d used in the context of a process) refers to a specific process for developing and displaying a visual aid based upon data. It results in a display on a user's viewing device showing something that he can look through by navigation, where there is some meaning to the positioning of the info-items and other visualization objects on the screen.","In addition, the term \u201cvisualization\u201d where used as a noun (or adjective not used in the context of a process) refers to the result of the visualization process.","Voting","As used herein, the term \u201cvoting\u201d refers to the addition of information that describes, including but not limited to: characteristics such as purxpts, trxrts, or attributes of a ttx or a relationship, or a request to change, make an addition to, or delete information from a description, a cncpttrrt description, a value of a characteristic, or a value of an attribute of the ttx or of a relationship. Voting also includes requests to the system stating that, including but not limited to: a ttx should or should not exist; that a relationship should or should not exist; that two ttxs are or are not the same; that one ttx is related to another by a specific relationship scopx; that an information resource is relevant to or defines a ttx and should be in an occurrence relationship with the cnxpt (or goal); that a ttx is derived from (or another relationship infxtypx, fxxt, or scopx) another ttx; that a ttx has a trxrt; that an info-item specified by the rsxitem is relevant to a ttx; that a user has visited a ttx and is thus \u2018interested\u2019 in the ttx, that a goal has been met or has not been met, that a goal has not been met but should be converted to a cnxpt; or that a cnxpt (or goal) is similar or identical in meaning to another.","As the CMMDB is used, information is collected as txo information or as relationship information. Much of the information is considered \u2018voting\u2019 information.","In one embodiment, different types of votes may be tallied differently. This form of \u2018voting\u2019 is really a consensus decision-making decision process that not only seeks the agreement of most participants, but also seeks to resolve or mitigate the objections of the minority to achieve the most agreeable decision.","In one embodiment, for txo or cnxpt voting transactions, new vote records referring to the txo or cnxpt are created one per vote. For cnxpt votes, summarization of votes involves, including but not limited to: \u2018existence\u2019, \u2018difference\u2019, \u2018information addition\u2019, \u2018interest\u2019, and \u2018improvement\u2019 votes, by scopx.","In one embodiment, for relationship voting transactions, new relationship records are created one per vote. For relationship votes, summarization of votes involves, including but not limited to: \u2018existence\u2019, \u2018interest\u2019, and \u2018correctness\u2019 votes, by scopx and infxtypx.","In one embodiment, characteristics information is added as votes. Each edit of a characteristic is a vote, and votes are tallied by the system to come up with the actual description of the characteristic as seen by public users. Private users can utilize scopxs, fxxt analysis, and filters to add weight to the votes that they have entered. Users will be encouraged to narrow to abstraction and to unify entire descriptions for voting.","In one embodiment, attribute edits are added as votes. Each edit of an attribute is a vote, and votes are, where attributes can be converted to numeric values, time weighted averaged according to expertise of the voter to come up with the actual attribute value as seen by public users. Private users can utilize scopxs, fxxt analysis, and filters to add weight to the votes that they have entered.","In one embodiment, descriptions, characteristics, and names may be entered as votes in multiple languages as variants, and each may be voted upon by other users separately. Descriptions, and names may be viewed in multiple languages and displayed according to the language the user has selected by use of scopxs, fxxt analysis, and filters.","In one embodiment, edits to a description are more complex, and are kept simple by allowing only a simple \u2018replacement is better or not\u2019 vote. If anyone disagrees with a newly provided description, then a negative vote is cast, while those that agree cast a positive vote. If the total is greater (with weighting) than 0, then the new description is used.","A name is \u2018elected\u2019 by a weighted tallying process.","Voting Ontology","As used herein, the term \u201cvoting ontology\u201d refers to the mechanisms for gaining consensus about the data within an ontology. User entered changes to the txo or relationship information are subject to weighting against and alongside other changes entered by other users, and thus these changes are considered votes for a change rather than an order to make the change itself.","An expertise level for the voter is entered into weighting of the vote. Votes also have to be civil, and can be blocked editorially if they are not.","Generality of relationship is considered in calculating totals in that a very general statement is weighted less and less over time (weighted average strengths decrease strength of new entries).","Forms of voting include but are not limited to: development of queries, every edit (on cnxpts, attributes, or relationships), showing of interest by visiting ttxs.","The mechanism also deals with the issues of \u2018what if\u2019, \u2018belief\u2019, \u2018assuredness, certitude, or conviction\u2019, and \u2018self-reliance\u2019. For instance, with \u2018what if\u2019, the votes are used temporarily while the user settles on their \u2018belief.\u2019 For \u2018assuredness, certitude, or conviction\u2019, the user is stating that they are really more expert in their opinion than others, and this forcefulness, to a point, can be used to slightly affect the voting for some period of time. With \u2018self-reliance\u2019, the user accepts that their view of the world is different and yet they wish to retain it even if others vote against them. The display technique allowing ones own views to have priority is one form of \u2018Filtering\u2019.","Of course, security of proprietary information, due regard to privacy, competition, access compartmentalization, and other group dynamics must be considered. Trust increases if people feel that they are equal participants within a collaborative environment, especially if they can make use of the shared, retained knowledge of the system and yet see the impact of facilities that protect their rights.","Weights","As used herein, the term \u201cweight\u201d refers to a value set as a surrogate for the true relevance of an assertion, such as that a relationship should exist, or that a name is appropriate for an info-item. An expertise level for the user making a change, doing a search, or voting is used as a basis in calculating the weight assigned to the relationship or info-item affected.","Workflow","As used herein, the term \u201cworkflow\u201d refers to a defined set of task steps managed by the system to help a user or a set of users (not necessarily known by each other) to complete a larger task.","In a standard topic map the objective is to correctly match topics to a subject, with only expert users. Here, the objective is to use the consensus of users with a range of sophistication to both refine definitions for topics to match them to known subjects, refine definitions for topics to make them better definitions for previously unknown but reasonable subjects, to collect information regarding and relevant to the subjects to characterize and relate them to other information, and to refine categorizations of topics.","Alternative Purpose Description","Comparison with Topic Map Standards","What distinguishes the concept here from the Topic Map Standard and other efforts is the distinct rejection of subject identifications as an issue. Rather than identification, a comparison and placement structure provides a deep organizational structure that is valuable \u2018enough\u2019 for users to gain understanding rapidly, but it does not try to identify any topic as being identical to another. By allowing a deep detailing of a subject and by retaining the thought behind it, the detail can provide a better comparison and better, deep organization. A terminology comparison will be made available to the examiner as needed.","See ISO\/IEC JTC1\/SC34, Topic Maps\u2014Data Model, Jun. 3, 2008, Available at http:\/\/www.isotopicmaps.org\/sam\/sam-model\/#terms-and-definitions.","Top Level for Structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1518","num":"1968"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Manner of How Preferred Embodiment Works","Information Categorization and Retrieval Management Lifecycle with Top Level Process Flows","To achieve improvements in innovation, the creativity lifecycle must include a facility to capture user \u2018conjuring\u2019 early on into a visualizable Mental Map and provide for effective storage, access, and reuse of the thinking.

In one embodiment, it is technology. For each user project, the users prepare their own study focus and thus their own specific methodology beyond what others have provided for reuse. A range of uses and methodologies result among users and over time. Users adjust their plan as they need and may have multiple studies with different purposes in process at once. The range of uses includes not merely viewing maps of information or performing studies, but also, including but not limited to: selling information and services, advertising, networking, investing, obtaining patent protection, teaching, planning products, entrepreneurial activities, finding solutions, offering and obtaining rewards, and playing games. Preparation also provides for system implementation, provisioning for use, and administration.","The Generation Step results in the capture of a large set of descriptive statements regarding the focus. In one embodiment, where the focus is technology, the descriptive statements relate to tcepts and appcepts. Results of ideation methods, whether or not performed within the system, used to accomplish this are entered, including, but not limited to: traditional brainstorming, brain writing, nominal group techniques, focus groups, qualitative text analysis, incremental innovation, from writing of goals or searches, by tours and placing ttx ideas, by stating cncpttrrts, stating purlieus, by connecting ttxs, by result set culling, by assisted methodologies, feature extension, surveys, or others listed below. Generation occurs perpetually, and among a wide set of dissociated users often not involved in a study, and possibly still contributing to the ideation and perhaps without realizing it. Generation also allows for the reuse of prior ideation by the study team and others. Generation generally includes creation of representatives for ttxs called cnxpts; forming of relationships between cnxpts; naming (labeling) the cnxpts; and adding characteristics for the cnxpts; including but not limited to: descriptions, cncpttrrts, purlieus, occurrences, attributes, ratings; forming and culling result sets associated with the cnxpts; and assigning scopxs.","The Structuring Step results in sortings of the accumulated information in preexisting or new categories, based upon formed relationships; defining of scopxs; and forming fxxts. Generation and Structuring are highly intertwined. For example, stating goals and executing their queries and culling their result sets may be used for Structuring as well as Generation. Automatic semantic distancing and other topic merging techniques suggest consolidation of ttxs. Prior interest and past filtering specifications and results augment voting and merging to divine a structuring for the relationships underlying a mapping. Structuring makes use of the efforts of many dissociated users on a perpetual basis and the results are cumulative and reusable. In one embodiment, the accumulated information is a consensus built up from the users' input based upon summarization of ratings and categorizations by statistical analyses of the strength of relationships between cnxpts along various types of relationships, resulting in a measure of closeness of ttxs. Cluster analysis on the output of the multidimensional scaling partitions the map into clusters of statements or ideas.","The Representation Step provides analysis by taking the accumulated information and \u201crepresenting\u201d it in map form suitable for the purpose of the study. Mathematical analysis of the categorization \u2018ontology\u2019 generates taxonomies based upon various fxxts in the cnxpt structure. Portions of the representation step are performed on a periodic basis, and some is performed as the user wishes to change their view of the data by using different filters, fxxts, etc. Filters, fxxts, tours, and viewpoints may be shared and reused.","The Interpretation Step yields refinements of the accumulated information allowing users to utilize their own labels and interpretations for the various maps they produce from the CMMDB to better suit their purpose. For instance, maps may be used for prior art searching, and one ttx may be designated as the focus of the prior art search study. Also, the user may adjust their CMMV view of the CMMDB to use their own labels, cnxpt relationships, cnxpts, and filters to provide a custom map for their own interpretation. Interpretation may, but does not necessarily remove the opportunity to include newly accumulated CMMDB information and thus the Interpretation provides for new altered and more current maps without additional work by a user.","The Utilization Step involves using the maps to help address the original focus. They can be used as the basis for, including but not limited to: searching, investing, competitive intelligence, performing ad hoc or methodology based studies, developing product comparisons, providing communities with information, displaying results, viewing maps of information, selling information and services, advertising, networking, investing, obtaining patent protection, teaching, planning products, entrepreneurial activities, obtaining investment, finding solutions, offering and obtaining rewards, and playing games. Maps may be shared in collaboration, exported, used as the basis for derivative or periodic studies, etc. Alerts provide for notice when changes occur.","Collective Problem-Solving","In this system, the objective is continual improvement of the data in the CMM and all improvements are intentionally incremental, and are performed under stigmergy.","The efficiency of mental problem-solving depends on the way the problem is represented inside the cognitive system\u2014the mental map. Here, the problem is reduced in complexity to the definition of a ttx and its relationship to other ttxs. This limits the complexity of the system relative to systems where the CMM is used for collected problem solving solution selection.","One way to solve a problem is by trial-and-error in the real world: just try out some action and see whether it brings about the desired effect. Such an approach is obviously inefficient for all but the most trivial problems. Intelligence is characterized by the fact that this exploration of possible actions takes place mentally, so that actions can be selected or rejected \u201cinside one's head\u201d, before executing them in reality. The more efficient this mental exploration, that is, the less trial-and-error needed to find the solution, the more intelligent the problem-solver. This relates to the present system in that the consensus is built with the knowledge of the changes suggested by others, so those making suggestions will have their reputation at stake.","Coordinating Individual Problem-Solutions","Because the CMM is limited in purpose, the conceptual framework needs to apply only to the definitional level rather than to collective problem-solving of a different scale. This limitation of scope and purpose seems critical to retain focus and limit issues. Still, that higher scale of problem-solving is incredibly more easy to accomplish where values and priorities can be set first, and where definitional information is available.","Each individual will start with his or her own mental map but will assist in moving the CMM toward their internal map only where they see a lack of definition or a poor definition. At some point, the authority of the CMM will improve to a point where it matches most users internal maps. However, individual mental maps are not objective reflections of the real world, and even if they were, at some point the individual will get creative or the world will change.","Thus the internal and common maps will also be to an important degree different. This constant differential is healthy because it means that different individuals can complement each others' weaknesses.","Address and Reduce Obstacles to Collective Intelligence","Obstacles to Collective Intelligence","First, however competent the participants, their individual intelligence is still limited, and this imposes a fundamental restriction on their ability to cooperate. Another recurrent problem is that people tend to play power games. Everybody would like to be recognized as the smartest or most important person in the group, and is therefore inclined to dismiss any opinion different from his or her own. Such power games often end up with the establishment of a \u201cpecking order\u201d, where the one at the top can criticize everyone, while the one at the bottom can criticize no one. The result is that the people at the bottom are rarely ever paid attention to, however smart their suggestions.","It seems that the problem might be tackled by splitting up the committee into small groups. Instead of a single speaker centrally directing the proceedings, the activities might now go on in parallel, thus allowing many more aspects to be discussed simultaneously. However, now a new problem arises: that of coordination. To tackle a problem collectively, the different subgroups must keep close contact. This implies a constant exchange of information so that the different groups would know what the others are doing, and can use each other's results. But this again creates a great information load, taxing both the communication channels and the individual cognitive systems that must process all this incoming information. Such load only becomes larger as the number of participants or groups increases.","Constant Change Request Process","The utility of this is that it provides for high rates and volume of requests for changes in the information held by users. Users will maintain the CMM by making requests that serve as concise votes on the information, and the tallying of the votes must be an extremely easy process not requiring human effort or intervention other than by offering a survey to users.","Constant Improvement in CMM","The utility of this is that it provides the facilities to continually improve the data in the CMMDB. The objective of the system is to improve the data that everyone is getting the value from. All efficient mechanisms for doing so should be provided if feasible.","Incentivization","Incentivize Users toward Map Improvement based upon Thinking Style","The utility of this is that it provides incentives to users with each thinking style: Synthesist; Idealist; Pragmatist; Analyst; Realist.","Ideation process","Use Case: Ideation process.","Ideation process includes:\n\n","Not all steps are required in other embodiments.","Ideation Benefits","The steps in the Ideation lifecycle can provide, for example:\n\n","Visualization Navigation Process","Use Case: Visualization Navigation Process.","Visualization Navigation process includes the sub-processes of the other above processes as specialized and:\n\n","Not all steps are required in other embodiments.","Visualization Navigation Benefits","Interest Paths\n\n","These trends over time will help in forecasting fruition of future technologies and serve as a guideline for inventors who are uncertain about what to focus on for invention, entrepreneurs who are uncertain where to focus their development efforts, and investors who want to take a less risky gamble on the future of technologies.","The steps in the lifecycles can provide, for example:\n\n","Adaptation\n\n","Goal Based Searching Process","Use Case: Goal Based Searching Process.","Goal Based Searching process includes the sub-processes of the other above processes as specialized and:\n\n","Not all steps are required in other embodiments.","Goal Based Searching Benefits","Goal Display and Query Process","In one embodiment, when a user creates a goal, the user is shown a new cnxpt-like object on the map visualization. The goal, if not well specified, may appear to surround all or most dxos on the visualization. The result set for the goal when first created is defined to contain all known cnxpts, but it is not usable or displayable in that state. As the goal is further specified, the number of info-items it encloses would normally decrease. If well specified or created within a txo, it is smaller, enclosing fewer or no dxos. The result set for the goal is not fully usable or displayable until the number of rsxitems in it is reduced to a system set threshold, although some number of rsxitems may be displayable.","If the goal encloses no txos on a visualization specified on a specific fxxt and filter, then it is said to have no results within the displayed fxxt or filtering applied, but it may not actually have an empty result set. If it encloses no txos and has no txos in its result set in any fxxt, it is said to be a leaf txo. If it is a goal for finding a tcept and it encloses no txpts, it is said to be an incremental innovation that may or may not be novel.

Development Process\u2014Ttx Mapping Visualization Planning and Use Process","The utility of Ttx Mapping facilities are that users may collectively organize their knowledge using a variety of tools, to build new knowledge and keep it organized, and to visualize the knowledge effectively to gain deeper understanding or to communicate it to others.","In one embodiment, the process is altered to allow for parallel operations. Each of the following processes execute in parallel with the others. The actual results forming any map is the cumulative result of all of these taken a specific point in time.","Preparation Step","Use Case: Preparation Step\u2014The Preparation Step consists of the decision about what to map.","Users may form their subject matter maps. In one embodiment, the subject matter is predefined to be technology and the Preparation Step is completed for the user.","For each user project, the users decide on a specific purpose for using the system and prepare their own study's focus. Different users take this step as they need and may have multiple studies with different purposes in process at once, but the maps here generally allow for interaction giving the ability to a user to dig into a topic deeply and quickly.","Map Design","Use Case: Map Design\u2014Produce an effective communication medium for the information of interest to a user from the CMMDB.","Map design is a process of software development or customization where developers devise new map formats and data extract scenarios for those new formats.","Map design includes the definition of one or more fxxt specifications to form the contents of the map. It may also include definitions for segmentations of the map within boundaries set by the elastic surface based upon, including but not limited to a set of: purlieu, time slices, vertical slices, horizontal slices, zones, quadrants, centroid points and diameters, etc.","Data Abstraction","Generation Step","Use Case: Generation Step\u2014The Generation Step consists of the collective development of the CMM, including data collection, category organization, and manipulation.","In the generation step users collectively develop a large set of descriptive statements regarding the Common Focus. This includes descriptions about ttxs and their interrelationships. Collaboratively, the system is updated by a wide collection of individuals with different specific purposes but with a shared interest in the Common Focus.","A wide variety of ideation methods can be used to obtain update information to accomplish this, including: traditional brainstorming, brainwriting, nominal group techniques, focus groups, qualitative text analysis, and so on. This system also utilizes the writing of queries to obtain new cnxpts from users even as they wonder about new ttxs.","One operation is data collection. Users put in data by creating new cnxpts or relationships, or further describing those cnxpts or relationships. They may even request that a cnxpt or relationship should not exist. Users also enter, alter, and delete other dxos that relate to cnxpts.","Another data collection component is the automatic gathering of data for cnxpts or dxos. This process also finds new relationships based upon the new and existing data in the CMMDB.","Result set culling may be used as an ideation tool as a part of this step to jar the imagination of individuals.","The organization of data in the CMMDB is a continual process. Each user may assist in the effort by stating that a change is in order in the data. These changes are tallied as votes, and the result is the best available organization of the data. This raw data is not easily displayed because it is N-dimensional. Manipulation is required before the map can be created.","This process step occurs perpetually, with users dissociated from those in a study possibly contributing to the brainstorming, perhaps without realizing it. This also allows for the reuse of prior ideation by the study team and others.","In one embodiment, the history of any manipulations and mappings that users perform on the visualization info-items will be stored in the CMM by user, giving each user the ability to undo, roll back, or roll forward any command that they have made throughout. The utility of this facility is that each user can save their work as a project, come back to it at a later time, and redo prior changes.","Structuring Step","Use Case: Structuring Step\u2014In the Structuring Step the users may participate by sorting the descriptions into preexisting or new categories (thus stating and forming relationships) and naming (labeling) the cnxpts, adding\/editing descriptions, and\/or rating the descriptions on one or more scales.","Structuring includes the design process culminating in CMM Knowledge Base Definition. If users properly execute queries and effectively cull result sets, categorization will result as a by product. User studies will very often may make use of the efforts of others, since the structuring process is being carried on by multiple, perhaps dissociated users on a perpetual basis.","Periodically, in one embodiment, the system will manipulate the data in the CMMDB to extract specific summaries and relevant cnxpt data that are properly within a map that a user could understand. This process results in one or more bundles of information (called clumps here) that may be translated into a map easily.","Summarization of ratings and categorizations and statistical analyses are used. A form of multidimensional scaling takes the sort data across all participants and develops a summarization of the strength of relationships between cnxpts along various types of relationships (fxxts), resulting in a measure of closeness of cnxpts when cnxpts related by more users are closer to each other on the map.","For some visualizations, cluster analysis is used on the output of the multidimensional scaling and partitions the map into groups of statements or ideas, into clusters if not already categorized into small enough sets within a category.","To form useful mappings of the data, mathematical analysis of the categorization \u2018ontology\u2019 generates taxonomies based upon each of the various fxxts in the CMMDB structure. Portions of the representation step are performed on a periodic basis, and some is performed as the user wishes to change their view of the data by using different filters, etc.","The efficiency of this step is enhanced by doing recalculations only on an as needed basis.","Representation Step","Use Case: Representation Step\u2014The Representation Step is where the analysis is done\u2014this is the process of taking the results and \u201crepresenting\u201d them in various map forms for expeditious use and for communicating the information to users effectively.","Map representation is a user process of customization to devise new map formats and data extract scenarios for those new formats.","Artwork Preparation","Use Case: Artwork Preparation\u2014Convert the data that is to make up a map into a graphical map.","The actual display artwork will be created by the application program.","Also, in one embodiment, map design can be accomplished to a degree by each user by providing new graphic settings, colors, filtering parameters, etc. that take effect either during the request for the map data or when the data is assembled into a map by the user application program.","Map Artwork Retrieval","A clump of information making up a segment of a map is accessed by a user interface (application program) when the user requests a visual representation of it. The application program requests the data and a server obtains the data from the database to build a map on the user's screen as a visualization, for an export, or for printing.","This clump of information is accessed by a user in that their user interface (application program) obtains the data from the database to build a map on the user's screen as a visualization, for an export, or for printing. In one embodiment, users having different filtering parameters will receive different visual results for the map based upon the same underlying data from the clump, and can each be seeing different portions of the same clump at the same time in one or more of their own windows. They may also be viewing the clump from a Descendant or Ascendant duality.","Users having different filtering parameters will receive different visual results for the map based upon the same underlying data from the clump.","Map Reproduction","Use Case: Map Reproduction\u2014Display a map for a user that has been accessed and saved by a user (possibly the same user).","The map may have been tailored by filters, had annotations added such as \u2018tours\u2019, placeholders, notes, etc. and the user may share it collaboratively with others.","Map reproduction is the process of saving and reopening\/reviewing maps, sharing of maps during close collaboration (conferencing), through the process of reuse of the clump of information by distribution to multiple users as a data stream, through printing of portions of the map, or through exportation of map data for use outside the application program.","Interpretation Step","Use Case: Interpretation Step\u2014The Interpretation Step consists of the study of the CMM.","Users may form their own interpretations for the various maps produced from the CMMDB.","For instance, maps may be used for prior art searching, and one cnxpt may be designated as the focus of the study. The user may adjust their view of the CMMV to use their own labels, cnxpt relationships, cnxpts, and filters to provide a custom map for their own interpretation.","Utilization Step","Use Case: Utilization Step\u2014The Utilization Step involves using the maps to help address each user's original focus for their use of the system.","The maps and the collected information can be used as the basis for searching, developing product comparisons, or displaying results, among others. Maps may be shared in collaboration, exported, used as the basis for derivative or periodic studies, etc. With the online interactive system here, generation and utilization occur simultaneously.","Ideation Process","Setup System","Establish Common Mental Map","Use Case: Establish Common Mental Map\u2014Create infrastructure for the CMM and load basic CMM objects to establish a working system and CMMDB.","CMM Initiation Process","The CMM is started by automated consolidation of existing indices and tools such as cluster and cross-citation analysis, described below, but is maintained and extended by crowd sourced collaboration, the ease of which is improved by effective visualization and editing interfaces. Relationships within the Map are the basis for reaching consensus on the accuracy of the categorizations, namings, and descriptions. Currency of the contents is improved by a process called concretizing wherein users' thoughts (conjurings) are rapidly infused into the CMM.","Initial Loading","Available categorization schemes are used to start populating the ontology as the taxonometric relationships are imported as relationships between the categories represented by txpts.

Users think up new ttxs to search for, and thus provide ideas that are not well defined but new nonetheless. There is no wait for cataloguers, etc. to restrict the flow of information into the CMM. Along with the possible creation of a new ttx, within the search process, new information, possibly relevant, is brought into the knowledgebase and culled for relevance to the ttx being sought.

For example, many organizations have built information retrieval systems to permit users to obtain documents published by that organization. In one embodiment, a search system that can index and catalogue information stored in many different formats on different websites, permitting users to perform a search through a single web portal, is provided. The ability to penetrate the content of some sites by more sophisticated searching techniques such as DeepWeb and\/or by use of an account while at the same time searching other simpler engines greatly speeds the overall search effort.","In one embodiment, there are various distinct forms of searching in, including, but not limited to: the CMMDB, in external data stores, on the internet, in an editor pane, on the visualization display, etc. This provides a range of customizable query options that is broad and flexible enough to allow users to produce query results that are useful and accurate.","The info-items involved in searching and querying are, including but not limited to: search txos, query txos, goals, result sets, selection sets, Areas of Consideration, Areas of Interest, selection set items, and rsxitems.","Impulse Retrieval Procedure","Use Case: Impulse Retrieval Procedure\u2014Wander around the data in the CMMV and to serendipitously find ttxs of interest.","The change from navigation to a recognition of interest and an indication of a dxo on the visualization is the point at which the process is completed.","This facility allows users to find something of interest without finding, searching, or querying or after finding, searching, or querying narrows their search. This procedure may be begun at any point in the navigation of the visualization. The utility of this is that it provides users with the ability to retrieve ttxs as they see them.","In combination with indication and goal placement, impulse retrieval adds to the users' ability to refine a search for a ttx by adding relevant information as criteria for the goal.","Lookup\u2014Simple Finding\u2014Focus to a Specific Dxo","The purpose of Finding is to locate one or more Dxos in a visualization or listing, or in multiple visualizations or listings, or rsxitems in a result set the user is viewing. The number of dxos that may be on a display at a specific time may be quite large. Locating a specific dxo is tedious without a tool to do so.","In one embodiment, when finding, the user is seeking to find an existing dxo having a specific name or name variant. In one embodiment, when finding, the user is additionally seeking to find an existing dxo having a specific string in a description or description variant. In one embodiment, when finding, the user is additionally seeking to find an existing dxo having a specific string in an associated trxrt.","In one embodiment, the user uses the Focus Selection panel in order speed-up the search. This panel displays all the names of dxos in the current display that contain the string that a user enters into the panel input field.

In one embodiment, this panel additionally displays all the names of dxos in the current display which have an associated trxrt that contains the string that a user enters into the panel input field.","In one embodiment, the user uses the Focus Selection Tree View panel to speed-up the search. This panel displays a table of contents in the form of a tree visualization or a 3D tree visualization containing all the names of dxos in the current display that contain the string that a user enters into the panel input field. In one embodiment, a Focus Selection Tree View panel may contain two columns, one containing description terms and one containing the associated dxo names. In one embodiment, a Focus Selection Tree View panel may contain two columns, one containing cncpttrrt terms and one containing the associated dxo names. Other visualizations usable in the Focus Selection Tree View panel include self-organizing graphs of nodes or hierarchical constructs.","To locate a specific dxo, the user begins typing a string to fill the list of names (or terms). When the number of names (or terms) is short enough, the user finds the dxo of interest in the list and clicks on it.","At this time the display will locate the dxo and automatically scroll the window (or move the viewpoint) to bring that dxo into focus.","In combination with indication and goal placement, finding adds to the users' ability to refine a search for a ttx by adding relevant information as criteria for the goal.","Find","Finding is valuable for finding data INSIDE the visualization or list being viewed.","The objective of the Find procedure is, in one embodiment, to search for a string of characters to navigate to and to show the next instance of the string in the view or the data behind the view that a user is \u2018finding\u2019 in. The dxo containing the next instance of the find string is brought into focus (viewpoint is moved) and indicated.","A Find consists of entering a (wild-carded) \u2018find\u2019 string to find each match (the next instance) of a combination of any characters, including uppercase and lowercase characters, whole words, or parts of words, or regular expression, in the dxo names, titles, descriptions, cncpttrrts or connected information within a CMMV view. Find acts like the typical \u2018find next\u2019 command because the next instance found is the next FROM the current context, and wrapping is optional. Find First will take a user all the way to the \u2018top\u2019 of the context, and that is not usually well understood by the user until they become familiar with the tool.","Find may be used to populate the Focus Selection panels.","Use Case: Specify\/Invoke Find\u2014Specify and then invoke execution of a Find lookup to adjust positioning of the visualization to the first item containing the string sought.","Use Case: Specify\/Invoke Find Again\u2014Specify and then invoke execution of a Find Again lookup to adjust positioning of the visualization to the next item containing the string sought.","FindAll","The objective of the FindAll procedure is, in one embodiment, to use an entered (wild-carded) \u2018find\u2019 string to find all matches of a combination of any characters, including uppercase and lowercase characters, whole words, or parts of words, or regular expression, in the dxo names, titles, or connected information within a CMMV view. In a single object, all of the found strings will be highlighted. In a list or visualization, all of the items containing the string will be selected and become members of the selection set.","FindAll may be used to populate the Focus Selection panels.","Use Case: Specify\/Invoke FindAll\u2014Specify and then invoke execution of a FindAll lookup to adjust positioning of the visualization and fill the table of contents views on Focus Selection panels.","FindIntoView Procedure","The objective of the FindlntoView procedure is, in one embodiment, to use an entered (wild-carded) \u2018find\u2019 string to find each match of a combination of any characters, including uppercase and lowercase characters, whole words, or parts of words, or regular expression, in the dxo names, titles, or connected information within a CMMV view presently holding the focus, and bring it into the view. This is equivalent to increasing the content of the view as needed. The data in the view will be changed to include all dxos containing the find string with the FindIntoView command. To cause less trouble for the user, only a proportionate increase in the number of dxos in the view will be allowed, and the user will be suitably notified that more can be added by repeating the FindIntoView and the total number of dxos that would be found.","FindIntoView may be used to populate the Focus Selection panels.","Use Case: Specify\/Invoke FindIntoView\u2014Specify and then invoke execution of a FindIntoView lookup to adjust positioning of the visualization and fill the table of contents views on Focus Selection panels.","Result Set Find","The objective of the Result Set Find procedure is to use a result set as a basis for a FindAll command to find info-items listed in the result set on the current visualization, if they are on the visualization.

The result set, whenever possible and depending upon the search command, is used to focus a current visualization, to create a new selection set of dxos on the view presently holding the focus, to create a new visualization or list, and\/or to fill a table of contents view on Focus Selection panels.","Searching is valuable for finding data INSIDE the CMM, hidden in any number of fields. All of the data in the system is structured, but some of the data is information resource locator (hyperlink) information referencing data outside the system. The result of the search depends upon the search procedure and parameters used.","In one embodiment, with proper parameters set, the search will encompass those external information resources for which information resource locators are in the CMM.","Visualizations display one or more specific info-item types. When a search is performed that is to result (by parameters specified or by visualization definition) in a certain set of info-item types in the visualization, info-items of other types listed in the result set of the search as rsxitems are not displayed in the visualization.","In one embodiment, the search will result in a new selection set of dxos on the visualization view presently holding the focus. If this is inappropriate because of the nature of data retrieved due to the parameters, then a new view with the proper format and procedures will be opened to display the data found. The system will always attempt to form a selection set of cnxpts and display it as a default process.","In combination with indication and goal placement, searching adds to the users' ability to refine a search for a ttx by adding relevant information as criteria for the goal.","Where the search may result in a cnxpt, or may result in information useful as relevant to a new cnxpt, searching may generate a temporary goal that may later become a new cnxpt in the CMM. For example, a search for traits may result in a list of rsxitems which could be relevant to describe a new cnxpt, and in one embodiment, the system would suggest that the search and results be used for a goal by creating the goal and attaching the search and results by internal relationships. In one embodiment, the user would be required to request that the goal be created.","Search for Interesting Ttxs","Use Case: Search for Interesting Ttxs\u2014See ttxs represented by cnxpts that a user wishes to know about.","Searching directly for a cnxpt involves standard name or subject searching, or associative searching by visualization, covered below.","Searching indirectly for a cnxpt involves searching of attached information and involves result set searching by, including, but not limited to the following types.","Search for Interesting Tpxs","Use Case: Search for Interesting Tpxs\u2014See tpxs represented by txos that a user wishes to know about, including infrastructure tpxs.","Search for Interesting Cncpttrrts","Use Case: Search for Interesting Cncpttrrts\u2014See cncpttrrts represented by trxrts that a user wishes to know about.","Search for Interesting Purlieus","Use Case: Search for Interesting Purlieus\u2014See purlieus represented by purxpts that a user wishes to know about.","Search for Interesting Keywords","Use Case: Search for Interesting Keywords\u2014See Keywords represented by kwxs that a user wishes to know about.","Word Search Procedure","The objective of the Word Search procedure is, in one embodiment, to use an entered \u2018word search\u2019 command to find data INSIDE the CMM matching the command criteria.","The process a user takes to find a set of words is: the user enters any number of search words, each separated by a space character or otherwise following the search syntax, and then presses the \u2018SEARCH\u2019 button. In one embodiment, the system will search its entire CMM in user visible data fields. In one embodiment, alternative search locations are available.","In one embodiment, with proper parameters set, the search will encompass those external information resources for which information resource locators are in the CMM.","The utility of searching is that it allows for a wealth of search structures, including, but not limited to Boolean word search, advanced searches involving attribute names, unstructured database searches, structured data searches, returning collateral information resources, re-utilizing internal information resources, topic map searching, and combinations thereof.","Term Search on Info-item Names, Descriptions","Use Case: Term Search on Info-item Names, Descriptions\u2014Search specific user accessible and viewable CMM info-items that contain a phrase a user wishes to know about.","Search for Phrase Anywhere","Use Case: Search for Phrase Anywhere\u2014Search all user accessible and viewable CMM info-items that contain a phrase a user wishes to know about.","Result Set Search","The objective of the Result Set Search procedure is to use a result set as a basis for a Search command to locate in the CMM those info-items that are listed in the result set.

The searching user navigates around and into the categories. Each cnxpt is at a level in a taxonomy. The strength of relationships between cnxpts determines their locations in the visualization. Each category cnxpt also represents a cntexxt a new ttx might be added. Associative searching, by itself, does not leave behind a cnxpt stemming from the user's ttx, but the interest shown in an area of cnxpts is highly useful. Also, the user at any time may indicate that his ttx should be at a certain place it is not, and thus concretize it at that spot in that category with that cnxpt as a parent in that fxxt he is navigating in. He may also navigate other fxxt visualizations and place the same ttx under different parents in that visualization of that fxxt.","Without the categorization of associative search, entry of new cnxpts is highly manual.","The strongest indicator of where a ttx belongs is provided when a user moves the goal to become a child of a cnxpt on a visualization of a certain fxxt. To locate that new spot may involve significant navigation.","Automated assistance to find a ttx is provided by queries and searches. These may be used to move a user's context to a different cntexxt. This is accomplished by evaluating a result set and determining based upon the result set where the ttx should be placed in the category if the result set was a sufficient knowledgebase to provide it. The result set is manipulated to find cntexxts where the ttx should be placed, in the order by strength of the cntexxt. The placement is fxxt dependent only if cntexxts involving descendency were found, and then only if the strength of such a cntexxt was higher than those cntexxts not involving descendency. [See Procedure\u2014New Category Generation and Category Relation Generation From Result Set] The strongest result set based placement occurs when the Result Set is attached to a goal as a parent. [See Procedure\u2014ATTACH a Result Set to Goal as PARENTS] Secondary placements occur where the result set is attached as a sibling or children list. [See Procedure\u2014ATTACH a Result Set to Goal as SIBLINGS] [See Procedure\u2014ATTACH a Result Set to Goal as CHILDREN]","While these automated tools assist, they are not perfect, so the user must navigate as well.","In building the CMM, the assistance tools above are used to obtain ttxs from existing information and then to form cnxpts automatically for later use and refinement by users. Without assistance in cataloging, the new cnxpt, categorizing of new cnxpts is highly manual. Both Associative search and assistance in cataloging are heavily dependent upon the existence of the categorization structure itself.","Goal Based Searching Process","Goals","The overall purpose of pursuing a goal is to find a preexisting ttx. Additionally, where the goal ttx is not found, the purpose of the goal it to define a ttx. The ttx can inherit from its context, so categorization is very important. The ttx in a user's mind is formed in the CMM by categorizing the goal representing it; by finding relevant information about it due to its similarity to another ttx, or a set of ttxs, and indirectly relating that information to the user's the goal by relating to those cnxpts; by connecting information from external sources or captured information resources (that are not necessarily structured\u2014a collection of point findings rather than an understandable\/outlined\/grouped result) to the goal; or by connecting information from the characteristics such as attributes and descriptions of other info-items to the goal. This other information serves first to narrow searches by specifying additional yet fuzzy criteria, but sometimes involving expansion due to the inclusion of important terms in other languages or lexicons. The information serves to position the goal to improve the potential for further co-location associative searching. Finally, the information can assist the system in modeling, predictions, investment structuring, advertising, community structuring, and subsequent searching.","A goal is an enumerated, but unexplained, combination of features of ttxs as defined by an initially empty set of cnxpts or information resources as occurrences. As the user progresses in the search, the set of cnxpts or occurrences is built up with, hopefully, relevant additions, to narrow and clarify the meaning of the ttx to what could be resolved from these collected references. As each new subsuming ttx or new occurrence is added, the goal becomes more narrow in its definition.","One or more queries may be used within a goal, and each may result in connection of the goal to existing cnxpts and to other information by occurrences according to the union of the final result sets for each query (the last query step's result set) and the result set of the goal if one exists. (Intermediate queries need not have a direct result involving cnxpts and\/or occurrences because an intermediate result may have a purpose in later steps.)","The process of searching for a ttx begins with defining a goal to encompass all information about a ttx which the user has in his mind. The user may simply use associative searching to navigate to the cnxpt representing the ttx, without a lot of information entry. The user might also enter one or more single or multiple step queries for the goal ttx and obtain a result set of possibly relevant sources or cnxpts as a result of each of the queries. The user may navigate further to find the ttx, with each navigation possibly resulting in generation of a query step specification in the currently open query or in a new default query if none is open. The combined results cause creation of relationships and cause positioning of the goal on visualizations. These actions are effectively combined into an overall editable scripts so that they can be re-run at a later time and receive new rsxitems and thus new relationships and relationship weighting based upon the results, and thus changes in position on the visualizations.","In one embodiment, queries may be used to concretize a goal.","Because goals become cnxpts, they are reusable and may be copied, altered, and shared with others. This reuse mechanism provides the utility that the stored query logic can be reused and for new searching. An added utility is that it provides functionality to save \u2018chained queries,\u2019 which are scripted series of queries applied against successively developed result sets. The goal need not be considered a ttx as it may be given a special purpose.","In one embodiment, placing a cnxpt for a ttx under an existing ttx category cnxpt with no description causes the cnxpt to be a goal as if the user placed a new goal at a specific location (under an existing ttx in the map). The goal is converted to a cnxpt when a user states that no cnxpt representing the ttx has been found.","In one embodiment, the goal is converted to a cnxpt when the user states a name or a description for the ttx, or when the user's activity on the goal has not continued for some period.","Visually, a user navigates a visualization with the goal as a \u2018cursor\u2019 icon so that the cursor is moved toward and into ttx symbols in the visualization.","When navigating visualizations while using the goal, the user is seeking to serendipitously find ttx categories which the user's ttx would fit into, or ttxs which are predecessors in time to the user's ttx. The user is also seeking to categorize the goal ttx or to show that the ttx stems from other ttxs. When a user navigates into a ttx category, they add the ttx category as a \u2018predecessor\u2019 or another specific endpoint in a directed hierarchical association where the goal\/cnxpt is to be a successor or have another specified role. (Alternatively, the relationship applied could be an extensional subsumption Association.) The relationship is assigned a set scopx, infxtypx, and weight. If the user navigates out of that ttx category, this hierarchical association weight is reduced considerably, or deleted. The fxxt of the visualization provides type information for the relationships categorizing the children of ttx categories, and this typing information is used for typing resulting categorization relationships for the goal when it is moved into a ttx.","In a goal, the user is seeking to add rsxitems to the goal as being relevant occurrences, along some nature of relationship, even if merely generally germane. The greater the relevance, the greater the weight on the occurrence relationship. Rsxitems used to create occurrences may refer to infrastructure txos, irxt information resources, traits, purlieus, etc.","Additionally, the user is seeking to add rsxitems referencing cnxpts. Relevant cnxpts are used to move the focus of the user to specific ttx categories and to similar ttxs, by creation of affinity associations. In some cases, these rsxitems may be used for creation of hierarchical or directed associations.","When navigating while as part of the goal, the user is also seeking ttxs which are similar to add as relevant to their goal, even though they might possibly not be germane enough or be the specific ttx being sought. When a user touches a ttx or indicates that the ttx is relevant, or traverses to a different point on the visualization using a ttx, they add the ttx as a \u2018generally similar\u2019 endpoint in an undirected affinitive association where the goal\/cnxpt is to have a specified role. The relationship is assigned a set scopx, infxtypx, and weight.","In one embodiment, the result set items found as a result of the query script will be added as txo info-items and occurrence relationships will be created with the goals and carried over as the goal is converted to a cnxpt. In one embodiment, the result set items will be added as specific txo types with specific type-instance relationships and specific occurrence relationship types.","In one embodiment, in manual goal use, a user may add or delete item references to\/from the Goal. Result sets can be created manually or obtained from external sources. User selected info-items (called selection sets) may be converted to result sets, and indicated info-items may be manually added to result sets. These info-items may be cnxpts or information resources, and are related to the Goal as associations or occurrences through a \u2018base\u2019 result set.","The cnxpts referenced by rsxitems remaining in a result set for the goal are added as \u2018generally similar\u2019 endpoints in undirected affinitive associations where the goal\/cnxpt is to have a specified role. The relationship is assigned a set scopx, infxtypx, and weight. Those cnxpts referenced by rsxitems in the goal are also made endpoints in intensional subsumption Associations with the goal, where the goal is given the subsumed endpoint role.","These new ttxs and relationships are tentative, since the user may not have been pleased with the results found and must cull the result set. If the user has an opportunity to pick and choose the rsxitems that really fit in his ttx, then he will actually be refining the ontology's understanding of the ttx as he means it. The culling process will cause a repositioning of the goal. When result set culling is complete, the rsxitems retained as relevant will likely cause the creation of occurrences or associations. This mechanism is lacking in intellectual property searching today, and the addition of this facility alone will have major ramifications.","Setup Goal System","Define Query Template","Use Case: Define Query Template\u2014Create templates for searching for certain things, with certain methods, or in certain places.","Create templates for searching for specific result set item types, including but not limited to: specific infrastructure txo such as \u2018business\u2019; traits; purlieus; products; or for searching within specific source types, including but not limited to: web sites; patents; legal articles.","Define Site Specific Query Template","Use Case: Define Site Specific Query Template.","Define Engine Specific Query Template","Use Case: Define Engine Specific Query Template.","Define Analytic Specific Query Template","Use Case: Define Analytic Specific Query Template.","Define Survey Specific Query Template","Use Case: Define Survey Specific Query Template.","Set up Meta-search","Use Case: Set up Meta-search.","Manage Search Engine Subscription","Use Case: Manage Search Engine Subscription.","Define Site Scraping Rule","Use Case: Define Site Scraping Rule.","State a site name and a metadata mapping definition for describing what is found in a scraping, state what to search for, and define a Crawl Result to hold the result set of the scraping.","Define Site Indexing Rule","Use Case: Define Site Indexing Rule.","State a site name and a metadata mapping definition for describing what is found in a scraping, state what to search for, and define a Crawl Result to hold the result set of the indexing.","Define Alert Template","Use Case: Define Alert Template.","Search with Goal","In the following, a search causes or is added to a Goal and the search is used to narrow the ttx represented by the goal to be what is in the user's mind.

formalized, yet continuously evolving process by which the management team assesses the evolution of its industry and the capabilities and behavior of its current and potential competitors to assist in maintaining or developing a competitive advantage. An attempt is made to ensure that the organization has accurate, current information about its competitors and a plan for using that information to its advantage.","CI traditionally uses public sources to find and develop information on competition, competitors, and the market environment without business espionage or other illegal means.","Effective implementation of a company's CI Program (CIP) requires not only information about the competitors, but also information on other environmental trends such as industry trends, legal and regulatory trends, international trends, technology developments, political developments and economic conditions. The relative strength of the competitor can be judged accurately only by assessing it with respect to the factors listed above. In the increasingly complex and uncertain business environment, the external factors are assuming greater importance in effecting organizational change. Therefore, the determination of CI information needs is based upon the firm's relative competitive advantage over the competitor assessed within the \u2018network\u2019 of \u2018environmental\u2019 factors.","The competitive intelligence information obtained can be used in programs that supplement planning, mergers and acquisitions, restructuring, marketing, pricing, advertising, and R&D activities.","Competitive Analysis Research Tasks","The purpose of a CIP is to gather accurate and reliable information under cost constraints. The groundwork for the CIP is done through audits and studies. Traditionally, relevant data was gathered from the organization's own sales force, customers, industry periodicals, competitor's promotional materials, own marketing research staff, analysis of competitor's products, competitor's annual reports, trade shows and distributors. Specific CIP techniques included querying government resources and online databases, selective surveys of consumers and distributors about competitor's products, on-site observations of competitor's plant or headquarters, \u201cshadowing\u201d the markets, conducting defensive CI, competitive benchmarking, and reverse engineering of competitor's products and services.","The objective of the CIP is to gather relevant information that is valid and accurate. Incomplete or inaccurate information may jeopardize the organization's CI efforts. This collected information has been difficult to maintain, and loses currency quickly, showing that reuse and collaborative efforts for update would be highly valuable if done properly. Associations have often performed this collaborative function.","With a CMM, collection is greatly simplified where the organization for the study is structured along the lines of the categorization structure of the CMM, and the collected results will be shared by many users and customers out of their own need to reduce costs, or sold as Disaggregated Data DataSets.","CI is also more efficient here because the user may be able to see information already collected and catalogued by others within their area of search. They could easily see entries made by others about a competitor that would not be locatable by keyword search but are available for impulse retrieval.","Competitive Analysis Studies","Analysts will use the Project Study process to prepare to inform management about their competitors. They will use the information in the system, but they will also use the system to search for new information and to categorize information for their study. The collected information may be marked as internal use only, and as such will not be collected back into the central CMMDB until they release it,","Exports of the categorization structure can provide content for the analyst's report. It can also be used to form the basis of spreadsheet analysis. The fxxt oriented ontology database and the calculation facilities of the system can be used for data manipulation and analysis, and provide export of formulas as well as data for use in spreadsheets.","The data abstraction layer and import facility can be used to obtain data from external sources for inclusion in the system's calculations and analysis.","Define Competitive Trend

Markets","Stages of progress toward product sales for various markets, along with gates for \u2018graduating\u2019 from the stage to the next are defined to establish processes, to form definitions for investment pool. The pools are defined by these stages of development of innovations, and additionally by, including but not limited to: market segment, investment form, risk, gestation timeframe, \u2018valuation at graduation\u2019 range, invention ownership proportion, geography, jurisdiction, type (entity, idea, license, consortium, or other) or other subdivisions.","For each \u2018real money\u2019 investment pools, independent special purpose vehicles are formed to handle the securitization of the asset backed securities, to create and sell the investment pool securities, use the proceeds of the sale to pay back the investors, and to manage relationships with the entities formed around the innovations that are the underlying assets. Shadow vehicle accounts are formed for either \u2018shadow\u2019 investment pools, or for \u2018communal\u2019 investment pools. Initially, these pools will not have investors.","Memberships in an investment pool are offered to inventors who progress their invention past a certain success gate. To get into an \u2018real money\u2019 pool they either, including but not limited to: 1) allow their invention to be assigned to a business entity that they will form, and which is owned to a certain (low) percentage (non-dilutable) by the \u2018pool\u2019 special purpose vehicle; 2) assign their patent rights to a license portfolio management company which is owned to a certain (low) percentage (non-dilutable) by the \u2018pool\u2019 special purpose vehicle; or 3) form a consortium around the idea and assign a portion of the consortium to a \u2018pool\u2019 special purpose vehicle. Depending upon stage of progress, the new pool member entity, idea, or consortium obtains either a set of services for this initial assignment, or cash, or both. They are not owners of or investors in the pool except in the special case where the pool is a collective owned by the, including but not limited to: entities, inventors, or consortia.","Securitization of the \u2018real money\u2019 pools will take the form of shares, options, or asset-backed derivatives to allow the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified for actual investors. Each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets. An on-line exchange for these securities is established, with membership subscriptions sold for varying fees.","Shadow shares, shadow options, or shadow asset-backed derivatives are sold on the \u2018shadow\u2019 pools to users who have purchased service subscriptions in the shadow facility. Incremensa will assign initial shares, or options (possibly maturing on the success of their own invention) to the members of communal investment pools. An on-line exchange for these securities is established, with membership subscriptions sold for varying fees.","To move from one pool to another, an entity, idea to be licensed, or consortium must make progress, as determined first by self-evaluation but also by points awarded for, including but not limited to: interest shown in it, external money raised, business progress, IP protection progress, exterior evaluations and appraisals, completion of methodologies, increases in staff, resources, or sales, improvement in speed of completions of these activity\/progress indicators. As time passes, points are taken away from the entity, idea, or consortium as a penalty and the penalty provides a structure for incentive as well as a structure for removal from the pool to a different pool for lower performers. When sufficient points are earned, the entity, idea, or consortium reaches a graduation gate. When sufficient points are lost as penalties, the entity, idea, or consortium reaches a removal gate. As an invention passes the gate defined as the graduation point for the pool it moves into a pool for the next stage, usually of higher anticipated value, and a \u2018purchase transaction payment\u2019 is made from the subsequent pool to the earlier stage pool, set by the value set, predicted, or priced based upon a group-based crowdsourced negotiation process price (or market price or option price) for the invention graduating.","As an invention\/innovation graduates from the final pool, the share in the business entity formed originally, or its assigns, is sold on the market and the funds received are placed into the treasury of the pool for distribution. For shadow markets, the market value is added to the shadow treasury account.","Request Membership in Pool\n\n","Obtain Assistance in Initiating Membership in Pool\n\n","Obtain assistance available only for pool members or those seeking membership.","Grant Membership in Pool\n\n","Memberships in an investment pool are offered to inventors who progress their invention past a certain success gate.
