The government has certain rights in this invention.","The development of practical magnetoelectric (ME) multiferroic devices for industry is concentrated on two embodiments: The first is for weak-field sensors for applications such as mine detection in harbors or related military devices. In this case practical devices favor sandwich-type bilayer or multilayer composites of ferroelectrics such as lead zirconate-titanate (PZT) with magnets such as terphenyl-d but this configuration yields low ME voltage coefficients which is not suitable for weak field sensor applications. The second is for random access memory elements where the ability to switch magnetization with applied electric fields (and vice versa) would permit the combination of fast (possibly sub-nanosecond) WRITE operation with nondestructive magnetic READ operation. Such a combination would produce formidable competition for FLASH EEPROMs, particularly in view of the fact that magnetoelectric RAMs would operate at <1.0V, an international target for all microelectronics in the next decade which FLASH devices are unlikely to meet without cumbersome internal charge pumps.","However, most multiferroics to date (such as terbium manganites TbMnOor TbMnO) switch only nC\/cmwith applied magnetic fields\u2014approximately 1000\u00d7 too small for reliable discrimination between \u201c1\u201d and \u201c0\u201d states. Moreover, they operate only at cryogenic temperatures. BiFeOmight operate at room temperature, but it exhibits a weak magnetism (ca. 0.03 emu\/cc), high leakage current, and it does not permit switching of neither magnetization with electric fields nor polarizations with magnetic fields. There are several other magnetically frustrated systems that have been identified which show gigantic magnetoelectric effects at low temperature. Among them, MnWOshows external magnetic field dependence of its ferroelectric loops below room temperature. Similarly, high-temperature multiferroic behavior has been reported in PbFeTiOand in PbFeWOPbTiO. Others have studied the relaxor properties of PFW and PFW-PT ceramics.","Clearly a new line of thinking is required to overcome the intrinsic limitations of direct linear magnetoelectric (ME) coupling of form PM in the free energy, where P is polarization and M, magnetization. There have been recent efforts by researchers throughout the world to produce electric switching of magnetizations or magnetic switching of polarizations in multiferroic magnetoelectrics. Generally, schemes for switching from +M to \u2212M with electric field (E) or conversely from +Pto \u2212Pwith magnetic field (H) have been examined. In the present state of the art there is a need for a new single-phase material that can exhibit magnetoelectricity (not necessarily linear) at room temperature.","The present invention provides a novel class of magnetoelectric multiferroic compositions that have a room-temperature magnetic switching of large electric polarizations with high memory window in MMIS structure paving way for non-volatile memory applications.","According to an aspect of the invention, a novel class of room-temperature, single-phase, magnetoelectric multiferroic (PbFeWO)(PbZrTi)(0.2\u2266x\u22660.8) (PFW\u2212PZT) thin films are provided that exhibit high dielectric constants (1200-3000), high polarization (22-60 \u03bcC\/cm), weak saturation magnetization (0.48-4.53 emu\/cm), broad dielectric temperature peak, high-frequency dispersion, low dielectric loss and low leakage current.","According to a further aspect of the invention, the inventive films are suitable for room-temperature multiferroic devices. Near 20% of PFW, the ferroelectric relaxor state is nearly unstable at room temperature against long-range ferroelectricity which in turn gives a large magnetoelectric effect: switching not from +Pr to \u2212Pr with applied H, but from Pr to zero with applied H of less than a Tesla.","According to another aspect of the invention, a Metal Multiferroic Insulator Semiconductor (MMIS) device structure is provided on Pt\/(PFW\u2212PZT)(0.2\u2266x\u22660.4)\/SrTiO(6 nm)\/Si (111) substrate showing a well behaved and saturated C(V) hysteresis with 3-4 V memory window, and low leakage current density (10-10A\/cm) @ 150 kV\/cm.","According to one aspect of the invention, the synthesis and fabrication of a novel class of room temperature, single-phase, magnetoelectric multiferroic thin films of composition (PFW-PZT)(0.2\u2266x\u22660.8) is provided showing magnetic control of large polarization (\u02dc22-60 \u03bcC\/cm) merely less than a Tesla.","According to another aspect of the invention, the method of fabricating magnetoelectric multiferroics of composition (PFW-PZT) (0.2\u2266x\u22660.8) that exhibit high dielectric constants, weak saturation magnetization, broad dielectric temperature peak, high-frequency dispersion, low dielectric loss and low leakage current is provided.","According to still another aspect of the invention, (PFW-PZT) composite thin films are provided, where x=0.20; exhibiting a giant polarization of 60 \u03bcC\/cm, moderate magnetization 6-8 emu\/cc, and a high piezoelectric coefficient at room temperature.","According to one aspect of the invention, a method of fabricating (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20) composite thin films that switch large polarizations from 22 \u03bcC\/cmto 0 \u03bcC\/cmunder the application of 0.5 Tesla is provided.","According to another aspect of the invention, the device incorporating the above films permit 3-state logic (+P, O, \u2212P) and a condenser with >5000% magnetic field change in its capacitance; in H=0 the coercive voltage is 1.4 V across 300 nm for +Pto \u2212Pswitching, and the coercive magnetic field is 0.5 T for +Pto zero switching.","According to a further aspect of the invention, a method of fabricating (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20) composite thin films in which increasing magnetic field lengthens the relaxation time by \u00d7500 from <200 ns to >100 \u03bcs is provided, wherein it strongly couples the polarization relaxation and spin relaxations.","According to one aspect of the invention, it provides a family of room-temperature, magnetoelectric mutiferroic devices fabricated and designed by tailoring compositions of (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.2\u2266x\u22660.8) at the \u201cB-site\u201d that show high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, diffused ferroelectric phase transition, low leakage current and high temperature dependent dielectric tunability.","According to another aspect of the invention, a memory device structure incorporating the (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20\u2266x\u22660.80) composite and a method of fabrication of such device is provided.","According to still another aspect of the invention, a (PFW-PZT) (x=0.20\u2266x\u22660.80) composite that is used in microelectronic applications in the form of magnetic field sensors, and capacitors is provided.","According to a further aspect of the invention, a MMIS device structure of Pt(PFW\u2212PZT)\/SrTiO\/Si (111) is provided, fabricated for different compositions of (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20\u2266x\u22660.60), showing well behaved and saturated C(V) hysteresis with 3-4 V memory windows, and low leakage and serving as excellent candidates for non-volatile memory applications and multiferroic RAMs.","Throughout the figures, the same reference numbers and characters, unless otherwise stated, are used to denote like elements, components, portions or features of the illustrated embodiments.

The composite exhibits remarkable change in capacitance >5000% under the application of small magnetic field (0.5 T) rendering it suitable for use as magnetic field sensor and capacitor.","The invention provides a chemical solution method of fabricating a thin film of composite (PbFeWO)(PbZrTiO)where, 0.2\u2266x\u22660.8. The method is carried out by providing a platinized silicon substrate; spin coating a (PFW\u2212PZT) solution on said substrate; pyrolyzing the spin coated substrate at a temperature in the range of 673-773 K; and repeating the steps of spin coating and pyrolyzing to obtain a film having thickness in the range of 300-500 nanometers. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the platinized silicon substrate is a Pt\/TiO\/SiO\/Si(100) layered substrate. In this chemical solution method, high purity (>99.9%) precursor materials, lead acetate trihydrate, iron 2-4 pentanedieonate, titanium isopropoxide, zirconium isopropoxide and tungsten isopropoxide are used to prepare the (PFW-PZT) solution of concentration in the range of 0.2-0.3 moles per liter. The invention provides a chemical solution method of fabricating a thin film of composite (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.2\u2266x\u22660.8) that further includes the step of rapid thermal annealing at temperatures in the range of 873-1023 K for a time period in the range of 60-300 seconds. Rapid thermal annealing is first carried out at a temperature of 973 K for 30 seconds followed by annealing at 923 K for 150 seconds.","The invention can be alternatively carried out by a pulsed laser method of fabricating a thin film of composite (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.2\u2266x\u22660.8). The method comprises providing ceramic targets of (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.20\u2266x\u22660.80); depositing a (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.20\u2266x\u22660.80) layer from the ceramic target on a substrate; annealing the deposited (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.20\u2266x\u22660.80) layer at 873 K for 30 minutes in oxygen at a pressure of 300 Torr; and cooling the annealed layer to 296 K at a rate of 5 K per min.","The invention also provides a pulsed laser method of fabricating a thin film of composite (PFW\u2212PZT)(0.20\u2266x\u22660.80), wherein the composite layer is deposited from the ceramic target to the substrate at a temperature of 873 K under an oxygen pressure of 200 mTorr, using a laser energy density in the range of 1.0-1.5 J\/cmat a repetition rate of 5-10 Hz.

The total thickness of the film is at least 350 nm.","All the composites having composition (PbFeWO)(PbZrTiO)wherein, 0.2\u2266x\u22660.8 prepared by the pulsed laser method are weakly ferromagnetic and ferroelectric at some temperature, but the increasing amounts of PZT raises the relaxor-to-ferroelectric phase transition from about 150K at 60% to 300K at 80%, so the 80% PZT specimens combine the most interesting properties at ambient temperatures. They exhibit well saturated hysteresis loops with high remanent polarization (P) of about 55-35 \u03bcC\/cmat an external electric field of 550 kV\/cm at room temperature; the remanent polarization decrease with increasing Fe and W compositions. Further enhancement in the Fe and W compositions magnetic Neel's temperature and Curie temperature (ferroelectric phase transition temperature) come near to room temperature which is best for magnetoelectric device fabrication.","The magnetic hysteresis loops of composites with 20% PFW, 30% PFW, and 40% PFW is shown in . The M-H data display weak ferromagnetism. The induced magnetization for (PFW\u2212PZT) was 5 emu\/cc at a high magnetic field of 1.5 T; up to this external magnetic field the M-H curve for 20% PFW shows an unsaturated loop with a low saturation magnetization (M\u02dc0.48 emu\/cc) and a low coercive field (H\u02dc0.12 T), but at 40% the saturation is better and M=4.5 emu\/cc. A super-exchange in the disordered regions through Fe\u2014O\u2014Feis expected to yield antiferromagnetic ordering but at the low Fe concentrations in this material, weak ferromagnetism is probably caused by spin clustering.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a single-phase tetragonal composite (PbZrTiO)(PbFeWO)(0.2\u2266x\u22660.4) prepared by the chemical solution and pulsed laser methods onto Pt\/TiO\/SiO\/Si(100) and SrTiO\/Si substrates.","The present invention provides a memory device structure that includes at least one layer of the composite (PbFeWO)(PbZrTiO)wherein, 0.2\u2266x\u22660.8, preferably 0.2\u2266x\u22660.6, more preferably 0.2\u2266x\u22660.4; that is sandwiched or layered between at least one layer of a high-k dielectric material and a metal electrode. The invention can be embodied in a non-volatile memory device structure that includes at least one layer of the composite (PbFeWO)(PbZrTiO)wherein, 0.2\u2266x\u22660.8, preferably 0.2\u2266x\u22660.6, more preferably 0.2\u2266x\u22660.4; that is sandwiched or layered between at least one layer of a high-k dielectric material and a metal electrode.

The thickness of the high-k dielectric layer is in the range of 2-8 nm. The memory device structure displays a memory window ranging from 2-4 V and a low leakage current density in the range of 10to 10A\/cm.","The invention provides a method of fabricating a memory device structure that includes the steps of providing a p-type Si substrate; depositing at least one layer of high-k dielectric material on the substrate, wherein the dielectric layer is 2-8 nm thick; and depositing at least one layer of composite (PbFeWO)(PbZrTiO)where, 0.2\u2266x\u22660.8, on the said dielectric layer, wherein the composite layer is 350 nm thick. The high-k dielectric material is selected from a group including but not limited to SrTiO, HfO, DyScO, and LaGdO. The layer of dielectric material has a thickness in the range of 2-8 nm and it is deposited on the p-type Si substrate by pulsed laser deposition at a temperature in the range of 973-1073 K in an oxygen atmosphere at a pressure in the range of 50-100 mT. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the step of depositing a layer of the composite (PbFeWO)(PbZrTiO)where, 0.2\u2266x\u22660.8 on the dielectric layer, comprises: irradiating the composite layer with a laser radiation under an oxygen pressure of 200 mTorr at a temperature of 600\u00b0 C.; annealing the irradiated composite layer at a temperature of 873 K for 30 min under an oxygen pressure of 300 Torr; and cooling to room temperature at a rate of 5 K\/min.","The invention also provides room-temperature, single-phase, magnetoelectric multiferroic (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.2\u2266x\u22660.8) thin films for non-volatile memory applications in FERAMS.

The high purity (>99.9%) precursor materials (i.e., lead acetate trihydrate, iron 2-4 pentanedieonate, titanium isopropoxide, zirconium isopropoxide and tungsten isopropoxide) were bought from Alfa Aesar and used for making stock solutions. For good quality films a (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.20\u2266x\u22660.40) solution of 0.2-0.3 molar concentration was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and pyrolyzed at 673 K for 2 minutes. This process was repeated several times in order to get desired film thickness. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) was performed at different temperatures from 873 K-1023 K for different time intervals \u02dc60-300 seconds to get the desired phase and high density. The substrate consists of a layer of Si (about 350 \u03bcm thick), SiO(about 0.6 \u03bcm thick), TiO(about 0.1 \u03bcm thick) and Pt (about 0.15 \u03bcm thick). The films are deposited on a substrate which is approx. 300 nm thick.","DC sputtering was carried out for depositing the Pt top electrode of 3.1\u00d710cmarea using a shadow mask. The dielectric properties in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz were studied using an impedance analyzer HP4294A over a wide range of temperature attached to a temperature controlled probe station. Magnetic properties were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The polarization versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop of the capacitor was measured using the RT 6000HVS ferroelectric tester (Radiant technology) operating in virtual ground mode.","Results","X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the (PFW\u2212PZT) (0.20\u2266x\u22660.40) thin films deposited on Pt\/TiO\/SiO\/Si substrates at 673 K and post-annealed at 1023 K for 60 seconds, continuously further annealed at 923 K for 180 seconds for better homogeneity and crystallinity. In order to get the desired phase, several temperatures were chosen for RTA; the compositions listed provide the best single-phase compound at each annealing temperature. The XRD analysis indicates that the films grown at 973 K were single-phase polycrystalline in nature with less than 1% impurities (pyrochlore) phases. The synthesized complex single-phase perovskite possesses more than five elements in the perovskite octahedra, which makes it very unlikely to get a 100% pure phase, but the electrical properties of all the films having less than 5% pyrochlore were excellent, giving very similar polarizations and electrical responses.","These exhibit ferroelectricity and (weak) ferromagnetism above room temperature with strain coupling via electrostriction and magnetostriction. Application of modest magnetic field strength (\u03bcH<1.0 Tesla) destabilizes the long-range ferroelectric ordering and switches the polarization from ca. 22 \u03bcC\/cm(0.22 C\/m) to zero (relaxor state) as shown in . This offers the possibility of three-state logic (+P, 0, \u2212P) and magnetically switched polarizations. Because the switching is of large magnitude (unlike the very small nC\/cmvalues in terbium manganites) and at room-temperature, commercial devices should be possible.","The electric-field-induced polarization switching (P-E) behavior was studied at low frequency at 50 Hz using Sawyer-Tower measurements.  shows the ferroelectric hysteresis loops for (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20 (a), x=0.30 (b), and x=0.40 (c)) at 300 K, 200 K and 150 K respectively. The films exhibit well saturated hysteresis loops with remanent polarization (P) of about 22, 20, and 11 \u03bcC\/cmand coercive field of 47 kHz, 64 kHz, and 111 kHz respectively for (a), (b) and (c) under 400 kV\/cm applied external electric field. Enhancement in remanent polarization may be attributed to the relaxed local strain (due to larger grains) and\/or greater compositional. In order to check the real-time polarization behavior of (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20) films and thus their utility in memory devices, fatigue tests were performed. Fatigue behavior of (PFW\u2212PZT) thin films was studied with 100 kHz bipolar square waves in the presence of 350 kV\/cm external electric field. The first fatigue data points were obtained after 10cycles and continued until 10cycles, as shown in . There was a modest polarization loss (<12%). Twelve percent decay in fatigue of (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20) thin films on a platinized silicon substrate after 10cycles much better than the early reports for PZT, indicating its suitability for memory device applications.","Three-state logic and switching at room temperature is shown in . +Pto \u2212Pswitching is observed at E=48 kV\/cm (1.4 V across 300 nm); and magnetic switching from +Pr to zero is shown at 0.5 Tesla. In microelectronics memory applications, it is of greater interest to switch magnetization M with electric field E than to switch polarization P with magnetic field H. The device can be placed in a dc field of H=0.49 T with only 100 Gauss required to switch. Three-state logic at a switching field of 100 Gauss could be very useful.","The polarization response at 0.5 T is shown in the insert in ; representing a leaky linear dielectric. The reason for this behavior is shown clearly in the plot of dielectric constant versus frequency at different magnetic fields shown in . At H=0.80 T, the dielectric constant is 1430 for f=1 kHz but it is 233 at f=100 kHz. This is simply due to the field dependence of the relaxation time, and the fact that as H increases the size (correlation length) of spin clusters in this magnetic relaxor increases and hence their fluctuation time decreases (in an extrapolated infinite field H, the system would have long-range ferromagnetic order and the relaxation frequency would go to zero). The fact that this strongly influences their dielectric susceptibility requires strong coupling between spin fluctuations and polarization fluctuations.  shows that the peak of the dielectric loss at H=0.85 T is at f=ca. 2-3 kHz. Note that this agrees with the inflection frequency of 2-3 kHz estimated from real part of permittivity, suggesting a magnetic field-induced Debye relaxation. The relaxation time obtained from the characteristic peak in dielectric loss spectra from  and\/or from the stretched exponential parameters of  are plotted in . It indicates that increasing H lengthens the relaxation time by 500\u00d7 from <200 ns to >100 \u03bcs, and it couples strongly the polarization relaxation and spin relaxations.","These characteristic frequencies can be accurately fitted to high precision the Vogel-Fulcher-type equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"f","mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"f","mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":"U","mn":"2"},"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["H","c"],"mn":"2"},{"mi":["H","R"],"mn":"2"}],"mo":"-"}}},"mo":"+"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"where His a freezing field and replaces the analogous term in T(freezing temperature) in the usual Vogel-Fulcher Equation; \u03bcis the Bohr magneton; and H, the relaxation field.

The fitted data provide freezing field H=0.92\u00b10.07 Tesla and characteristic frequency f=40\u00b11 MHz as shown in .","Conclusions","A bigger family of room-temperature single-phase magnetoelectric multiferroic (PZT-PFW)thin films has been synthesized by CSD techniques which shows a high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, highly frequency-dispersive susceptibility, more than 50% temperature dependent dielectric tunability, and above-room-temperature dielectric maxima. They exhibit a ferroelectric polarization of 22 \u03bcC\/cmand low coercive field of 48 kV\/cm with 12% fatigue in polarization after 10cycles, thus suggesting a potential candidate for memory applications. At room temperature a weak ferromagnetic\/antiferromagnetic M-H hysteresis was detected which suggests an extra degree of freedom of Fe ions in complex octahedra, tilting of Fe\u2014O\u2014Felinkage, and charge ordering with nearest neighbors. The ferroelectric hysteresis flops under the application of external magnetic field (>0.50 T), revealing a strong magnetoelectric coupling in the present system, but this is not direct, rather it is indirect through strain via electrostriction plus magnetostriction. It is not due to a conventional magnetically-induced phase transition (instead, due to a field-dependent spin relaxation time). This new magnetoelectric effect, switching from +Pto zero with applied magnetic field, is 1000 times greater than in rare-earth manganites and occurs at room temperature, suggesting a variety of new magnetoelectric devices, including very large magneto-capacitance and three-state logic elements.","Materials and Methods","Stoichiometric ceramic targets of (PFW\u2212PZT)(0.20\u2266x\u22660.80) with 10% excess of lead oxide (to compensate for loss of volatile Pb) were synthesized by a conventional solid-state route. Three different compositions of (PFW\u2212PZT) films with varying deposition temperature were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) employing a KrF excimer laser (A=240 nm). The conducting LaSrCoO(LSCO) layer was grown on MgO (100) substrate at 873 K under an oxygen pressure of 300 mTorr, using a laser energy density of (1.8 J\/cm) and repetition rate of 10 Hz, followed by normal cooling in oxygen atmosphere. LSCO was used as bottom electrode for all kind of electrical measurements. The (PFW\u2212PZT) layer was then deposited on the LSCO layer at 873 K under an oxygen pressure of 200 mTorr, using a laser energy density of (1.5 J\/cm) and repetition rate of 10 Hz. After deposition, (PFW\u2212PZT) was annealed at 873 K for 30 minutes in oxygen at a pressure of 300 Torr. Finally, the films were cooled down to room temperature at a slow rate. The total thicknesses of the films were around 350 nm. The structural analysis was done with a Siemens D500 x-ray diffractometer (Cu K\u03b1 radiation) in a \u03b8-2\u03b8 scan. Atomic force microscopy (Veeco-AFM-contact mode) was used to examine the morphology and the surface roughness. The film thickness was determined using an X-P-200 profilometer. The electrical and room temp magnetic measurements were carried out with the same equipments as for CSD films. Temperature dependent magnetic measurements were carried out using a Quantum Design MPMS XL-7 SQUID magnetometer.","Results","XRD patterns of (PFW\u2212PZT) films indicate epitaxial (cube by cube) growth along (100) directions. The peak positions were shifted towards higher Bragg angles with increase in Fe and W compositions. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) increases slightly for higher PFW percentages, indicating the local strain contribution to the FWHM is reduced by the presence of a unique crystalline orientation. Cell parameters of these films were estimated due to the limited number of peaks in XRD spectra showed tetragonal crystal structure till x\u02dc0.50. Lattice mismatch between the substrate and the films were analyzed on the basis of the in-plane epitaxial relationship (PFW\u2212PZT) [100]\u2225LSCO [100]\u2225MgO [100]; the lattice mismatch was calculated using the equation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u025b","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["a","sub"]},{"mi":["a","film"]}],"mo":"-"},"msub":{"mi":["a","sub"]}},"mo":"\u2a2f","mn":"100"}},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["sub ","film "]},"The electric-field-induced polarization study was carried out at very low operating frequency \u02dc50 Hz using Sawyer-Tower circuit.  shows the ferroelectric hysteresis loops of PLD grown (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20 to 0.40) at room temperature (297 K) respectively. These films exhibit well saturated hysteresis loops with high remanent polarization (P) of about 55-35 \u03bcC\/cmat 550 kV\/cm external electric field, the remanant polarization decrease with increasing Fe and W composition.","The temperature and frequency dependence of (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20) are shown in  which shows frequency-independent dielectric peaks (\u2208) at 550 K from 100 Hz to 10 kHz and a 40 K shift in \u2208temperature for higher frequencies (up until 1 MHz). These observations reveal strain-induced relaxor ferroelectric properties. The tangent loss shows the character typical of relaxor materials: loss increases with increase in applied frequency. The frequency dispersion in the dielectric constant does not follow that of classical relaxor materials, but instead is more similar to that of impurity-induced relaxor materials like BaSrTiOand SrBiNbO. SrBiNbOcan be tuned as a relaxor ferroelectric by doping with Ba, Sr, or Ce ions. A huge frequency dispersion in the dielectric spectra below and above the ferroelectric phase transition is noticed with extra energy storage capacity during the heating and cooling process. Similar phenomena were observed in the loss-tangent spectra. Heating and cooling effects on the dielectric constant and loss spectra at selected frequencies (10 kHz and 100 KHz) are shown in , (b) and (d).","The most striking features of increased Fe and W compositions in (PFW\u2212PZT) are as follows: (i) the ferroelectric phase transition temperature shifts towards room temperate; (ii) ferroelectric relaxor behavior (e.g., frequency dispersion) increases; (iii) energy storage capacity increases; (iv) more temperature hysteresis for Tupon heating and cooling; (v) loss tangent increases with increase in ratio of Fe and W compositions in solid solutions of (PFW\u2212PZT).","The magnetization versus applied field (M-H) characterization of (PFW\u2212PZT) (x=0.20) films performed for in-plane and out-of-plane field directions is shown in . The induced magnetization values were between 6-8 emu\/cc at 4 kOe magnetic field. M(H) along the c-axis showed well saturated ferromagnetic hysteresis with 2-3 emu\/cc remanent magnetization and 230 Oe coercive field. The in-plane M(H) curve displayed a small opening (hysteresis) H=2500e coercive field. The origin of magnetism can be explained in light of the presence of dions at B-site which may provide in-plane ferromagnetism. The magnetization of (PFW-PZT) (x=0.20) is better and well defined compare to same composition prepared by CSD techniques; this may be due to inhomogeneous (gradient) compressive strain in the films which cause a small distortion in the Fe\u2014O\u2014Cospin angle, producing room-temperature ferromagnetism via spin canting. Super-exchange in the disordered regions through Fe\u2014O\u2014Feis expected to yield antiferromagnetic ordering; there is a possibility of strong magneto-electric coupling, suggesting the converse effect of our earlier report\u2014viz., electric fields E controlling the magnetic properties at both mesoscopic and microscopic scale.","Conclusions:","A large family of room-temperature magnetoelectric mutiferroic devices has been designed at by tailoring compositions of (PFW-PZT) at the B-site. It is found that with suitable compositions, both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic phase transition temperatures can be made to coincide near room temperature, which will be of great interest for devices and basic physics. Ferroelectricity diminished whereas relaxor behavior and anti\/ferromagnetism improved with increase in FeW\/ZrTi ratios. The temperature of the dielectric maximum temperature shifted strongly to lower temperatures with increase in Fe and W percentages. The ferroelectric phase transition temperatures in PLD films are higher than that of CSD specimens with the same nominal compositions, most likely attributable to in-plane gradient compressive strain. The ferro\/antiferromagnetic\/magnetic relaxor properties of PLD films are better that those CSD films. The basic properties of these multiferroics promise a bright future for room-temperature magnetoelectrics having both ferroic phase transitions at ambient temperature, despite the fact that their magnetoelectric coupling is nonlinear.","Materials and Methods:","To fabricate the MMIS structure, 6 nm SrTiO(ST) was deposited on a p-type Si(111) substrate by PLD technique. Attempts at fabrication of the structure by depositing amorphous SrTiOat low temperatures yielded much higher leakage currents, in turn giving unsaturated accumulation regions under the application of negative bias voltage. So instead crystalline SrTiO(6 nm) was grown at 973 K with 100 mTorr of oxygen atmosphere. Three different compositions of (PFW\u2212PZT) films with varying deposition temperature were fabricated by PLD employing a KrF excimer laser (\u03bb=240 nm). The (PFW\u2212PZT) layer was then deposited on the ST layer at 600\u00b0 C. under an oxygen pressure of 200 mTorr, using a laser energy density of (1.5 J\/cm) and repetition rate of 10 Hz. After deposition the (PFW\u2212PZT) was annealed at 873 K for 30 minutes in oxygen at a pressure of 300 Torr. Finally the films were cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 5 K\/min. The total thicknesses of the films were around 350 nm. All other structural and electrical characterizations were done similar to previous example.","Results:","Crystal structure of (PFW\u2212PZT) thin films on high k-SrTiO(6-nm) coated p-Si (111) substrate showed a good single-phase tetragonal material of perovskite structure.

(), (), () show memory window data as functions of sweep voltage at 1 MHz operating frequency. Curve (a) is for 20% PFW; (b) is 30% PFW; (c) is 40% PFW. A large window of ca. 4.0V is observed for the 40% PFW sample. The capacitance (C)-voltage (V) curve is similar to that of a normal metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure, clearly showing regions of accumulation, depletion, and inversion. It should be remember that all these compositions show very large polarization and low coercive field, as presented in our earlier reports. The figure displays large clockwise C-V hysteresis and a memory window controlled by ferroelectric hysteresis of the (PFW\u2212PZT) on the Si surface. The memory window of (PFW\u2212PZT) as function of sweep voltage with an almost negligible memory window below \u22123 V sweep voltage, saturated C-V hysteresis until \u221210V, above which gate voltage the MMIS structure started leaking during the DOWN sweep, whereas during the UP sweep (in gate voltage) accumulation regions showed good saturation. These observations indicate that the materials have high potential for RAM applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 14","sup":["\u22125 ","\u22127 ","2 ","\u22129 ","\u221211 ","2"]},"Conclusions:","MMIS device structures of Pt\/(PFW\u2212PZT)\/SrTiO\/Si (111) are fabricated for different compositions of PFW: (a) x=0.20, (b) x=0.30, (c) x=0.40. All these composition showed well behaved and saturated C(V) hysteresis with 3-4 V memory windows, suggesting good candidates for multiferroic RAMs. J(E) characteristics of these specimens illustrate low leakage currents at room temperature dominated by bulk-limited n-type Poole-Frenkel conduction. Energy band match-up diagram and experimental results suggest that all these specimens might provide a wide memory window and good DOWN saturation if used with alternative high band-gap and high k-dielectric materials instead of SrTiO. Since all the compounds are multiferroic in nature, under the application of external magnetic field it may be possible to destabilize the saturated gate voltage and produce more than two logic states with additional functionalities.","Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is evident that many alternatives and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the description.
