{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. The Field of the Invention","This invention relates to decision-making processes where information is analyzed to provide an individual with one or more suggested solutions or actions. More specifically, the present invention relates to transferring and synchronizing medical data between a decision-making medical system and one or more mobile information devices used by clinicians, thereby aiding a clinician to more efficiently treat patients than is currently possible.","2. The Prior State of the Art","The U.S. health care delivery system has undergone breathtaking changes since the late 1980's. Escalating costs, diminishing resources, demands for accountability characterize today's medical marketplace, inescapable conflicts regarding meaningful outcomes measures, and an expanding medical knowledge base.","Health care is an information intensive industry and the delivery systems typically used within hospitals and clinics are drowning in data while starving for information. It is no exaggeration to describe the current health care delivery system as undergoing an information revolution. Increasingly providers and health care researchers experience demands for more accurate and accessible information. The complexity of health care, its burgeoning information base, and the turbulence of the medical marketplace have all contributed to a system grappling with methods to efficiently synthesize and disseminate information, standardize care, and to continue to create and innovate. The obstacles to these goals are the same regardless of whether the health care delivery entity is a small hospital, long-term\/skilled nursing facility, medical clinic, home health agency, hospice, emergent care unit, or large institution. The frustrations and barriers are faced equally whether the affiliation is academic public or private, managed care or fee-for-service, not-for-profit or for profit. All entities are faced with the need to identify strategies and solutions to manage information and make better decisions, whether those decisions are medical or business-related in nature.","Of particular interest to the demands of the ever increasing need for more accurate and accessible information is the area of clinical decision-making. Clinical decisions are of particular interest since they often influence the balance of human suffering and well-being. Clinical decisions, not unlike all human decisions, are complex and influenced by many causal relationships. These relationships include the evidence-base of medicine, patient-physician factors and interactions, and external and internal constraints. Whether clinicians are serving individual patients or populations they have always sought to base their decisions on the best available evidence. This simple tenet has been confounded by the continual expansion of medicine's evidence-base. The rapid expansion of the scientific and clinical evidence has changed the health care landscape so that no longer is the question how much of medical practice is based in evidence, but rather how much of the available evidence is applied at the front lines of patient care.","One front line of patient care involves the daily visit of a clinician to each patient under he or she's care, commonly termed \u201crounds\u201d. A clinician, or subordinate clinician, visits each patient and views the current medical condition of the patient, typically, represented by vital statistics and other information contained within paper charts. Commonly, the subordinate clinician must prepare to report the progress of the patient by providing a medical history of the patient and current medical information, with suggested treatments. The \u201crounds\u201d process is time consuming and complex since each patient will typically have different medical conditions influenced by a large number of different factors, such as demographics, family history or genetic background, occupational influences, and the like. To properly diagnose and treat each patient a clinician and\/or subordinate clinicians must understand the nuances of the medical condition of each patient, and respond accordingly to variations in the current medical condition of the patient. Additionally, the clinician and subordinate clinician must maintain his or her knowledge base with the ever-changing medical and scientific knowledge base.","Although clinicians maintain a high knowledge base of medical information, clinician's are human and sometimes may not recognize signals or medical information that suggests a medical condition unrelated to the medical condition for which the patient was admitted. Such error in judgment or misinterpretation of medical information may result in increased patient stay in the medical facility or possibly patient death.","Clinicians are, therefore, influenced by a number of complex and varied constraints during the decision-making process of how to treat a patient's medical condition. Such constraints involve the factors of time, community standards, formal policies and laws, and the issues of reimbursement. Add to these constraints the need to for the clinician to maintain his or her knowledge base with the ever-changing medical and scientific knowledge base, and it is obvious that clinicians attempt to make informed medical decisions under difficult conditions.","It would be an advance to provide methods and systems to aid the clinician in providing an informed and accurate medical decision for each specific patient under his or her care that has a basis in the most current medical and scientific knowledge.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for accessing medical information in an efficient and controllable manner.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for presenting a clinician with medical information in a manner controlled by the clinician.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method that conveys medical information in a concise manner that aids a clinician in diagnosing and treating medical conditions.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method for summarizing the current medical status of a patient based upon the most current medical information and the patient's previous medical history.","Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method for synchronizing the medical information gathered by a clinician with existing medical information of the patient.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method for updating a personal digital assistant with summarized patient data specific to those patient's that a clinician is to examine within and definable period of time.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method to synchronize proscribed medications and administered treatments with the various related departments within a medical facility.","Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method to allow real-time communication between a decision supporting system and a clinician to aid the clinician in making informed decisions related to patient medical care.","Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other objects of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of the invention as set forth hereinafter.","As disclosed previously, clinicians are influenced by a number of complex and varied constraints during the decision-making process of how to treat multiple patients each having varied medical conditions. Each clinician must maintain a large personal knowledge base to provide medical care to a variety of different patients with varied family histories and backgrounds. Although clinicians typically educate themselves, during the rigors of the performing medical care, such knowledge may not raise to the clinician's memory. To achieve the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, systems and methods for providing clinicians with recommended and suggested medical care that is based upon a large expert knowledge base and specific to each patient that a clinician may visit, termed decision-support patient data, is disclosed.","In one embodiment, a method for delivering decision-supported patient data of a patient to a user module accessible by a clinician in a controlled and repeatable manner is disclosed. The method includes the steps of analyzing patient data to identify current patient data of each patient that a clinician is to examine in a defined time period. Such current patient data may include general health information like blood pressure and heart rate and\/or medical condition specific data such as blood sugar level for a diabetes patient.","The current patient data is evaluated with the expert knowledge of a knowledge base to generate decision-supported patient data for each patient that is to be examined within the defined time period. As referenced-above, the decision-supported patient data provides the clinician with potential medical conditions that the patient may have and recommendations for medical care.","Once the current patient data and other medical history data and information are evaluated, the decision-supported patient data is presented to the clinician in a configuration that assists the clinician in treating each patient. The displayed data provides the clinician with the pertinent information related to the patient's existing and potential medical condition and the medical care to be implemented by the clinician. For example, the display may include warnings related to a particular recommended treatment for a specific patient.","Such method may be performed in real-time so that the clinician may receive updated decision-supported patient data from a decision-support module and\/or medical module. In this manner the clinician is aided in making informed decisions related to patient medical care.","One of the modules implemented by one embodiment of the present invention is a decision-support module. The decision-support module generates decision-supported patient data specific to each patient that a clinician is to examine in a defined time period. The decision-support module includes a knowledge module that stores data representative of expert knowledge within the medical field. Such expert knowledge is gleaned from various sources and experts in a variety area of the medical field. The decision-support module also includes a patient module that stores patient specific data. Communicating with the knowledge module and the patient module is an inference engine that generates the decision-supported patient data based upon the information and data stored in the knowledge module and the patient module.","Another module of the present invention is a user module. The user module communicates with the decision-support module and allows the decision-supported patient data to be presented to the clinician in a configuration that assists the clinician in treating each patient. The user module may have various other modules that allow the decision-supported patient data and other patient specific data to be stored therein and accessed by the clinician as a clinician makes a determination as to the medical care to proscribe for each patient that the clinician examines.","In this manner, the present invention is capable of using various user modules to effectively provide decision-supported patient data to a clinician in a configuration that assists the clinician in making a decision related to medical care of a patient.","The present invention extends both methods and systems for updating and gathering data from a database through the use of hand held-technologies. The embodiments of the present invention may comprise a special purpose or general purpose computer including various other computer hardware and\/or software modules and components, as discussed in greater detail below.","Embodiments within the scope of the present invention also include computer-readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such a connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media. Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including personal computers, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by local and remote processing devices that are linked (either by hardwired links, wireless links, or by a combination of hardwired or wireless links) through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a conventional computer , including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples various system components including the system memory  to the processing unit . The system bus  may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures.

Alternatively, the input devices may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, a game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or another display device is also connected to system bus  via an interface, such as video adapter . In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and printers.","The computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as remote computers and . Additionally, computer  may communicate with one or more mobile information devices  and , such as personal digital assistant's (PDA), pagers, telephones, Black Berries, pocket PC's, consumer electronic devices, palm computers, and the like.","Remote computers and and mobile information devices  and  may each be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer , although only memory storage devices and and their associated application programs and have been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN)  that are presented here by way of example and not limitation. Such networking environments are commonplace in office-wide or enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer  is connected to the local network  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer  may include a modem , a wireless link, or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network , such as the Internet.

In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing communications over wide area network  may be used.","The present invention is discussed herein with reference to a decision-support system where patient data and information is gathered and analyzed with stored patient data and information to generate decision-supported patient data. The system provides the clinician with the decision-supported patient data, or optionally and summarized versions of the decision-supported patient data, optionally in real-time or clinician perceived real-time. Although discussion is made to the use of the present invention in a decision-support system, it may be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to use with a decision-support system, but may be used in various other systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","210","214","214","212","200","216","210","210","214","214","216"],"i":["a","n ","a","n ","a","n ","a","n "]},"Through the configuration illustrated in , a patient or clinician may input information regarding the patient's health, medical conditions, billing information, and past and current medical care, termed \u201cpatient data\u201d. Subsequently, system  may evaluate this patient data to create data that assists the clinician in making a medical diagnosis or medical care decision. Such data is termed \u201cdecision-supported patient data.\u201d","Optionally, the decision-supported patient data may be configured in the form of a decision-supported progress note that assists the clinician in making a medical diagnosis of medical care decision. The decision-supported progress note is a module, data file, record, field, or one or more data storages that contain information and data that represents a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the patient assessment process performed by the decision-support module  and the clinician and the recommended plan of medical care suggested by decision-support module . Such qualitative and quantitative analysis may extend over a long period, such as with an outpatient situation, or over a shorter period, such as with an inpatient situation.","In this manner, system  may gather and analyze stored patient data with input patient data to generate decision-supported patient data, optionally, in real-time or perceived real time. Although discussion is made to the use of the present invention in a  decision-support system, it may be appreciated that the novel features of the present invention are not limited to use with a decision-support system but may be used in various other systems.","As illustrated in , system  includes decision-support module . Decision-support system , in one embodiment, allows a patient to store and access patient data, while allowing a clinician to store, update, and access the patient data and decision-supported patient data that contain information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions. Additionally, the clinician may access a knowledge base that includes data representative of the current expert medical knowledge within a variety of medial areas that assists the clinician with the diagnosis and medical care of the patient. The patient data, the decision-supported patient data, and the knowledge base need not be incorporated within decision-support module , but may be located remotely from decision-support module  and accessible by decision-support module . For example, optional medical module , as illustrated by dotted lines, may include one or more servers that store the patient data, the decision-supported patient data, and the knowledge base.","Facilitating communication between decision-support modules -, user modules -, and optionally medical module  is network . Network  may be a local area network (LAN) such as a hospital or clinic intranet, wide area network (WAN), wireless network, packetized network, real-time network, and various other networks known by one skilled in the art. Decision-support modules -communicate with network  via various types of communication line connections, such as but not limited to, cable or cable modems, satellite, telephone lines, whether analog or digitally based, the internet, DSL, G-Lite, wireless technology, infra-red (IR) technology, other high-speed data connections, or any other suitable transmission technology or medium. One skilled in the art may identify various other types of network and\/or communication line connections that are capable of performing the desired function of allowing decision-support modules -to communicate with user modules -and optionally medical module .","Each user module -communicates with decision-support module  to allow a clinician or a patient to gather patient data and receive decision-supported patient data or progress notes in real-time or perceived real-time. For example, the clinician and\/or patient may provide and receive data regarding the patient's general health, exercise, eating, smoking, drinking, and drug habits, if any, and the like, while the clinician may view current and past medical conditions, treatments, medications proscribed, family history, genetic predispositions and microbial susceptibilities, and the like. The clinician, therefore, may retrieve data from and transmit data to decision-support modules -, optionally in real-time or perceived real-time and receive from decision-support modules -medical diagnoses and medical care recommendations, optionally in real-time or perceived real-time.","As discussed herein, the operation of either transmitting data and\/or receiving data, in various forms and types, shall be termed collectively as \u201ctransceiving\u201d and transceiving data between decision-support module -, user module -, and medical module  without a substantial delay between an input and a response is real-time or perceived real-time communication.","The transceiving of patient data, decision-supported patient data, and decision-supported progress notes between decision-support module  and user modules -is accomplished by synchronizing decision-support module  and user modules -through a variety of communication line connections and synchronization manners, such as wireless synchronization, direct dial synchronization, desktop synchronization, or such others as known by one skilled in the art. Such synchronization may optionally be continuous, substantially continuous, periodic, sporadic, or the like.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each user module -may take various configurations, including personal computers, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronic devices, telephones, pagers, pocket PCs, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. Such devices and user module -may be considered mobile information devices. Preferably, user module -is a personal digital assistant (PDA). Generally, therefore, each user module -may include the structure and functionality of computer  with associated application programs  and memory  to store the application programs  and medical data and information.","Optional medical module  represents the various hardware and software modules and components of a medical facility, such as a hospital, clinic, and the like. Each medical facility may store business data, medical data, patient data, decision-supported patient data, decision-supported progress notes, and the like. Medical module , in one embodiment, includes various modules associated with the medical facility's intranet or internal network that links various departments of a hospital or clinic. For example, the departments may include radiology, the pharmacy, administration, the laboratories, and the like. Additionally, medical module  may include the hardware and software modules and components for medical module  to communicate with decision-support module  and user modules -by a communication line connection known to one skilled in the art in light of the teaching contained herein.","According to another aspect of the present invention, system  optionally includes third party module . The third party module represents the various other modules that may communicate with decision-support module , user modules -, and medical module . For example, the third party module may represent a medical provider, an insurance carrier, a referred clinician, a referring clinician, a third party paging service, and the like. In this manner, a clinician may communicate with outside sources to obtain approval for services and\/or give information to the outside sources. For example, system  may allow decision-support module  to communicate with an insurance carrier, health care management organization (HMO), or other similar health care provider to received authority to give a recommended medical treatment. One skilled in the art may identify various other third parties that may obtain benefits from the present invention.","Generally, the configuration of system  facilitates the gathering of patient data and delivery of decision-supported patient data to a clinician and patient. For example, if a clinician is examining a patient for the first-time, i.e. a new outpatient, one or more of decision-support modules -analyze the medical information collected by system The resultant diagnosis, if any, is subsequently transmitted to user module -. Additionally, decision-support modules -transmit recommended treatments, procedures, tests, therapeutic drugs, and the like, which a clinician may use to treat the medical condition or prevent the onset of one or more other medical conditions. Furthermore, decision-support module -may deliver educational materials that decision-support module -identifies as appropriate for the patient, whether for general health purposes or for a specific medical condition. For example, if the current medical condition of the patient suggests a potential for heart disease or a heart attack in the future, decision-support module -may generate educational literature directed to helping the patient to change their eating, smoking, drinking, and exercising habits to combat the potential for a heart attack or other heart related medical problems.","Alternatively, system  may be used in an \u201cimpatient\u201d setting. Decision-support modules -, therefore, may analyze the newly gathered patient data with the stored patient data relating to the patient's previous or preexisting medical conditions. Upon analyzing the relevant patient data decision-support modules -deliver recommended treatments, procedures, tests, therapeutic drugs, and the like to the clinician. As with the outpatient situation, decision-support module -may generate educational literature related to the patient's medical condition. For example, if the patient has recently given birth to a new baby, decision-support module -may generate materials related to care of a new-born and potential medical complications or emotional problems that the mother may incur.","Optionally, system  may present the clinician or patient with a summarized version of the available medical and non-medical data via user module -. Such medical and non-medical data provided to the clinician and the patient may include warnings or alerts with respect to recommended treatments or potential medical conditions of the patient. By summarizing the decision-support patient data, the clinician is not bombarded with a large quantity of information through which he or she must search. Rather, the clinician may view the current decision-supported patient data, i.e., recent laboratory test results, vital statistics, current drug usage, and the like. In this fashion, the clinician is given a simplified representation of the patient's medical condition based upon the current medical knowledge and the current patient data. Thus, medical costs are reduced and a higher quality of medical care is provided to each patient.","Generally, decision-support modules -of system , either solely or in combination with medical module  may evaluate the stored patient data to generate decision-supported patient data for each of the patients that the clinician is to examine within a defined time period. In this manner, decision-support modules -and system  assists the clinician in the treatment of the patient. The decision-support nature of the decision-supported patient data is such that suggested medical care recommendations and drug regimes are automatically generated by decision-support modules -based upon each specific patient's needs, past and present medical conditions, family history, and various other parameters as will be discussed herein and that may be identified by one skilled in the art.","As illustrated in , the configuration of system  facilitates the delivery of patient data to the clinician in a standardized and reproducible manner. The clinician may request real-time patient data from decision-support module , or medical module  on demand and receive the patient data in a standardized format. Such patient data may be delivered to the clinician via user module -and displayed to the clinician through a browser or other user interface. Additionally, the configuration of system  facilities the delivery of important or critical information and patient data to the clinician, whether in a synchronized basis or upon the occurrence of an alerted event, such as when a patient has heart attack or an adverse reaction to prescribed medication. In this manner, the clinician is quickly informed of the progress of his or her patients.","Generally, each of the modules, -, -, and  may be incorporated within various types of computer , remote computers , , and mobile information devices ,  as depicted in . Each module -, -, and , therefore, may include system memory  and storage devices and , while optionally including hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , optical disk drive , and associated interfaces , , and . Additionally, each module -, -, and  may communicate one with another via a variety of different manners and communication line connections. Hence, the functionality of each module -, -, and  may be incorporated within one or more of the other modules. For example, the functionality of decision-support module -and\/or of user modules -may be incorporated within medical module .","With reference to the more detailed schematic representation of one embodiment of the present invention depicted in , only a single decision-support module  and a single user module  are depicted. The following discussion will relate to the interaction between one decision-support module  and one user module . One skilled in the art may appreciate, however, that a similar discussion may be recited for the interaction of multiple decision-support modules -and multiple user modules -","According to one embodiment of the present invention, decision-support module  includes a patient storage module . Patient storage module  stores the patient data that may be used by the clinician in determining the medical care to be received by the patient. As illustrated, patient storage module  includes one or more databases -that maintain the patient data. Each database -may have various architectures, such as but not limited to, relational, network, flat, and hierarchical databases, with associated database management systems (not shown) that control the flow of data to and from databases -. Although multiple databases are represented, one skilled in the art may appreciate that system  may include a single database.","The patient data maintained in databases -may include, but is not limited to, the patient's billing information (e.g., name, address, telephone number, birth data, social security number, and insurance information) and patient's demographic information (e.g., age, sex, height, and weight). Additionally, databases -include past and current: (i) medical conditions; (ii) medical care; (iii) tracked cure and failure information; (iv) medications prescribed and associated adverse effects of drug interactions; (v) laboratory tests and results; (vi) clinical consequences of treatment; (vii) family histories; (viii) genetic predispostions; (ix) decision-supported patient data and progress notes; (x) microbial susceptibilities, and the like. Such data may be stored in a variety of different fields, files, and records that are associated one with another to allow an appropriate database management system (not shown) to access the stored data in an efficient manner.","In addition to the above-recited data stored within databases -, decision-support module  may store pharmacogenomic data of the patient and the patient's family to aid with the selection of medical treatment modalilties. This allows decision-support module  to use the patient's genetic structure to define responses to prescribed drugs and provides a more useful medical treatment recommendation. For example, a patient may be found through genetic testing to lack an enzyme necessary for a particular drug's metabolism. Hence, decision support module  would use such pharamacogenomic information to suggest an alternative drug that avoids toxicity and treatment failure, while being consistent with the patient's condition and pertinent medical parameters.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, decision-support module  includes a knowledge module . Knowledge module , and associated databases -, is the repository of the medical information, data, and associated rules and parameter descriptions i.e., \u201cknowledge\u201d, which decision-support module  uses to identify an unknown medical condition of a patient that is examined by the clinician. Alternatively, the \u201cknowledge\u201d may be used to treat a known medical condition, such as a terminal medical condition or non-curable medical condition.","The medical information and data stored within knowledge module  is based on information from experts within the relevant fields of medicine, such as such as Geriatric Medicine, Genetic Medicine and Gene Therapy, Cardiovascular diseases, Respiratory diseases, and the like. Therefore, knowledge module  includes information related to, but not limited to the following: Critical Care Medicine, Renal diseases, Genitourinary diseases, Gastrointestinal diseases, Diseases of the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, Hematologic diseases, Oncology, Metabolic diseases, Nutritional diseases, Endocrine diseases, Women's Health, Diseases of bone and bone mineral metabolism, Diseases of the immune system, Musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases, Infectious diseases, HIV and Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, Diseases of protozoa and metazoa, Neurological Diseases, Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat diseases, Skin diseases, Pediatric Medicine, and the like.","The rules and parameter descriptions stored in knowledge module  may include one or more software modules, files, and records that define how decision-support module  uses the expert information to analyze the patient's current medical information. In this manner, the clinician is guided with the identification and treatment of a patient's medical condition. Such rules and parameters are dynamic in that as system  gathers more \u201cknowledge\u201d the rules and parameters changes to accommodate the increased knowledge. This is in contrast to many existing expert systems that utilize hard coded rules and parameters that are difficult to vary based upon an increasing knowledge base.","As with databases -, each database -may have various architectures, such as but not limited to, relational, network, flat, and hierarchical databases, with associated database management systems (not shown) that control the flow of data to and from databases -","Although  illustrates each database -and -being incorporated within decision-support module , one skilled in the art may appreciate that such databases -and -and\/or patient storage module  and knowledge module  may be remotely located from decision-support module  Alternatively, in one configuration, patient storage module  and\/or databases -may be incorporated within a hospital or clinic's administrative system and\/or network that allow decision-support module  to access the information stored therein. In another configuration, patient storage module  and\/or databases -are located remotely from decision-support module  and a hospital or clinic's administrative system and\/or network.","Communicating with patient storage module  and\/or knowledge module  is an intermediate module . Intermediate module  facilitates the decision-making process by providing one or more modules that interact with patient storage module  and\/or knowledge module  to generate a medical condition diagnosis and medical care recommendations for the clinician. In one embodiment of the present invention, intermediate module  is a middle tier application server. It may be appreciated by one skilled in the art that intermediate module  may have various other configurations. For example, intermediate module  may be an application server integrally formed with medical module .","Intermediate module  includes, in one embodiment, an inference module . Inference module  controls the manner by which decision-support module  generates solutions to the medical condition of the patient, whether the information and data to make such solution is gathered and\/or stored patient data and information contained within the knowledge module . Inference module  includes an inference engine that is commonly known by those skilled in the art. Inference module  communicates with patient storage module  and\/or knowledge module  through a variety of different interfaces such as those developed with Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (COBRA), and Common Object Model (COM) compliant services. It may be appreciated that a variety of different software modules and services may be used to allow inference module  to communicate with patient storage module  and\/or knowledge module .","Although inference module  is depicted as being incorporated within intermediate module  of decision-support module , one skilled in the art may appreciate that inference module  may be integrated into medical module  by connecting intermediate module  directly to medical module  by an Internet Inter-Object Request Broker Protocol (IIOP) or remotely by a Remote Method Invocation (RMI).","According to another aspect of the present invention, intermediate module  optionally includes interface modules -. Interface modules -allow intermediate module  and hence decision-support module  to communicate with medical module  and obtain patient data therefrom. Such communication may be via a variety of communication protocols and communication line connections. In one illustrative embodiment, interface module allows communication via the Health Level 7 protocol, while interface module allows communication between decision-support module  and medical module  via Extensible Markup Language (XML). It may be appreciated by one skilled in the art that various other protocols and communication line connections may allow communication between decision-support module  and medical module .","Intermediate module  further includes an application module . Application module  represents the various application programs that may be used by intermediate module  to facilitate the decision-making process to diagnose a medical treatment and provide guidance as to recommended medical procedures or treatments. For example, application module  may includes software to drive the decision-support process and more specifically to drive the decision made by inference module . In another configuration, application module  includes a progress note module that manipulates the decision-supported patient data into a decision-supported progress note that represents the a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the patient assessment process performed by the decision-support module  and the clinician and the recommended plan of medical care suggested by decision-support module . Such qualitative and quantitative analysis may extend over a long period, such as with an outpatient situation, or over a shorter period, such as with an inpatient situation.","To allow intermediate module  to transceive information to and from user module , one embodiment of the present invention optionally includes a web module . Web module  may be a web server that facilitates data transceiving between decision-support module  and user module . Web module  may transceive information and data via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), or various other communication protocols and communication line connections. For example, web module  may use TCP\/IP communication protocol, a connection orientated or connectionless network protocol, via asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology, X.25 protocol, Frame Relay protocol, packet switching protocols, circuit switching protocols dynamic packet switching protocols, 802.11RF protocol, home network protocols, and the like to transceive data through network . Therefore, web server  and hence decision-support module  may use a variety of different interface types, such as but not limited to a wireless interface thereby utilizing IR, RF, satellite, blue tooth transmission and associated protocols, a modem, cable modem, ADSL connection, ISDN, Ethernet, or similar other connections, and the like.","One skilled in the art may appreciate that inclusion of web module  within decision-support module  is optional. In the event that decision-support module  is partially or completely incorporated within medical module , decision-support module  is devoid of web module  and may utilize a web module incorporated within medical module  to allow communication with user module  via network .","Referring again to , communicating with decision-support module  is user module . User module  is preferably a personal digital assistant (PDA) or other hand-held hardware device, including, but not limited to, a Palm Pilot, or CE based palm computer, with associated software applications and operating systems. Therefore, user module  may be a computer  and\/or remote computer and that allows a clinician and\/or patient to gather and view medical information and associated medical diagnosis and treatments.","User module , in one embodiment, includes a communication interface , a control module , and a user interface . Communication interface  may transceive data between decision-support module , medical module , and user module . Communication interface , therefore, may transcribe data, compress and decompress data, encrypt and decrypt data, and the like. Alternatively, the above-described operations may be performed by a combination of communication interface  and control module .","Depending on the type of communication line connection between user module  and network , and hence decision-support module  and optionally medical module , communication interface  may have a variety of configurations. One skilled in the art may identify various other types of communication interface that are applicable in light of the teaching contained herein. For example, communication interface  may be a wireless interface thereby utilizing IR, RF, satellite, blue tooth transmission and associated protocols, a modem, cable modem, ADSL connection, ISDN, Ethernet, or similar other connections, and the like.","As implied above, communication interface  communicates with control module . Control module  performs a number of operations and functions to allow a clinician and\/or patient to gather patient data through user interface  and view proposed diagnosis and recommended treatments or medical procedures by way of user interface , such as the decision-supported patient data. Control module , therefore, manages the flow of data: (i) to and from the clinician and\/or patient; (ii) from data storage module  to user interface ; (iii) between user module  and decision-support module ; and (iv) optionally from medical module  to user module .","In addition to controlling the flow of patient data between the various modules and components of system , control module  may control the configuration of user interface . Stated another way, control module , in one embodiment, may receive display instructions from the clinician regard how the decision-supported patient data and decision-supported progress note received from decision-support module  are to be displayed or arranged. Alternatively, control module  may either receive the decision-supported patient data (or the decision-supported progress note) and convert the data into a form consistent with the clinician's instructions or function with intermediate module  and web module  to generate the desired display.","In the later case, control module  may: (i) receive through communication interface  the decision-supported patient data or the decision-supported progress note; (ii) store the decision-supported patient data or the decision-supported progress note in data storage module , decision-support module , and\/or medical module ; (iii) summarize the decision-supported patient data (or decision-supported progress note) in accordance with the clinician's instructions to display the pertinent information to the clinician; and (iv) display the summarized decision-supported patient data (or decision-supported progress note) to the clinician through user interface .","Generally, the summarized decision-supported patient data contains the pertinent information related to the current medical status of the patient. For example, if the patient has diabetes the medical information received from decision-support module  will be directed to the pertinent medical conditions associated with the patient's diabetes and control module  will summarize the decision-supported patient data to recite the most recently acquired pulse rate, blood pressure, blood sugar level, critical warnings and alerts, and the like. Alternatively, when a therapeutic regimen is suggested, the summarized decision-supported patient data includes drug name and type, dose, route, interval and duration of therapy, critical alerts and warnings specific to the patient and the drug, patient demographics, and the like.","In this manner, control module  provides the clinician with the pertinent patient specific decision-supported patient data in a summarized arrangement requested by the clinician. By summarizing the pertinent data, a clinician is more capable of treating a patient in an efficient manner; with a reduction in the time required to perform normal clinician activities.","According to another aspect of the present invention, control module  may manage the flow of information gathered by a clinician and input into system  through user interface . Control module , therefore, may receive changes to current medical treatments and store the same in preparation for delivery to decision-support module .","For example, a clinician performing \u201crounds\u201d within a hospital may employ user module  to track changes to medical treatment or proscribed medications made by the clinician. Control module  causes such changes made to the medical treatments and\/or medications proscribed to be stored in data storage module . Such changes will be subsequently transmitted to decision-support module  and medical module  upon synchronizing of user module , such as hotsyncing user module  with decision-support module  and\/or medical module  through physically inserting user module , such as in the form of a PDA, within a cradle or alternatively synchronizing the stored information by way of a wireless connection, satellite connection, IR connection, or such other connection known by one skilled in the art in light of the teaching contained herein.","Control module  may include various hardware and\/or software modules to perform the above-referenced functions, such as but not limited to one or more micro-controllers, central processing units, state machines, programmable logic arrays, network logical arrays, or gates, ASIC processors, software-based controllers, combination logic, combinations thereof, and a variety of other controllers known by one skilled in the art. Control module  may communicate with communication interface , user interface , and data storage module  by a variety of connections, such as but not limited to electrical communication, an analog or digital, wireless, optical, or various other types of connection by way of one of a variety of communication line connections known by one skilled in the art.","As referenced above, a clinician may update medical information through user interface  and receive a graphical representation of all or a summarized version of the available medical conditions, diagnosis, and treatments of a patient through the same user interface . User interface  may also allow a clinician and\/or patient to define the display configuration of the decision-supported patient data and other patient data that is transmitted to user module  from decision-support module  and\/or medical module . A clinician may, in one embodiment, select from a number of stored display configurations, use the default display configuration, or generate a clinician specific display configuration. No matter the particular display configuration selected by the clinician, the particular display configuration assists a clinician in diagnosing, treating, and providing medical care to the patient.","In one embodiment, user interface  is preferably a graphical user interface (GUI), such as a web browser. One skilled in that art may identify various other interfaces that are capable of performing the desired function of allowing a clinician and\/or patient to gather and subsequently view medical information. For example, user interface  may be a textual, interactive, drop-down menu, voice activated, and the like interface. User interface  may allow a user to select choices through pushing buttons, selecting icons, scanning bar codes, vocalization of procedure codes or medical treatments, or through some other method, system, hardware device, and\/or software application known to one skilled in the art.","Generally, user interface  and communication interface  may be developed from a variety of software packages such as HTML, dynamic HTML (DHTML) (including JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, cookies, Java, ActiveX, Server-Side Includes (SSI)), and the like.","According to another aspect of the present invention, decision-support module  and user module  may communicate with medical module  via network . Medical module , as referenced above, may include various hardware and\/or software modules and components associated with a medical facility, such as a hospital or clinic, a government agency, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or some other facility that may obtain a benefit of the present invention.","As depicted in , medical module  optionally includes a web server  that communicates with network . Web server  provides content representative of information stored in medical module  over network  to those hardware and\/or software modules that access web server . Upon receiving a request from a hardware and\/or software modules, such as user module  and decision-support module , web server  provides the requested documents or information in an appropriate language, such as Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), XML, or some other language. Web server  may provide the requested information via Secured Socket Layers (SSL) protocol, a Virtual Private Network (VPN), asymmetric or symmetric encryption, or some other security protocol or process known to one skilled in the art. One skilled in the art may also recognize that although a single server is depicted as part of medical module , medical module  may include a plurality of web servers .","Communicating with web server  is an application server . Application server  provides the conduit between the information stored in medical module  and any requests for such information through web server . Application server  acts as an intermediary between the information or data storage and the hardware and\/or software modules that request access to the desired information. Application server  controls access to such information. In the illustrated configuration of , information from the ancillary module  passes through application server  upon a request through web server  to access the medical information stored in the ancillary module . Application server  may, optionally in combination with web server , authenticate access rights to the requested information.","In an alternate configuration of the present invention, when decision-support module  is partially or completely integrated within medical module , inference module  of decision-support module  may be integrated into medical module  by connecting intermediate module  directly to application server  of medical module  by an Internet Inter-Object Request Broker Protocol (IIOP) or remotely by a Remote Method Invocation (RMI).","According to another aspect of the present invention, medical module  includes ancillary modules . Ancillary modules  includes one or more other modules that represent various hardware and\/or software modules of the individual departments within the medical facility, such as the hospital or clinic, and there associated connection to medical module  and network . As illustrated, ancillary modules  may include a pharmacy module , laboratory module , administration module , radiology  and the like.","Pharmacy module  maintains information and data representative of drugs requested and proscribed for each of a plurality of patients, whether a patient is an inpatient or an outpatient. Laboratory module  maintains information and data representative of the laboratory tests ordered and performed for each of a plurality of patients. Administration module  maintains information and data representative of the billing information and scheduling information associated with each of a plurality of patients. Radiology module  maintains information and data representative of the Computed Tomographic (CT) scans, fetal ultrasounds, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammographs, and X-rays, ordered and performed for each of a plurality of patients.","One skilled in the art may identify various other modules that may be included within ancillary modules . For example, ancillary modules  may include computer physician entry systems, other order entry systems, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["210","216","214"]},"Referring now to , a description of the methodology of the present invention shall be provided as it relates to obtaining decision-supported data by a clinician in an inpatient setting. The methodology description makes reference to , thereby illustrating the method of processing data through the various illustrative modules and components of the present invention.","Before a clinician begins \u201crounds\u201d, the clinician identifies each patient with whom he or she will visit or examine, as represented by block . During this process the clinician may synchronize or connect user module  with decision-support module  and\/or medical module  (). This may be achieve through various communication line connections, such as but not limited to wireless, IR communication, placing user module  within a cradle, and the like. In this manner, a clinician may identify those patients that decision-support is required.","Upon selecting the patients to be visited or examined, decision-support module , either solely or in combination with medical module , gathers patient data for each patient selected by the clinician, as represented by block . This may entail each or a combination of the following: (i) searching patient module , with its associated databases -(); (ii) searching one or more modules of ancillary module  () of medical module ; and (iii) receiving patient data from the clinician through user module .","Once decision-support module  gathers the patient data, inference module  of decision-support module  analyzes the patient data with the data stored within knowledge module , as represented by block . This process may involve many iterations to determine possible medical conditions, causes of medical conditions, potential treatments, such as surgery, administration of a therapeutic drug, lifestyle change, or the like, to define a recommended course of action. This may also entail verifying authorization with an insurance carrier for particular recommend treatment. In the event that an insurance carrier does not accept or will not pay for a recommended treatment, decision-support module  reevaluates the decision-support process to determine alternate courses of action for the particular patient.","Upon reaching a recommendation, whether a single recommendation or a ranked list of recommendations, decision-support module  generates decision-supported patient data specific for each patient on the list of patient's that the clinician is to visit or examine, as represented by block . The decision-support patient data, generally, includes all pertinent patient data that relate to the recommended treatments suggested by decision-support module . For example, when a therapeutic regimen is suggested, the decision-supported patient data includes drug name and type, dose, route, interval and duration of therapy, critical alerts and warnings specific to the patient and the drug, patient demographics, and the like. Such information will be specific to each patient. For example, the dose of the therapeutic drug may be defined by decision-support module  based upon the height, weight, age, gender, and past medical history of the patient. Although the analysis performed by decision-support module  may not be illustrated or displayed to the clinician, such information may be provided to the clinician via user module  if requested by the clinician.","While the clinician remains connected to decision-support module , such as when user module  is located within a cradle, or upon maintaining synchronization or synchronizing or connecting of user module  with decision-support module  prior to \u201crounds\u201d, decision-support module  delivers the decision-supported patient data to user module  such that the patient data stored therein is updated, as represented by block .","As data is transferred to user module , decision-support module  identifies whether a clinician has set display parameters for user interface  of user module , as represented by decision block . For example, the clinician may vary the manner by which user interface  displays the decision-supported patient data, thereby allowing a clinician to organize patient data in a format that assists the clinician in providing medical care to the patient. If the clinician has set display parameters, decision-support module  in cooperation with user module  organizes the decision-supported patient data in accordance with the clinicians selections, as represented by block . Alternatively, if the clinician has not set display parameters, decision-support module  in cooperation with user module  organizes the decision-supported patient data in accordance with the default display configuration, as represented by block .","It may be appreciated by one skilled in the art that decision-support module  may only deliver decision-supported patient data to user module  without assisting with the selection of display configuration. User module  alone may review whether the clinician has defined a clinician specific display configuration.","Upon receiving the required patient data (e.g., decision-supported patient data, patient data, and other patient specific information) user module  is ready for use by the clinician during the clinician's examination of the patients. The clinician may commence his or her \u201crounds\u201d by selecting the first patient with whom he or she will visit, as represented by block . This may be achieved in a variety of manners depending on the particular type of user interface. For example, a clinician may select a patient from a drop-down menu, through a voice activated interface, pushing buttons, selecting icon representations of each patient, or by one of a variety of other manners known by one skilled in the art in light of the teaching contained herein.","Once the patient is selected, the clinician may perform his or her examination of the patient, as represented by block . The examination may be a physical examination, a question and answer session, or a combination thereof. Following the examination, the clinician may update the information stored within user module , as represented by block . Subsequently, the clinician maintains a connection or connects to decision-support module  and\/or medical module , either through a cradle located at the patient's bed into which user module  is located or through a wireless connection, to generate new decision-supported patient data with associated recommendations and treatments, as represented by block . Following receipt of the new decision-supported patient data the clinician selects the desired medical treatment or regime.","Alternatively, instead of the clinician asking a number of questions as prompted by the clinician's knowledge and information contained within the decision-supported patient data, a patient may answer a number of questions posed through another user module located at the patient's bed. In this manner, when the clinician examines the patient the clinician merely has to select the desired medical treatment or regime, without connecting to decision-support module  to obtain new decision-supported patient data. Hence, steps related to connecting to decision-support module  to obtain new decision-supported patient data are optional to the flow diagram depicted in .","Once the desired medical treatment or regime is selected, a clinician may store the new decision-supported patient data centrally within decision-support module  and\/or medical module , thereby updating the patient data stored therein, as represented by decision block . If the clinician wishes to store this patient's data, user module  connects or synchronizes with decision-support module  and\/or medical module , either physically or through wireless or other remote connection, and updates the information or data stored therein, as represented by block . In the event the clinician does not wish to store the new decision-supported patient data centrally, user module  stores the new decision-supported patient data within data storage , as represented by block .","Whether the new decision-supported patient data is stored centrally or locally, the clinician may select other patients with whom he or she is to visit, as represented by decision block . If the answer is in the affirmative, the clinician is asked to select a new patient, as represented by block . Subsequently, the clinician follows the same data flow as represented by blocks  through . If the answer is in the negative, user module  automatically or through user prompts connects or synchronizes with decision-support module  and\/or medical module , either physically or through wireless or other remote connection, to update the information or data stored therein, as represented by block . Such connection and\/or synchronization may cause decision-support module  and\/or medical module  to request functionality of ancillary module . For example, in the event that the medical care recommended by the clinician requires laboratory tests, user module  connects to laboratory module  to schedule such tests and notifies the nurse or other clinician assistant to obtain the necessary blood or other substances to perform the desired tests. Similarly, if a prescription medication is required, user module  connects with pharmacy module  to obtain the medication.","In this manner a clinician is able to receive decision-supported patient data that provides the clinician with recommendations as to potential medical conditions that each patient with whom he or she may have and\/or provide the clinician with updated current patient data for those patients that the clinician is continually treating. By providing such decision-supported patient data, the clinician is continually educated with current medical knowledge from the extensive expert system incorporated within decision-support module  and\/or medical module . This allows the clinician to provide medical care at the cutting edge of the medical knowledge and the clinician is more capable of giving each patient a high quality of medical care in an efficient manner.","According to another aspect of the present invention, user module  may be continuously, substantially continuously, periodically, or sporadically connected or synchronized with decision-support module  and\/or medical module . User module  may then receive alert signals or messages from decision-support module  and medical module  related to the patient's visited by the clinician. For example, the clinician may receive an e-mail message on his or her mobile information device or user module  identifying an emergency with his or her patient. Alternatively, the user module  may receive a reminder to visit a particular patient at a particular time or request information from decision-support module  and\/or medical module  on demand. In this manner, the clinician is quickly informed of the progress of his or her patients.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. For example, embodiments of the present invention are also disclosed in copending United States patent application entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Manipulating Medical Data Via a Decision Support System\u201d, filed Sep. 21, 2000, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
