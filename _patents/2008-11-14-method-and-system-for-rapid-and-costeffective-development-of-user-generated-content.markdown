{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Entertainment and video game software applications have evolved in ways unforeseen by early pioneers in the field. While early video games typically provided static content including graphics and sound, modern video games may be dynamically configured to include new content only limited by the abilities of game and content developers. In addition, new content may be generated not only by professional game developers but also game enthusiasts who wish to share their content with other gamers. This provides a very rich creative environment for game development.","Thus, when a user purchases a game, the user typically relies on the assumption that new content will become available over time for a title. This scenario is mutually beneficial for the user and the game developers. For the user it insures that the lifetime of the game will be virtually unlimited as new content will become available over time. For game developers, a single title provides a sustained revenue stream if users are willing to pay for new content created for the title. Thus, the ability to provide dynamic content over time to users makes users more willing to buy and thus developers more invested in developing complex and often expensive titles.","Nonetheless, dynamic content availability creates a number of technical challenges from a development and information technology perspective. As content may be created dynamically, a game is always under development, multiple schema versions of content may coexist at a single point in time. Typically a content server is configured to allow a game development team to upload, modify and download game content during the development phase.","This scenario raises a number of challenges for efficient game development. With known methods, game development of a new content element or feature may be very slow and require the developer to generate significant amounts of code unrelated to the substantive game feature they are developing. In addition, traditional methods do not allow for schema versioning. Thus, an alternative method is required.","An express content metadata system (\u201cECM\u201d) may provide developers functionality for uploading, querying and downloading game content without heavy coding requirements on the part of the developers. The ECM may provide fast indexing, searching and data retrieval of content. The ECM may manage evolving changes to content definitions by providing flexible and efficient versioning control over content definitions that allows multiple versions of game content to coexist and be independently searchable.","According to one embodiment, a rapid design paradigm for iteration and deployment of new content is described. The process commences with a developer conceiving a new feature or content element for a game. The developer may then generate an XML (\u201cExtensible Markup Language\u201d) schema pertaining to that feature describing a model for the content element, which serves as metadata for the content element. The developer may then upload the content schema, which is validated. Upon validation, a code generation process may generate Wrapper APIs with \u201cfriendly\u201d API methods to invoke various methods relating to the content element. The developer may then download the generated wrapper source code, integrate the wrapper code and libraries into their game source code and finally build and run their game to test out the features.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["122","138","126","136","128","134","124","126","128","130","130","132"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["122","140","122","142","140","144","146"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"],"b":["158","150","152","152","150","152","102","150","150","152","158"]},"In order to search for digital content element , user  may provide a search query  to search engine  via search engine interface , which may be a Web interface. Search engine  may perform a search against the entirety of content metadata in datastore  to retrieve all content items satisfying the search query. The user may then be presented with options for performing interactions with the retrieved content items such as downloading, updating, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["120","1","120","3","100","116","1","116","3","125","120","1","120","3","125","116","1","116","3","120","1","120","3","116","1","116","3","125","125"]},"Development devices ()-() may utilize any type of communication protocol in order to communicate with ECM  via network . Development devices ()-() and ECM  may be coupled to network  and may utilize any type of communications protocol and transport protocol for the transmission and exchange of information. For example, in the case where network  is the Internet, development devices ()-() and ECM  may communicate using the TCP\/IP protocols. As described below, ECM  may provide a Web server and thus development devices ()-() may communicate with ECM  via HTTP (\u201cHypertext Transport Protocol\u201d).","ECM  may comprise ORM (\u201cObject Relational Mapping\u201d) layer , web application layer , administrator page , web server , CodeGen layer , validation server  and RDBMS  (\u201cRelational Database Management System\u201d).","RDBMS  stores data relating to generated content using a relational model. According to one embodiment RDBMS  stores data utilizing a plurality of tables comprising database schema such that data may be stored in a normalized fashion. According to one embodiment the schema defined for RDBMS  is static, i.e., fixed.","Although RDBMS schema  may be fixed, users  of ECM  typically require defining and interacting with objects in a dynamic and flexible manner. ORM layer  provides a mapping between objects exposed to users and data stored in RDBMS , which are scalar values. According to one embodiment, ORM layer  defines an individual content metadata unit referred to herein as a SearchableItem. ORM layer  further comprises a schema component The structure of ORM layer  and the content metadata unit SearchableItem will be described in detail below.","Web application layer  provides various methods for interacting with ECM. According to one exemplary embodiment web application layer  provides a create method that allows a client to upload digital content along with its metadata in a single call and create a metadata object (referred to herein as a SearchableItem Object and described below), an update method that enables a client to modify an existing record when its data changes on the client, a search method that enables a client to query the ECM for content based on specific search criteria and a get method that retrieves all metadata for a single content item.","CodeGen layer  receives a content schema definition (not shown in ), which among other things defines comprises a well-defined a structured definition of a title's content along with query definitions on how to update and\/or search for that content as well as what data is relevant to be returned with each query. The CodeGen layer  may analyze the content schema definition and generate custom data structures based upon the names and data types for that definition. According to one embodiment, CodeGen layer  may analyze customer queries and create local in-title APIs mapped and named after customer-defined query names that wrap actual calls to lower level web methods that may not be as user-friendly. This allows a game developer to write a schema that results in friendly looking APIs that map directly to in-game data and only that data. For example, a user might be able to write an API entitled \u201cCreateCar\u201d as opposed to calling a more cumbersome and generic API where many arguments will not apply to their specific needs. According to one embodiment, as described in more detail below, a more generic API that may ultimately be called.","Administrator page  may provide an interface for users ()-() to interact with ECM . According to one embodiment administrator page  may be a HTML (\u201cHypertext Markup Language\u201d) page served by web server  upon request of a specific URL (\u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d). Thus, users ()-() may interact with ECM via a web browser (not shown in ), which display administrator page  upon request of a specific URL associated with ECM . Administrator page  may allow a development team to configure a particular content server configuration based upon content they are developing.","Among other functionality, administrator page  may allow users ()-() to upload a content schema definition (described in detail below), which may be a schema written in an XML format that defines content and how search for the content based upon particular object definitions. Upon receipt of a content schema definition, the administrator page may call CodeGen layer , which may then generate header (.h) and body (.cpp) files that may wrap calls to an underlying API.","Validation server  may perform various validation routines of data uploaded by users ()-() to ECM .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["204","102","116","202","100","125","106","202","100","106","202","100","112","108"]},"According to one embodiment, administrator page  may parse content schema  and configure various tables in RDBMS  that control how content schema  maps to a fixed schema in RDBMS .","Upon validation of content schema , the content schema  may be registered and stored in RDBMS . RDBMS may store mutltiple versions of a schema for versioning purposes. Thus, as shown in , for example, RDBMS may store schema , schema  and schema  all pertaining to different versions of a content element. Administrator page  may then call CodeGen layer  using the validated content schema to generate wrapper code based upon content schema . The structure and functions of CodeGen layer  in generating wrapper code based upon a content schema  is described in detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2C"],"b":["120","1","202","100","120","1","202","100","106","202","106","202","112","202","106","110","202","320","236","120"]},"In addition, upon uploading content schema , administrator page  may populate schema tables  based upon received content schema. Schema tables  described in more detail below store information regarding information defined in content schema  such as the fields, updates and queries. The structure of an exemplary content schema  as well as schema tables is described in detail below. Content tables  may store actual content element data according to one embodiment.","The dashed arrows in  illustrate processes occurring due to user () invoking a method in friendly API . As noted previously, friendly API may have been generated automatically by CodeGen layer . Upon invocation of a method in friendly API , a name resolution process is performed (the name resolution process is described below). The name resolution process maps from a method name in friendly API  to corresponding information stored in schema tables . That is, the call to a friendly API  may map to various rows in schema tables (Schema ORM) . This mapping is transparent to user ().","The method invocation via friendly API  may be made via web application layer . As noted previously, web application layer  may support methods create, get, update and search methods (described in detail below). Friendly API calls on the client may be mapped to a fixed API call such as XTS_ContentServerSearchableContent (still on the client), which in turn use may invoke a web method in application layer  that knows how to map that data to a SearchableContent object on the server. The structure of a SearchableContent object  is described in detail below. Calls to the web application layer  result in a SearchableContent object  that may invoke ORM layer , which negotiates between SearchableItem Object  and underlying metadata stored in RDBMS  in metadata tables.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":["280","1","280","280","1","280","372","374","376","372"]},"Updates block  describes types of targeted updates users may make to existing model records already existing in schema tables of RDBMS .

ORM module  performs functions for negotiating between an object representation such as SearchableItem  and an underlying relational database representation such as metadata tables . It should be understood that ORM layer may be implemented utilizing any programming language or representation.","The structure and function of the class hierarchy shown in  is now described. PersistedBase class  comprises logic to bind a parent object to a database table named after that object. According to one embodiment a custom installer creates tables when binaries built with PersistedBase objects  are installed. The installer may utilize managed code reflection capability to examine all objects in the binaries to build the SQL tables with foreign key relationships along with columns named after member data in the corresponding object definition.","According to one embodiment, base class Item  defines all data common to content stored on ECM  such as \u201ccreated data\u201d, \u201ccreator XUID\u201d, \u201cpayload size\u201d, \u201cpopularity\u201d and \u201caverage rating\u201d.

According to one embodiment SearchableItem  may store only a fixed number of five primitive types: ints, floats, ulongs, DateTime values and strings. Of course SearchableItem may store any number of primitive types and the five specific types noted are merely exemplary. SearchableItem  may also store a number of references into a SearchableitemBlob table that may store non-searchable blob data.

SearchableItem.Ulongs table  comprises private key Id, private key Id_Ulongs, Key field and Value field. SearchableItem.Ints table  comprises private key Id, private key Id_Ints, Key field and Value field. SearchableItem.Tags field  comprises private key Id field, private key Id_Tags field, Key field and Value field.

SearchableItem.Bloblds table  comprises private key Id, private key Id_Bloblds Key field and Value field. SearchableItem.Blob table  comprises private key Id and Blob field.","According to one embodiment, the five tables SearchableItem.Ints , SearchableItem.Ulongs , SearchableItem.Tags , SearchableItem.DateTimes , SearchableItem.Floats  are used in a star join pattern to create metadata for arbitrary content types as described below.","For example, a user might define their SearchableItem's metadata to have 2 integers, no floats, 3 bigints, 1 string and 2 DateTime values, and no blobs for example. In that event, a single record, when created, would contain 2 rows in the integer table, 0 rows in the float table, 3 rows in the bigint table, 1 row in the string table, and 2 rows in the DateTime table. This \u201ctype\u201d of content has a variable amount of data spread out among 4 tables. Another SearchableItem defined by a user might contain 1 float and a single preview blob. In that event, even though the system has 6 tables available for use, that type of SearchableItem, when created, only uses 2 tables\u2014a single entry in the float table and a single blob entry in the blob table\u2014per SearchableItem record.","According to one embodiment, RDBMS  utilizes a star join table design pattern for storing SearchableItem data . The star join pattern distributes a definition of a customer content type or model among a fixed number of thin \u201cname\/value\u201d pair tables based on a primitive type, each with exactly one index.  depicts the use of a star join pattern. An arbitrary complex table may be built by repeated multiple joins of a set of primitive data types . For example, if a piece of searchable content contained 5 integers, those 5 integer values could be stored in the same table as 5 separate rows but with each having the same \u201cowner id\u201d that maps back to an ORM object that unifies those rows as a single record.","An advantage of the star join arrangement is that each record doesn't use tables or consume storage space that is not required. In addition, the star join provides a predictably efficient indexing model because each primitive table has exactly one index and every metadata property receives the same priority index. This fact should allow a database server to maximize cache efficiency, and maximize indexing efficiency, which should translate into very consistent query performance over time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 2"],"b":["110","202","108","108","202","110","108","202"],"i":"c"},"Generated Wrapper APIs  also comprise logic for resolving calls to friendly APIs to actual underlying API calls, for example in XTS_ContentServer* as shown in . In order to facilitate this functionality, upon uploading of content schema  via administrator page , schema tables  are populated based upon the received model definitions. According to one embodiment, the following schema tables  may be defined:","Schema.Field","Schema.Model","Schema.Model.Fields","Schema.Model.Updates","Schema.Query","Schema.Query.Parameters","Schema.Query.

Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","System memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data .","Computer  may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example only,  illustrates a hard disk drive  that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk , and an optical disk drive  that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk , such as a CD ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like.

In , for example, hard disk drive  is illustrated as storing operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and information into computer  through input devices such as a keyboard  and pointing device , commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor  or other type of display device is also connected to system bus  via an interface, such as a video interface . In addition to the monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers  and printer , which may be connected through an output peripheral interface .","Computer  may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer . Remote computer  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to computer , although only a memory storage device  has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, computer  is connected to LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, computer  typically includes a modem  or other means for establishing communications over WAN , such as the Internet. Modem , which may be internal or external, may be connected to system bus  via user input interface , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation,  illustrates remote application programs  as residing on memory device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Computing environment  typically includes at least some form of computer readable media.
