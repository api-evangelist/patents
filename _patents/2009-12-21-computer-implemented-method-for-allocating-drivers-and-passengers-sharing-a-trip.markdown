title: Computer implemented method for allocating drivers and passengers sharing a trip
abstract: Techniques for allocating drivers and passengers sharing a trip. The techniques may include a trip sharing service comprising receiving a first service request; specifying a first potential trip data object by the trip sharing service and executing a matching method. Matching may include checking a first potential trip data object against at least a second potential trip data object. Matching may further include comparing the specifications of the first potential trip data object with the specifications of the at least one second potential trip data object, determining the degree of congruency of the specifications of the compared potential trip data objects, assigning one role to a first and a second user, and adding the second potential trip data object to a result list in case the determined degree of congruency between the first and the second potential trip data object exceeds a predefined threshold.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND AND RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","ABBREVIATIONS","LIST OF REFERENCE NUMERALS"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of data processing, and more particularly to a computer implemented method for allocating drivers and passengers sharing a trip.","The most convenient and usually quickest way for door-to-door transport is the usage of a private car. Said means of transport is however expensive and connected with negative consequences on the environment in respect of noise and pollution. In most cases a car transports only one or two persons although most cars provide room for four or even more persons. Several trip-sharing services help to bring together persons having the same or very similar trip plans thereby reducing damage to the environment reducing traffic congestions and reducing travel costs for all participants.","Current trip-sharing services usually require its users to execute several manual steps to find potential trip accompanies for a planned trip, to contact the potential trip accompany and to meet an agreement regarding the departure time and place, the payment and other aspects of the trip. This is a time consuming task: a user usually has to log into the web portal of the trip-sharing service he is registered at, has to search for planned trips of other registered users having the same or a similar place of time of departure or arrival. In addition to checking these basic data of the planned trips the user has to manually check whether the other user fits to his own personality e.g. in regard of smoking habits or taste in music. Finally the communication between the potential trip accompanies according to current trip-sharing services requires an exchange of emails, phone calls or other manual activities for reaching an agreement among the participants.","The present invention relates to a computer implemented method for allocating drivers and passengers sharing a trip.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention relate to a method being provided to users in the form of a trip sharing service. A trip sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention is a computer implemented service operable to maximize the users' convenience regarding the organization of shared trips, in particular regarding the task of finding appropriate trip accompanies and regarding the allocation of trip accompanies to each other as trip accompanies.","A particularly advantageous feature according to preferred embodiments of the invention is the provision of an intelligent matching method for detecting potential trip accompanies having a high degree of congruency regarding their trip plans and regarding the personalities. The matching method is operable to evaluate a multitude of user preferences for the arrangement of a shared trip. Upon receipt of a service request, the trip sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention creates a potential trip data object and uses the specifications given in the service request and, depending on the embodiment, the specifications of the user profile, to specify the created potential trip data objects.","A data object is a data entity that can be uniquely identified and be manipulated by the commands of a programming language. A trip data object is a data object stored to a storage medium, e.g. a database, or held in memory of a processing device, which comprises data characterizing details of a trip. A potential trip data object is a trip data object representing a trip in the \u2018real world\u2019 planned by a user which has not yet taken place. According to some embodiments of the invention, trip related parameters, e.g. the time of departure and arrival and the place of departure and the destination location specify a potential trip data object. According to further embodiments of the invention, a potential trip data object in addition comprises user related data, e.g. smoking preferences or the taste in music of the user. User related preferences are derived from the settings of the user profile but can be overridden by user related parameters comprised in the service request. Two compared potential trip data objects will not match in case the place of departure of the passenger is not within the pickup area of the driver.","The potential trip data object is compared with existing trip data objects stored in a database of the trip sharing service in a matching method of the trip sharing service. The matching method determines the degree of congruency of the specifications of the newly created trip data object with all the existing potential trip data objects.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, users corresponding to potential trip data objects having a high degree of congruency when compared to each other in the matching method can be automatically or semi-automatically allocated to each other as trip accompanies. This feature is particularly advantageous as it reduces the time and effort that is currently required to reach an agreement with a potential trip accompany upon the details of the trip. Those details are for example the pick-up and drop off place, the starting time or the price. The time and effort required for reaching an agreement upon the details of the trip does not pay off for short trips, e.g. trips from home to work and back executed daily by millions of commuters, based on current trip sharing services. The trip sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention solves said tasks automatically or semi-automatically, thereby significantly reducing time and effort spent currently by the users to agree on the trip details. Thereby, the service facilitates in particular the allocation of trip accompanies for short distance trips. Short distance trips make up a large fraction of the total car traffic.","A further advantage of said automation is that persons being less internet savvy do not have to login to a service portal multiple times, click through long lists of potential trip accompanies and exchange multiple emails.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the submission of one email request and the receipt of a second email comprising the details of an arranged shared trip may be the only two situations in which a user has to use electronic communication technology in order to arrange a trip with the help of the trip-sharing service.","The allocation of trip accompanies based on the congruency of their respective trip specifications and their respective user preferences is a fairer way of allocating free car seats than the allocation methods of current trip-sharing services. Currently, users investing more time in finding appropriate trip accompanies have a higher chance of finding a matching person than a person spending less time in the search.","The trip-sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention provides an improved automatic multi-dimensional and adaptive matching method for determining potential trip accompanies.","According to further embodiments of the invention the trip-sharing service in addition to the matching method provides an efficient method for allocating users sharing a high matching score to each other as trip accompanies.","According to further embodiments the matching method of the trip-sharing service is able to intelligently and dynamically assign one of the matching users a driver role and the other matching user a passenger role. The matching method thereby considers at least the driver\/passenger preferences of each user. According to further embodiment of the invention, the matching method in addition considers the place of departure of all matching trip accompanies in relation to the destination location in the assignment of the driver and passenger role. The users of the trip-sharing service according to preferred embodiments of the invention are able to specify their preference to act as driver in the form of a value of a scale ranging for example from 0 to 10. The scale value 0 indicates that a driver never wants or is not able to act as driver. The maximum scale level indicates that a user always wants to drive but the user may also specify in between values therein scale values residing in the middle of the scale indicate that a user is likewise willing to act as driver or as passenger. The users preference to act as passenger is considered to be inverse to his preference to act as driver: a person having the value ZERO in said scale is considered never to act as driver and to be a categorical passenger. A user having the highest possible scale value is considered as categorical driver never acting as passenger. The user may also determine a low scale value indicating that he prefers to act as passenger but may also act as driver if no driver can be found by the trip-sharing service for the requested trip. Further embodiments of the invention use scales comprising more or less than the said 11 different scale values 0-10, or use the scale to indicate the preference of a user to act as passenger.","The allocation of roles by the trip-sharing service may in addition determine the distance of the departure location of both allocated persons from the destination location and may, based on that data in the user's preferences to act as a driver or passenger, assign the driver and passenger roles.","Current trip-sharing services use only two discreet \u2018driver\u2019 or \u2018passenger\u2019 attributes and do not allow a user to gradually adapt his preference to act as driver. Surely there exist cases of users who can never act as driver, e.g. persons not owning a car or not having a driving license, and of users who always want to act as drivers. However, it will be often the case that a user owns a car but wants to save money by sharing his car with others or by acting as car passenger. This kind of user may be assigned the driver or the passenger role depending on the peculiarities of each particular case.","A significant disadvantage of many car sharing services currently available is that the number of passengers by far exceeds the number of drivers. As a result many trip-sharing requests cannot be matched and will not result in the arrangement of a shared trip. The trip-sharing service according to preferred embodiments of the invention solves this problem by dynamically allocating driver roles resulting in a much higher fraction of successfully mediated shared trips: in case none of two matching persons is particularly keen on acting as driver for a particular trip but both users match very well in other regards, e.g. regarding the specifications of the trip plans and user-related preferences, one person having a preference to drive greater than 0 may be dynamically assigned the role of a driver by the trip-sharing service.","A further advantage of the matching method of the trip-sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention is the ability of the matching method to automatically compare a multitude of personality features and trip-related features very quickly. According to current trip-sharing services the registered users have to manually login to the service portal, search for planned trips of other users planning to travel to the same or a nearby destination location at the same time. In case a user detected a potential trip accompany whose trip plans matched according to said basic trip data (time and place of a trip) he or she currently has to manually evaluate whether the potential trip accompany is acceptable regarding additional features of the person. Said features are features which can be of relevance during the time spent together on the trip. Such features can be the preferred age, the preferred gender and the preferred smoking habits of a trip accompany. Said features can also comprise the taste in music of the user and the preferred experience or preferred manners of driving of a trip accompany acting as driver. This manual evaluation may take considerable time and effort and the user may soon lose track of the best matching candidate if the number of potentially trip accompanies is high.","The trip matching method according to a preferred embodiment of the invention helps to save time and effort by automating this evaluation step and by matching users automatically based on their specifications of planned trips and based on user-related specifications. Such features can be the preferred age, the preferred gender and the preferred smoking habits of a trip accompany. Said features can also comprise the taste in music of the user and the preferred experience or preferred manners of driving of a trip accompany acting as driver. In addition a user of the trip-sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention may specify that he solely or preferentially wants to share a trip with members of the same social group. The social group can be the group of employees of a company or of a department of a company. The group may be derived from the user's profiles of various social networks such as Facebook or Xing. The social group can also be specified within the trip-sharing service. A further feature that can be considered by the matching method is acquaintance of users of the trip-sharing service with each other. A user who has shared a trip multiple times with another user of the service may specify in his user profile that he preferentially wants to share trips with persons he already knows from previous shared trips.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the user profiles available for the trip-sharing service are selected from the group consisting of social communities, employee profile lists of companies, LDAP directories and user profile lists. Various software modules being able to pass the profile data of various social networks and user repositories have been developed to extract user-related data and to define user profiles according to the requirements of the trip-sharing service.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the user can evaluate former trip accompanies. The evaluation comprises criteria such as cleanliness of the car or the person himself, kindliness and friendliness of the driver or passenger, driving skills and further criteria. A user can evaluate and assign a grade to each of these criteria. The result of the feedback information provided by one or multiple users can be used as additional specification in the matching method: a user may specify that he or she wants to share a trip only with persons having been evaluated positively by a minimum number of other users or have reached a positive evaluation score exceeding a particular threshold.","According to a further embodiment, registered users having used the trip-sharing service to organize a shared trip receive at the end of the respective month a message reminding the user to provide feedback information on the trip accompanies he has not evaluated yet. The message can comprise a link to facilitate the process of logging into the trip-sharing service portal and to provide feedback information on past trips.","A further advantageous feature of the matching method according to further embodiments of the invention is the consideration of a price specification during the match. The price specification of both matching users is used to determine a final price. The price determination by the matching method can be adapted in order to increase the efficiency and utilization of the service and to increase the number of drivers participating in the trip-sharing service. A user of the trip-sharing service can specify the maximum price he is willing to pay in the role as passenger, e.g. in cent per kilometers or cent per mile. The user can also specify the minimum reward he expects to receive in the role as driver. The matching method considers the utmost price a potential passenger is willing to pay and the minimum reward a potential driver expects to receive and determines whether both users match given their pricing preferences. In case the passenger is willing to pay more per mile than the driver expects to receive according to one embodiment of the invention the actual price will be determined by the matching method as in between price lying between the specifications of both users.","According to other embodiments of the invention the price will be higher than said in between price including the possibility to be equal to the maximum price a passenger is willing to pay. The flexibility regarding the pricing policy is particularly beneficial as this feature allows to make the trip-sharing service more attractive to drivers. In case much more passengers than drivers use the service the pricing strategy can be flexibly adapted to attract more drivers. As a result more persons can be attracted to use the trip-sharing service and to act as driver. The number of drivers is the bottleneck of many current trip-sharing services. By adapting the algorithm which determines the final price to be paid by the passenger to the driver, the trip-sharing service according to said embodiments of the invention can be adapted to the current distribution of users preferring to drive or preferring to act as passenger.","According to further embodiments of the invention the user can specify the maximum detour he is willing to accept in the role as driver in order to pick-up a passenger. The maximum detour for picking up a passenger can be specified as a time or as a distance measure. The maximum acceptable detour can be given in absolute values, e.g. a particular number of miles or kilometers or as relative value. A relative value can be for example 10% of the total route of the trip. The specification of relative values is particularly advantageous as in general users accept a much longer detour for long distance trips than for short trips, e.g. for a trip from home to work executed daily by commuters. Based on the user-specific settings for the maximum detour on departure, the trip-sharing service calculates the pickup radius. The pickup radius specifies the pickup area. The pickup area is an area surrounding the place of departure within which a user in the role of a driver is willing to pick-up passengers for a particular trip. The pickup area is considered in the matching method.","In addition the user can specify the maximum detour he is willing to accept in the role as driver to drop off a passenger. The maximum detour can be specified as a time or as a distance measure. The maximum acceptable detour for dropping off a passenger can be given in absolute values, as a particular number of miles or kilometers or as relative values. Based on the user-specific settings for the maximum detour for dropping off a passenger the trip-sharing service calculates a drop off radius. The drop off radius specifies the area around the destination location of the driver within which the driver is willing to drop off passengers for a particular trip. The drop off area considered in the match is considered in the matching method. Two compared potential trip data objects will not match in case the destination location of the passenger is not within the drop off area.","According to further embodiments of the invention each user of the trip-sharing service can specify a blacklist of users which shall not be considered as potential trip accompanies by the trip-sharing service. This feature provides the user with the possibility to be sure not to be allocated to a person he once shared a trip with and does not want to be allocated to a second time. The user may use this blacklist also to ensure that he will not share a trip with a colleague his dislikes or with a neighbor he has a dispute with.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the matching method is provided by a trip-sharing service hosted on a remote server. The trip-sharing service is accessible via multiple different interfaces from multiple different types of clients. The service is able to return a result to the clients via multiple different interfaces. A user may register for the service by creating a user profile. The user profile comprises contact data of the user, e.g. an email address or a mobile phone number. A user can determine the value of various user-related specifications which are used by the trip-sharing service in the matching method to determine a matching trip accompany. The user might specify his preferences regarding the smoking habits, the age, the gender, the social proximity or driving skills of potential trip accompanies. He can specify the price he is willing to pay in case he uses the trip-sharing service as passenger and the minimum price he wants to receive for acting as driver. He can set his driver\/passenger preferences wherein the settings can be a value of a scale ranging from 0 to a maximum scale value. Said specifications are evaluated during the matching process. For example in case a user has specified to share trips with non-smokers only the trip-sharing service will not suggest a smoker as a trip accompany. In case the user according to the specifications of his user profile is not willing to pay the minimum reward expected by the driver, the trip-sharing service will not match both users in the matching process.","According to further embodiments of the invention exceptions exist from this general behavior which will be explained later.","Each of the mentioned specifications can be assigned a weight by the user. A non-smoker who does not mind others to smoke may set the weight of the specification indicating the smoking habits of a trip accompany to 0. As a result this specification will not be considered in the matching method. In case a user does in any circumstance not want to share a trip with persons having a particular age or taste in music the user may set a high weight to these features and the matching method will consider the specifications accordingly. Features having been assigned a high weight by the user will be required to match perfectly or almost perfectly while other features having been assigned a low weight may allow a match although the matched person does not fit to the user in that particular regard.","Some specifications are considered by the matching method as mandatory. Said specifications are specifications for the starting time, the place of departure, the arrival time and the destination location. In case the trip plans of users differ significantly regarding the place of departure regarding the destination location and the time for performing the trip are matched between users resulting in an allocation of users to a particular trip does not make any sense. Therefore these features are required to match in any case. In addition the minimum amount of money the driver expects to receive and the price a passenger is willing to pay at the most have to fit together otherwise a match is not possible. In addition, for a successful match, it is required that one of the matching users can be assigned the role of a driver and one can be assigned the role of a passenger. Said features are required to match otherwise the potential trip data objects corresponding to two users will not match and the corresponding users will not be allocated as trip accompanies.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the data evaluated in the matching step is derived from multiple resources. The smoking habits, gender and similar data are usually derived from the specifications of the user profile of a user registered for the trip-sharing service. Other data, e.g. the time and place of departure or arrival are specified within a service request sent to the trip-sharing service. Specifications which never or only rarely change, e.g. the smoking habits, the gender or the taste in music are usually specified within the user profile. Data which will change for every service request, e.g. the time and location of a planned trip are submitted in the service request.","A service request is a message sent from a client or another remote service to the trip sharing service. The trip sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention provides a multitude of different communication interfaces. The service request can therefore be submitted based on a multitude of communication technologies. The interfaces provided by the web service will in the following be referred to as \u2018web service\u2019 interfaces. The term \u2018web service\u2019 therein and in the following does not merely refer to a web service in the strict meaning of the word (a software system for machine-to-machine communication based on SOAP, the XML based interface of the service being described by a WSDL file). Accordingly, the term \u2018web service interface\u2019 does not necessarily refer to an XML based interface described by a WSDL file and supporting the data exchange via web services in the strict meaning of the word. Rather, the term \u2018web service\u2019 in the following denotes any kind of communication technology for exchanging data between two processing devices. The term \u2018web service\u2019 as used in the following therefore includes web services in the strict sense, e.g. RESTful web services, but includes also the exchange of data via SMSs, Http requests, remote procedure calls (RPC), CORBA, DOOM, RMI or any other communication technology. The term web service also includes data exchange via RDS, satellite link, e-mails or SMS interface or via instant messaging based e.g. on XMPP\/Jabber. Web services in the strict sense, conforming to the specification of the world wide web consortium (W3C) will in the following be referred to as \u2018W3C web services\u2019 and their corresponding XML based interfaces will be referred to as \u2018W3C web service interface\u2019. The W3C web service may according to some embodiments of the invention be registered in an UDDI registry.","A service request submitted to the trip sharing service can therefore be a meeting request e-mail submitted to the e-mail interface of the service, a web service request submitted to the W3C web service interface or a SMS submitted to the SMS interface of the service. The result retrieved by the client can be received via the same interface used for submitting the request or via another interface. According to further embodiments of the invention, the user can specify the communication technology and interface used to receive a response from the service in his user profile.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the starting time submitted by a user to the trip-sharing service specifies the earliest acceptable starting time for the user. Accordingly the time of arrival submitted by a user to the trip-sharing service specifies the latest acceptable arrival time for the user. The submitted starting time and the submitted arrival time therefore define a time window within which a user is prepared or willing to travel. The broader the specified time window the higher the chances of a user to find a matching trip accompany based on the matching method of preferred embodiments of the invention.","According to further embodiments of the invention the starting time and the time of arrival submitted to the trip-sharing service specify the actual starting time and the estimated arrival time of the planned trip. For example a driver who knows exactly when he wants to start and when he will arrive and who is not flexible regarding his trip plans may submit this information to provide other persons with the option to join him as passengers. As the timeframe submitted by the driver via the starting time and the arrival time parameters is in that case roughly equal to the time required to travel, the driver according to the described use case scenario will accept only passengers requiring only a very small or no detour.","According to a further embodiment of the invention each of the specifications of the user profile can be overwritten by the submission of a service request comprising in addition to the time and place information of the trip user-related specifications. For example a non-smoker who wants to ensure to find a matching driver for a particular urgent trip may specify his service request submitted to the trip-sharing service to accept smokers for the next trip although according to his user profile, he does not want to share trips with smokers.","According to preferred embodiments of the invention it is possible to assign multiple passengers to one trip. The assignment of multiple passengers to one trip requires that each of the passengers matched to the one single driver associated with each trip in that the driver accepts each passenger as trip accompany and vice versa.","Users who prefer to act as passengers are, according to the matching method of a preferred embodiment of the invention, preferentially assigned to drivers which have not yet been assigned a passenger. Only in case there does not exist an alternative match, more than one passenger is assigned to one driver. This feature of the matching method ensures that the driver is not unduly burdened by multiple passengers, each passenger potentially requiring the driver to deviate from the direct route to the destination location in order to pick-up or drop off a passenger.","Each potential trip planned by a user corresponds to a potential trip data object. The potential trip data object represents a trip event of the real world but differs from the real world event in that the starting time and the arrival time of the potential trip data object specifies the timeframe within which the trip of the real world is planned to take place. The potential trip data object according to a preferred embodiment of the invention is created by the trip-sharing service upon receipt of a service request of the user. The potential trip data object comprises basic trip related data such as the earliest acceptable starting time and the latest acceptable arrival time according to the user submitting a service request to the trip-sharing service. The receipt of a service request by the trip-sharing service results in the generation of a potential trip data object. The potential trip data object according to further embodiments of the invention in addition comprises user-related specifications according to the user profile values of the user, e.g. the user preferences regarding the smoking habits, the gender and the taste in music or age of a potential trip accompany.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the potential trip data objects compared in the matching method are implemented as multidimensional vectors. Each vector comprises trip related and user-related specifications. Each specification is represented by one dimension of the vector. A vector could for example comprise dimensions representing the place of departure, the starting time, the destination, the maximum price payable as passenger, the minimum expected reward as driver, the user's smoking preferences or the user's preferences regarding the gender of trip accompanies. Each dimension has assigned a weight which corresponds, geometrically, to the length of each vector component. A vector component represents the influence of that vector in a given dimension. Some dimensions can have assigned a high weight while other dimensions such as a taste in music of the trip accompany may have a low weight. The weight of some of the dimensions representing a specification, e.g. the taste in music can be specified by the user in his user profile.","The weight of a dimension determines the impact of each dimension on the overall matching score obtained by comparing the vectors of two potential trip data objects with each other. The similarity of two vectors is determined based on the angle between both vectors within a multidimensional space. The smaller the angle, the more similar are both multidimensional vectors to each other and the higher is the matching score. The weight of a particular dimension determines the impact of that dimension on the matching score of the two compared vectors.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the determination of the vector similarity is executed by the TREX search engine of SAP which comprises multiple vector operations based on the vector space model and a data mining feature pack for advanced algebraic analysis. TREX supports structured data search not only for document Metadata but also for mass business data and data in SAP business objects. In indices for structured data are implemented compactly. Data can be aggregated and analyzed in linear time to enable large volumes of data to be processed entirely in memory.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the matching method returns a result list comprising potential trip data objects with a matching score exceeding a predefined threshold. The list is sorted according to the matching score of a potential trip data object. Each potential trip data object represents a service request of a particular user. Two matching potential trip data objects represent a pair of potential trip accompanies. The potential trip data object with the highest matching score is the first potential trip data object in the result list and referred to as best matching potential trip data object. The user corresponding to the best matching potential trip data object is referred to as \u2018best matching user\u2019.","According to a further embodiment of the invention a user can specify a threshold for an automatic allocation of trip accompanies in his user profile. Said threshold determines the matching score above which a user corresponding to a potential trip data object is automatically accepted as trip accompany. A confirmation of the user to accept the other user whose matching score exceeds a threshold for automatic allocation of trip accompanies is not required. Matching users with a matching score below the matching score threshold for automatic trip accompany allocation may be suggested to the user as trip accompanies by the trip-sharing service. An allocation of trip accompanies in this case is established upon receiving an explicit confirmation of the user.","According to a further embodiment of the invention a further threshold for the matching score is specified by the user. Potential trip accompanies having been detected by the matching method and having a matching score below the threshold are never suggested to the user as potential trip accompanies.","According to further embodiments of the invention the user submitting a request to the trip-sharing service does not receive a suggestion of a potential trip accompany if the criteria specified in the user profile are not met. However, there exist a few cases according to which a user will be suggested a potential trip accompany while also one of his specifications is not met by the matching user:\n\n","To simplify matters the expression of a \u2018matching user\u2019 in the following refers to a user having specified via a service request a potential trip data object the potential trip data object having been detected by the matching method to match to another potential trip data object.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the suggestion of a potential trip accompany not matching perfectly to the specifications of a user is connected with a time information: in case 24 hours before the planned trip starts according to the specifications of the service request submitted by the first user to the trip-sharing service, the trip-sharing service suggests potential trip accompanies even in case these potential trip accompanies do not match perfectly or have a matching score slightly below the minimum matching score specified by the user.","The comparison of the planned place of departure of the two users requires execution of some additional calculation steps in order to determine whether the two places can be considered as being located together in spatial proximity. If the place of departure and the destination location of both compared potential trip data objects and corresponding users are close enough to each other is referred to in the following as \u2018location matching\u2019.","According to further embodiments of the invention each user profile comprises a radius determining the maximum acceptable distance from the place of departure to pick-up a passenger. Said radius is referred to as pickup radius. The value is only of relevance in case the user indeed acts as driver because usually a passenger would not mind the driver accepting a long detour to pick him up. In addition each user profile comprises a radius determining the maximum acceptable distance from the destination location to drop off a passenger. Said radius is referred to as drop off radius. Again this radius is only of relevance for the matching step in case the user acts as driver.","Both radiuses can be given an absolute time or distance measures, e.g. in minutes or miles or in relative values, e.g. 10% of the total route distance or 10% of the total travel time. With the help of both radiuses a user can specify the maximum acceptable detour for picking up and dropping off passengers in case he acts as driver. Both radiuses of a user profile are used by the matching method to determine if two users match. A match between the users requires that the place of departure and the destination location of the passenger lie within the area specified by the radiuses of the driver for the maximum acceptable detour for picking up and dropping off passengers. Passengers having either a place of departure or a destination location lying outside these areas do not match to the driver as the matching score is significantly diminished by a mismatch regarding said feature.","The driver\/passenger roles are however dynamically assigned by the matching method at the end of the matching method wherein the driver\/passenger preferences of the potential trip data objects and their respective places of departure in relation to their destinations are evaluated. It is therefore not determined at the beginning of the matching method who of the users will indeed act as driver and whose radius values are relevant. The first user may have significantly smaller radius values than the second user in case he is not willing to lose too much time by picking up or dropping off passengers. Therefore the trip-sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention uses a permissive location matching method and uses, according to other embodiments of the invention, a strict location matching method. The use of the strict location matching method gives the danger of overseeing potential users but is more straight forward to implement. The use of the permissive location matching method guarantees that all matching users are detected but requires the execution of an additional filtering step after the matching score has been calculated for a pair of potential trip data objects.","According to the permissive location matching method the length of the pickup radiuses of the two potential trip data objects are compared and the larger of the two radiuses is used to determine if the places of departure of both users match. Analogously the larger of the two drop off radiuses of both potential trip data objects is used to determine if the destinations of both users lie close enough to each other. The permissive location matching method guarantees that no potential matching user pair is missed. However, in case at the end of the matching method the user with the smaller pickup or drop off radiuses is determined to be the driver the determined matching score may be too high and needs to be corrected in an additional filtering step. In the filtering step the matching score is reduced in case the place of departure or the destination location of the actual passenger lies outside the pickup or drop off area of the actual driver.","According to the strict location matching method the shorter of the two pickup radiuses is used to determine if the places of departure of both users match. The shorter of the two drop off radiuses of both potential trip data objects is used to determine if the destinations of both users lie close enough to each other. In case the strict location matching method is applied the filtering step is not necessary.","According to further embodiments of the invention the permissive location matching method is the default location matching method in order to make the matching regarding the maximum detour for picking up a passenger as permissive as possible. It is therefore assumed in the matching step that the larger pickup and drop off radiuses are associated with the user having the driver role. In case this assumption is wrong and the pickup or drop off place of the passenger lies outside the pickup and drop off areas of the driver the wrong assumption is corrected in the filtering step.","According to further embodiment the area surrounding the place of departure of the driver as specified by the pickup radius is segmented into at least two segments. In case the area is split into two or more segments one of the segments has to be centered upon the axis connecting the place of departure with the destination location of the driver. Said segment is referred to as S segment. The segments adjoining S are referred to as S. The segments adjoining the S segment (with the exception of S) are referred to as S segments. In case the pickup places of multiple matching passengers lie within the pickup area of the driver, the matching score of the passengers which have to be picked up in S are highest followed by the matching score of passengers having to be picked up in S, S and so on provided that the passengers do not differ from each other in other respects. The place of departure of the user having assigned the passenger role is referred to as pickup place. This feature is particularly advantageous as the consideration of the pickup place in the matching method helps to preferentially allocate passengers to drivers who require only a minimum detour. The segment S is the segment lying more or less on the direct route of the driver to his destination location. The smaller the segment size the more fine-grained information on the required detour for picking up a passenger is available.","Analogously the area defining the maximum detour acceptable for the driver to drop off a passenger is determined by the drop off radius of the driver with respect to the destination location of the driver. Said area can be segmented and can be considered during the matching method as well. A drop off place requiring no or only a very small detour, e.g. the drop off places lying within S will result in an increased matching score. Drop off places lying in S segments or even S segments will result in a lower matching score compared to drop off places lying in S.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the specifications of the potential trip data objects evaluated and compared in the matching method in addition comprise a specification on the segment of the pickup area within which the pickup place of the passenger is located and a specification of the segment within which the drop off place is located. Both areas indicate the utmost detour acceptable for a user acting as driver for picking up and dropping off passengers.","According to further embodiments of the invention, the location matching method is implemented as a \u2018corridor matching method\u2019. According to said embodiments, a corridor is defined along the route. Each user can specify the width of the corridor as a time or as a distance measure. The maximum acceptable detour can be given in absolute values, e.g. a particular number of miles or kilometers, or as a relative value. A relative value can be for example 3% of the total route of the trip. Said value defines a corridor of the width of 6% of the total route length (3% to the left side and 3% to the right side of the driver. The \u2018corridor matching method\u2019 is particularly advantageous, as it allows a driver to pick up passengers at an arbitrary place along the route lying within said corridor. The \u2018corridor matching method\u2019 therefore does not require the places of departure and the destination location to match. It is merely required that the passenger's pick-up place lies within the corridor somewhere along the route of the driver from the drivers place of departure to the driver's destination location location.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the matching algorithm is able to learn from previous decisions of a user regarding trip accompanies suggested by the trip-sharing service. Previous decisions of a user therefore influence the results generated by the matching method and help to improve the matching service. In case a first user in the past has multiple times accepted users as trip accompanies who did not match perfectly to the specifications of the first user, the repeated acceptance of these non-perfect matching users may have led to a shift of that very specification of the first user which was hitherto the cause for the matching method resulting in imperfect matches. For example a first user may have specified in his user profile that the maximum acceptable detour for picking up passengers in the role as a driver is 10% of the total distance of the route. As the specification was too strict the first user repeatedly did not receive perfect matches but sub-optimal matches of passengers having a pickup location requiring a detour of 11% and 12%. The first user repeatedly accepted these passengers requiring a detour of 11% and 12%. As a result the trip-sharing service automatically changed the specifications of the user profile of the first user regarding the maximum acceptable detour for picking up passengers from 10% to 12% of the total route. The matching method initiated upon the result of a service request as a consequence uses a maximum detour limit for picking up passengers of 12% of the total route.","According to a further embodiment of the invention the adoption of those specifications of a user profile having repeatedly been violated by accepting also users as trip accompanies not matching that specification perfectly is not executed automatically. Rather the user is prompted to agree to the modification of that specification in his user profile. That feature informs a user that a particular specification in his user profile may be too limiting for an effective matching of trip accompanies.","According to further embodiments of the invention the service request submitted to the trip-sharing service is required to comprise at least data specifying the earliest acceptable starting time, the latest acceptable arrival time, the place of departure and the destination location of the planned trip. The term \u2018acceptable\u2019 indicates the point in time that the user submitting the service request considers as acceptable. The place of departure and the destination location have to be unequivocal addresses or geo-coordinates to provide the service with unequivocal information for matching users with each other sharing the same or a nearby place of departure or destination location.","According to other embodiments of the invention the service request submitted to the trip-sharing service may comprise general user-specific or group-specific tags representing places or routes. As unequivocal addresses are hard to memorize and cumbersome to enter, according to preferred embodiments of the invention the user has the option to specify the place of departure or the destination location in the service request via tags. Those tags are automatically replaced by a mapping service by unequivocal addresses. The mapping service is a part of the trip-sharing service and precedes the execution of the matching service.","Unequivocal address information is required by many services in the context of appointment and trip management, e.g. for calculating the distance between two locations and for estimating the required travel time. The entry of those unequivocal addresses is however time consuming as most people memorize only a very limited number of complete addresses including street, house number and postal code. Usually people use the names of persons, buildings or activities when referring to particular places, e.g. \u2018Mike\u2019, \u2018Mr. Peters\u2019, The Pentagon', \u2018Home\u2019 or \u2018Work\u2019.","According to said embodiment of the invention, the user is allowed to enter ambiguous names, for example \u2018Mike\u2019 or \u2018Home\u2019, in order to refer to an unequivocal address including street, house number and postal code. The ambiguous tags are mapped to unique addresses, the addresses being used in further processing steps. In contrast to complete address blocks, those tags can be entered by the user very quickly and conveniently. It is possible, for example, to specify a route by entering \u2018from Mike to Tom\u2019 or \u2018from Home to Work\u2019. In order to calculate the route to get from one person to the other, e.g. by a route planning service, those tags have to be mapped to the complete address of each person. As the name \u2018Mike\u2019 may, depending on the user, denominate different persons located in different places, a personalized, user-specific mapping and tag replacement has to take place. In order to calculate a route based on location tags contained in a service request, a personalized mapping schema specifying to which address the name \u2018Mike\u2019 has to be mapped is required. The personalized mapping information may be provided as additional information within the service request or may be a part of a user profile available to the service.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the mapping also comprises the mapping of general terms and names to unequivocal addresses, e.g. \u2018Pentagon\u2019 or \u2018White House\u2019 and the mapping of group specific tags. The general and personalized tags of a user profile according to said embodiment of the invention can be supplemented by tags being specific for a particular social group the user belongs to. The user being registered for a service may be member of a particular social group, e.g. a social network such as Xing or MySpace, may belong to the personnel of a company or a particular department of a company. In case the department of the company the user is working at organizes a Christmas staff party at a particular restaurant, the tag \u2018Christmasparty\u2019 may be mapped to the unequivocal address of the restaurant for all user profiles being member of said social group. The process of mapping comprises a text analysis step in which token boundaries are determined, in which some of the tokens are recognized by the service as tags representing unequivocal addresses and wherein regular expressions may be applied in order to identify location tags.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the mapping of location tags to unequivocal addresses also comprises the mapping of tags to routes. According to this use case scenario, the service request may comprise one single tag representing a route rather than two location tags representing the starting point and destination location. For example, the tag \u2018Highway\u2019 could represent the route from \u2018Work\u2019 to \u2018Home\u2019 via the highway, while the tag \u2018Countryroad\u2019 refers to an alternative route from \u2018Work\u2019 to \u2018Home\u2019. The required mapping information is derived, according to one embodiment of the invention, from a list of \u2018favorite routes\u2019 being contained in a user's profile. Alternatively, the mapping information could be specified within a text field of the service request.","According to further embodiments of the invention, the matching method of the trip sharing service is initiated on a remote server hosting the trip sharing service as follows:\n\n","The matching method tries to match the newly generated potential trip data object against all potential trip data objects already existing in the database of the trip sharing service. For each pair of the newly generated potential trip data object and an existing potential trip data object from the database, the matching method determines the degree of congruency. After all existing potential data objects have been compared with the newly generated potential trip data object existing potential trip data objects are collected in a result list. The result list of matching potential trip data objects is sorted according to the matching score of the pairs of compared potential trip data objects.","The matching method comprises the following steps:\n\n","After the matching method has terminated, both users corresponding to the first and the best matching potential trip data objects have to be notified of the successful match and have to be assigned to each other as trip accompanies. The first user corresponds to the user having submitted the service request resulting in the execution of the trip sharing service. The best matching user corresponds to the best matching potential trip data object existing already in the database.","Depending on the embodiment of the invention and on user specific settings, the first user and the best matching user are allocated as trip accompanies for a particular trip automatically, upon confirmation by one user or upon confirmation of both users. The allocation of trip accompanies requiring the explicit confirmation of the allocated users is referred to as semi-automatic allocation of trip accompanies.","In case both users have successfully been allocated to each other (automatically or semi-automatically), the data comprised in both potential trip data objects is used by the trip sharing service to specify a new data object, an arranged trip data object. According to further embodiments of the invention, the starting time of the arranged trip data object is the first starting time acceptable by both users. For example, the potential trip data object corresponding to the user submitting the service request comprises the value 2 p.m. as starting time while the best matching potential trip data object having been read from the trip sharing service's database comprises the value 2.30 p.m. as starting time. In this case, the starting time of the arranged trip data object is 2.30 p.m. In case the respective embodiment of the invention comprises a route calculation, the time required for the trip is used to specify the expected arrival time of the arranged trip data object. The arranged trip data object is stored to the trip sharing service's database.","An allocation process following a successful matching method tries to allocate the best matching user, which is the user corresponding to the best matching potential trip data object, to the user submitting the service request as trip accompany. The allocation process may be executed automatically or upon confirmation by the user.","According to further embodiments of the invention, other users reaching a matching score slightly below the threshold for automatically allocating matching users as trip accompany are allocated to the first user as trip accompany only upon the user's explicit confirmation. By modifying the threshold in his user profile, the user may flexibly determine the matching score above which the trip sharing service is allowed to automatically allocate matching users as trip accompanies.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, a user can specify the number of seats available in his car for the case he acts as driver. In case multiple users acting preferentially as passengers match to said user acting as driver, multiple passengers can be assigned to the driver.","In case the matching method has been executed successfully, the best matching user has to be allocated to the first user submitting the service request.","Automatic Allocation of Trip Accompanies:","In case the matching score is high enough for an automatic allocation of trip accompanies, the trip sharing service determines, which user has been assigned the driver role and which user has been assigned the passenger role by the matching method. The server hosting the trip sharing service sends a notification of a successful match to the device of the driver. The notification comprises user specific data of the passenger, e.g. an e-mail address or a mobile phone number as contact data. In addition, the notification comprises the place of departure of the passenger, the pick-up place. The notification in addition comprises information on the price of the arranged trip.","In addition, the trip sharing service sends a notification of a successful match to the device of the passenger. Said notification comprises user specific data of the driver, e.g. the driver's e-mail address or his mobile phone number. In addition, the notification sent to the passenger may comprise the arrival time. The notification in addition comprises information on the price of the arranged trip.","No further action of the driver or the passenger is required. As both users have selected the option of an automatic allocation of trip accompanies in their user profiles and the matching score was high enough, it is assumed that both users agree to the automatic allocation of each other as trip accompanies. Each user may manually contact his allocated trip accompany, but he is not obliged to do so. The number of manually executed steps in order to organize a shared trip can thus be minimized and tremendously simplified.","In case the user corresponding to the best matching potential trip data object has a high matching score which, however, does not reach the threshold for automatic trip accompany allocation, a semi-automatic trip allocation procedure is initiated by the trip sharing service which requires the confirmation of one or both users. Depending on the embodiment of the invention, the semi-automatic allocation of trip accompanies to each other may be executed server-based or client-device based.","Server-Based Semi-Automatic Allocation of Trip Accompanies:","In case the best matching pair of potential trip data objects reaches a high score which however is still below the threshold values specified by both users corresponding to the compared data objects, a first matching result message is sent from the server hosting the trip sharing service to the client device of the driver. The driver is selected as first recipient as typically the number of available drivers is lower than the number of passengers and drivers can therefore be expected to be more selective regarding trip accompanies than the passengers. The first matching result message comprises user specific information on the suggested passenger. The driver may accept or reject the best matching user as trip accompany.","In case the driver accepts the suggested passenger, an acceptance message is submitted from the driver's device to the server. The server in this case submits a second matching result message. The second matching result message is sent to the client device of the passenger and comprises user specific data on the driver. The passenger can accept or reject the driver.","In case the passenger accepts the driver, an acceptance message is submitted from the client device of the passenger to the server, comprising the information that the passenger accepts the driver. As a consequence, an arranged trip data object is created by the trip sharing service and stored to the tip sharing service's database. The server now submits a message to the driver's device and the passenger's device, the message comprising a notification on the arranged trip.","In case the driver rejects the suggested passenger, a rejection message is submitted from the client device of the driver to the server hosting the trip sharing service. The trip sharing service checks if the result list of the executed matching procedure comprises a further user matching to the current driver.","If so, the server determines if the driver role of the new pair of matching user is still assigned to the user having currently assigned the driver role. It is possible that the current driver has a passenger role and the further matching user has the new driver role. The service determines the current role of the former driver and the role of the further matching user and submits a new first matching result message to the current's driver's device suggesting the current matching passenger.","In case no such further matching user could be found, the semi-automatic allocation of trip accompanies is aborted without an allocation of trip accompanies, without the arrangement of a shared trip and without the creation of an arranged trip data object. The potential trip data objects remain unchanged in the database of the trip sharing service and may lead to another successful match during the next execution of the matching method.","In case the passenger rejects the driver, a rejection message is submitted to the server. The trip sharing service as a result checks, if a further user was found in the previously executed matching method. In case no further matching user was found the method is aborted without an allocation of trip accompanies.","In case a further matching user was found, the current roles of the former passenger and the further matching user is determined by the server. The former passenger may act as passenger or as driver according to the further match. The trip sharing service will determine the current driver and the current passenger based on the pair of the former passenger and the further matching user. Afterwards, the service sends a message to the new driver's device suggesting the user currently having associated the passenger role.","The server-based, semi-automatic allocation of trip accompanies requires the exchange of at least 6 messages:\n\n","Client Device-Based Semi-Automatic Allocation of Trip Accompanies:","According to further embodiments of the invention, the semi-automatic allocation of trip accompanies is established based on the communication between the client devices of the passenger and the user. Said client device-based semiautomatic allocation of users requires at least five communication steps in case the driver immediately accepts the passenger and vice versa:\n\n","In another aspect of an embodiment of the invention, the client device-based semi-automatic method for allocating trip accompanies in case of a successful execution of the matching method comprises:\n\n","According to further embodiments of the invention, the client device-based allocation of trip accompanies is executed by a trip manager program installed on each of the client devices. The trip manager program comprises one or multiple machine-machine interfaces enabling the devices to exchange data with each other, e.g. via the Internet, via a mobile telephone connection or any other data exchange technology. The trip manager program according to further embodiments of the invention is in addition capable to prompt the user via a graphical user interface for accepting or rejecting a suggested trip accompany.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the user can specify in his user profile if he wants his position to be tracked during the trip. In case the user has security concerns when traveling with an unknown person, he may use this option to ensure that he can be located along the route or in case the driver notably deviates from the route. The tracking function requires that the client device of the user comprises means to determine the current position of the car. Such a client device could be, for example, a mobile phone comprising a GPS receiver. The trip sharing service receives the position information from the client and stores this information to its database. The positional data is deleted from the server after the user preferring to be tracked has reached his destination location.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the trip sharing service comprises in addition the function of tracking the position of users currently executing a trip having been organized by the trip sharing service, wherein the trip sharing service submits an alarm in case the position significantly deviates from an originally determined route of an arranged trip.","According to further embodiments of the invention, the semi-automatic allocation of trip accompanies is executed by client devices having installed a trip manager program.","The trip manager program installed on a client device facilitates the use of the trip sharing service by the user of the client device. The trip manager program in operation is able to communicate with the remote trip sharing service. The trip manager program manages four distinct lists of data objects representing predicted, published, arranged and past trips. The data objects are referred to accordingly as predicted, published, arranged and past trip data objects. Each trip data object comprises at least specifications of the starting and arrival time, on the place of departure and on the destination location. The location information can be determined in the form of unequivocal addresses or in the form of general, user- or group-specific tags.","The first list comprising predicted trip data objects is stored solely on a client device. Predicted trip data objects can be trip data objects predicted by a service integration module as explained in the following paragraphs. A predicted trip data object can also be created manually by the user, e.g. via a graphical user interface provided by the trip manager program. The predicted trip data objects are stored solely on the client device and are not known to the trip sharing service. For example, in case a user plans a trip but is not sure if he will be able to travel at the specified day, he may define the trip data object in advance. The main function of the first list is to act as container for planned trips for which still some relevant data is missing, e.g. the place of departure, or which are not guaranteed to take place at all. Possible user actions on the predicted trip data objects are: create, delete, edit and publish. The publication of a predicted trip data object is equivalent to moving the respective predicted trip data object to the second list comprising published trip data objects. Moving a particular predicted trip data object from the list of predicted trip data objects to the list of published trip data objects (the second list on the client) triggers the submission of a service request to the trip sharing service. The service request comprises the trip specifications (starting time, arrival time, place of departure, destination) of the predicted trip data object. The published trip data object is stored by the trip sharing service in a database. The trip sharing service uses the specifications of the published trip data objects and the specifications of a user profile corresponding to the service request to create a potential trip data object. Said potential trip data object is used by the trip sharing service in the next step to execute the mapping and matching service as described beforehand.","The second list comprising published trip data objects is stored on the client device. As the specifications of each published trip data object are submitted as service request to the trip sharing service upon publication and result in the generation of a corresponding potential trip data object on the server, the data contained in the second list of trip data objects on the client is also contained on the server hosting the trip sharing service.","A trip data object does not necessarily have to be created in the list of predicted trip events first. A trip data object may be created directly as published trip data object in the second list. Depending on the embodiment of the invention, the published trip data object may be created automatically or manually by the user. A published trip data object created in the second list is automatically published upon creation and submitted to the trip sharing service in the form of a service request. On the server side, the service request triggers the creation of a potential trip data object and the execution of the matching method. The trip data objects of the second list can be created, edited or deleted. Any action upon said published trip data objects will be automatically submitted to the trip sharing service in the form of a service request.","According to further embodiments of the invention, the automatic prediction and creation of predicted or potential trip data objects in the first or second list is executed by a service integration module. The service integration module is a piece of software installed on the client device. The service integration module has read and write access to a calendar application and to the first and second list of the trip manager program. In case the service integration module predicts a required event based on the analysis of the electronic calendar of the calendar application, the service integration module may create a predicted trip data object or a published trip data object. The expression \u2018required event\u2019 refers to data objects being stored in, written to or read from an electronic calendar of a calendar application, the data objects representing an event in the real world. An event can be a singular event or a recurring event comprising a particular recurrence pattern.","If the service integration module creates a predicted trip event in the first list, the user has the option to review the prediction result and to publish the predicted trip event manually. In case the service integration module creates a published trip data object in the second list, a corresponding service request is submitted automatically to the trip sharing service.","According to further embodiments of the invention, service integration module can be implemented as \u2018plug-in\u2019 or \u2018add-in\u2019 for the calendar application or the groupware server of the calendar application. It can also be implemented as an independent service program being registered as event listener with a calendar event of a calendar application or the groupware server of the calendar application. It can also be implemented as an independent service program updating the electronic calendar on a regular basis. As said service integration module has to be interoperable with the calendar application or the respective groupware server, the implementation details of the service integration module depend on the type and version of the calendar application, e.g. on a particular version of Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes or the corresponding groupware servers.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the trip manager program is implemented as event listener listening on the creation of events in a calendar application installed on the client device. If a new event is specified by the user of the client device, the trip manager software automatically creates a predicted trip data object in the first list of trip data objects.","The third list located on the server side and also on the client device side comprises arranged trip data objects. In case the trip sharing service determines at least one matching potential trip data object and in case the corresponding matching user could be successfully allocated to the user of the client device comprising the trip manager program, an arranged trip data object is created by the trip sharing service and stored to the database. The corresponding potential trip data objects on the server side are supplemented with a link pointing to the arranged trip data object in the third list. The arranged trip data objects are also supplemented with at least two pointers to their at least two respective published trip data objects corresponding to the driver and the at least one passenger.","The arranged trip data object is similar but not identical to the published trip data objects it is derived from: for example, the driver and the passenger have specified via their published trip data objects a time frame within which each of them was willing to travel. On the contrary, the arranged trip data object comprises the starting and arrival time of the actual trip. The specifications of the arranged trip event are submitted by the trip sharing service to the client device, resulting in the creation of an arranged trip event in the third list stored on the client device and a deletion of the corresponding published trip event in the second list. The arranged trip data objects of the third list can be edited, deleted or used to contact the allocated trip accompany by the user of the trip manager program.","The fourth list comprises past trip data objects. After the arrival time according to the specifications of the arranged trip data object is reached, the corresponding data object is moved from the list of arranged trip data objects to the fourth list comprising past trip data objects. This movement is executed on the trip manager program on the client and also on the server hosting the service integration module. A user can click on a past trip data object to provide feedback information on the trip accompany corresponding to the past trip data object or to contact said trip accompany. According to a further embodiment of the invention, the past trip event is deleted after three month from the list.","While the first list is located solely on the client device, the second, third and fourth lists are located on the client device and on the server hosting the trip sharing service.","According to further embodiments of the invention, the trip manager program and the service integration module are implemented as one single piece of software unifying the capabilities and functions of both software modules.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the trip manager program is implemented as software running on the Android operating system.","According to further embodiments of the invention, the client devices are mobile processing devices such as smart phones, mobile phones, Blackberries, netbooks, notebooks or navigation devices.","The trip manager program according to further embodiments of the invention is operable to manage the communication between the client device with the server during the automatic and semi-automatic trip accompany allocation process.","According to further embodiments of the invention, the trip manager program is in addition operable to manage the communication between two client devices in the semi-automatic client device-based allocation of trip accompanies. To provide said communication functionalities, the trip management program comprises an appropriate interface for exchanging messages with the trip sharing server and with other instances of the trip management program being installed on other devices.","According to further embodiments of the invention, the trip sharing service can be initiated by a service request submitted by a first client device, the first client device including:\n\n","In the following, the term \u2018data object\u2019 refers to computer interpretable objects comprising data which can be manipulated by the commands of a programming language.","The manual specification of planned trips, the manual search for and evaluation of potential trip accompanies and the subsequent communication steps between both potential trip accompanies to agree upon the trip details requires considerable time and effort. As a result, current trip sharing services are used only by a fraction of the people having a car or being interested to use a trip sharing service as passenger.","According to further embodiments of the invention, said limitations of current trip sharing services are overcome by a dynamic and flexible matching method being operable to intelligently and dynamically assign driver and passenger roles to matching users, by an elaborate and adaptable matching method being operable to calculate a matching score based on a multitude of user and trip related specifications and by an flexible and automatic way of allocating users as trip accompanies.","The matching method according to the embodiment depicted in  determines, whether a first potential trip data object created after receiving a first service request reaches a sufficient level of congruency with one or more potential trip data objects stored in the database of the trip sharing service. The execution of the matching method is initiated by the receipt of the first service request by the trip sharing service. The highest scoring match of the first potential trip data object with an existing potential trip data object corresponds to a match of the user submitting the service request to the user having formerly submitted the service request resulting in the creation of the best matching potential trip data object. According to preferred embodiments of the invention, the determination of the degree of congruency is implemented as a comparison of vectors as depicted in . Further aspects of the matching method regarding the matching of locations are depicted in and ","In case the level of congruency is high enough, e.g. in case the matching score reaches a particular threshold, the users corresponding to each matching potential trip data object are allocated to each other as potential trip accompanies. The allocation can be executed automatically by the trip sharing service as depicted in . The allocation of trip accompanies can also be executed semi-automatically based on the server hosting the trip sharing service communicating with the client devices as depicted in . The allocation of trip accompanies can also be executed semi-automatically based on the server communicating with the client devices and the client devices communicating with each other as depicted in . The service requests can be submitted to the trip sharing service via third party services, for example, an event management service, as depicted in . One embodiment of the trip sharing service is can be seen by a combined consideration of and . The trip sharing service provides a multitude of interfaces and may be called by a multitude of clients via a multitude of technical communication protocols as depicted in .","According to further embodiments of the invention, the adapter modules and communication interfaces hosted according to and  on a trip sharing message server are hosted on the same server as the trip sharing service (not shown).","The service requests can be specified and submitted by a user explicitly, e.g. by creating a meeting request e-mail in a calendar application such as Microsoft Outlook which is sent to an e-mail interface of the trip sharing service. This application scenario is depicted in and . A meeting request response email and, depending on the implementation of the calendar application, a second meeting request e-mail, is sent by the trip sharing service to the user's e-mail address and received by the calendar application of the user's client device. The response e-mails are submitted by the trip sharing service to the user in case the trip sharing service was executed successfully. The trip sharing service was executed successfully in case the matching service, which is a part of the trip sharing service, detected in the database of the trip sharing service at least one potential trip data object reaching a matching score above a threshold with the trip data object created upon receipt of the service request. The e-mails returned in this case comprise the result of the execution of the trip sharing service, e.g. user specific data of the matching user. Upon receipt of the meeting request response email or the second meeting request e-mail, the calendar application of the user is updated. In effect, the trip sharing service is integrated into the calendar application of the user.","Other client devices as depicted in , and  may use a special software module installed on the client device which is operable to submit service requests to the trip sharing service. Said additional software component is referred to as service integration module. The service integration module may use W3C web service technology, SMS, e-mail, instant messaging or any other communication technology to submit a service request to a corresponding interface provided by the trip sharing service. The service integration module may receive the results of the service via the same or a different interface as the interface used to submit the service request. The service integration module receives the result returned by the service and updates the electronic calendar of the calendar application. In case the trip sharing service returns the result via e-mail, the service integration module is only required for submitting service requests, not for receiving the result and for updating the calendar application. Said scenario is depicted in .","According to a further embodiment of the invention, a trip manager program may be installed on the client device in addition or instead of the service integration module. The trip manager program provides the user with a graphical user interface to conveniently specify and manage planned, arranged and past trips.","According to further embodiments, the service requests are not specified manually and explicitly by the user. Rather, required trip events are predicted by the service integration module having access to the calendar application of the trip sharing service as depicted in .","The trip sharing service according to further embodiments of the invention can be integrated into any calendar application comprising a meeting request e-mail functionality, e.g. Microsoft Outlook, Apple iCal, Mozilla Thunderbird, Google Calendar, Blackberry Calendar, Lotus Notes, the iPhone Calendar and many more. A meeting request functionality of a calendar application is a function by which users can invite one or multiple other persons to a meeting, the meeting being defined by a starting time, location and arrival time. Each invited person may accept, postpone or reject a meeting invitation by sending a meeting request response (MRR) e-mail to the e-mail address of the organizer. In case an invited person accepts the suggested meeting date, the event in the electronic calendar of the organizer corresponding to the MR for the meeting is automatically updated with the information that the invited participant will join the meeting.","Each invited person may accept the appointment, reject it or propose a new time. The invited user submits his decision to the calendar application of the organizer by clicking on an \u2018accept\u2019, \u2018reject\u2019 or \u2018suggest new time\u2019 button displayed by the calendar application of the invited person after opening the meeting request (MR) e-mail. In most current calendar applications, it is possible to submit more information than said three options \u2018accept\u2019, \u2018decline\u2019 or \u2018propose new time\u2019, e.g. by adding comprehensive supplementary data or comments to the MRR e-mail in the e-mail's text body. However, due to security considerations, this additional data is not added to the calendar event in the organizer's calendar. For said reason, the options for automatically updating electronic calendars via a MRR e-mail are currently restricted to a limited set of parameters and cannot be used to add complex textual comments via a meeting request response e-mail. A possible workaround is the sending of a second meeting request e-mail to the list of recipients comprising the comments a user wants to add. The electronic calendars of the recipients are automatically or upon confirmation updated, because the receipt of the second MR e-mail will trigger the creation of new events.","Other calendar applications following a less restrictive security policy than e.g. Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes are more permissive regarding the possibility to update events via MRR e-mail of invited users. In order to update those calendar applications, the submission of a second MR e-mail by a recipient of the first MR is not required. Rather, the recipient of the first e-mail is able to provide all other invited persons and the organizer with additional relevant data simply by adding said data directly e.g. to the text body or another field of the first MRR e-mail. If the calendar applications of the recipients follow a permissive updating policy, the additional data provided in the first MRR e-mail will automatically be added to the existing MR related event in their respective electronic calendars.","In the following, the updating of the organizer's electronic calendar regarding said limited list of options (\u2018accept\u2019, \u2018decline\u2019, \u2018propose new time\u2019) via a first MRR e-mail in combination with creating a new event in the organizer's calendar by sending a second MR e-mail (from the recipient of the first MR to the organizer of the first MR) will be referred to as \u2018default updating strategy\u2019. The second MR e-mail comprises additional data and may also comprise modified event specifications. The specifications of an event can comprise a time information, e.g. the starting time or arrival time, but can in addition or alternatively also comprise information such as location, subject, a recurrence pattern for recurring events and additional information required by a recipient, the additional information being contained in the text body of the event.","A second \u2018advanced updating strategy\u2019 does not require the submission of the second MR e-mail, because according to this update strategy all additional data can be provided already within the MRR e-mail. The advanced updating strategy requires the calendar application of the organizer and other participants of the event to follow a permissive security policy: the calendar application must allow the update of any kind of information of a calendar event, e.g. starting time, arrival time, location or the text contained in the text body of the event).","The term update request (UR) will in the following refer to the submission of e-mails from the trip sharing service to the user of a client device having installed a calendar application in response to a service request submitted by the client, wherein the e-mail may be one single MRR e-mail or a combination of a MRR e-mail and a second MR e-mail.","The update request comprises, in case of the default updating strategy, the submission of a first MRR-email and a second MR e-mail to the organizer's e-mail address, the first MRR updating only a limited list of options of the event associated with the first MR, the second MR e-mail updating the organizer's electronic calendar by creating a second event. The second event comprises all the additional data and optionally modified event specifications. Said updating strategy is in the following referred to as \u2018default updating strategy\u2019.","The update request comprises, in case of the advanced updating strategy, the submission of only a first MRR-email to the user's email address by the trip sharing service, the first MRR e-mail being able to update any kind of data specifying the event associated with the first MR, e.g. time and location and being able to add supplementary data to the event corresponding to the first MR e-mail.","Which kind of updating strategy is applicable in the context of a particular use case scenario depends on the implementation and security policy of the calendar application installed on the client device.","Due to the fact that in praxis many calendar applications for security reasons do not provide the full update functionality they could provide, further embodiments of the present invention follow a dual strategy for automatically integrating services into calendar applications via the MR and MRR functionality provided by current calendar applications.","In the following like elements are designated by identical reference numerals throughout the various embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0161","num":"0208"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"185"},"At first, the trip sharing service receives a first service request  submitted from a first user. The service request comprises trip related data. The service request comprises a starting time, an arrival time, a place of departure and a destination location. In case the user profile comprises a default departure location or a default destination, the respective information may be absent in the service request. The service request comprises also information allowing the mapping of the service request to a user profile. This information can be provided e.g. in the form of an e-mail address corresponding to the e-mail address used in the user profile of the first user. The trip sharing service creates and specifies in step  a first potential trip data object which comprises trip related information, e.g. time and place of departure and arrival and which comprises in addition user related information derived from the user profile of the first user. User related information can comprise the smoking preferences or taste in music of the first user. The created first potential trip data object is stored to a database of the trip sharing service. All service requests received in the past which have not yet been allocated to a matching trip accompany are stored in the form of potential trip data objects in the database of the trip sharing service. The trip sharing database typically comprises several 100.000 or several million potential trip data objects.","After receiving the first service request in step  and creating and specifying a first potential trip data object based on the first service request in step , the matching method  is initiated: a loop process  looping over all potential trip data objects currently existing in the trip sharing database except the first potential trip database is executed.","For each existing potential trip data object, steps , , ,  and  is executed. The current potential trip data object of the loop, in  referred to as \u2018second potential trip data object\u2019, is compared in step  with the first potential trip data object. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the comparison between the first and the second trip data object is implemented as a comparison of two multi-dimensional vectors whose dimensions are weighted. The comparison is executed on the trip related specifications, e.g. time and place of departure, and on user related specifications, e.g. smoking habits, driver\/passenger preferences or taste in music. In step , the degree of congruency of both potential trip data objects is determined. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the degree of congruency is specified as a matching score. The higher the weight of a dimension of the compared vectors, the higher the impact of said dimension on the matching score. In Step , a final role is assigned to each of the users corresponding to the first and the second potential trip data object. Categorical drivers and categorical passengers will be assigned their categorical role, but they cannot be matched to each other if they have the same categorically specified role. In case both users have specified to act preferentially, but not categorically, as driver or passenger, their final role may not in every case be their preferred role. The final role may depend on the preferences of the assigned trip accompany and on the places of departure of both users in relation to the destination location.","In case in step , the comparison of potential trip data objects, a permissive location strategy was applied to determine a match between locations, a filtering method  has to be executed. The filtering method checks if the pick-up or drop-off radius of the user having been assumed in step  to have the driver role is indeed larger than or equal to the pick-up or drop-off radius of the user having been finally assigned the passenger role. If this assumption is false, the matching score is reduced accordingly.","The decision  determines, if the degree of congruency exceeds a first threshold for adding a potential trip data object to the result list of matching trip data objects. The degree of congruency is preferentially indicated by a matching score. Depending on the embodiment of the invention, the threshold may be specified by each user in his user profile or may be predetermined by the trip sharing service. In case the matching score exceeds a first threshold, the matching potential trip data object is added to a result list in step . The list is sorted according to the matching score of each second potential trip data object. After step  is finished, the loop proceeds to the next potential trip data object of the database and compares this current trip data object as new \u2018second trip data object\u2019 with the first trip data object according to the steps of the loop procedure .","After having compared all existing potential trip data objects with the first potential trip data object, the decision  determines if the matching method was executed successfully. The matching method was executed successfully in case the result list comprises at least one matching existing potential trip data object.","In case the result list comprises at least one matching potential trip data object, the trip data object with the highest matching score is used to allocate the first user as trip accompany to the best matching user. In case of the successful execution of the matching method, a method allocating the user corresponding to the first potential trip data object to the user corresponding to the best matching potential trip data object as trip accompanies is initiated.

The trip sharing service  processes the data contained in the MR e-mail and executes  the service. The execution  of the service is decoupled (asynchronous) from the submission of the MRR e-mail. Step  may be executed immediately after sending the MRR e-mail or after a predefined period of time. The service may also be executed  repeatedly on a regular basis until a certain condition is fulfilled or may be triggered by any other event. Which kind of trigger is used by the service for its execution depends on the service. The execution  may involve the calling of one or more second order services (not shown) or the reading and\/or writing of data from or to various storage media, e.g. a database. Depending on the results of step , a second meeting request MR is created and specified by the service which is finally sent  as a result to the e-mail address  of the user. After receiving  the second MR email MR by the calendar application , a second event  is created according to the specifications of MR, the specifications (time, location, subject, additional data within the text body) being the result of the execution  of the service. The user of the calendar application may confirm or decline  MR by submitting a second MRR e-mail MRR to the service. After receiving  MRR, the server may execute additional processing steps depending on the acceptance status of MRR and on the implementation of the trip sharing service .","For example, if the service request submitted to the trip sharing service resulted in a match and a successful allocation of trip accompanies, the MRR email may have been marked by the service with the status \u2018accepted\u2019 resulting in the event  being flagged in the electronic calendar as \u2018confirmed\u2019. The MR e-mail leading to the creation of a second event  in the electronic calendar may comprise a different starting and arrival time than event , in case e.g. the trip accompany preferred an earlier arrival time as specified in event  and MR. The starting time of the MR e-mail is according to this use case scenario the actual departure time of the trip and the arrival time is the arrival time according to the arranged trip data object. The MR e-mail may also comprise additional information regarding the allocated trip accompany, information on the route, the pick-up place in case the allocated trip accompany is the passenger and the like. This additional data is contained in the second event  created by the calendar application upon receipt  of MRR. In case there service request did not yield a match or a successful allocation of a user, the trip sharing service could have returned a decline via MRR.","In case the calendar application supports the \u2018advanced updating strategy\u2019 (), the MRR e-mail would have been created after the execution  of the trip sharing service . Depending on the service, MRR may have been created only after a successful completion of the service yielding a particular kind of result. The MRR e-mail would comprise the results of the execution of the service and could differ regarding its specifications (starting time, arrival time, location) from the specifications of MR. As the calendar application  according to this scenario is able to update the calendar event  automatically, the additional information generated by the service would be added to event  automatically and the specification of event  would have been replaced in the update step by the event specifications (e.g. starting and arrival time, location) of MRR. In this case, the creation and submission  of a second MR e-mail is not required and no second event  is created.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0219","num":"0266"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["322","152","157","153","152","150","157"]},"The service integration module  in operation analyzes in step  the events contained in the electronic calendar  in order to predict events or service request necessary or useful for organizing the events in the real world represented by the existing calendar event data objects. The begin of the analysis step  is triggered according to one embodiment of the invention by the entry of a new event by the user. Step  can also be initiated and executed on a regular basis in predefined time intervals according to a further embodiment. In step , all events within a calendar or only a subset of events may be evaluated. The subset of events to be evaluated can be determined e.g. by the temporal proximity of an event  to a newly entered event  or any other criteria depending on the implementation of the service integration module .","According to a further embodiment of the invention, all events of the electronic calendar being in temporal proximity to a newly entered event  are used by the service integration module  for the prediction of required trip events. If, for example, event  is a business meeting in the office of an employee at 9.00 a.m. already existing within the calendar application and the newly entered event  is a business meeting in another town at 4 p.m., then the service integration module  predicts in step  that a trip is required in order to get from the office to the meeting in the other town in time. The service integration module  may execute several additional computation tasks depending on the implementation of . For example, the service integration module  could comprise the functionality of mapping tags contained in the location or text body fields of events to unequivocal addresses. If the meeting locations have been entered in the electronic calendar in the form of ambiguous names, e.g. \u2018Mike\u2019 or \u2018Mr. Miller\u2019, these location tags are replaced by their respective unequivocal addresses. The mapping of route tags to routes is also supported. In addition, or alternatively, the unequivocal addresses of the first and the second meeting place may be used by service integration module  to predict the best route, predict the route with the shortest travel time and to suggest a starting time corresponding to the specified route. The prediction of the best route may also depend on user specific settings if available to the service integration module . The arrival time of the first event and the starting time of the following event may determine the earliest acceptable starting time and the latest acceptable arrival time for the planned trip. Those settings may comprise data on the driver\/passenger preferences of the user registered for the trip sharing service. In step , additional data which may be required by the trip sharing service for processing the service request is assigned to the predicted required event. In step , the service integration module  submits a service request  to the first web service interface of a trip sharing service assisting in organizing the trip, the request comprising the start and arrival time of the predicted required event. The request may comprise additional data provided by the service integration module .","According to one embodiment of the invention, the service integration module  in step  automatically initiates the submission of a service request to the first web service interface of the service.","Depending on the implementation of the service integration module and the prediction result, step  may also comprise the prediction of multiple required events of different types. For example, service integration module  could have predicted the required event of a trip to get from one appointment to the next appointment, and could have in addition predicted the requirement of ordering a business gift for a particular meeting participant in time resulting in the submission of one service request to a trip sharing service to organize the trip and the submission of a second service request to a vendor of business gifts.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the predicted required events are presented to the user of the calendar application before submission, they are not used to automatically specify and submit service requests to the services. The user has the option to check if he really wants to submit the predicted required service request, e.g. to the trip sharing service. In case the user accepts the prediction of the service integration module  and marks a predicted required event accordingly, the corresponding service request(s) are submitted to one or multiple services. This embodiment of the invention is particular beneficial if the predicted required events and actions often vary depending on multiple additional factors and an automatic service request may therefore be inappropriate. In case the user feels ill and does not know in advance if he will be able to join a meeting scheduled in the following week, the user in this case has the option to delay his approval to the submission of the service requests until he is sure to be able to join the meeting and to make use of the trip sharing service.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the service integration module  is used to predict required trip events and to submit corresponding service requests to a trip sharing service. The service integration module  predicts required trip events to get from one appointment to the next. The service integration module analyzes all events  being in temporal proximity to a particular event , e.g. an event that has just been added to the calendar application. The analysis according to one embodiment of the invention is initiated by the entry of the new event , but according to other embodiments, the analysis could be triggered by other events or be executed on a regular basis.","According to a typical use case scenario, a supplier of a remote service provides the service integration module  in the form of a downloadable service integration module , e.g. a downloadable plug-in, developed for a particular calendar application, e.g. Microsoft Outlook. After installation on the client machine, the plug-in in operation is capable to analyze the calendar application, to predict required events and actions and to send corresponding service requests to the service. The service providing the downloadable plug-in may also provide means for entering user profile data or any other additional data to the plug-in, this data being used as additional information submitted in the service requests.","The service integration module  may have access to the user's profile data via accessing an online service related to the service integration module  or via the user entering his profile data to the service integration module  manually. This user profile data, if available, and context data of the analyzed events (e.g. time and location) is used in the analyzing step  to determine required trip events to get from the first meeting event to the next.","The existing event  in the calendar may be a telephone conference on Monday, 9 a.m., having associated the location tag \u2018Work\u2019. The second event may be a business meeting on 3 p.m. on the same day being assigned the location tag \u2018Dr. Millor Ltd.\u2019. The plug-in predicts a required trip event to get from the employee's home to his office, the trip having an arrival time several minutes before the telephone conference starts. The time security margin can be specified by the user in the user profile, e.g. 15 minutes. In this case, the service integration module  will predict a required trip event from home to the employee's office with an arrival time 8.45 a.m. (15 minutes earlier than 9 a.m.). The predicted departure time is the earliest departure time acceptable for the user while the arrival time is the latest arrival time acceptable for the user. The latest acceptable arrival time can be calculated by considering the starting time of a meeting in combination with a time margin specified e.g. in the user's profile data ensuring the user does not arrive late at a meeting. The predicted starting and arrival time therefore specify a time window within which the user is willing to travel. The service integration module may in addition predict further trip events required during the office day, e.g. in order to get from the office to the meeting scheduled at 3 p.m. in another town, or predict trip events required for spare time activities, e.g. to travel from the office to a movie theater. The prediction comprises the following steps:\n\n","According to further embodiments of the invention, the service integration module is operable to write predicted required events as predicted trip event objects into the first list of trip data objects of a trip manager program installed on the same client device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0230","num":"0281"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"i":["a ","a"],"b":["450","473","473","447","472","459"]},"An event managing service  is installed on a remote server .

The service request in addition contains information on the location from which the customer plans to start his trip to the concert.","All relevant information is extracted from the service request . At first, a profile service is invoked for assigning a user profile to the service request. The profile service has access to the database  comprising, among other data, also user profiles. A user profile  may comprise multiple attributes, e.g. the real name of the user , his date of birth , his e-mail address , and may also comprise mapping information  and additional parameters  specifying e.g. driver\/passenger preferences of the user.","The profile service  searches for the user profile stored in the database . The search concentrates on the e-mail address attribute  of the user profile in order to map a user profile to the service request based on identity of the e-mail address of the user profile  and the customer's e-mail address  specified in the service request. The data contained in a service request sent to the trip sharing service and the data contained in each user profile according to one embodiment of the invention is illustrated in detail in . If an appropriate user profile  was found by the profile service, mapping information  contained in this user profile is retrieved and used during the execution of the mapping service . The mapping service maps ambiguous tags ,  within the service request to unequivocal addresses ,  (). There exist generally available tags, e.g. \u2018Home\u2019 or \u2018Work\u2019, but also user-specific tags, e.g. \u2018Mike\u2019 or \u2018Supermarket\u2019. These tags are automatically replaced by user specific, complete addresses as specified in the mapping schema  of the user profile. The two addresses  and  define the starting point and destination location of the trip. In addition, external services such as Google Maps may be used to derive the of those addresses or to derive street maps depicting the route of the shared trip.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the service request  may comprise additional mapping information  overwriting the tag mapping schema  of the user profile. For example, the tag \u2018Work\u2019 may be mapped according to the specification in a user's profile to a particular address. Three days in a year the employee works in a different dependence of his company. Instead of changing the mapping information of his user profile, the employee during those three days may simply add additional mapping information to his service requests sent to the trip sharing service, the additional information mapping \u2018Work\u2019 to a different address. The additional mapping information could, for example, be submitted via the GUI of a service integration module for the trip sharing service installed on the client machine. After retrieving the unequivocal addresses for the location tags, a route is calculated to get by car from the starting point to the destination location. According to a further embodiment of the invention, the route calculation may be executed by a third party service, e.g. Google maps. The route can be used by the service to calculate the time the trip via the predicted route will probably take.","After the execution  of the mapping service , a matching service  is executed. Based on the calculated route and additional parameters contained in the user's profile or the service request , the mapping service of the trip sharing service searches for users having associated preferences being congruent with the preferences specified in the service request  and the sender's user profile  and who plan to travel the same route or a part of the same route within the time window defined by the starting time (the earliest acceptable starting time for the user) and the arrival time (the latest acceptable arrival time for the user) as specified in service request . In addition, the matching service checks if the profile of the user submitting the service request  and the profile of a potential trip accompany match regarding their trip specifications and preferences , e.g. regarding their driver\/passenger preferences. In case one or multiple matching user profiles are detected in the database , the best matching profiles are assigned automatically to the trip. The result comprising the best matching user profiles is sent according to the depicted use case scenario via a second order service request  to the e-mail adapter component hosted on the trip sharing message server . The Email adapter  creates a meeting request e-mail with the e-mail address of the customer in the recipients field. The MR e-mail is sent to the customers e-mail address  by the E-mail interface , resulting in an update of the electronic calendar of the customer.
