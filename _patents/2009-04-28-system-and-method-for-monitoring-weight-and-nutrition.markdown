title: System and method for monitoring weight and nutrition
abstract: A system for providing weight and nutritional information. The system involves input of subject data such as weight, body fat percentage, and expected activity levels. Users also may input an assessment of a subject, which can be used to generate a weight plan for the subject. The weight plan can include a series of acceptable minimum weights for the subject, each of the minimum weights being associated with a time. The method can also be used to generate a nutrition plan based on the subject data entered. A subject can build the nutrition plan by responding to a series of food exchange item prompts.

Peplinski, Alan Utter, and David Neiman, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/355,195, filed Jan. 31, 2003 by Daniel M. Peplinski, Alan Utter, and David Neiman (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,023), both of which claim priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/391,587, filed Jun. 27, 2002, and this application claims benefit to those filing dates for priority. The entire disclosures, specifications, attachments and drawings of U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10\/355,195, 10\/355,195 and 60\/391,587 are incorporated herein by specific reference for all purposes.","The present invention relates generally to products and methods useful for monitoring body weight and nutrition, and more particularly to methods and products that can be used over the Internet or through software to calculate and monitor body weight and nutrition, especially for those in sports programs that require weight monitoring, such as wrestling.","Athletes, especially wrestlers, may lose weight very rapidly to gain a competitive advantage. Athletes often use rapid weight reduction methods in order to qualify for a certain weight classification. For some wrestlers, in particular, weight loss is excessive and often accomplished by methods that lead to loss of lean body mass and total body water. There is evidence that this excessive and rapid weight loss is unhealthy, especially for high school wrestlers who have not yet completed their growth and development. Negative health consequences include growth retardation, decreased academic and cognitive performance, and altered endocrine or hormonal function. Cycling of body weight may also decrease strength, power and endurance, diminishing a wrestler's likelihood of success. Three tragic deaths in late 1997 prompted the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to make a Wrestling Weight Certification Program (WWCP) mandatory to foster a safe competitive environment.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,937,387 to Summerell et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,954,640 to Szabo and U.S. Pat. No. 6,368,272, to Porumbescu describe various nutritional methods and algorithms. Summerell's system can be accessed through either an Internet or intranet format, or implemented in a stand-alone mode or a workstation or a PC. However, none of these methods provides a product or method that is easily employed by a user to determine how much weight a particular individual can be expected to lose or maintain without adverse affect to their body, and to build a nutrition plan.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,839,901 to Karkanen discloses an integrated weight loss control method. Karkanen fails to disclose, however, monitoring a subject's weight to determine a maximum allowable weight loss over successive time periods, and building a nutrition plan to conform to the allowable weight loss values.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,951,197 to Mellinger discloses a weight loss management system. Mellinger fails to disclose, however, monitoring a subject's weight to determine a maximum allowable weight loss over successive time periods and building a nutrition plan to conform to the allowable weight loss values.","According to a first embodiment, a method of monitoring weight, comprises providing a plurality of data entry options, the data entry options allowing entry of data for generating an assessment of a subject, wherein the menu of data entry options comprises an option for entry of an identification of the subject, an option for entry of subject gender, an option for entry of subject academic level, an option for entry of subject weight, and an option for entry of data describing subject body fat percentage. The assessment data may be stored on a computer-readable medium. A subject body fat percentage is determined, and a weight plan is generated based on the subject assessment data. The weight plan is generated by calculating a plurality of minimum weights for the subject using a maximum allowable weight loss percentage for a time period, each of the minimum weights being associated with a time period.","Additional objects, features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects, features and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combination particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","In accordance with the embodiments discussed below, a system and method are disclosed for providing weight and nutrition information. The information can describe, for example, a weight plan for a subject, a subject's compliance status with a weight plan, a nutrition plan for a subject, and other information regarding a subject's weight, health, or nutritional status. The system and method can be used, for example, to determine how much weight a subject can lose while avoiding possible adverse effects on their health. The nutrition plan can be used to ensure that the subject follows the weight plan.","The system and method disclosed in this specification are particularly suitable for young subjects who are still growing and may not fully understand the harm that they may cause by losing or gaining too much weight. According to one embodiment, a user can determine a subject's minimum weight for a series of time periods, and a build a diet plan according to factors such as the user's initial body fat percentage, height, weight, and perhaps also, age. The minimum weight at each time period can be determined according to guidelines published by state and national athletic organizations, such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).","In one embodiment, the weight certification program of the present invention is a web-based application that is used to monitor the weight of certain classes of subjects. For example, collegiate and scholastic (e.g., high school) wrestlers are governed by specific weight guidelines, and the web-based application can be used to monitor their weight and\/or nutritional status.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1000","1000"]},"The system  comprises a server  connected to a network .

However, the general principles discussed below maybe applicable to any number of sports, particularly those in which weight and\/or nutrition are relevant factors for qualification for the sport. In addition, many aspects of the website can be used by users who are simply interested in obtaining a nutrition and\/or weight loss plan, and who may not be interested in participating in a sport. The website arrangement can be programmed on and executed by the server  illustrated in , or by other server arrangements. The website arrangement can also be in the form of an executable program stored on a digital medium readable by, for example, a microcomputer or personal computer.","Referring to , a WEIGHT CERTIFICATION PAGE provides a menu option for a COLLEGIATE menu and a SCHOLASTIC menu. The COLLEGIATE option may be used to obtain information regarding athletes governed by collegiate sports standards, such as those provided by the NCAA and the NAIA. The SCHOLASTIC menu option can be used to obtain weight information regarding athletes governed by one or more of the various state and local governing bodies. The options provided under the COLLEGIATE menu option can be tailored to conform to the appropriate governing body. At the present time, NCAA weight guidelines are used by collegiate governing bodies. The options provided under the SCHOLASTIC menu option can also be tailored to conform to a particular governing body's requirements. At the present time, NCAA weight requirements are acceptable by most state and local collegiate governing bodies. A subject who is not governed by any particular governing body can select, for example, either the COLLEGIATE or the SCHOLASTIC menu. In general, the weight loss and nutrition guideline information provided under both options is advantageous to users regardless of their participation in sport.","The COLLEGIATE menu is illustrated in . The SCHOLASTIC menu is illustrated in . If the user is neither a collegiate nor a scholastic sport participant, the user may elect to simply access, for example, the collegiate mode. In an alternative embodiment, the collegiate\/scholastic option may be omitted and access can be provided directly to the menu options disclosed under the COLLEGIATE and SCHOLASTIC menu options, where applicable. Access to the various menus may be provided according to the user's identity. For example, in a state with mandatory weight certification programs, entry of data through menu options may be restricted to persons such as coaches, or assessors designated by the relevant governing body or bodies.","The INSTRUCTIONS menu option can be selected to obtain specific information for using each of the menu options in the website, or for other information relevant to the site. The INSTRUCTIONS menu can include, for example, a description of skin fold measurements.","The ENTERING DATA menu option is provided to allow a user to input data regarding a subject. The subject may, in effect, be the user, who may enter his or her own data. The ASSESSMENTS SECTION I option provides access to an NCAA Wrestling Weight Certification Section I form, which is illustrated as . The Section I form is used to provide an initial assessment of a wrestler at the date of the initial assessment, or \u201calpha\u201d date. As shown in , the ASSESSMENTS SECTION I menu option generates various weight data for the subject wrestler. The weight data generated includes a lowest allowable weight-one (LAW 1), body density (BD), percentage of body fat (% BD), fat weight (FW), free fat weight (FFW), lowest allowable weight-two (LAW 2), and a lowest minimum wrestling weight (MWW). The NCAA provides the Weight Certification Section I form and the calculations used to determine the above data.","After completing the NCAA Wrestling Weight Certification Section I form, the data may be saved, and the form can be printed. The subject wrestler's information is thereby saved in the system.","The ASSESSMENTS SECTION II menu option provides a user access to an NCAA Wrestling Weight Certification Section II form, which is illustrated as . The form is generally completed before a wrestler's first competition. The Section II form is used to ensure that the subject wrestler conforms to NCAA body fat percentage requirements. The FINAL CERTIFICATION SECTION II option is used to verify wrestler status.","The REPORTS option is used to generate reports for information entered regarding one or more subjects. The SECTION I AND II REPORTS menu options can be used to generate reports for all of the wrestlers on a particular coach's team, and may list all of the Section I and Section II information, respectively. The SUMMARY REPORT menu option allows the user to display and print a summary of different data concerning those subjects for which the user has access to. A Squad List Summary Report is illustrated as . The WEIGHT LOSS PLAN menu option provides a printout of a weight loss regimen generated by the weight certification website. A sample weight loss plan is illustrated as . In general, the WEIGHT LOSS PLAN describes a permissible maximum weight loss for the subject. Each date on the form includes a minimum weight that the subject may have at that time. In the form shown in , the minimum weights are calculated to the NCAA standard of a maximum loss of 1.5% of body weight in any one week period. The RECERTIFICATION FORM menu option is used to generate a form to allow a wrestler to return to a previous weight class. The WRESTLER ACCESS menu option generates a list of wrestlers, their alpha date, alpha weight (i.e., weight at initial assessment), login ID, and login password. A sample wrestler access form is illustrated as .","The STUDENT ATHLETES menu option is used to generate a weight loss plan for a subject and to generate a nutritional plan for the subject. Developing a weight loss plan and a nutritional plan are discussed below with reference to the SCHOLASTIC menu option. The subject who is a student athlete will generally obtain an I) and a password from his coach.","The coach references each subject's ID and password from the WRESTLER ACCESS menu, which lists all of his team member IDs and passwords.","The EDUCATION option can be used to access nutritional information and access to, for example, an educational video. The educational video may be provided to advise coaches, wrestlers, parents, or other athletes and subjects on basic nutritional principles, hydration, and weight management. The video can include, for example, a review of basic nutritional guidelines, a review of hydration guidelines, recommendations for weight management, and special nutritional topics for certain classes of subjects. For wrestlers, that could include topics such as, for example, pre-competition meals, food and beverage intake during competition, post-competition nutritional guidelines, healthy choices from the school cafeteria, etc. A HELP option may also be provided to provide information on use of the site and for other information.","The SCHOLASTIC menu option is illustrated in . The INSTRUCTION, EDUCATIONAL, and HELP menu options can contain information similar to the menu options under the COLLEGIATE menu shown in , and may be tailored to the scholastic side of the website.","The COACHES menu option is provided to allow coaches to enter data regarding subject wrestlers, and to access subject data. The INITIAL ASSESSMENT menu option is used to generate an NWCA Wrestling Weight Certification form. A sample NWCA Wrestling Weight Certification form is illustrated as . The NWCA form may use calculations similar to the NCAA form illustrated in , with modifications to account for the different body composition requirements for state or local governing bodies. For example, according to the form shown in , the minimum allowable body fat percentage is 7%, as opposed to the 5% value shown in the NCAA form. The system  () can account for national, local and state requirements, and can generate forms that conform to the requirements.","The APPEAL option provides a list of subject wrestlers, and allows a user to select a subject, and to request an appeal of the initial assessment for that wrestler. The ALPHA MASTER menu option is used to generate an NWCA Wrestling Weight Certification Alpha Master Report. A sample NWCA Wrestling Weight Certification Alpha Master Report is illustrated as . The WEIGHT LOSS PLAN menu option is used to generate a weight loss schedule for a subject. The weight loss schedule provides a list of minimum weights that the subject can have at specified dates, similar to the plan illustrated in . A sample plan is illustrated as . The wrestler's actual weight for each time can be entered in the right column. The WRESTLER ACCESS menu option generates a NWCA Wrestling Weight Certification Wrestler Access Report, which may have a format similar to the form shown in .","The ASSESSORS menu option is used to allow a designated assessor to enter information in the system and to view information. The assessor is typically a person authorized by a governing body to monitor the weight status of one or more subjects. The assessor may also be authorized to enter data and to generate reports. The INITIAL ASSESSMENT option, the APPEAL option, the ALPHA MASTER option, and the WEIGHT LOSS PLAN option may all have functions for assessors similar to the same functions under the COACH menus. In a state without a mandatory program, a subject's coach can usually perform one or more assessor tasks.","The STUDENT ATHLETES menu option provides a subject student athlete access to his data, and generates a menu of food items that the subject can consume while conforming to the weight loss plan. The VIEW ASSESSMENT option allows the subject to view his initial assessment (see ). The WEIGHT LOSS PLAN option allows the wrestler to view his weight loss plan (see ). From the WEIGHT LOSS PLAN menu, the subject can generate a nutritional plan that conforms to the plan. Generating a nutritional plan using the website arrangement is discussed below with reference to .","According to an embodiment of the present invention, a nutrition plan is generated for a subject.  illustrate one method for generating a nutrition plan for a subject. The method illustrated in  can be executed by accessing either the COLLEGIATE menu option or the SCHOLASTIC menu option. The nutrition plan can be selected to conform to the weight plan generated in the method described above, and with other factors. According to a preferred embodiment, a nutritional plan based on the weight loss plan is generated by the system . The nutritional plan allows subjects, and in particular wrestlers, to select from a wide variety of food products from a variety of lists based upon, for example, their fat free weight (which may be calculated in the certification program), their resting metabolic rate, and their typical daily activity level. This information may be used to calculate a number of \u201cchoices\u201d each wrestler can select from each list of food items (vegetables, meats, etc). The nutritional plan can be a dynamic dietary plan, which a user and\/or subject can modify at any time, as long as the nutrition plan requirements are satisfied. While this invention is particularly adaptable to wrestlers, the same method or a similar method can be employed by many types of subjects for monitoring their weight and\/or nutrition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 3B-3K"},"In step , the user, who will typically be the subject, enters personal data such as age, height, and activity level (see steps - in ).","In step , a resting energy expenditure (REE) (using a fat-free mass based equation) is calculated.","In step , an average daily total energy expenditure (TEE) (using the Bouchard system of energy equivalents for 24-hour grouped activities) is calculated.","In step , a recommended daily energy intake (RDEI) is calculated using, for example, an equation based on REE, TEE, and the recommended rate of weight loss. RDEI can be based on factors such as resting metabolic rate, physical activity levels, and body composition. The Institute of Medicine has published a formula suitable for calculating RDEI.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 3C"},"In step , a recommended number of food exchanges are provided. A \u201cfood exchange\u201d is a selection of food selectable by the subject. The food exchanges may be provided for all food groups, and may be based on the RDEI and nutritional guidelines for a healthy diet (e.g., based on a 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein macronutrient profile). A sample Food Exchange Options screen is illustrated in .","In step , a series of prompts are provided to allow the subject to build a menu. The menu items may be selected according to the subject's personal likes\/dislikes. The menu is built to facilitate weight loss at the prescribed rate. Menu items are selected according to prescribed serving sizes and food exchange type. Examples of food exchanges are nonfat dairy, lean protein, vegetables, fruit, starches, and an \u201cextra calories\u201d menu.  illustrate the entry screens for entering the subject's food exchange options and amounts. As an alternative to allowing the subject to build a menu from scratch, sample menus can be provided that the athlete\/coach can adapt to meet specific needs.","In step , the subject's menu is generated. A completed sample menu is illustrated in .","In step , queries may be received by the subject. The subject can submit queries to one or more qualified nutritional advisors, such as, for example, a registered dietitian.","In step , informational resources are provided. The subject is allowed to access other informational web sites providing advice on nutritional guidelines. Several websites exist that provide advice to wrestlers, for example, and URLs for these websites may be presented in a menu.","A method of generating a weight plan will now be discussed with reference to .  is a block diagram of the method for generating a weight plan. In one embodiment, the method is executed by the system  illustrated in . Other apparatuses, however, may be used to employ the method. The method can be used to generate the weight plans discussed above (see ).","The method is discussed in the context of a subject wrestler operating under guidelines from a governing authority, such as, for example, the NCAA, or a state's athletic association.","A user may, however, enter data for subjects engaging in other activities, such as monitoring weight for general health or other reasons. The guidelines can therefore be applicable at the collegiate level or at the secondary school level.","Many organizations govern athletics at various levels. At the collegiate level, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) determine the requirements for athletes. Standards for scholastic athletes are determined by state and local high school athletic associations. In this specification, these organizations are referred to by the generic term \u201cgoverning body.\u201d More than one governing body may have jurisdiction over a subject.","In general, governing bodies require wrestlers to have their body fat percentage (% BF) and body weight (BW) determined before the wrestling season begins. In , this step is disclosed as step , in which subject data is entered. The data can be entered on a form such as those illustrated in , D, and H. The subject's body weight BW is preferably measured when the subject is hydrated. The bodyweight (BW) may therefore be referred to as a \u201chydrated body weight\u201d or, more generally, a \u201ccurrent weight.\u201d This step may also include the entry of raw data such as body caliper measurements used to determine the subject's body fat percentage (% BF). Alternatively, the subject's body fat percentage may be entered directly.","Body fat percentage can be provided by, for example, a commercially available service such as BodPod.RTM. Other subject data entered at this point can include the alpha date, urine specific gravity, subject grade or years in college, and subject name.","In step , the subject's body composition is determined. The subject's body composition can include data such as the subject's body density (BD), body fat percentage (% BF), fat weight (FW), and fat free weight (FFW). These values may be displayed on the forms illustrated in , D, and H. The steps involved in determining the subject's body composition are discussed in detail with reference to .","In step , the subject's weight plan is generated. The weight plan can include one or more weight parameters such as, for example, a lowest allowable weight (lowest allowable weight-one, or \u201cLAW 1\u201d) at which a wrestler can wrestle at for a first time period T. In more general terms, LAW 1 can be a lowest recommended weight for a first time period. The weight parameters can also include a lowest allowable weight-two (LAW 2). LAW 2 can be a lowest allowable weight for a subsequent or later time period T. LAW 2 is typically used to describe a minimum ending weight after a period of weeks. In addition, minimum weights for any number of intermediate time periods, such as weekly time periods, can be calculated. As shown in , each time period in the left hand column is accompanied by a minimum weight for that time. The minimum weights may be used to inform the subject, coaches, parents, or others, of the minimum weight that the subject should have at any time. Generation of a weight plan is discussed in detail below with reference to .","After the weight plan is generated, the subject's weight may be monitored. In one embodiment, users, who may be wrestling coaches, are capable of monitoring any number of subjects' compliance with prescribed governing body guidelines. The website arrangement described above is particularly advantageous for monitoring the subject's compliance because of the detailed reports available to users. For example, each wrestling coach in a specified region can have access to the server , and can monitor any of the wrestlers participating in wrestling in that region. According to NCAA guidelines, for example, if a certain wrestler is below his\/her allowable body weight for a given week, he\/she is not allowed to wrestle. A coach or other user who detects that a wrestler is not operating within the prescribed guidelines can alert the governing authority of detected violations. In addition to and alternatively to monitoring by users, the server  may contain a database of subject data, and the subject data can be examined to determine whether the subject is complying with the prescribed guidelines. In this way, the system  can provide automatic notification when a subject fails to comply with prescribed guidelines.","As another advantage to using the web-based application, the data entry and calculations used in the initial assessment can be used to generate a weight certification form, which may be in a form acceptable to the various governing bodies. The weight certification form may be submitted to a governing authority, such as the NCAA, or the state's athletic association. The report establishes the wrestler's minimum allowable wrestling weight, and accordingly his\/her lowest allowable wrestling class. These calculations are based on a formula supplied by the NCAA.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":"420"},"In step , the subject's body density (BD) is determined. Body density may be determined by a number of methods. For example, data from skin-fold measurements may be used to calculate body density. One skin-fold measurement technique involves skin-fold measurements taken in three areas of the body: triceps, subscapular and abdominal. The skin-fold measurements can be entered as subject data in step  (). The median values of each area are then summed, and used in the following formula to determine BD:\n\n1.0982\u2212((SUM )*0.000815)]+[(SUM ).sup.2*(0.00000084)]\n\nwhere SUM SF is the sum of the skin-fold median values. Alternatively, body density may be measured by known methods such as hydrostatic weighing or commercial devices such as BodPod.RTM, as discussed above.\n","In step , the subject's body fat percentage is calculated. Body fat percentage (% BF) can be calculated according to the following formula:\n\n% 4.57)\u22124.142]*100.\n\nIn step , the subject's fat weight (FW) is calculated. Fat weight is the weight of the fat contained in the subject's body. Fat weight may be calculated according to the following formula:\n\n*(% 100).\n","In step , the subject's fat free weight (FFW) is calculated. The fat free weight FFW represents the weight of a subject's body that is comprised of materials other than fat, and may be calculated according to the following formula:\n\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 4"],"b":"430"},"In step , a lowest allowable weight-one (LAW 1) is calculated. The lowest allowable weight-one is calculated according to the FFW. LAW 1 can be calculated according to:\n\nLAW1\n","In the equation for LAW 1,f is a factor that describes the minimum body fat allowed according to governing body rules. For NCAA standards, a minimum body fat of 5% is required. For the NCAA, f is 0.95, or 1.00-0.05. For other governing bodies, such as those that regulate high school wrestlers, f can be, for example, 0.93.","In step , a time period (TIME) is determined. The time period can be described as a period of time between an initial assessment and a \u201cdeadline date,\u201d and is usually described as a number of discrete time periods of weeks. The deadline date represents a deadline measurement date. The deadline measurement date is different according to different governing bodies. For example, in NCAA collegiate wrestling, the deadline date is December 15th.","The time period TIME can be, for example, expressed as a number of discrete time periods, such as weeks (\u201cWEEKS\u201d) between the initial assessment and deadline date. The deadline date can be any date. The various state athletic associations may specify other dates.","In step , a lowest allowable weight-two (LAW 2) is determined. LAW 2 may be calculated according to the general formula:\n\nLAW2=(*TIME)\n\nwhere c is a constant. In a more specific embodiment, and in accordance with NCAA guidelines limiting body weight loss to 1.5% of body weight per week (i.e., c=0.015), the formula can be stated as:\n\nLAW2=\u2212(0.015*TIME)\n\nwhere TIME is in units of weeks.\n","In step , a minimum weight (MW) is determined. The Minimum Weight may be calculated according to the following formula:\n\nMW=the higher of LAW 1 and LAW 2.\n","If the subject is a wrestler, the minimum weight can be described as the subject's minimum wrestling weight (MWW), and may be calculated by:\n\nMWW=higher of LAW 1 and LAW 2.\n","The minimum wrestling weight MWW is the minimum weight that a wrestler may have and still conform to governing body standards. Each time period during the monitoring period for a subject has its own MWW.","In step , minimum weight values for each of the discrete times in the measurement period may be calculated, as are illustrated in . The minimum weights can be calculated by reducing the alpha or initial body weight assessment by a percentage prescribed by a governing body. Reducing each preceding projected minimum weight by the percentage populates the projected weight fields in .","NWCA currently supports an Internet-based weight certification program at http:\/\/www.nwcacalculator.com\/certification\/ for the calculation of a safe and healthy minimal wrestling weight.","Additional advantages, features and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
