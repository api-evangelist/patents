title: Playlist structure for large playlists
abstract: Enabling efficient navigation of a playlist of media files stored on a computer-readable medium. Aspects of the invention define a playlist structure to have one or more playlist units. Each playlist unit identifies one or more media files in the playlist and includes metadata for the media files. A consumer electronic device retrieves the playlist units and displays the metadata contained therein to a user to enable navigation of the playlist. Aspects of the invention reduce the memory requirements of the consumer electronic devices and reduce the quantity of disk seek operations needed for playlist navigation.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","APPENDIX A"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/273,415, filed Oct. 17, 2002, entitled \u201cNavigating Media Content via Groups within a Playlist,\u201d hereby incorporated by reference, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/418,973, filed Oct. 16, 2002, entitled \u201cCOMPRESSED MEDIA FORMAT SPECIFICATION,\u201d now abandoned.","Due to recent advances in technology, computer users are now able to enjoy many features that provide an improved user experience, such as playing various media and multimedia content on their personal or laptop computers. For example, most computers today are able to play compact discs (CDs) so users can listen to their favorite musical artists while working on their computers. Many computers are also equipped with digital versatile disc (DVD) drives enabling users to watch movies.","In some multimedia environments, a computer has access to a computer-readable medium storing compressed media files such as Moving Picture Experts Group audio layer-3 (MP3) files and WINDOWS MEDIA technologies audio (WMA) files. When the media files are rendered on a computer, the computer typically has access to a database storing metadata describing albums, artists, genres, years, or the like for the media files. The computer typically organizes the media files into playlists based on the metadata when the compressed media files are played on the computer. For example, in the case of audio media files, the files may be organized by album, artist, genre, year, or some user specified selection and ordering. This allows users to easily have access to all of their content regardless of whether or not the users manually created a playlist.","However, when compressed media files are transferred from the computer to an optical format such as CD or DVD for playback on a portable CD player, car receiver, DVD player or other consumer electronic devices having a low-power processor, limited memory and often limited display and user input capabilities, the media files traditionally lose much of the functionality offered by metadata databases hosted on devices with greater computing power. The playlists revert to nothing more than a sequential list of files to be played.","Further, a playlist having a large number of files is difficult for a low-powered device to navigate. For example, some existing systems store metadata separate from media files on a computer-readable medium. To render the media files and display metadata associated with the media files, the existing systems have to seek to at least two separate areas of the computer-readable medium. If the rendering device has a limited buffer for disk seek and find operations, then such rendering devices cannot navigate large playlists. For example, a rendering device such as a low end portable CD player only contains an 8 bit 1 MHz processor with 100 kilobytes of working memory with a five second seek time.","Other systems store the metadata within the media files. To obtain the metadata for the media files, the existing systems have to open each media file in the playlist to obtain and display the metadata. Opening every media file in a playlist is slow and increases complexity. The existing systems fail to provide a playlist structure that supports an unbounded number of media files and is capable of playback on even the lowest power devices.","Accordingly, a system for enabling efficient navigation of large playlists is desired to address one or more of these and other disadvantages.","Embodiments of the invention include a playlist structure in which references to content within the playlist are stored along with metadata associated with the content in self-contained, easy to parse, fixed-size playlist blocks, chunks, units, or other discrete elements. Metadata is preserved when storing playlists on a computer-readable medium for access by a consumer electronic device having a low-power processor, limited memory and limited display and user input capabilities. The playlist units have a size that is aligned to a sector size of the computer-readable medium (e.g., CD or DVD) to enable efficient loading by the consumer electronic device. A low-end rendering device or software need only load one or more playlist units into memory to acquire and process the complete metadata and playlist. In one embodiment, the metadata stored in the playlist units includes file and directory information for the media files, metadata for each of the media files, and specific playlist data for rendering those files.","By storing the metadata and the media file references in easy-to-load playlist units, aspects of the invention reduces the number of disk seek and find operations. These aspects of the invention also enable rendering devices with low-power or limited memory to process and navigate large playlists.","Alternatively, aspects of the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Appendix A includes exemplary group data for the playlist structure of aspects of the invention.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring first to , a block diagram illustrates an exemplary media environment in which the invention may be implemented. A system  has one or more computers  coupled to one or more consumer electronic devices  providing media content including audio data, video data, and\/or still image data. For example, the devices  may include a compact disc (CD) player , a camcorder , or a camera . Additionally, the devices  may include other personal computers, removable hard drives, network shares, a Moving Picture Experts Group audio layer-3 (MP3) player, an audio system in an automobile, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, or the like. The consumer electronic devices  may include any suitable rendering filter or media player or device (e.g., a portable media device) that is configured to render digital media so that the user can experience the content that is embodied on the consumer electronic device . For example, suitable media player applications include a compact disc (CD) media player and a digital versatile disc or digital video disc (DVD) media player. The computer  also has rendering capability including a processor and rendering software (e.g., a media player).","One aspect of the present invention enables the user or, particularly, enables a media player program executing on computing device , to access, retrieve, and display for the user, so-called metadata. Those skilled in the art are familiar with metadata, which is simply information about data. In the context of the illustrated embodiment, metadata includes information related to specific content of a digital media file being played on the media player. Basic metadata includes, but is not limited to, title, performer, genre, track number, and the like. Extended metadata includes, but is not limited to, cover art, composer, description of content, performer biographies, reviews, ratings, related performers, where to buy similar items, upcoming concerts, ticket sales, URLs to other related experiences including purchase opportunities, studio, director, and the like. In one embodiment, extended metadata may be organized into two main categories: metadata retrieved or downloaded, and metadata computed from the media file (e.g., digital signal processing of the file stream). The metadata may be stored within the media file or stored in another file accessible and known to the media file.","In one example, additional metadata is available from the metadata provider  via a data communication network . The computer  and metadata provider  are coupled to the data communication network . While the network  includes the Internet in one example, the teachings of the invention may be applied to any data communication network. Data communication network  may support, for example, client\/server communications or peer-to-peer connections.","The consumer electronic devices  or computer  may have access to one or more computer-readable media (e.g., memory area ). While the memory area  is illustrated to be part of any of the consumer electronic devices  in , the memory area  may be separate from the consumer electronic devices  yet accessible to the consumer electronic devices , for example, via a network. In one embodiment, memory area  includes one or more computer-readable media for storing playlists . In , a playlist  has playlist units  such as playlist unit # through playlist unit #N. Each of the playlist units  includes a content entry field (not shown) such as a \u2018content entry\u2019 field in  for each of the media files associated with the playlist unit  and a metadata field (not shown) such as an \u2018offset to text\u2019 field in  for each content entry field. The content entry field stores a media file reference identifying a location of the media file. The metadata field stores metadata associated with the media file associated with the content entry field. The playlist structure is described in further detail with reference to  below.","In one embodiment, the consumer electronic devices  (e.g., a portable media device) are configured to execute computer-executable instructions for navigating the playlist  having a plurality of media files associated therewith. The computer-executable instructions may be organized into one or more components. For example, the consumer electronic devices  may store a playlist component , a parser component , a user interface component , and a playback component . The playlist component  retrieves, obtains, or otherwise receives one of a plurality of playlist units  stored in memory area . The playlist units  collectively represent the playlist . The parser component  obtains metadata stored within the playlist unit  retrieved by the interface component. The metadata describes a media file associated with the playlist . The user interface component  displays, to a user, the obtained metadata or a portion thereof to enable user selection of a media file associated with the displayed metadata. The user interface component  receives a media file selection from the user. The playback component  renders the selected media file to the user via the media file reference associated with the media file selection. In one embodiment, each of the playlist units  has a size derived from a sector size associated with the memory area.","The computer , or other device or software, also has one or more exemplary modules or components for implementing aspects of the invention. For example, the computer  may have computer-executable instructions for creating playlist  which has an efficient structure described herein to enable efficient navigation of the playlist . Such computer-executable instructions are described in .","Those skilled in the art will note that the invention software may be implemented with any number and organization of components or modules. That is, the invention is not limited to the specific configuration of the playlist component , the parser component , the user interface component , the playback component , and the computer-executable instructions executed by computer , but may include more or less components having more or less individual functionality than described herein. Further, the invention may be embodied in hardware, software, or a combination thereof in a media player, operating system, DVD recorder, CD recorder, video camera, hard drive, flash drive, personal digital assistant, wireless device (e.g., cellular telephone), or the like.","Referring next to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates a playlist structure. In one embodiment, each playlist is represented as a unique <playlist>.HMT file such as nnnnnnnn.HMT file, where nnnnnnnn is an upper-case, string representation of a hexadecimal number without leading zeros that represents a playlist identifier. The playlists may contain one or more of the following media files; audio files, video files, image files (along with the minimum duration an image should be displayed as well as transitions to use between each image), and parallel images (e.g., an image slideshow with background audio). Further, in one embodiment, each playlist may be organized into groups. There are four different types of playlist groups: an audio playlist group, a video playlist group, a timed image playlist group, and a parallel image audio playlist group. Audio playlist groups have one or more audio files. Video playlist groups have one or more video files and support the ability to specify the starting and ending point to use when playing a video file. Timed image playlist groups have one or more image files and support the ability to specify the minimum duration an image should be displayed as well as transitions to use between each image. Parallel image audio playlist groups allow for an image slideshow with background audio.","The playlist structure in  generally includes a file header, an offset group table, a group name table, and playlist unit data. Playlists that are created on rewritable media also include padding to allow for future edits. For example, the padding may be after an offset group table as well as after the group name table. In one embodiment, the size of the padding is a minimum of 2,048 bytes for each padding section. If the playlist authoring software of the invention expects a large number of edits to be made to the playlist, an increased padding size may be warranted.","An exemplary file header is shown below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"File Header."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Offset","Length","Field Name"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"0","8","Identifier"]},{"entry":[{},"8","2","Version"]},{"entry":[{},"10","4","Size of Playlist File"]},{"entry":[{},"14","1","Playlist Summary Type"]},{"entry":[{},"15","1","Reserved"]},{"entry":[{},"16","4","Number of Playlist Groups"]},{"entry":[{},"20","4","Number of Playlist units"]},{"entry":[{},"24","2","Size of Playlist unit"]},{"entry":[{},"26","4","Next Available Group ID"]},{"entry":[{},"30","4","Offset to Group Name Table"]},{"entry":[{},"34","4","Offset to Playlist unit Data"]},{"entry":[{},"38","4","Offset to Padding After Group Name Table"]},{"entry":[{},"42","64","Name of Authoring Application"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The offset group table includes a list of one or more offset group entries.

The offset shall correspond to an I-frame within the Video File.","Ending Point of Video","There is one 4-byte entry for each Video File in this Playlist Group. The value is the offset in milliseconds to the starting time of the next frame of the ending frame. A value of zero indicates that the Video File should be played to the end of the file. When two sequential Video File Indexes in a Video Playlist Group indicate the same Video File, this is a special case intended for uninterrupted playback. Entries such as this allow \u2018chapters\u2019 to be created within a single Video File allowing the user to skip by chapter. During normal playback, the video plays without interruption as each chapter end where the next begins. Uninterrupted playback is only mandatory, in one embodiment, for \u2018chapters\u2019 contained within a single Playlist unit. Interruptions are allowed when a chapter spans Playlist unit boundaries.","Starting Point Offset","There is one 8-byte entry for each Video File in this Playlist Group. The value is the offset from the beginning of the Video File to the location a player may use to start reading the file. This offset is used with the Starting Point of Video field. If the Starting Point Video field is zero then this field is zero in which case the player will locate the first packet to read by examining the File Header. If the Starting Point of Video field is non-zero then this field contains the nearest location in the file to start decoding in order to reach the video starting time.","Ending Point Offset","There is one 8-byte entry for each Video File in this Playlist Group. The value is the offset from the beginning of the Video File to the location a player may use to stop reading the file. This offset is to be used with the Ending point of Video field. If the Ending Point of Video field is zero then this field is zero in which case the player will need to decide for itself where to stop reading the file. If the Ending Point of Video field is non-zero then this field contains the nearest location in the file to end reading to ensure all necessary data has been read.","Times Image Playlist Group Object","The order of the Image File Indexes is the playback order for this Playlist Group Object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE A5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Timed Image Playlist Group Object."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Offset","Length","Field Name"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"0","4","Number of Image File Indexes"]},{"entry":[{},"4","2","Initial Transition"]},{"entry":[{},"6","2","Final Transition"]},{"entry":[{},"8","4","Image File Index 1"]},{"entry":[{},"12\u2002","4","Duration 1"]},{"entry":[{},"16\u2002","2","Transition 1"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"."]},{"entry":[{},"\u20028 + 10 * (n \u2212 1)","4","Image File Index n"]},{"entry":[{},"12 + 10 * (n \u2212 1)","4","Duration n"]},{"entry":[{},"16 + 10 * (n \u2212 1)","2","Transition n"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"This 4-byte entry is the number of Image File Indexes that are listed in this Playlist Group Object.","Initial Transition","This 2-byte entry defines the initial transition to be used to display the first image in this Playlist Group Object.
