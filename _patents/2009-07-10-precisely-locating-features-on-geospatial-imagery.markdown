title: Precisely locating features on geospatial imagery
abstract: Methods for locating a feature on geospatial imagery and systems for performing those methods are disclosed. An accuracy level of each of a plurality of geospatial vector datasets available in a database can be determined. Each of the plurality of geospatial vector datasets corresponds to the same spatial region as the geospatial imagery. The geospatial vector dataset having the highest accuracy level may be selected. When the selected geospatial vector dataset and the geospatial imagery are misaligned, the selected geospatial vector dataset is aligned to the geospatial imagery. The location of the feature on the geospatial imagery is then determined based on the selected geospatial vector dataset and outputted via a display device.

No. 11\/169,076 and U.S. provisional application No. 60\/586,623 are incorporated herein by reference.","The research and development described in this application were supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under contract number W31P4Q-07-C-0261 and the National Science Foundation (NSF) under contract number IIP-0712287. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the claimed inventions.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to geospatial data processing. More specifically, the present invention relates to precisely locating features on geospatial imagery.","2. Related Art","Geospatial imagery includes images of the Earth's surface taken from the air or from space. In combination with corresponding geospatial vector data, approximate locations of features on geospatial imagery can be determined. Such features may include buildings, roads, parcels, geological features, and so forth. Geospatial vector data can be any type of data that associates spatial attributes such as latitude and longitude coordinates to various sites on the Earth's surface. Geospatial vector data may also include non-spatial attributes like road names, house numbers, ZIP codes, ownership information, associated telephone numbers, tax information, valuation information, and so on.","Unfortunately, geospatial imagery and corresponding geospatial vector data are rarely mutually aligned. Misalignment between geospatial imagery and geospatial vector data can be caused by any number of variables. For example, geospatial imagery can be distorted due to the curvature of the Earth, the angle at which a given geospatial image was taken, minor movements in an imaging platform (e.g., a satellite or aircraft), and other errors associated with imaging techniques.","Due in part to the common misalignment between geospatial imagery and corresponding geospatial vector data, traditional approaches for locating features on geospatial imagery may not be accurate enough for commercial applications. Moreover, other approximations used in traditional approaches can further these inaccuracies. One existing approach for locating a specific address or property on geospatial imagery is to infer a location based on road vector data interpolation. Road vector data interpolation can be performed on a given road segment when the address number range as well as the latitude and longitude of the endpoints of that road segment are known. Using road vector data interpolation, a determined location of an address or property, relative to the actual location on the geospatial imagery, can have a substantial margin of error (e.g., 50 or more meters). Other similar existing approaches infer locations by interpolating between opposing corners of a given geospatial image, thus potentially resulting in even more drastic margins of error. A large margin of error in locating features on geospatial imagery can hinder usefulness in many various applications. As such, there is a need for improved techniques to precisely locate features on geospatial imagery using available geospatial data.","Embodiments of the present technology allow features on geospatial imagery to be precisely located using the most accurate available data. The features may include businesses, residences, hospitals, geological features, roads, or any other feature associated with the geospatial imagery. Margin of error in locating features on geospatial imagery is minimized using available geospatial vector data. When multiple geospatial vector datasets are available for a given region, the most accurate geospatial vector dataset may be utilized. A misalignment between a geospatial vector dataset and corresponding geospatial imagery can be corrected.","In a first claimed embodiment, a method for locating a feature on geospatial imagery is disclosed. A first geospatial vector dataset is selected from the plurality of geospatial vector datasets. The first geospatial vector dataset has the highest accuracy level of each geospatial vector dataset in the plurality of geospatial vector datasets. The selected geospatial vector dataset is aligned to the geospatial imagery. The location of the feature is determined on the geospatial imagery based on the selected geospatial vector dataset. The location of the feature is provided via an output device.","In a second claimed embodiment, a device for locating a feature on geospatial imagery is set forth. The device includes a memory for storing a program and a processor for executing the program. An evaluation module, alignment engine, and locator module are all stored in the memory and executable by the processor. The evaluation module determines an accuracy level of each of a plurality of geospatial vector datasets available in a database. The evaluation module may also select the geospatial vector dataset having the highest accuracy level, where each of the plurality of geospatial vector datasets corresponding to the same spatial region as the geospatial imagery. The alignment engine aligns the selected geospatial vector dataset to the geospatial imagery. The locator module determines the location of the feature on the geospatial imagery based on the selected geospatial vector dataset.","A third claimed embodiment sets forth a computer-readable storage medium having a program embodied thereon. The program is executable by a processor to perform a method for locating a feature on geospatial imagery. The method involves selecting a first geospatial vector dataset of the plurality of geospatial vector datasets. The first geospatial vector dataset has a highest accuracy level of each geospatial vector dataset in the plurality of geospatial vector datasets. The first geospatial vector dataset is aligned to the geospatial imagery. The location of the feature is determined on the geospatial imagery based on the selected geospatial vector dataset.","The present technology minimizes errors in locating features on geospatial imagery using available geospatial vector data. The accuracy of geospatial vector data available for a given region can vary drastically depending, for instance, on techniques used for acquisition. Additionally, two or more geospatial vector datasets of differing accuracies may be available for the same region. For example, road vector data and parcel vector data may be available for one spatial region. When multiple geospatial vector datasets are available for a given region, the most accurate geospatial vector dataset can be determined and selected. Furthermore, if the most accurate geospatial vector dataset is not well aligned to corresponding geospatial imagery, misalignment in that geospatial vector data can be corrected.","Referring now to , a block diagram of an exemplary environment  for practicing embodiments of the present technology is shown. The environment  includes a computing device , geospatial imagery source  and geospatial vector dataset source . Computing device  includes feature location system  which can be connected to display device  and may communicate with geospatial imagery source  and a geospatial vector dataset source . The feature location system  is discussed in further detail in connection with . Other various components (not shown) that are not necessary for describing the present technology may also be included in the environment , in accordance with exemplary embodiments. Examples of the computing device  may be a desktop personal computer (PC), a laptop PC, a pocket PC, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smart phone, a cellular phone, a global positioning system (GPS) device, and so on. Computing device  is discussed in more detail with respect to .","The geospatial imagery source  can comprise any repository, compilation, database, server, or other source of geospatial imagery. Similarly, the geospatial vector dataset source  may include any repository, compilation, database, server, or other source of geospatial vector data. The geospatial imagery source  and the geospatial vector dataset source  may be provided by a private organization or federal, state, or municipal governments. For example, the geospatial imagery source  may include the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).","According to exemplary embodiments, feature location system  can access geospatial imagery source  and the geospatial vector dataset source  via a network , which can be implemented as any wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN), the Internet, an intranet, a public network, a private network, a combination of these, or some other data transfer network. The geospatial imagery and geospatial vector data may be provided to the feature location system  via the computing device  as a computer readable storage medium read by the computing device , such as by compact disk.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["105","105","205","210","215","220","225","230","105","110","110","105","225","230"]},"Execution of the communications module  facilitates communication of data and information between the feature location system  and the computing device . For example, geospatial imagery or geospatial vector data can be transferred to the feature location system  through execution of the communications module . Likewise, data and information can be provided to a user from the feature location system  by way of execution of the communications module . Additionally, the communications module  may be executed to provide communication between constituent engines, modules, and databases of the feature location system .","One or more various databases may be employed by the feature location system . According to exemplary embodiments, the geospatial imagery database  may store geospatial imagery obtained by the feature location system  from the geospatial imagery source . Similarly, the geospatial vector dataset database  may optionally store geospatial vector datasets obtained by the feature location system  from the geospatial vector dataset source . Such geospatial vector datasets may include building footprint vector datasets, parcel vector datasets, road vector dataset, other spatial and non-spatial datasets, or any combination thereof. The geospatial imagery database  and the geospatial vector dataset database  may be indexed or otherwise coordinated to so that corresponding geospatial imagery and geospatial vector datasets are associated. In some embodiment, the geospatial imagery database  and the geospatial vector dataset database  may be combined into a single database. According to other embodiments, the geospatial imagery database  and the geospatial vector dataset database  are not party of the feature location system , and geospatial imagery and geospatial data are processed as received from the geospatial imagery source  and the geospatial vector dataset source , respectively.","Execution of the evaluation module  allows an accuracy level to be determined for geospatial vector datasets in the geospatial vector dataset database . Generally speaking, each geospatial vector dataset may correspond to the same spatial region as a given geospatial image of interest. Accuracy levels are indicative of spatial resolution and of how well a geospatial vector dataset aligns with corresponding geospatial imagery. Examples of well-aligned and poorly-aligned geospatial vector datasets are discussed in connection with .","The evaluation module  may be further executed to select the geospatial vector dataset having the highest accuracy level. In exemplary embodiments, a margin of error in the proximity of a determined location of a particular feature and an actual location of that feature is at least partially dependent on the accuracy level of the selected geospatial vector dataset. The margin of error is characteristic of how precisely features can be located on geospatial imagery.","Various metrics may be utilized in determining or assigning an accuracy level to geospatial vector datasets. For example, an accuracy level of a given geospatial vector datasets may be determined based on, at least in part, a type of dataset included in the geospatial vector dataset. Accuracy levels may be determined based on the following types of datasets: (1) aligned building footprint vector data, (2) unaligned building footprint vector data, (3) aligned parcel vector data, (4) unaligned parcel vector data, (5) incomplete parcel vector data, (6) aligned road vector data, (7) unaligned road vector data, and (8) incomplete road vector data. Geospatial vector datasets that include aligned building footprint data may be regarded as having the highest accuracy level, while geospatial vector datasets that include incomplete road vector data may be regarded as having the lowest accuracy level.","As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, aligned building footprint vector data includes data that defines peripheries of buildings and other structures, and is well aligned to those corresponding peripheries on imagery. Conversely, unaligned building footprint vector data also includes data that defines peripheries of buildings and other structures, but is not well aligned to those corresponding peripheries on imagery. An example of building footprint vector data is discussed in connection with .","Aligned parcel vector data includes data that defines peripheries of parcels, and is well aligned to those corresponding peripheries on imagery. Unaligned parcel vector data, in contrast, also includes data that defines peripheries of parcels, but is not well aligned to those corresponding peripheries on imagery. Examples of parcel vector data are described in connection with .","Incomplete parcel vector data includes parcel vector data that incompletely describes addresses associated with certain parcels. For example, multiple addresses can exist on a single parcel, but not all of those addresses may be reflected in the available parcel vector data.","Aligned road vector data includes data that defines positions of roadways, and is well aligned to those corresponding positions on imagery. Unaligned road vector data includes data that defines positions of roadways, but is not well aligned to those corresponding positions on imagery. In some cases, road vector data may define the centerline of a given road and not the edges.","Incomplete road vector data includes road name information, but lacks address information such as house numbers. As such, ZIP code maps, area code maps, or other region-defining information may be used in conjunction with incomplete road vector data to better approximate the location of the feature by combining the geospatial extents inferred from multiple vector datasets. Incomplete road vector data may be the best geospatial vector data available in very remote parts of the world.","The alignment engine , or modules thereof, can be executed to align a selected geospatial vector dataset to corresponding geospatial imagery. Such alignment may be performed when selected geospatial vector dataset and corresponding geospatial imagery are misaligned. By performing improving alignment, a margin of error in the proximity of a determined location of a particular feature and an actual location of that feature can be minimized for the available geospatial vector dataset having the highest accuracy level. The alignment engine  is discussed in further detail in connection with .","Execution of the locator module  allows a location of a given feature on geospatial imagery to be determined. This determination may be based on a geospatial vector dataset corresponding to the geospatial imagery selected by the evaluation module . The location may be provided as an image coordinate, a pixel identification, a latitude and longitude coordinate, a marker placed on the geospatial imagery, and so forth. To mark a given parcel, for example, the centroid of that parcel found using coordinates of the parcel may be indicated by a red dot on the geospatial imagery.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["225","225","305","310","315","110","110","225"]},"Execution of the detection module  allows a first group of control points in a selected geospatial vector dataset to be detected. A second group of control points on geospatial imagery corresponding to the selected geospatial vector dataset can also be detected via execution of the detection module . Control points mark certain points as \u2018land marks\u2019 of sort, both in the selected geospatial vector dataset and on the corresponding locations on geospatial imagery. Once detected, control points can be used during alignment of a geospatial vector data set to corresponding geospatial imagery. Additionally, filtering may be performed on control points such that any erroneous control points are disregarded. Exemplary processes in determining control points in a parcel vector dataset and on geospatial imagery are discussed, respectively, in connection with .","The inference module  may be executed to infer a template from the vector data, based on the detected control points and the locations, shapes, and directions of surrounding roads and parcels. An exemplary template is illustrated in . The inference module  may be also executed to infer the road pixels in color imagery. Templates may be used by the detection module  in detecting the corresponding control points on geospatial imagery by matching the templates with road pixels on the imagery.","According to exemplary embodiments, execution of the distortion module  allows a selected geospatial vector dataset to be distorted such that a first group of control points in the geospatial vector dataset is aligned with a second group of control points on corresponding geospatial imagery.

Thus, the remaining portions of the dataset are roads such as road . Roadsides can then be located from the portions of the parcel vector data that correspond to roads. In process step , salient points in the geospatial vector dataset are located such as salient points  and . Salient points can be points along a roadside in areas of high curvature, such as bends in a road, road intersections, cul-de-sacs, etc. In process step , representative points that each correspond to a cluster of salient points are designated as control points in the parcel vector dataset. A cluster of salient points may be a group of salient points within a certain radius. Examples of such representative points include control points  and .
