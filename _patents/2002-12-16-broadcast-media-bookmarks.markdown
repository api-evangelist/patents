{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates generally to mobile devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a device having broadcast tuning and digital communication capabilities.","Preset radio buttons are common on conventional radios and are well known for use as programmable shortcuts to frequencies associated with favorite radio stations. Mobile devices that are capable of receiving FM radio transmissions are also known. Like conventional radios, these devices typically include options for storing frequencies associated with favorite radio stations and for quickly tuning to those frequencies. Unlike convention radios, however, many of these mobile devices are connected to data networks. As such, these mobile devices may send and receive data, and may provide access to the Internet through the device.","Because many mobile devices may simultaneously receive FM radio stations and browse the Internet, it is often desirable when listening to the radio on such a device to view the content of a web page associated with the radio station. The content of such a web page may supplement the radio broadcast with further details and information related to the broadcast, or provide additional information such as local news and weather. These mobile devices, however, do not typically include a means for accessing, in parallel, Internet media and FM broadcast media associated with a radio station.","To view web page content for a radio station while listening to the radio station broadcast on such conventional mobile devices, a user typically must tune to the radio station of interest and independently navigate the Internet to find a web site associated with the radio station. The user may navigate to the radio station web site through the use of a pre-selected bookmark for the web site, and may tune to the radio broadcast with a radio station bookmark; however, the user nonetheless independently tunes the radio and navigates the web in order to simultaneously listen to the radio station broadcast and browse the corresponding web site. The use of a preset radio button along with a web site bookmark requires the user to employ separate steps for controlling access to each media source. Such a process is time-consuming and more complex than necessary. Further, such a process is cumbersome when scanning multiple broadcasts that may be available in a certain geographical area. To address this shortcoming in such mobile devices, solutions have been proposed.","One proposed solution includes the use of digital radio services. Digital radio consists of radio broadcasts of data rather than analog transmissions. Because the data transmitted may include various types of information along with audio information, a mobile device receiving digital radio broadcasts may view content associated with the audio radio broadcast. Radio stations broadcasting digital radio, therefore, can transmit information, such as traffic, weather, and advertising information, simultaneous with the audio broadcast. Unless the mobile device is in communication with the Internet, however, the user is limited to one-way communication with the radio station. In other words, the user may be able to view information sent by the radio station, and may even be able to navigate through the information, but the user is unable to request different information or to interact with the radio station in two-way communication.","Another proposed solution includes the use of radio data system (RDS) technology. RDS technology includes the transmission of limited amounts of data along with FM radio transmissions. The data is carried inaudibly in one or more subcarrier frequencies that are part of the baseband transmission. The amount of data that can be transmitted is relatively small and typically includes information such as a program service name (PS), program identity (PI), or alternative frequencies for the station broadcast. Like digital radio, unless the mobile device is in communication with the Internet, however, the user is limited to one-way communication with the radio station. In other words, the user may be able to view a small amount of information sent by the radio station, but the user is unable to request different information or to interact with the radio station in two-way communication. Further, the use of RDS requires an additional antenna and tuner, which are not available on many such mobile devices.","For both conventional radios and mobile devices, when a user travels to a different geographical area, pre-set buttons or other programmable shortcuts to favorite radio stations are generally not applicable for the new geographical area. As such, the user typically scans through available frequencies in the new area to receive desired broadcasts and\/or to reset shortcuts to desired radio stations. This process may be time consuming and frustrating for the user, particularly one who travels frequently. Further, the user may not fully appreciate characteristics of scanned broadcast stations located during the scanning process when only audio information is transmitted. For example, a user may not recognize station identity and broadcast genre for audio only stations\u2014particularly when scanned stations are broadcasting advertisements during the scanning process.","Thus, a need exists for systems and methods that simplify broadcast media tuning on mobile devices capable of receiving analog and digital communications. Also, a need exists for systems and methods that simplify the scanning process for reception of media broadcasts. Further, a need exists for systems and methods that reduce, if not eliminate, the need for resetting station shortcuts to media broadcasts when traveling to different geographical areas. Additionally, a need exists for interacting with graphical content provided by broadcast stations while scanning for reception of broadcast signals.","In order to overcome the above-described problems and other problems that will become apparent when reading this specification, the present invention provides systems and methods for providing media broadcast tuning on mobile devices capable of receiving analog and digital communications. In one embodiment, combined functionality bookmarks are provided on a mobile device according to geographical location, which provide shortcuts to media broadcasts and associated websites. In another embodiment of the invention, broadcast station scanning\/scrolling is simplified by providing a graphic representing a scanned station broadcast, which aids the user in identifying the broadcast station and characteristics of the station.","According to a further embodiment, supplemental broadcast information is provided to the mobile device by a cell broadcast service. In one aspect of the invention, the supplemental broadcast information includes bookmark information. In other aspects, the supplemental broadcast information enables automatic radio tuning features. In many embodiments of the invention, computer-executable instructions for implementing the disclosed methods are stored on computer-readable media. Additionally, embodiments may include reception of different broadcasts, such as television, satellite and other broadcasts. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent with reference to the following detailed description and figures.","In the following description of the various embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration various embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","As shown in , one embodiment according to the present invention includes a mobile data terminal device (DTE)  in communication with a data communication network  and a broadcast network . DTE  generally includes any mobile device capable of receiving media broadcasts and interacting with a digital communication network. The broadcast network may include radio waves associated with a radio station (not shown) that are transmitted from a transmitter , or may include television, satellite or other types of digital or analog broadcasts. The data communication network  may communicate with a broadcast station server  also associated with the radio station (not shown). DTE  generally includes a display screen , memory , a keypad , a processor , a radio tuner , an antenna , and communication hardware . As is known in the art, the processor  performs steps according to instructions stored in the memory  and generally interacts with other components of the DTE . The display screen  displays images and the keypad  is adapted to receive inputs from an operator.","The antenna  may receive radio waves in the radio broadcast network  transmitted by the transmitter , as is known in the art. The radio tuner  is connected to the antenna  and is adapted to tune, demodulate and amplify selected frequencies of radio waves received by antenna , such as those transmitted from transmitter . The radio tuner  is a digital phase-locked loop (PLL) synthesizer that is able to be retuned within milliseconds. The communication hardware  is adapted to receive and modulate or demodulate wireless communication signals, such as microwaves, sent or received from the DTE , as is known in the art. Thus, the device  according to one embodiment comprises a mobile device that is capable of receiving radio station broadcasts while simultaneously communicating with a data network. The device of the present invention, however, is not limited to any particular embodiment of a device, provided the device has both data connectivity and broadcast reception capabilities.","Further, the device of present invention is not limited to any particular embodiment for enabling data connectivity or broadcast reception. For example, the DTE  may use a circuit switched connection for data connectivity, such as a second-generation wireless system using TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), or other such access systems. In other examples, DTE  may use a packet based access system, such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) over a GSM network, or short range connectivity systems such as WLANs (Wireless local area networks) or BLUETOOTH. With regard to broadcast tuning, DTE  may receive, for example, analog radio transmissions, digital radio transmissions, satellite radio transmissions, analog television transmissions, digital television transmissions, or other such broadcasts.","According to one embodiment, radio bookmarks  are stored in the memory , and may be programmed and selected by the user. The radio bookmarks  generally include handles or identifiers pointing to various resources such as files, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, uniform resource locators (URL), and the like. The bookmarks may also include parameters that further define the bookmarks. The radio bookmarks  generally have combined functionality such that selection of a bookmark  results in selection of both a network address and a radio frequency, both of which are associated with a particular radio station. Accordingly, a user simply selects a radio bookmark  in order to tune the tuner  to frequencies of radio waves for a radio station, such as those transmitted by transmitter , and to substantially simultaneously connect the device  with a server located at a network address associated with the radio station, such as broadcast station server .","For example, suppose that the radio transmitter  transmits FM radio waves for a certain radio station (not shown), for instance a radio station having the call sign WZZZ, and that the broadcast station server  is operated by radio station WZZZ. Suppose also that radio station WZZZ maintains a web site on broadcast station server  that provides information supplemental to its FM radio broadcast. Suppose also that the radio station is a favorite radio station for the user and that the user has programmed bookmark one  to include frequency information for the radio station broadcast and the network address of the radio server . As such, in order to listen to the radio broadcast and to view web content for the radio station, the user merely needs to select bookmark one . The user may select bookmark one  using keypad  to select a representation of bookmark one  shown on the display , as is known in the art for graphical user interfaces. Alternatively, the user may select a key on keypad  associated with bookmark one , or use other such methods to choose a bookmark.","Referring now to , when the user selects bookmark one , the processor follows instructions stored in the memory  and performs associated steps. Accordingly, the processor  detects  the user's selection of bookmark one . Bookmark one  points to both a radio player application  stored in the memory  and a browser application , such as a wireless markup language (WML) application. Bookmark one  also includes parameters  that include frequency information for radio station WZZZ and web site address information. Parameters generally include information or data that further define one or more bookmarks or that affect performance of the DTE  based on selection of associated bookmarks. Parameters may include frequency information and network address information, as well as other types of information, some examples of which are discussed below.","Selection of bookmark one  invokes both radio player application  and browser application , and provides information in parameters  to the respective applications , . According to the radio player application, the processor  tunes  the radio tuner  to the frequency parameter  for bookmark one  for receiving the associated radio station broadcast. According to the browser application , the communication hardware sends  a request to the network address of broadcast station server  requesting data for the radio station website. The step of sending  a request may include opening a communication channel using communication hardware , if it is not already open. For example, if communication with communication network  is via a circuit switched connection like GSM, then the connection is open for the time of service and is closed when service use ends. Thus, a communication channel may need to be opened prior to sending  any requests. This may also be applicable for a packet switched connection, such as GPRS, if the connection has not yet been established.","In response to sending  a request, the broadcast station server  returns data to the device  and the processor  receives  the data. At this point, a session may be established with broadcast station server , which is managed by the browser application  and the server . In accordance with one embodiment, when data is received, the processor displays a web page (not shown) for the radio station, which includes links that the user may select. In accordance with another embodiment, update data is frequently received to update the web page. In this way, regardless of user input, information displayed on DTE  is substantially synchronized with the radio broadcast to reflect current content of the broadcast, such as the name of a song being played or to provide input opportunities, such as for a quiz or contest being broadcast on the station. When the processor detects that the user selects  a link shown in the display , the processor  directs the device  to request  data from broadcast station server  for that link. Accordingly, by simply selecting bookmark one , the user may simultaneously listen to the radio station broadcast and browse the radio station web site, thereby having means to receive information supplemental to the radio broadcast.","In another embodiment of the invention, interactions with the broadcast station server  may occur via short messaging service (SMS) and\/or multimedia messaging service (MMS) messages. Accordingly, upon selection  of a bookmark, DTE  sends a message, such as an SMS text message, to server . The SMS message (not shown) informs server  that DTE  has started listening to the radio station and requests  associated data from the server. In response, server  sends one or more SMS or MMS messages to provide content feed. The frequency of these messages may vary. For example, only one initial message may be provided to display a current program being broadcast by the radio station. Alternatively, messages may be sent at set intervals, such as every 5 minutes, or at set times, such as when a new song is played. Further, DTE  preferably sends a SMS message to server  when DTE  tunes to another radio station, thus informing server  of the change and terminating further messages from the server.","In a further embodiment of the invention, the frequency and IP address parameter information may not be stored on the device, but may be stored remotely, such as on a server in communication with network . This provides many benefits, such as allowing the user to program radio bookmarks for different radio stations depending on other programmed parameters. For example, the user may desire bookmark one  to represent the strongest classical music radio station for the user's present location. This may be particularly beneficial for a user who travels frequently. The user's present location is an example of an additional parameter that may be useful for adding flexibility to the use of radio bookmarks. The user's location may be automatically determined, for example, using global positioning system (GPS) technology, but the present invention is not limited to GPS or any other positioning technology.","In another example, a parameter could be a unique apparatus id associated with the DTE , such that the radio frequency and IP address for a particular bookmark are related to the apparatus id. Another example of a parameter is a unique user id, wherein the radio bookmarks on a device are adapted according to a unique user id, such as username and password. Multiple parameters can add even further flexibility. In a further example, the bookmarks  on a particular device  may represent different radio stations for different users of the device. As such, a user may need to input a unique user id, which may be manually entered as a username and password, or entered through the insertion of an identification module in to the device, or other like means. Accordingly, the parameter may be a unique user id and the bookmarks may represent radio stations or preferences for radio stations according to individual users' programming.","In further examples, parameters may include preferences established by the user, such that a bookmark represents different stations based on the time of day, location, or other factors. For example, a user may prefer that bookmark one  refer to travel information during rush hour, rock music during the daytime, and classical music in the evening. In another example, a user profile may be established based on statistical information of the user provided to a bookmark web site that creates bookmarks. The bookmark website may forward bookmarks to DTF  that the user could choose to accept. In a different example, a bookmark could represent a particular station, and based on a location parameter for the user, a different broadcast frequency may be applicable for that station. In an example with a radio station chain, the bookmark could represent the chain, and based on a user location parameter, a frequency for a station within the chain could be appropriate.","The bookmarks  and their parameters may be programmed according to software stored on the DTE  using keypad , or through an interface with another computer such as through a universal serial bus (USB) connection or network communications, or other known methods for programming mobile data terminals. In other examples, the bookmarks  and their parameters may be programmed remotely and sent to DTE  over the air (OTA). In such an example, a friend of the user may send a bookmark to the user as a recommendation for a broadcast station. This could be accomplished using a short messaging service (SMS), such as Nokia SMART MESSAGING. In another example, a user may request a bookmark from a broadcast station using an SMS message, or through a web-based service. Further, a broadcast station server may send a whole set of bookmarks based on a user profile. In a further example, a user may use a web-based service to configure their bookmarks remotely for DTE , and then update DTE  via OTA communications. In yet another example, bookmarks may be transmitted using Cell Broadcasting Service (CBS), wherein only bookmarks corresponding to available radio stations in the area are transmitted to respective users. In general, when DTE  receives a message that is recognized as a bookmark, it may automatically, or after user verification, store the bookmark in memory.","To provide further flexibility and further illustrate the use of parameters with bookmarks, another embodiment of the present invention, as shown in , includes a mobile terminal device (DTE) , a station id server , a broadcast station server , and a transmitter . The DTE  may be in communication with communication network  and broadcast network . The station id server  and broadcast station server  are generally in communication with communication network . The transmitter  broadcasts radio waves in broadcast network . The station id server  generally includes a server that identifies a broadcast station based on a bookmark selected and other parameters sent to the station id server. The station id server  generally includes a storage medium  and a processor  for processing instructions contained in the storage medium. For illustration purposes, suppose that the user shares DTE  with a family member and has therefore manually entered a unique user id that identifies the user and his bookmark preferences. Suppose further that the device  is generally configured as shown in , which is similar to DTE  in the previous embodiment except for differences and aspects discussed herein.","Accordingly, DTE  includes bookmark one  and bookmark two , which are stored in memory  and are graphically displayed on display . Each of the bookmarks ,  point to a radio player\/web site viewer application  and the parameter of a user id . The player\/viewer application  according to one embodiment is a browser application running a Flash or SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) plug-in. The application  may be included in the terminal's initial software suite, or it may be downloaded or otherwise installed on DTE . When bookmark one  is selected, it invokes application  and points it to the unique user id  stored in memory . The application , based on the bookmark selected and the user id , instructs the processor  to set up the DTE to receive a broadcast and connect with a web site for the selected bookmark and user id parameter. Thus, bookmarks may be uniquely configurable for different users of the same device.","Use of the present invention according to such an embodiment is generally illustrated in . The user starts the process in step  by selecting a radio bookmark, for example bookmark one , on the DTE . In response to selection of bookmark one , which invokes application , the processor  performs the step of sending  a request for radio broadcast frequency information and a network service address of a radio station broadcast station server  to the station id server . The request is related to a particular bookmark, such as bookmark one , and is based on related parameters, such as unique user id . The station id server  receives the request including the unique id parameter , determines the appropriate frequency information and network address information for bookmark one  and unique user id , and returns  the information to DTE  via the communication network . The DTE  thereafter tunes  the tuner  to receive the radio broadcast and requests  data from the broadcast station server  located at the network address returned. Server  preferably sends data associated with the radio station web site, which DTE  receives  via network . The user is therefore able to view the web site display for the server  and may select  a link shown on the web site display. In response to such a selection, the processor  requests  data associated with the selected link.","Referring now to , a further embodiment of the present invention is shown, which generally includes all aspects and preferences of the previous embodiment except with regard to message flows between DTE , station id server , and broadcast station server . Like numbers shown herewith, refer to like components, steps and features as previous embodiments. Accordingly, as a user selects  a radio bookmark on DTE , the processor receives the inputs and sends  a request to the station id server  via network . The request is likewise for broadcast information and a network address for server  for a radio station based on the bookmark selected and the parameter of a user's unique user id. The station id server  selects the appropriate radio station for the bookmark selected and parameters sent, and redirects  the request for the network address of server  to server  for the selected radio station. The broadcast station server  in turn sends  frequency information and the network address for its website to DTE .","After receiving frequency and network address information from server , the DTE  tunes  the tuner to receive the radio station broadcast. Preferably, included with the information sent from server  is web site data for the radio station's web site. Accordingly, as DTE  receives  the web site data it displays the web site information on DTE display. If the user then selects  a link from the web site display, DTE  sends  a request for data according to the link via network . The request for data associated with the link may be to a different server in communication with network  or to server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIGS. 9-16","FIGS. 1-4","FIGS. 1-4"]},"Referring now to , DTE  is shown that is adapted to graphically represent available bookmarks for a geographical area and to indicate the data interactivity capabilities of associated stations. DTE  is generally the same as DTE  of , except that bookmarks  are related to a geographical location parameter of DTE  and that memory  includes a bookmark database  and a radio scan\/player\/viewer application . Bookmark database  contains bookmarks and a geographical location parameter (not shown) associated with each bookmark, and may optionally include a graphic, such as a station logo, representing the associated station or a pointer to a file containing the graphic. Database  may further include further parameters or other information related to each bookmark. Application  may be a browser application running a Flash or SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) plug-in for providing tuning and scanning capabilities along with providing website interactivity. Application  could also be a dedicated broadcast media application, such as an application that runs in a JAVA 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) environment.","Application  is adapted to provide bookmarks in accordance with a geographical location parameter and to determine current geographical location information. For example, geographical location information may be determined by DTE  based on interactions with a cellular network, via graphical positioning system (GPS) techniques, or through broadcast media transmissions that include radio data system (RDS) messages. In another example, the user may simply input geographical location information into DTE  via keypad .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["350","352","324","354","332","355","320","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9","FIG. 1"],"b":["356","310","337","357","12","12","12","358","310","310","12","310","12","359","310","310","360","332","310","12","361","320","310"]},"Cellular network method  may be used repeatedly according to programming of application  to determine geographical location information. For example, anytime the user reviews bookmarks based on the geographical location parameter, application  may instruct processor  and communication hardware  to update geographical location information. In another example, application  may be setup to periodically initiate a request for geographical location information. In a further example, DTE  may monitor network  and automatically request and store a new location when it determines the location has changed sufficiently, such as based on handover to a different cell or a change in signal strength.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 9"],"b":["362","310","310","362","337","364","365","366","310","368","370","332","371","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 9"],"b":["370","310","337","310","372","373","310","374","310","376","332","337","377","310"]},"Referring now to , a method  is shown for reviewing bookmarks for a particular geographical location, and for receiving a media station broadcast and interacting with a website for the media station based on selection of a bookmark. In accordance with geographical location information, which may be determined, for example, by methods , ,  or , the user requests  to view bookmarks having geographical location parameters matching the determined geographical location information. The bookmarks may have been previously saved as favorite bookmarks by the user using application . In other examples discussed below, the bookmarks may be established via an autoscan function of application  that finds available broadcast stations for the geographical location. In response to the user's request, application  causes display  to list  bookmarks  according to the current geographical location information. The bookmarks may also be displayed using other parameters combined with their location parameter, such as a desired music genre. Using keypad , the user selects  a desired bookmark from the bookmarks displayed. Upon selection of the desired bookmark , application  fetches  the frequency and geographical location parameter for bookmark  from database .","After fetching the frequency for bookmark , application  instructs  tuner  to tune to the frequency for bookmark  and thereby receive  the audio broadcast. Application  may also be configured to find  and display  a graphic  on display  in conjunction with the reception of the audio broadcast. The graphic may be a standard radio indicator common to all stations that indicates to the user the audio broadcast is being played. As such, the user does not view a blank screen and is able see an indicator of audio broadcast reception. Preferably, however, the graphic  includes a logo image or animation (not shown) stored in memory  that is associated with bookmark . Further, the graphic  may form part of the associated bookmark displayed on display .","Graphic  provides various advantages. For example, it may indicate that interactive digital content is available for the broadcast station. It may further provide an appealing indication of the broadcast station that is readily recognizable by the user. It may also provide information about the broadcast station or advertise products or services. In other embodiments, the graphic  may be customizable, such as one of many downloadable graphics that may be obtained from a website for the broadcast station. Graphic  may include animations, sounds, video clips and other content.","In other embodiments, the graphic could initially be a standard radio indicator that is replaced by a logo image or animation (not shown) received subsequently from broadcast station server  when digital connectivity is established. The graphic, as well as website address and other bookmark information, could be obtained from station id server  according to methods discussed above in conjunction with . After receiving such information for the bookmark, application  preferably stores such bookmark information in database . According to one embodiment of the invention, such bookmark information could be updated periodically from the station id server  for all bookmarks stored in database  in accordance with programming of application .","In another embodiment of the invention, the user may manually request that bookmark information for bookmarks stored in database  be updated from station id server . In order to accurately identify the stations associated with each bookmark during such updates, frequency and geographical location parameter information are transmitted to station id server . The station may also be accurately identified to station id server  by transmitting station identification information to server  that is stored in database . The station identification information may have been received from an RDS signal along with the station broadcast or through communications with the broadcast station server for the station. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, an appropriate website address and graphic may be received while tuned to the broadcast frequency via an RDS signal. In a further embodiment, the delivery and display of graphical station identifiers may be implemented with messaging, such as multimedia messaging service (MMS) messages. Accordingly, when DTE  is tuned to a certain radio station, the existence of a corresponding graphical representation of the radio station may searched for in database . If not found, a MMS message including graphics and\/or a jingle audio file is requested from the service using a short messaging service (SMS) message. When received, the MMS message is used to construct the graphical and\/or audio representation of the radio station.","In any event, a graphic  is preferably displayed  on display  to indicate reception of the desired broadcast media. Substantially in parallel with tuning tuner , application  requests  communication with broadcast station server  using the website address for the server. In response, communication hardware  requests  data from broadcast station server . Accordingly, DTE  receives  data via communication hardware  and displays  the associated content on display .","Thus, according to method , the user is initially presented with bookmarks for his current geographical location, or optionally a selected geographical location. Once he selects a bookmark, he is able to view a graphic  indicating reception of broadcast media, such as audio radio media. When data from broadcast station server  is received, DTE  shows current data, such as interactive data, for the broadcast station's website. In other embodiments of the invention, the graphic , website data, and other bookmark information may be received via RDS signals.","Often, bookmarks are associated with a known broadcast station, such as a favorite radio station. In many cases, however, the user may like to review bookmarks for broadcast stations that are unknown to the user, but available in his geographical location. As such, the user may desire to scroll through bookmarks for available stations in his geographical location. Such scrolling may be improved by representing the bookmark for each available station with graphical information about the station that may identify whether the associated station includes digital interactivity. Accordingly, application  according to an embodiment of the invention includes an autoscan feature. The autoscan feature permits the user to view graphical information about the available broadcasts while tuning to desired broadcasts. Information gained from an autoscan process can be used to establish a set of bookmarks for the geographical location.","Referring now to along with , a method  is shown according to embodiments of the invention for scanning for available media broadcasts in a geographical area, tuning the mobile device by visually reviewing scanned broadcast stations, and for optionally creating bookmarks from the available broadcast stations. As shown, the method begins as the user of DTE  selects  an option for listening to the radio. Such selection may occur via the user entering a shortcut key on keypad  to application , or via other user interface methods. After execution of application , the user may select  a \u201cScan\u201d feature of application , which causes tuner  to scan the appropriate frequency bandwidth to find  available station broadcasts. When one or more broadcast frequencies are found, tuner  reports  such frequencies to application .","As shown in , application  may indicate on display  that DTE  is in the process of autotuning. The user may also be presented with options to control the autotuning operation. For example, UP , DOWN  and SELECT  options may be shown on display  along with the current frequency  located by tuner . If the user selects the UP  or DOWN  options, application  instructs tuner  to scan above or below the current frequency respectively. If the user chooses the SELECT  option, or optionally in response to expiration of a time out period in which DTE  waits for user input, tuner  tunes to the current frequency displayed and begins playing  the audio broadcast received. As shown in , display  may display  to the user the frequency to which DTE  is tuning.","Upon selection of a scanned frequency, application  attempts to find  a graphic  for broadcast station. Application  first searches bookmark database  to determine whether a bookmark is stored locally for the station. For example, based on the current geographical location information and the scanned frequency, application  may be able to locate a bookmark with associated bookmark information for the scanned broadcast station. As shown in , if a bookmark is found and a graphic  is stored in database  for the bookmark, the stored graphic  is initially displayed  on display . Along with the graphic , a broadcast reception indicator  is optionally displayed to indicate to the user that the broadcast is being received. In other embodiments, the graphic , as well as website data and other bookmark information, may be received via RDS signals or data messages, such as cell broadcast messages. In a further embodiment, the graphic  may be requested from a server, such as station id server . In yet further embodiments, SMS and\/or MMS messages may be used to request and receive graphic  and\/or audio files.","Application  further checks for data service, such as a website, for the station associated with the current scanned broadcast. If the broadcast signal includes a station identity as part of an RDS signal, the station identity information is used to request data connectivity information. If not, frequency and geographical location information are used to request data connectivity information. Using such information, application  instructs  communication hardware  to send  frequency and geographical location information to station id server  and request reception of data from the website associated with the broadcast station according to the methods discussed along with . As shown in , while searching for data service, display  optionally displays a data search indicator  to indicate that DTE  is searching for data service.","If data service for the current scanned station is received  by communication hardware , the information is processed  and the digital content is displayed  on display . illustrates the enhanced display shown upon reception of data service for the scanned broadcast station. As shown, an updated graphic  may be received as well as data connectivity information, such as the website for the broadcast station server . This information is preferably automatically stored in database , and if a bookmark does not exist for the station, one is created. The bookmark preferably includes as much information as available, such as genre, graphic , website information, geographical location, frequency, etc. The user may also be provided with the option of saving the broadcast station as a favorite bookmark. Further, application  can optionally be setup to save all stations located from the autoscan process as bookmarks for the geographical location.","As an example to illustrate the previous method, suppose the user travels to a different location that he visited a year ago. Suppose that he desires to scan available broadcast stations. As shown in , suppose that as a programmed preference, application  starts at the high end of the frequency range and works down. Suppose that DTE  locates frequency 104.6 as an available broadcast. Upon listening briefly to 104.6, suppose also that the user decides to try another station. As such, the user may select the down option displayed on display . Suppose that the user does so, and that tuner  subsequently locates frequency 102.3 as a viable broadcast having a sufficiently strong signal. If the user does nothing, DTE  times out and begins to tune to broadcast 102.3. Further, application  finds an old bookmark in database  for the current frequency at the present geographical location, as determined by one of methods , ,  and . Based on the data for the old bookmark, as illustrated in , DTE  displays the stored graphic  and attempts to connect to the website address stored in database . Upon successful reception of data from the station website, the related content is displayed in display , as shown in along with a new graphic . Further, the old bookmark is updated for future reference by the user.","In an alternative embodiment (not shown), DTE  may request information for all available broadcasts in the current geographical area from a server, such as station id server. Upon reception of such information, DTE  establishes bookmarks to all available broadcasts, preferably including graphics . As such, the user may easily scroll through graphical bookmarks for available broadcasts in the geographical area.","In many of the embodiments discussed above, RDS transmissions may be used to provide information and other information that supplements a particular station broadcast to a mobile device bookmark. As is known in the art, RDS transmissions often include alternative frequencies (AF) on which a particular program or station broadcast is being transmitted. Further, RDS transmissions often include program identity (PI) information, which identifies a current program being broadcast via the transmission (e.g. the name of a talk show), and program station (PS) information, which identifies the broadcast station (e.g. Zoom FM). Other information, such as geographical location information, may also be transmitted via RDS. Based on RDS information transmitted, radio receivers can be programmed to be very user-friendly. For example, the radio receivers may quickly tune to an AF for a PI being received as the signal weakens and a stronger signal becomes available. Such radio receivers, however, require an RDS demodulator\/decoder and a microprocessor (not shown) in order to receive such transmissions, which may not be available on many mobile devices that are able to receive digital communications.","The benefits of RDS transmissions on a non-RDS capable mobile device may be realized through the use of digital communications that provide information otherwise provided in RDS transmissions, such as through cell broadcast service (CBS) transmissions. Referring now to , systems and methods are shown for providing supplemental broadcast information over a digital communications network according to embodiments of the invention.  shows a DTE  that is adapted to receive analog broadcast transmissions via VHF\/FM antenna  and digital communications from a data communication network, such as for example, a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network via GSM antenna . It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to receiving GSM data via the GSM antenna , also other types of antenna arrangements are possible. Except for aspects related to CBS transmissions, aspects and preferences for DTE  are generally the same as DTE .","According to one embodiment, software may be used to tune and\/or retune VHF\/FM receiver  according to RDS information received in CBS transmissions. As such, a VHF\/FM Radio application programming interface (API) , a wireless message API (WMA) , and a radio player application , which may be implemented as an application that runs in a JAVA 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) environment, are stored in memory  of DTE . During operation, if GSM antenna  is tuned to receive CBS transmissions that are delivering RDS information, a received CBS message  (shown in ) is submitted to radio player application  via WMA . The radio player application  is able to decode the RDS information and, based on the information, select the appropriate frequency. Using the VHF\/FM Radio API , the radio player application  tunes tuner , which is preferably a digital phase-locked loop (PLL) synthesizer, to receive desired broadcast transmissions. Thus, based on the RDS information, as well as other inputs such as user commands, application  provides instructions to processor  for controlling DTE  with regard to playing and displaying broadcast media and content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["600","88","600","602","604","606","608","610","604","602","606","600","608"]},"RDS messages according to an embodiment of the invention are each carried in the content  of a CBS message. For example, RDS message  shown in  is carried in CBS message . RDS message  includes PI , PS , AF  and other information , such as location information for a broadcast cell over which the RDS\/CBS message is sent or data for a bookmark graphic. By carrying an RDS message in a CBS message, the benefits of RDS technology may be gained by a mobile device that can receive CBS messages over a communication network, and that can receive broadcast media.","Referring to , a sample broadcast network  is shown to illustrate advantages of CBS messages in supplementing broadcast transmissions. Suppose that broadcast station  broadcasts FM radio under the station name \u201cZOOM FM.\u201d The broadcast signal from station  is sent via wires, or alternatively wirelessly using a wireless radio link, to a first transmitter  located in Espoo, Finland and a second transmitter  located in Turku, Finland. First transmitter  transmits the broadcast station ZOOM FM at a frequency of 106.2 MHz to the geographical area around the city of Espoo, and second transmitter  transmits the same broadcast station at a frequency of 103.9 MHz to the geographical area around Turku. RDS information is transmitted by transmitter ,  along with the broadcast, which includes AF, PI and PS data. Broadcast station  sends the same RDS information to a cell broadcast entity (CBE)  that services the geographical locations of Espoo, Turku, and regions in between.","Referring now to  in conjunction with , a public land mobile network (PLMN)  is shown that covers the domain of radio station ZOOM FM. PLMN  provides GSM mobile communications to mobile devices within its domain, which includes cell  , cell  , and cell   within the broadcast domain of radio station ZOOM FM. As shown, cell   and cell   receive FM radio broadcasts for ZOOM FM that are transmitted by radio broadcast transmitter , and cell  receives ZOOM FM broadcasts from transmitter . Based on an agreement between broadcast station  and PLMN , RDS information is periodically transmitted in cell broadcast areas that coincide with the broadcast transmission areas through CBS messages. The CBS messages may originate from a number of cell broadcast entities (CBEs), including CBE , which are connected to a cell broadcast center (CBC) . CBS messages from particular CBEs are transmitted according to CBCs cell coverage requirements as agreed to with broadcast station ZOOM FM.","The CBC sends CBS messages to appropriate base station controllers (BSC), where the messages are stored and periodically transmitted according to instructions from CBC . DTE  can be configured to receive these CBS messages manually by the user. Also, DTE  may be programmed to permit PLMN  to configure DTE  over the air (OTA) to receive CBS messages. CBS messages for each radio station are preferably transmitted over a dedicated channel; however, PLMN  could send all CBS messages for the domain over a common CB channel.","Suppose as an example that a user selects a bookmark  on DTE  for Zoom broadcast station  while in the city of Espoo. According to its programming, application  instructs tuner  to tune to frequency 106.2 MHz. Further, based on the reception of CBS message , which includes updated web address information as part of the encapsulated RDS message , DTE  requests digital content from broadcast station server  at the updated web address. Suppose that the RDS message  further provides AF information, which indicates that the same PS  is broadcasting the same PI on frequency 103.9 for cell . Suppose also that the RDS message  includes geographical location information in the \u201cother\u201d portion  of the RDS message. As such, upon entering cell   in the area of the city of Turku, application  automatically causes tuner  to tune the AF of 103.9. The frequency change is transparent to the user. Thus, without providing additional RDS functionality to DTE , DTE  is able to update its bookmark for ZOOM FM and to automatically change frequencies as needed.","While the present invention has been described in connection with the illustrated embodiments, it will appreciated and understood that modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. In particular, the invention applies to any computing device adapted to receive radio broadcasts and having data connectivity. Further, the radio broadcasts are not limited to FM radio, and may include analog or digital broadcasts."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will be described in detail in the following description of preferred embodiments with reference to the following figures wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIGS. 17","FIG. 16"],"i":["a","e "],"b":"17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 18"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 18","FIG. 19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 20"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
