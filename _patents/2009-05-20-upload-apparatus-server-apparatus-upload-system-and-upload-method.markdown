Field of the Invention","The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2008-133831 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on May 22, 2008, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to an upload apparatus, a server apparatus, an upload system, and an upload method that are configured to upload content on networks.","2. Description of the Related Art","Recently, such network services based on image posting management systems and so on as blogs (Weblogs), SNS (Social Network Services), and moving image sharing services, for example, have been increasing.","Users of these services can upload images on networks.","In using these services, users can two-dimensionally encode these necessary URL (Uniform Resource Locator) information to easily execute a URL input operation and an operation of transmitting URL information to other users at the terminals of users (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2007-249929, for example).","It should be note here that these services are basically operated by membership systems, so that each user must get registered as a member in advance and log in on a server providing an image posting management system and the like in many cases (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2008-108027, for example).","The member registration is executed by accessing from a network-connectable user terminal to a server providing an image posting management system and the like to receive an ID and a password necessary for login from that server.","A login operation is executed by the user's entry of the ID and the password distributed at the time of the membership registration into the user terminal and transmitting the ID and the password to the server providing the image posting management system. If the user stores the ID and the password in the user terminal beforehand, the user can execute a login operation with ease.","However, if the user has not stored the ID and the password in the user terminal to be used or if two or more users share one user terminal, the user or users must execute a cumbersome operation of entering each user's ID and password.","Therefore, the present invention addresses the above-identified and other problems associated with related-art methods and apparatuses and solves the addressed problems by providing an upload apparatus, a server apparatus, an upload system, and an upload method that are high in usability and configured to allow users to log in on a content sharing service providing server apparatus with an easy method, thereby uploading content.","In carrying out the invention and according to one embodiment thereof, there is provided an upload apparatus.

Consequently, by a simple method, the user can log in on a server apparatus providing content sharing services without entering his or her ID and password, thereby uploading content. If there are more than one user, one information processing apparatus included in the upload apparatus to be shared by more than one user extracts the information of the ID and the password for each user and the extracted information is transmitted to the network.","In the above-mentioned upload apparatus, the upload means has storage means for storing the content and the outputted code image by relating each other, extraction means for extracting the information of the ID and the password from the stored code image, and transmission means for transmitting the content and information of an ID and a password extracted from the code image corresponding to the content to a server apparatus on the network, the server apparatus being logged in by use of the ID and the password.","The upload apparatus stores the content and the code image including the information of the ID and the password by relating the content with the code image. Consequently, by user's selecting content to be uploaded, the above-mentioned code image is specified. In addition, the upload apparatus extracts the information of the ID and the password from the above-mentioned specified code image and transmits the content selected by the user and the extracted information to the server apparatus. Namely, by user's selecting desired content to be uploaded on the network, the content and the information of the ID and the password necessary for the uploading are transmitted to the server apparatus. Consequently, the user can upload, in a simple method, desired content by logging in on the server apparatus that provides content sharing services.","In the above-mentioned upload apparatus, the output means outputs the code image including the ID, the password, and address information of the server apparatus. The storage means stores the content and the code image including the address information by relating each other. The extraction means extracts the ID, the password, and the address information from the stored code image. The transmission means transmits the content and information of an ID and a password extracted from the code image corresponding to the content to the server apparatus by use of the address information.","The upload means transmits the content and the information of the ID and the password to the server apparatus by use of the address information of the server apparatus included in the code image. Consequently, the user can upload, in a simple method, the content without entering the address information of the server apparatus.","In the above-mentioned upload apparatus, the output means has a display configured to display the code image.
