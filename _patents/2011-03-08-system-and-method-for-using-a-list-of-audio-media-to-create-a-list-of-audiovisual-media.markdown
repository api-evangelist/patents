{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to a system and a method for using a list of audio media to create a list of audiovisual media. More specifically, a user of a computing device may create, may access, may edit and\/or may use a list of audio media objects, such as, for example, an audio playlist. Then, the user may request generation of a list of audiovisual media objects which correspond to the audio media objects in the list of audio media objects.","A user of modern digital media may discover and may consume digital media content in many different ways and on many different devices. For example, the user may discover and may play music files or streams using an online music service or a music sharing web site. As another example, the user may browse and may play music from a locally stored library of music files using a software music player executed by a personal computer or using a networked playback device, such as a DLNA-compatible stereo device. As yet another example, the user may play digital music files or streams using a mobile device, such as a mobile phone or a dedicated digital music player device. Each of these music playback scenarios has a corresponding scenario for playback of audiovisual content. For example, digital video files and streams may be discovered, may be accessed and may be played using an online video service, a video sharing website, a PC or mobile device equipped with multimedia playback software, or a networked video rendering device, such as a DLNA-compatible television.","For both audio media and audiovisual media, the available solutions often allow the user to organize media objects into lists of media objects. Such lists are called \u201cplaylists.\u201d A user may create, edit, store, and manage a playlist which references audio media objects or video media objects. Then, the user may play the playlist as a composite object to allow the audio media objects or the video media objects to be played in sequence on an appropriate audio or video rendering device. The rendering device or a separate control device typically allows the user to control the rendering of the playlist. For example, the user may skip forward to the next media object in the playlist, may skip backward to the previous media object in the playlist, or may generate a randomly shuffled order of playback of the media objects in the playlist. As a result, the user may organize favorite media objects into playlists and may use the playlists to play back the media objects in useful ways.","Audio playlists are typically created, edited, and used in the context of a library, a source, and\/or a collection of digital audio media objects. For example, a software music player on a personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d) may allow a user to create, edit and use an audio playlist based on a library of locally stored music files. For example, the music files may have been previously \u201cripped\u201d from compact discs or previously downloaded from an online music service. In this example, the existence, the accessibility and\/or the use of the playlist may be restricted to the software music player which creates and\/or manages the playlist. Alternatively, the software music player may enable the playlist to be exported, stored and\/or used outside of the software music player. For example, the playlist may be saved as a playlist file in a well-known format. The saved playlist may be used by other software applications on the PC or may be transferred to and\/or used by devices other than the PC.","As another example, an online music site may allow a user to create, edit and use an audio playlist based on the streamable music tracks available through the online music site. The resulting playlist may be managed and\/or used with tools provided by the online music site. For example, the tools to create, edit, manage and play the playlist and its associated audio media objects may be embedded in a web page using a scripting language such as Java, Javascript, ECMAscript, or Flash. The existence, accessibility, and\/or use of the playlist may be restricted to the online music site and\/or the tools provided by the online music site. For example, the online music site may not provide any way for the user to create a portable playlist file which may then be used outside of the online music site. Online music sites typically have such restrictions because use of the provided music content may be limited to the music site due to copyright issues. Playlist.com (www.playlist.com) and Myspace Music (www.myspace.com\/music) are two online music services which allow users to create, edit, and use audio playlists based on audio media, mainly music files, available through these services.","In a similar fashion, a software media player may allow a user to create, edit, and use a video playlist. The software media player may allow a user to discover, browse, identify and\/or select audiovisual media objects, such as available video files or streams. The software media player may allow the user to include audiovisual media objects in a playlist, and the playlist may then be used to access and\/or play back the audiovisual media objects in useful ways. Further, the software media player may allow the user to save, store and\/or export the playlist. As a result, the playlist may be used with other software, exported to other devices, or used to share the list of media objects with other users.","Similarly, an online video service may allow a user to create, edit and use a video playlist within the online video service. The online video service may be a news site, a sports site, an educational site, a video sharing site, a social networking site and\/or the like. The playlist may be restricted to the online video service. For example, the playlist may be restricted to only reference video media objects available from the online video service. The online video service may not allow the playlist to be exported or shared outside of the online video service. Even so, the online video service may allow the playlist to be shared between users of the online video service.","YouTube (domain at www.youtube.com; trademark of Google Inc.) is an example of a video sharing service which allows users to create video playlists based on the video content available through the service. YouTube also allows users to share the video playlists with other users of the service. Vevo (domain at www.vevo.com; trademark of Polygram Holding, Inc.) is another online video service which allows users to construct playlists from music video content available on the service. Vevo allows users to share their playlists with other users and to access \u201ccelebrity\u201d music video playlists which are featured playlists which focus on and\/or are provided by a celebrity, such as a popular music artist.","When media software or a media service allows playlists to be saved or exported, a well-known playlist format is typically used. The format may be a binary format, a text format, an XML format and\/or the like. For example, the well-known \u201cM3U\u201d playlist format is text-based, and allows media objects to be referenced by an absolute path within a file system, by a relative path within a file system, or by a resource location, such as an HTTP URL. As another example, the Windows Media Player playlist format, also known as \u201cWPL\u201d format, is an XML-based format for defining a playlist.","A user may create, may edit and may use an audio playlist in a software music client or through an online music service. However, the resulting audio playlist is only usable for playing the listed audio media objects. Available audiovisual media objects may correspond to some or all of the audio media objects referenced by the audio playlist. For example, fan videos, informational videos, or professionally produced music videos may correspond to digital music tracks referenced by the audio playlist. The corresponding audiovisual media objects may be available locally or may be available in one or more remote databases accessible to the software music client, the online music service, and\/or the user's computing device. The user may prefer viewing of the corresponding audiovisual media objects to merely listening to the audio media objects. However, the user currently has no way to use the audio playlist to discover, access, obtain or use the corresponding audiovisual media objects.","The present invention generally relates to a system and a method for using a list of audio media to create a list of audiovisual media. More specifically, a user of a computing device may create, may access, may edit and\/or may use a list of audio media objects, such as, for example, an audio playlist. Then, the user may request generation of a list of audiovisual media objects which correspond to the audio media objects in the list of audio media objects. For example, the user may request generation of the list of audiovisual media objects using a user interface on the computing device. The list of audio media objects may be provided to a list conversion engine which may discover, create, and\/or obtain audiovisual media objects which correspond to the audio media objects in the list of audio media objects.","To this end, in an embodiment of the present invention, a method for using a list of two or more audio media objects to create a list of audiovisual media objects is provided. The method has the steps of analyzing the list of audio media objects to obtain metadata descriptive of the audio media objects; searching one or more visual media object databases using the metadata wherein each of the visual media object databases provides access to visual media objects which encode visual content;

An MP3 file, an MP4 file containing a single media track of an audio type, and a Shoutcast (trademark of AOL Inc.) stream are examples of audio media objects. An audio media object may be a digital audio file, a digital audio stream, a music track, a song, an audio clip, a downloaded music object, and\/or the like. The audio media object may be stored locally and\/or remotely relative to a list of audio media objects which refers to the audio media object. For example, a playlist may reference a first digital audio file. The first digital audio file may be present on the same storage medium as the playlist, may be present in the same local network as the playlist, and\/or may be accessible from the playlist location over the internet. The playlist may reference the first digital audio file using a local storage location, a remote network location, a URL and\/or the like.","An audio media object database may be any database of audio media objects referenced by a list of audio media objects. For example, an audio media object database may be a library of digital music files; a collection of audio media objects on a digital storage medium, such as an electronic memory, a removable memory card, a hard drive or an optical disk; a collection of audio media objects on a media server device; a collection of audio media objects distributed among multiple storage devices in a local network; a collection of audio media objects available from a remote storage device via a network; a collection of audio media objects available from and\/or accessible via a content service; and\/or the like.","As used herein, an \u201caudiovisual media object\u201d is a digital media object which primarily conveys media having an audio component and a visual component. A Flash Video (FLV) file containing both audio and video, an MP4 file containing a first media track of an audio type and a second media track of a video type, and an RTSP session conveying an audio stream and a video stream are examples of audiovisual media objects.","As commonly used in the art, \u201cvideo\u201d refers to media which has an audio component and a visual component having moving pictures. A TV show, a movie, a short video clip, and an animated cartoon are examples of video media. According to this usage, a video media object is necessarily an audiovisual media object; however, the reverse is not necessarily true. For example, a still image displayed with accompanying audio and a digital photo slideshow rendered with accompanying audio are both examples of audiovisual media which are not video media according to the typical usage of the term \u201cvideo.\u201d However, either of these example objects may be encoded into a video media format. For example, the digital photo slideshow and its associated audio content may be combined by a video encoding apparatus to produce an audiovisual file in a standard video format, such as MPEG-4. Therefore, as used herein, the term \u201cvideo\u201d may apply to any audiovisual content encoded in any video media format, regardless of whether the content has moving pictures. A video media format may be standardized or proprietary. A video media format may exist, for example, as a file, a stream, a progressive download, a cached object, a streaming session, and\/or the like. Flash video, MPEG video, MP4 video, H.264 video, 3GPP video, and Ogg Theora video are well-known examples of video media formats.","As used herein, a \u201cvisual media object\u201d refers to any media object which has a visual component, regardless of whether the media object has an audio component. A digital photograph, a photo slideshow, and an MP4 file containing an encoded TV show are examples of visual media objects. A visual media object may be a digital video file, a digital video stream, a music video, a fan video, a downloaded audiovisual media object, a video clip, a digital photograph, a collection of digital images, a collection of album cover images, a visual slideshow, a graphical animation, and\/or the like.","A visual media object database may be any database of visual media objects accessible to and\/or searchable by the list conversion engine. For example, a visual media object database may be a library of visual media object files and\/or streams; a collection of visual media objects on a digital storage medium such as an electronic memory, a removable memory card, a hard drive or an optical disk; a collection of visual media objects on a media server device; a collection of visual media objects distributed among multiple storage devices in a local network; a collection of visual media objects available from a remote storage device via a network; a collection of visual media objects available from and\/or accessible via a content service; and\/or the like.","As used herein, a list of audio media objects may be a playlist; for example, the list of audio media objects may be available in a well-known playlist format, such as M3U. Alternatively, the list of audio media objects may be a proprietary file, a set of internal records, a list displayed in a user interface of a computing device, a list displayed on a web page, and\/or the like. The list of audio media objects may be created, may be edited and\/or may be maintained by the list conversion engine, a computing device associated with the list conversion engine, and\/or a software program associated with the list conversion engine. Alternatively, the list of audio media objects may be created by a computing device and\/or a software program which are unrelated to the list conversion engine. For example, the user may create a playlist using a separate playlist creation tool. Then, the user may provide the playlist as a playlist file to the list conversion engine and\/or to a device, a software program associated with the list conversion engine, and\/or a content service associated with the list conversion engine.","Similarly, a list of audiovisual media objects may be a playlist, a proprietary file, a set of internal records, a list displayed in a user interface of a computing device, a list displayed on a web page, and\/or the like. The list of audiovisual media objects may be a \u201ccaptive\u201d list; for example, use of the list of media audiovisual media objects may be restricted to a particular device, a particular software program and\/or a particular content service. Alternatively, the list of audiovisual media objects may be exportable, may be portable and\/or may be shareable between devices, software programs and\/or content services. For example, the list of audiovisual media objects may be available in a well-known playlist format, such as M3U.","An audiovisual media object may be stored locally and\/or remotely relative to a list of audiovisual media objects which refers to the audiovisual media object. For example, a playlist may reference a first video file in a standard video file format, and the first video file may be present on the same storage medium as the playlist. Alternatively, the playlist may reference a first video stream available from a remote content server. If the list conversion engine creates an audiovisual media object for inclusion in a list of audiovisual media objects, the list conversion engine may store the created audiovisual media object in a location which the list of audiovisual media objects is capable of referencing. For example, the list conversion engine may store the created audiovisual media object locally with respect to a video playlist which references the created audiovisual media object using a local file reference. Alternatively, the list conversion engine may store the created audiovisual media object on a remote video server and then may generate the list of audiovisual media objects to reference the created audiovisual media object using a URL which targets the remote video server.","As used herein, \u201cmetadata\u201d refers to information fields descriptive of an audio media object, a visual media object or an audiovisual media object. For example, the information fields may have one or more fields of a title, an artist, an author, a recording date, a music label, a publisher, a publication date, a copyright date, a genre, musical lyrics, a year, an album name, an album cover image, a URL and\/or the like.","Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts,  generally illustrates a system  for using a list of audio media objects  to create a list of audiovisual media objects  in an embodiment of the present invention.

Alternatively or additionally, the list conversion engine  may obtain the metadata from the audio media objects. For example, an audio playlist may reference audio media objects available in the audio media object database , and the list conversion engine  may access the audio media objects to obtain the metadata. As a more detailed example, an audio playlist may reference a locally stored MP3 music file which has metadata stored in an ID3 tag format, and the list conversion engine  may access the locally stored MP3 music file to extract the metadata from the ID3 tags.","The list conversion engine  may have access to one or more visual media object databases. For example, The list conversion engine  may have access to a first visual media object database , a second visual media object database  and\/or a third visual media object database . The present invention is not limited to a specific number of visual media object databases, and any number of visual media object databases may be implemented in the present invention.","For each audio media object in the list of audio media objects , the list conversion engine  may search the one or more visual media object databases to identify visual media objects which correspond to the audio media object. The search may be based on the metadata descriptive of the audio media object. For example, the list conversion engine  may have a song title, such as \u201cImprobable Nation,\u201d and\/or an artist, such as \u201cJames Peabody,\u201d obtained from a music playlist and\/or extracted from a digital music file referenced by the music playlist. The list conversion engine  may use the song title and\/or the artist as search terms for searching the one or more visual media object databases.","By searching one or more visual media object databases, the list conversion engine  may discover, may find and\/or may identify visual media objects which correspond to the audio media objects in the list of audio media objects . For a particular audio media object, the list conversion engine  may discover, may find and\/or may identify a single visual media object or multiple visual media objects. Alternatively, the list conversion engine  may fail to discover a visual media object corresponding to the particular audio media object.","A visual media object discovered, found and\/or identified by the list conversion engine  may be a purely visual media object, such as a digital photograph, a collection of digital photographs, or a slideshow, for example. Alternatively, the visual media object discovered, found and\/or identified by the list conversion engine  may be an audiovisual media object, such as a digital video file, a digital video stream, a music video, a fan video, a video clip, a television show, and\/or the like.","Based on the visual media objects discovered, found and\/or identified, the list conversion engine  may create and\/or may generate the list of audiovisual media objects . The audiovisual media objects in the list of audiovisual media objects  may correspond to the audio media objects in the list of audio media objects . Hereafter various techniques which the list conversion engine  may use to create and\/or generate the list of audiovisual media objects are described.","If the list conversion engine  identifies a single audiovisual media object which corresponds to a particular audio media object in the list of audio media objects , the list conversion engine  may include and\/or may reference the single audiovisual media object in the list of audiovisual media objects . For example, the third audio media object in the list of audio media objects  may be a digital music track having the title \u201cImprobable Nation.\u201d The list conversion engine  may search the first visual media object database  using the title \u201cImprobable Nation.\u201d As a result, the list conversion engine  may identify a music video version of the song \u201cImprobable Nation\u201d available from the first visual media object database . The list conversion engine  may generate the list of audiovisual media objects  such that the third audiovisual media object in the list of audiovisual media objects  may be the music video version of the song \u201cImprobable Nation.\u201d","If the list conversion engine  identifies multiple audiovisual media objects which correspond to a particular audio media object, the list conversion engine  may select a single audiovisual media object from the multiple identified audiovisual media objects. The list conversion engine  may include and\/or may reference the selected audiovisual media object in the list of audiovisual media objects .","As a first example, the list conversion engine  may use properties of the multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified to select a single audiovisual media object for inclusion in the list of audiovisual media objects . The properties may be available from the one or more visual media object databases which provide the multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified. The properties may have and\/or may be a confidence level; a rating; a user rating; a number of times the audiovisual media object has been viewed; a restriction indication; an indication of who created, published, and\/or posted the audiovisual media object; and\/or the like. The list conversion engine  may select the audiovisual media object from the multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified so that the selected audiovisual media object has the highest confidence level, rating, user rating and\/or number of views. Alternatively, the list conversion engine  may select the audiovisual media object from the multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified based on recognition of the creator, the publisher and\/or the provider of the audiovisual media object.","The list conversion engine  may use a restriction indication of an audiovisual media object to select the audiovisual media object from the multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified. The restriction indication may indicate that the audiovisual media object is protected by DRM, that the audiovisual media object is restricted to be used and\/or displayed only on certain devices or device classes, that the audiovisual media object is prohibited from being used and\/or displayed on certain devices or device classes, that the audiovisual media object is prohibited from being used and\/or displayed in certain geographical areas, that transfer of the audiovisual media object requires a secure channel, and\/or the like. A content provider and\/or a visual media object database may provide the restriction indication to protect and\/or to control the distribution, the consumption and\/or the use of professionally produced and\/or premium media content objects. Therefore, the list conversion engine  may use the presence of restriction indications to detect and\/or to distinguish media content likely to be professionally produced and\/or premium media content. Thus, an audiovisual media object associated with one or more restriction indications may be selected from multiple identified audiovisual media objects for inclusion in the list of audiovisual media objects . Alternatively, the presence or absence of restriction indications may be combined with other media object properties to select an audiovisual media object for inclusion in the list of audiovisual media objects .","The selection of an audiovisual media object based on a restriction indication may depend on whether the indicated restriction may be satisfied. For example, an audiovisual media object may have a restriction indication prohibiting display of the audiovisual media object on mobile devices. Consequently, a list conversion engine  may not select the audiovisual media object for inclusion in a list of audiovisual media objects intended for use on a mobile device. However, if the list conversion engine  is creating a list of audiovisual media objects for use on a non-mobile device, such as a desktop PC, then the list conversion engine  may select the audiovisual media object for inclusion in the list. Moreover, the list conversion engine  may use the presence of the restriction indication as an indication that the audiovisual media object may be professionally produced and\/or may be premium content, and may select the audiovisual media object based on the presence of the restriction indication.","As a second example, the list conversion engine  may have a preference order for the visual media object databases. The list conversion engine  may use the preference order to select the audiovisual media object from multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified. For example, the first visual media object database  may be a database of professionally produced music videos, and the second visual media object database  may be a database of fan videos, namely amateur videos produced and\/or uploaded by music fans. The list conversion engine  may have a preference order which prefers a professionally produced music video over a fan video. Therefore, the list conversion engine  may select an audiovisual media object from the first visual media object database  if an audiovisual media object corresponding to the audio media object is found by searching the first visual media object database . If no audiovisual media objects corresponding to the audio media object are found by searching the first visual media object database , the list conversion engine  may select an audiovisual media object from the second visual media object database . In this way, the list conversion engine  may access and\/or may search any number of visual media object databases which have an associated preference order.","As a third example, the list conversion engine  may accept input from a user to select an audiovisual media object from multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified. The list conversion engine  may use a user interface of a computing device to display a list which has one or more of the multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified. The user interface may accept user input to select one of the multiple audiovisual media objects which are identified. As a result, the list conversion engine  may include the audiovisual media object selected by the user input in the list of audiovisual media objects .","As a fourth example, the list conversion engine  may select a default audiovisual media object for inclusion in the list of audiovisual media objects . The list conversion engine may indicate to the user that additional alternative audiovisual media objects are identified. The list conversion engine  may enable the user to access, use and\/or play the list of audiovisual media objects  containing the default audiovisual media object selected by the list conversion engine . Further, the list conversion engine  may enable the user to access a list of alternative audiovisual media objects, such as the multiple audiovisual media objects identified by the list conversion engine , and select a different audiovisual media object for inclusion in the list of audiovisual media objects .","The list conversion engine  may maintain records of the multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to each of the audio media objects. The list conversion engine  and\/or another component may use the records to identify to the user that an audiovisual media object in the list of audiovisual media objects  may have additional alternative media objects which may then be presented for selection by the user. In this way, the list of audiovisual media objects  may be dynamic. For example, a user may replace an audiovisual media object with an alternative audiovisual media object which may have been identified by earlier searches executed by the list conversion engine .","The records of the multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to a particular audio media object may be stored in a playlist file. For example, the records of the multiple audiovisual media objects may be included as \u201ccomments\u201d in an M3U playlist file. As known to one skilled in the art, the M3U playlist format allows \u201ccomment\u201d fields to be identified by a leading pound character, namely \u201c#\u201d. Therefore, the list conversion engine  may create and\/or may generate the list of audiovisual media objects  as an M3U playlist file and\/or may encode the multiple audiovisual media objects as comment fields in the M3U playlist file.","In this way, the comment fields which specify the multiple audiovisual media objects in the M3U playlist file may be ignored by devices and applications which do not support the capability to offer the multiple audiovisual media objects specified in an M3U playlist file. Such devices and applications may be able to access and use the M3U playlist file but may not identify or present the multiple audiovisual media objects to a user of the device or the application, respectively. However, the list conversion engine  and\/or a device or an application which is capable of offering multiple audiovisual media objects in an M3U playlist file may recognize the comment fields which specify the multiple audiovisual media objects. In this way, the list conversion engine , the device and\/or the application may identify to the user that alternative audiovisual media objects exist for an audiovisual media object referenced by the playlist. An option may be provided for the user to explore and to select one of the alternative audiovisual media objects.","The preceding example uses \u201ccomment\u201d fields available in an M3U playlist file; however, the present invention is not limited to this example. One skilled in the art will recognize other ways in which the records which specify the multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to an audio media object may be encoded in a playlist file. For example, a new playlist file format may be created and\/or an existing playlist file format may be extended to include fields for representing the multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to an audio media object. As known in the art, an existing file format may have a generic extension mechanism used for adding new data fields, and the generic extension mechanism may be suitable for adding fields for representing the multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to an audio media object.","The records which specify the multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to an audio media object may be stored in other ways. For example, the list conversion engine  may store the records in a file, in a database, on a local disk, on a network attached storage device, and\/or the like. The present invention does not require storage of the records in a playlist file. However, storage of the records in a playlist file may be advantageous because records stored in a playlist file are portable and may be carried by the playlist file from a device and\/or an application to a different device and\/or a different application.","If the list conversion engine  identifies one or more purely visual media objects which correspond to a particular audio media object, then the list conversion engine  may create an audiovisual media object using one or more of the purely visual media objects identified. The list conversion engine  may create the list of audiovisual media objects  to include the audiovisual media object created from the one or more of the purely visual media objects identified.","For example, the first audio media object in the list of audio media objects  may be a digital music track with a title of \u201cRock the Mountain\u201d and an album name of \u201cNature Calls.\u201d The list conversion engine  may use the title and\/or the album name to search one or more available visual media object databases. As a result, the list conversion engine  may identify photographs associated with the title and\/or the album name. The list conversion engine  may access and\/or may retrieve the photographs from the one or more available visual media object databases. Then, the list conversion engine  may combine the photographs with the first audio media object. For example, the list conversion engine  may encode the photographs together with the first audio media object using a video encoder. In this way, the list conversion engine  may create an audiovisual media object, namely a visual slide show which displays the photographs concurrently with playback of the digital music track. The audiovisual media object created by combining the photographs with the digital music track may correspond to the first audio media object and\/or may be included in the list of audiovisual media objects . In an embodiment, the list conversion engine  may create an audiovisual media object by combining the audio media object with one or more purely visual media objects in response to a failure to identify any available audiovisual media objects which correspond to the audio media object.","If the list conversion engine  fails to identify a media object which corresponds to the audio media object, the list conversion engine  may create an audiovisual media object based on the audio media object. The list conversion engine  may include the created audiovisual media object in the list of audiovisual media objects . Alternatively, the list conversion engine  may include the audio media object in the list of audiovisual media objects  if the list of audiovisual media objects  accommodates a mixture of audiovisual media objects and audio media objects. As another alternative, the list conversion engine  may omit an entry in the list of audiovisual media objects  if an audio media object does not have a corresponding visual media object.","Several examples follow for creation of an audiovisual media object based on the audio media object if no corresponding visual media object is identified. As a first example, the list conversion engine  may encode the audio media object together with a static image using a video encoder. As a result, the list conversion engine  may produce an audiovisual media object in a video media format so that rendering of the audiovisual media object displays the static image concurrently with playback of the audio media object. The static image may be a blank video frame, a black video frame, a gray video frame, a frame displaying a text message, a frame displaying a corporate logo, a frame displaying an album cover, and\/or the like. The text message may indicate that visual content is not available for the audio media object. For example, the text message may say \u201cSorry, no video found.\u201d The text message may provide descriptive metadata for the audio media object.","As a second example, the list conversion engine  may encode the audio media object together with a music visualization animation. The music visualization animation may have and\/or may be moving pictures generated in response to the content, the pitch, the tempo, the energy, the volume and\/or the frequency decomposition of the audio media object. The list conversion engine  may decode and\/or may analyze the audio media object to generate the music visualization animation. Then, the list conversion engine  may encode the audio media object together with the generated music visualization animation using a video encoder. As a result, the list conversion engine  may create an audiovisual media object in a video media format, and the audiovisual media object may have the audio media object synchronized to a music visualization animation. The music visualization animation may display lines, bars, patterns, pulses, cartoons, an equalizer, lightning bolts, and\/or any visual design animated using properties of the audio media object. Music visualization animations are used to provide visual effects within a software music player and are well known in the art. Windows Media Player (trademark of Microsoft Corporation) and the WinAmp player (trademark of AOL LLC) are examples of software music players which support music visualization animations.","The list of audiovisual media objects  may be created by the list conversion engine  as a mix of the various types of audiovisual media objects discussed herein. The types of audiovisual media objects included in the list of audiovisual media objects  may depend on the search results corresponding to each audio media object.","For example, the list of audio media objects  may have a first digital music track, a second digital music track and a third digital music track. The list conversion engine  may search one or more available visual media object databases using metadata descriptive of the first digital music track and, as a result, may identify a first audiovisual media object corresponding to the first digital music track. The list conversion engine  may search the one or more available visual media object databases using metadata descriptive of the second digital music track. As a result, the list conversion engine  may find multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to the second digital music track. The list conversion engine  may select a second audiovisual media object from the multiple audiovisual media objects using one of the selection techniques discussed previously. The list conversion engine  may search the one or more available visual media object databases using metadata descriptive of the third digital music track and, as a result, may find purely visual media objects corresponding to the third digital music track. Accordingly, the list conversion engine  may create a third audiovisual media object by encoding one or more of the purely visual media objects together with the third audio media object.","As a result, the list conversion engine  may create and\/or may generate the list of audiovisual media objects  to have the first audiovisual media object, the second audiovisual media object and the third audiovisual media object. Further, the list conversion engine  may indicate to the user that the second audiovisual media object is one of multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to the second audio media object. The list conversion engine  may offer the user an option to select one of the multiple audiovisual media objects corresponding to the second audio media object. The selected audiovisual media object may be used as the second audiovisual media object in the list of audiovisual media objects .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0111"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["30","11","12","32","11","11","11","12","11","11","11","11"]},"In step , the metadata descriptive of the audio media objects may be used to search one or more databases of visual media objects.

The metadata may be used to search the one or more databases of visual media objects without any additional user input subsequent to the request to create the list of audiovisual media objects . In step , visual media objects available from the one or more databases of visual media objects may be identified so that each of the visual media objects corresponds to one of the audio media objects in the list of audio media objects . For example, a first visual media object may be identified which may correspond to the first audio media object, a second visual media object may be identified which may correspond to the second audio media object, and\/or a third visual media object may be identified which may correspond to the third audio media object.","In step , the visual media objects identified may be used to generate the list of audiovisual media objects . Each audiovisual media object in the list of audiovisual media objects  may correspond to one of the audio media objects in the list of audio media objects , and\/or each of the audio media objects in the list of audio media objects  may correspond to one of the audiovisual media objects in the list of audiovisual media objects .
