{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Over the past thirty years, telephony has significantly evolved from the once-ubiquitous public switched telephone network service. Advances in technology have added an ever increasing array of features and capabilities to telecommunication devices, such as touch screens, user-friendly graphic user interfaces (GUIs), and image and video capturing components. Such touch screens and GUIs enable users to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as initiating or receiving phone calls, writing emails or text messages, browsing the Internet, and managing device settings such contact lists. The GUIs may also be specific to applications, such as applications developed by third party developers. Some GUIs allow for customization based on user selections of one or more settings such as a color setting, thus enabling a user to select a color to be associated with a GUI.","Video and image capturing components such as camera elements allow users to capture images or videos with their telecommunication devices. The images and videos are then stored on the telecommunication device and can be emailed or messaged to other devices. Some telecommunication devices allow users to select an image captured with the telecommunication device to be a background or screen saver image.","Described herein are techniques for enhancing elements of a graphic user interface (GUI) with portion(s) of an image. Such elements of a GUI may include headers, menu items, list items, contacts, icons, buttons, slide controls, form elements, or backgrounds. To enhance these elements of the GUI, the graphics and\/or text associated with the elements of the GUI may be replaced or combined with portion(s) of an image. For example, a header, such as a bar or area at the top of the GUI, may be programmed to have the color blue and a time of day. To enhance the header, a portion of an image, such as a picture of a clock, may be selected and combined with the header. The enhanced header could, for instance, use the portion of the image in place of the area formerly colored blue and could overlay the time of day in front of the portion of the image.","The portion(s) of the image used to enhance the elements of the GUI may be selected based on parameters associated with the elements of the GUI. Parameters are criteria used for selecting portion(s) of the image. The parameters are associated with the elements of the GUI which the portion(s) are to enhance. For example, the header may be associated with a parameter that is set to the size of the GUI surface that the header occupies, such as 400 pixels by 80 pixels. Based on this parameter, a portion of the image can be selected and used to enhance the header. Other parameters, such as a coordinate pair referring to a location within the image, a brightness\/darkness parameter, or a color variation parameter, may be utilized as well.","The images utilized for enhancing the elements of the GUI may be any sort of images, such as pictures or a video captured with a telecommunication device, images retrieved or received from a local or remote computing device, images retrieved or received from an application, or images created or modified by a user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","106","106","118","112","120","102","104","108","116","118","102","104","108","116","118"]},"As illustrated in , the device may utilize an image or video capturing component to capture  the image from which the portion  is selected. The image may be a still image, may be a frame of a video file recorded by the image or video capture component, or may be a loop of such a video file. The device may capture  the image at a pre-programmed time or in response to receiving input from a user. Also, in a number of embodiments, the image or video capturing and transferring is a continuous process\u2014that is, images or video may be utilized in selecting , applying , and applying  in real time as they are captured.","In various embodiments, the device receives or retrieves  the image from a local or remote system. The local or remote system may be any sort of local or remote computing device and may be connected to the device via a network connection or local coupling. In one embodiment, the local or remote system is accessible via the Internet. Such a local or remote system may also, for example, store a plurality of images and may provide a graphic user interface (GUI) which enables a user to select from the plurality of images. In another embodiment, the local or remote computing device pushes the image to the device. For example, the image may be one of a plurality of images pre-loaded onto the device.","In some embodiments (not shown), the image is retrieved from an application. The application may be one that automatically provides images on a predetermined basis, such as daily. The application may also or instead act as an interface to a repository of images, enabling selection of one or more images of the repository. In other embodiments, the image is created by a user or modified by a user.","In some embodiments, the device captures , receives, or retrieves  multiple images, video frames, or video loops. Prior to performing the selecting , the device may automatically select one of the multiple images or may facilitate a user in selecting an image by, for example, displaying the multiple images in a GUI. If automatically selecting the image, the device may utilize any one or more of a number of techniques. The device may select the image randomly, based on user preferences, based on a time or location of image capture, based on traits intrinsic to each image (e.g., brightness, color variations, etc.), or based on any other technique known in the art. In embodiments in which the multiple images are multiple frames or loops of a video or multiple images of a sequence, the device selects each image, one after another.","In one embodiment, the preferences driving the automatic selection of the image may be provided via user input. For example, a device may pose a number of questions to a user which the user may answer with voice or text input. The answers are then utilized to determine a set of preferences.","In various embodiments, upon capturing , receiving or retrieving  an image, the device accesses the parameters . Each parameter  may be associated with one or more user interface elements  of a GUI and may specify a rule or criteria to be applied in selecting a portion  of the image. Such user interface elements  may include at least one of a header, a menu item, a list item, a contact, an icon, a button, a slide control, a form element, or a background, but may include any sort of user interface elements. For example, a user interface element  may be 50 pixels by 40 pixels in dimension. A parameter  associated with such a user interface element  may specify that the selected portion  to be applied to the user interface element  should also be 50 pixels by 40 pixels in dimension. Parameters  may also specify a pixel location within the image (e.g., an x,y coordinate pair) and an indication of where within the portion  that location is to belong (top left corner, center, etc.). Additionally, parameters  may include a brightness\/darkness parameter, a color variation parameter, and\/or any other sort of parameter known in the art.","The parameters  may be specified in a lookup table, which may in turn be stored in a template. Such templates are described in greater detail herein. Also, lookup tables are illustrated in , which shows a lookup table . In one embodiment, a lookup table  is associated with a single telecommunication device or other computing device. In other embodiments, each application, operating system (OS), platform, etc. is associated with a lookup table . The contents of the lookup tables may include entry pairs, each pair including a user interface element  and a parameter . In other embodiments, rather than pairs, an entry for a user interface element  is associated with a plurality of entries for parameters , or visa versa. A lookup table  may specify only one user interface element  and one or more parameters  for that element , or may specify multiple user interface elements  and parameters . In some embodiments, each user interface element  within the lookup tables  is associated with an identifier. The device may then associate each identifier with a corresponding portion  when selecting  the portion .","In some embodiments, the device dynamically constructs the lookup tables  in response to receiving user interface element \/parameter  pairs from a source, such as a third party application developer. To receive the parameters , the device may expose an application programming interface (API) that enables the source to programmatically provide parameters  for user interface elements , such as user interface elements  of a new application. The received user interface element \/parameter  pairs may then be used to create a new lookup table  (such as a table for an application) or supplement an existing lookup table . The dynamic construction may occur on a periodic basis or may occur as the user interface element \/parameter  pairs are received.","In some embodiments, lookup tables are associated with a theme. For example, several lookup tables associated with applications, the OS, and platform may be associated with a \u201cbright\u201d theme that includes parameters in each lookup table for selecting  bright portions  of the image. The theme may in turn be associated with a level of service, such as service provided by a telecommunication service provider, and different levels of service may \u201cunlock\u201d different themes and lookup tables.","In various embodiments, as further shown in , the device utilizes one or more rules to determine which portion  of the image to select. The rules may include rules specified by parameters  and\/or rules utilizing the parameters . For example, a user interface element  may be associated with parameters  specifying a size and a location\/coordinate within an image. Based on such parameters , the device may select  a portion  associated with the specified location and having the specified size.","In other embodiments, the parameters  only specify a size. In such embodiments, the device then utilizes one or more rules to select  a portion  having the specified size. For instance, the rules may be used to randomly select  a portion  from the image having a specified size. The device could use such rules, for example, to randomly or pseudo-randomly generate a location\/coordinate which is then used along with the size to select  the portion . In another example, the rule may specify a brightness, color, or color variation parameter and may cause the device to select  a portion  which meets the brightness, color, or color variation parameter and which has a size meeting the size parameter .","In further embodiments, the parameters  specify a size and a trait, such as brightness, color, or color variation, which entails analysis of the image by the device. In such embodiments, the device analyzes the image based on the parameters  and selects  a portion  having the requisite size and color, color variation, or brightness.","In some embodiments, once the portion or portions  have been selected  based on the parameters , the device associates each portion  with an identifier of a user interface element  for which the portion  was selected. As mentioned above, the identifiers may be stored in the lookup tables , in conjunction with the parameters .","In various embodiments (not shown), in addition to or instead of performing the selecting , the device selects a color of the image to be applied to the user interface of the device. The device may select the color based on an analysis of the colors found in the image and may utilize, for example, a histogram. The application of the color to the user interface is described in detail further herein.","As is further illustrated in , once the portion  has been selected , the device may apply  one or more graphic effects  to the selected portion . In other embodiments, the applying  is optional. In yet other embodiments, no graphic effects  are associated with the user interface element  corresponding to the portion .","Graphic effects  may include effects which are already applied to the user interface element . For example, if the user interface includes a list of contacts and the currently selected contact has a highlight effect applied to it (e.g., is shown as darker or lighter than other contacts), that has highlight effect may be applied to the portion  if the portion  corresponds to the user interface element  for the currently selected contact. In some embodiments, the graphic effects  include at least one of shading, brightening, dimpling, rippling, a button effect, a blurring, a color inversion effect, or a black and white effect.","In various embodiments, the graphic effects  are specified in the lookup table having the parameters  for their associated user interface elements. Again,  shows such a lookup table . In other embodiments, the graphic effects  are specified in a separate table, template or file and are indexed by the above-mentioned identifiers for the user interface elements . The device may access the graphic effects  and apply them to the portion , creating a modified portion  of the image. In , the graphic effect  is a shadow effect and is applied to the portion  to generate a version of the portion  having a shadow.","As shown in , once the graphic effects  are applied  to the portion , the device applies  the portion  to the user interface element . The applying  may comprise the device generating a modified user interface element  based on the user interface element  and the portion  (and on graphic effects , if there are any). To generate the modified user interface element , the device may apply any sort of text or data associated with the user interface element  to the portion . For example, if the user interface element  represents a contact on a contact list, the element  may include a textual representation of a contact name (e.g., \u201cAnton\u201d) or data, such as a picture of the contact. To preserve the text\/data which enables identification of the user interface element  as a contact, the device may apply this text\/data to portion  by, for example, superimposing the text\/data on top of the portion . In another example, the user interface element  may be an icon association with the contact instead of the entire representation of the contact. In such an example, device may simply replace a default icon with the portion . Such a modified user interface element  would actually be a replacement of the original user interface element  with the portion .","Once the device has generated the modified user interface element , the modified user interface element  may be displayed as part of the overall user interface.","While  only illustrates one portion  being selected  and applied , multiple portions  may be simultaneously selected  and applied  to, for example, create an overall themed appearance to the user interface of the device.","As previously mentioned, the device may select a color of the image to be applied to the user interface of the device in addition to or instead of performing the selecting . In such embodiments, rather than applying  the portion  to the user interface element , the device applies the color to the user interface element  to create a modified user interface element  having the selected color. In one embodiment, the device may apply the color in the same manner that it applies  the portion .","As mentioned above, the device may perform the selecting  and applying  repeatedly or continuously until an indication is received. Thus, for example, the device may perform the selecting  and applying  in real time based off of frames of a video as that video is captured. In such embodiments, the indication terminating the selecting  and applying  can be a termination of the video feed or a selection of a button or control configured to indicate a user desire for a specific portion  or set of portions  for the modified user interface element(s) . Such a button or control may be a physical key or GUI key, or any other sort of control known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","306","308","316","308","316","308","310","312","314","316","308","316","304","304"]},"In various embodiments, the cluster of servers  includes one or more server computing devices, such as application servers, web servers, and\/or data storage servers.

Further, each user profile  may include a list of the associated telecommunication or other devices, templates for each device or a template for all of the devices. Within the template or templates may be a lookup table for each device or for each application, OS, platform, etc. on each device. In one embodiment, these templates and lookup tables are gathered from the various devices associated with the service account and are then stored in the associated user profile .","In performing the selecting , all or a subset of the parameters  stored in the user profile  may be used to select  portions  of the images. After optionally performing the applying  of the graphic effects , the one or more servers may provide the selected portions  to the devices associated with the user profile  and\/or may apply  the selected portions  to user interface elements of a web page to be provided to a device associated with the user profile .
