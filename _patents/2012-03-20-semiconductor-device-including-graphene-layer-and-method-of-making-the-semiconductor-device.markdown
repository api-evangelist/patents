Just as the quality of the graphene channel can vary across a semiconductor chip, so also can the condition of the graphene that interfaces with the contact metal (local defects, residual resist, etc.). Therefore, a sizeable amount of variation in Ris observed, even when fabricating transistors with the same geometry and in very close proximity on a semiconductor chip.","Despite this sizeable variation in R, the plot in  reveals that the double-contacted graphene transistors  in the test set  consistently exhibited lower Rthan their top-contacted transistors  in the test set .","A summary of some key performance metrics comparing the double-contacted devices according to the exemplary aspects of the present invention, with bottom-contacted devices and top-contacted devices is given below in Table I.

Thus, while the inventors tested thirty (30) test sets  including the double-contacted devices  and top-contacted devices  (and twelve (12) bottom-contacted devices) with single-layer graphene, the inventors tested six (6) test sets including the exfoliated bilayer devices. The data from the testing of the exfoliated bilayer devices is included above in Table 1.","As illustrated in Table 1, there is a nearly 40% drop in contact resistance Rgoing from top-contacted single-layer devices to double-contacted single-layer devices, which averaged 320\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm with a low of 260\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm, which, to the inventors' knowledge, is the lowest reported contact resistance Rfor a CVD-grown single graphene layer, with previous reports (from various graphene sources) falling in the 500\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm to 1000\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm range.","As further illustrated in Table 1, the bilayer double-contacted devices reached an even lower average Rof 250\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm, with a low of 180\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm. In addition, there was an improvement in average peak transconductance g(and, correspondingly, the peak field-effect mobility \u03bc) of 31% for the single layer graphene devices, and an improvement in average peak transconductance g(and, correspondingly, the peak field-effect mobility \u03bc) of 21% in the and bilayer graphene devices, respectively.","The reason for gand \u03bcimproving less than Ris that improvement of the contacts is more clearly observed when the graphene layer is biased far from the Dirac point (V) (e.g., when the device is in the ON state). It is when Vis swept closer to the Dirac point (V) that the resistance in the graphene channel dominates and more dramatic modulation of the current takes place to yield the peak gvalue (thus \u03bc), as seen in the characteristics in . Take, for instance, the higher average mobility observed in the bottom-contacted devices compared to the top-contacted ones, even though the contact resistance is higher.","While the bottom-contacted devices are not on the same graphene channels as the double-contacted devices, the average Rfrom the different device sets does provide insight into the improved performance. Unlike in the top-contacted device, the substrate gate does not influence the doping level of the graphene in the source\/drain areas for the bottom-contacted device. Therefore, the 36% higher contact resistance Rin bottom-contacted devices can be attributed to the lower doping level.","Using an electrostatic model with an effective graphene-metal distance d=1 \u212b and W\u2212W\u2212\u0394c=200 meV, where Wand Ware the palladium and graphene work functions, respectively, and Ac is a correction coefficient due to the correlations, the observed differences in Rcan be better understood. For double-contacted graphene devices according to an exemplary aspects of the present invention (e.g., transistor ), this model (e.g., for gate capacitance C=\u2208\/d (where \u2208is the electric constant, and d is the thickness of the dielectric layer (e.g., graphene layer), and gate voltage V=0) predicts a 23% lower doping level than that in the top-contacted device (e.g., transistor ).","Taking into account that an increase in graphene-metal coupling by a factor of two (2) would translate to a \u221a2 reduction in contact resistance Rin a diffusive contact, one would expect a contact resistance of 460\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm in double-contacted devices. This is 40% greater than the measured resistance of 320\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm. This remaining difference may be attributed to a greater metal-induced doping in double-contacted graphene than in the one-sided contact geometries (e.g., top-contact only geometry, and bottom-contact only geometry) owing to the increased coverage of the metal on the graphene (e.g., see , where the graphene layer  is contacted by the first plural contacts , and the second plural contacts , ).","In the case where bilayer exfoliated graphene is used in the device (e.g., device ) according to an exemplary aspect of the present invention, the reduction of contact resistance Rby approximately a factor of two (2) is expected in electrically decoupled layers (e.g., misoriented layers) since carrier injection takes place for each layer independently. However, analysis of an AB stacked bilayer graphene is more complicated than analysis single-layer graphene due to the uncertainty in the ratio of transfer length and an electrical coupling between the layers of the bilayer graphene, which determines an overall contact resistance Rreduction in the range of \u221a2 to 2.","Ultimately, the double-contacted bilayer graphene creates a carrier transport scenario that warrants its own complete study of transport physics.","In conclusion, the inventors have demonstrated that a double-contact geometry (e.g., a metal contact below the graphene layer, and a metal contact above the graphene layer at the source and drain in a graphene FET) may provide improved performance compared to conventional devices which have only top contacts. The results of experiments conducted by the inventors (e.g., testing of dozens of double-contacted and top-contacted four-probe structures) show a consistent reduction of contact resistance Rbetween the contacts and the graphene layer, and an improvement of transconductance in the device according to the exemplary aspects of the present invention, as compared to conventional device. On average, in the tests conducted by the inventors, contact resistance Rdropped from 525\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm to 320\u03a9\u00b7\u03bcm where the graphene layer (e.g., graphene layer  in ) was single-layer graphene. The inventors attribute the observed improvement in contact resistance Rto both an enhancement of the effective graphene-metal coupling and a higher graphene doping in the presence of the second metal layer.","With its unique and novel features, the present invention may provide a semiconductor device including a graphene layer having a reduced contact resistance Rand an improved transconductance as compared to conventional devices.","While the invention has been described in terms of one or more embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
