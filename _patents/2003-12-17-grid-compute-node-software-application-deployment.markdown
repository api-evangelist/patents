{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates to grid application deployment.","In today's data centers, the clusters of servers in a client-server network that run business applications often do a poor job of managing unpredictable workloads. One server may sit idle, while another is constrained. This leads to a \u201cCatch-22\u201d where companies, needing to avoid network bottlenecks and safeguard connectivity with customers, business partners and employees, often plan for the highest spikes in workload demand, then watch as those surplus servers operate well under capacity most of the time.","In grid computing, all of the disparate computers and systems in an organization or among organizations become one large, integrated computing system. Grid computing is a form of distributed system wherein computing resources are shared across networks. Grid computing enables the selection, aggregation, and sharing of information resources resident in multiple administrative domains and across geographic areas.","Typically, grid computing includes a set of software services that allocate computer resources to different applications. These software services usually run on a software layer of computer systems and cannot modify certain lower level features of the computer systems such as operating systems. Modifying these features can require rebooting the computer systems.","In one aspect, the invention features a method including, in a grid network, determining available compute devices for installation and execution of an application, the application requiring a specific operating system.

In a grid network, determine available compute devices for installation and execution of the application, the application requiring a specific operating system platform. In response to determining that there are no available compute devices having the specific operating system platform, send a request to install the specific operating system and a grid manager through a link to a management system. Install the specific operating system on one of a plurality of compute devices controlled by the management system. Link the one of a plurality of compute devices controlled by the management system to the grid network.","In embodiments, the computer program product is being operable to further cause a data processing apparatus to execute the application in the one of a plurality of compute devices controlled by the management system. The plurality of compute devices controlled by the management system are blade servers and the management system is a blade management system. The product is further operable to cause the data processing apparatus to use an application programming interface (API) to send the request. The product is further operable to cause the data processing apparatus to install a grid manager.","In another aspect, the invention features a system that includes a client system residing in a grid network of interconnected grid compute devices, means for receiving a request in the client system to deploy and execute an application, the application requiring a specific operating system, the specific operating system unavailable in the interconnected grid compute devices, means for sending a request to install the specific operating system and a grid manager through a link to a management system.

The system further includes means for executing the application in the one of a plurality of compute devices controlled by the management system. The means for sending use an application programming interface (API). The plurality of compute devices controlled by the management system are blade servers and the management system is a blade management system.","Embodiments of the invention may have one or more of the following advantages. Requirements for a software application to run in a grid environment, such as a particular operating system, can be satisfied by dynamically configuring resources of the grid environment.","The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","As shown in , grid managers , , , ,  in a grid computing environment  manage computational resources for one or more applications . The grid computing environment  includes a set of distributed computing resources that can individually be requested by the applications  to perform computing or data retrieval tasks for the applications . The grid managers , , , ,  can be arranged in a hierarchical, linear, or some other form of architecture to coordinate handling requests by the applications . The computational resources include computer devices , , , , , . The grid managers , , , ,  are resident in the computer devices , , , , , respectively. The computer devices , , , ,  communicate using a network . The network  can be a local area network (LAN) or a larger group of interconnected systems such as the Internet. In other cases, the computer devices , , , ,  are single board computers and the network  is a data bus. The grid managers , , , ,  facilitate installation and deinstallation of transient software components of applications  on the computer devices , , , , and . The grid managers , , , ,  also manage the software components while they are present on the computer devices , , , , , , respectively. In the grid computing environment , the software components , , ,  are installed on the computer devices , , , and , respectively, and managed by the grid managers , , , , respectively.","Grid computing environment  also includes a computer device  that is managed by computer management system . The computer manager system  can install an operating system on the computer device  by writing an operating system to a boot device for the computer device  and rebooting the computer device . The computer device  can communicate with the computer devices , , , , and  through the computer management system  using the network . Computer device  can be a blade server and the computer management system  can be a blade management system. A blade server is a thin, modular electronic circuit board, containing one, two, or more microprocessors and memory, that can be easily inserted into a space-saving rack with many similar servers that are managed by a blade management system. Blade servers, which share a common high-speed bus, are designed to generate less heat and thus save energy costs as well as space. A blade server is sometimes referred to as a high-density server and is typically used in a clustering of servers.","As shown in , an application start process  provides application  with the necessary resources allocated in the grid computing environment  before executing on one or more computer devices (e.g., , , , , ).","The process  includes the application  sending () requirements for computational resources to query one or more grid managers (e.g., ) to determine if there are resources matching these requirements available in the grid computing environment . These requirements specify information pertaining to resources in a computer device such as required number of processors, required percentage of utilization for those processors, main memory, operating system, and network speed. The process  includes the one or more grid managers receiving () the requirements.","To respond to the query for available resources from the application , the process  includes the one or more grid managers matching () the requirements against resources known to the one or more grid managers. These resources can include resources (e.g., a processor) in computer device  that are directly managed by any single grid manager (e.g., ).","If process  determines () that there is at least one resource meeting the application requirements (e.g., a processor on computer device ), then a grid manager (e.g., ) installs and starts () a software component (e.g., ) on the resource. If the process  determines that there is not at least one resource meeting the application requirements, the process  determines () if an available resource can be configured to meet the requirements. If an available resource can be configured to meet the requirements, then the process  configures () the resource.","In some cases, the requirements are for a resource to run a particular operating system. For example, the resource requirements can include a resource running the Windows operating system. However, computer devices , , , ,  run a version of the UNIX operating system, for example. Installing a particular operating system typically requires installation and rebooting of a computational device. Rebooting a computational device can be done if the computer device (e.g., ) is managed by a computer management system (e.g., ).","Computer device  is available as a resource for the grid computing environment . The grid manager  can utilize an application programmer's interface (API)  that is configured to issue commands to the computer management system . The grid manager  uses the API  to request that the computer manager system  install the required operating system with grid manager software on the computer device . The grid manager  also requests that the computer device  reboot (). Upon initialization, the computer device  runs the required operating system and a grid manager . Subsequently, the grid manager  can install a new software component  on the computer device , the computer device  having the required operating system. The grid manager  then can start () the new software component  on the computer device .","The installation of the required operating system can be done using disk imaging. In disk imaging, an image in the form of a file is taken of a disk containing the required operating system with the grid manager software. Another installation technique includes Automated Deployment Services\u00ae (ADS) from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. ADS supports the automatic and simultaneous installation of Windows operating system images to multiple servers that have no operating system installed.","The management system  receives the file with the disk image and writes the contents of the file into a disk drive that is readable by the computer device . The disk drive can reside with the computer device  or be a network attached storage (NAS) system on the same network as the computer device . Upon booting up, the computer device  reads the file in the disk drive and executes the instructions of the required operating system. The operating system image includes grid manager software with information that is required to enable the grid manager  to be part of the grid computing environment .","As shown in , one example of the grid computing environment  is a grid computing environment  having a hierarchical grid management architecture. In the grid computing environment , grid managers , , , ,  are organized according to this hierarchical grid management architecture. Within the grid computing environment , pairs of grid managers can have directional relations that classify one grid manager as superior (or inferior) to another grid manager. A grid manager can have more than one superior (or inferior) relations with other grid managers. For example, grid manager  has a superior relation with grid managers  and . A grid manager can also have more than one inferior relations with other grid managers. For example, through these hierarchical relations, the application  does not need access to a list of the computer devices , , , , ,  in network  to use the computational resources in the grid computing environment . The application  only needs to have access to a network address of one computer device running a grid manager (e.g., computer device  running grid manager ) and the grid manager  uses its relations with other grid managers running on other computer devices to provide the application  with access to other computer devices in the grid computing environment .","A grid manager (e.g., , , , , ) maintains a first list of all superior relations with other grid managers and a second list of all inferior relations with other grid managers. These lists are maintained in a properties file for each grid manager. Each grid manager maintains an \u201calways open\u201d communications channel to all the grid managers in these lists over network  using, for example, interfaces on transmission control protocol (TCP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), and simple object access protocol (SOAP). These communication channels are opened when the grid managers , , , ,  are asynchronously started up on computer devices , , , , , respectively.","As shown in , an application start process  provides application  with the necessary resources allocated in the grid computing environment  before executing on one or more computer devices (e.g., , , , , ).","The process  includes the application  sending () requirements for computational resources to query a grid manager (e.g., ) to determine if there are resources matching these requirements available in the grid computing environment . These requirements specify information pertaining to resources in a computer device such as required number of processors, required percentage of utilization for those processors, main memory, operating system, and network speed. The query can also include information to which hierarchy level (in the grid computing environment ) the query should be propagated. The process  includes the grid manager  receiving () the requirements.","To respond to the query for available resources from the application , the grid manager  matches () the requirements against resources known to the grid manager . These resources include resources (e.g., a processor) in computer device  that are directly managed by grid manager . Resources directly managed by the grid manager  that are currently available and meet the requirements are added to a resource-query list maintained by the grid manager .","Grid manager  also sends the query to grid managers  and  having inferior relations with grid manager . The process  includes grid managers  and  responding () to the query by sending to grid manager  lists of resources (e.g., processors on computer devices , ) that meet the requested requirements and are available and known to grid managers  and , respectively. These resource-query lists of resources that are known to grid managers ,  can also include resources managed by grid managers (not shown) with inferior relations to grid managers  and . The grid manager  adds these resource-query lists of available resources from grid managers  and  to its resource-query list of available resources meeting the requested requirements. If the process  determines () that there is at least one resource meeting the application requirements (e.g., a processor on computer device ) in this resource-query list, then grid manager  sends () this resource-query list to the application . Otherwise, if the process  determines () that grid manager  has an inferior relation with a grid manager (e.g., grid manager ), grid manager  sends () the query for available resources to grid manager . In response to this query, grid manager  does not send a redundant query back to grid manager  having an inferior relation with grid manager .","Process  includes grid manager  sending () the list of available resources along with addresses of their corresponding grid managers in the network  that match the requirements. The application  selects a resource (e.g., a processor on computer device ) from the list and requests () a reservation of the resource on computer device  to the grid manager  managing the resource on computer device . If the resource in computer device  is still available for reservation () and the reservation succeeds, grid manager  sends () a reservation number to the application . This reservation means that the application  is guaranteed and allocated the requested resource on the computer device  in the grid computing environment . The grid manager  handles queries for available resources from applications using independent processing threads of execution. Thus, the grid manager  uses a semaphore to ensure that the same resource (e.g., the processor on the computer device ) is not assigned multiple reservation numbers for different applications simultaneously requesting the same resource.","If the grid manager  determines that the requested resource in computer device  is not available for reservation and the reservation fails, the application  selects the next available resource in the list and requests () the reservation of this next available resource. If the application receives a registration number and a timeout measured from the sending of the registration number does not expire (), the application  starts () the software component  on a processor resource in the computer device . Starting the software component  is initiated by the application  passing the reservation number and an application file to the grid manager  and then the grid manager  reads the application file to install and execute the software component  on the computer device .","If the process  determines () that the grid manager (e.g., ) has no inferior relation with a grid manager, the process  determines () if an available resource can be configured to meet the requirements. If an available resource can be configured to meet the requirements, then the process  configures () the resource as previously described in process .","If the application  requesting the use of resources in the grid computing environment  requires one or more computational resources running a particular operating system and computer device  is available as a resource for the grid computing environment , the grid manager  uses the API  to install the particular operating system with grid manager software on the computer device  and command the computer device  to re-boot. Upon initialization, the computer device  runs a grid manager  with an inferior relation to the grid manager . Subsequently, the grid manager  matches () the requirements against known resources by sending the requirements for computational resources with the particular operating system to the grid manager  and the grid manager  responds () to the query by sending a list that includes a processor on the computer device . Subsequently, the grid manager  installs a software component  on the computer device , the computer device  having the required operating system.","The computer management system  receives the file with the disk image and writes the contents of the file into a hard drive associated with the computer device  or a networked disk drive or network attached storage (NAS) as described previously for grid computing environment . Upon starting up, the computer device  reads the file and executes the instructions of the required operating system. The operating system image includes grid manager software with a properties file  (described above) containing a list of grid managers having a superior relation to the grid manager  on computer device . This list includes grid manager .","As shown in , a process  initializes relations among grid managers in the grid computing environment . The process  is also used to initialize relations between the newly started grid manager  and other grid managers. The grid manager (e.g., ) starts up on computer device  by reading () a properties file (e.g., ). The properties file contains a list of addresses of computer devices with grid managers having superior relations to the grid manager. This list was described earlier as a first list of all superior relations with other grid managers. If the process  determines () that a superior grid manager (e.g., ) is specified in this list of addresses, the grid manager  requests () to open a communication channel to the superior grid manager (e.g., ). Process  includes the grid manager  detecting () any requests for communication channels from grid managers  that are identified as having inferior relations with the grid manager . If the process  determines () that there are some requests, the grid manager  allows communication channels from the inferior grid manager . The process  includes the grid manager  checking () if there are any pending requests for communication to grid managers  having superior relations. If there are any pending requests, the grid manager  requests () communication channels to these grid managers (e.g., ). These communication channels are used for resource queries between grid managers (e.g., the process ) as well as \u201cheart beat\u201d messages between grid managers to ensure that each grid manager in the grid computing environment  is functioning.","Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
