title: Electronic document provision to an online meeting
abstract: A system and method are presented for providing electronic documents to online meeting participants. The method schedules a first online meeting between network-connected computer devices. A meeting server establishes a repository for the first online meeting. The meeting server receives an electronically formatted document sent to a first communication address assigned to the first online meeting repository, and stores the document in the first online meeting repository. A first computer device is able to log into the meeting server and access the document from the first online meeting repository at a time prior to, during, or after the first online meeting. Likewise, the meeting server is able to store a document received prior to, during, or after the meeting.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Functional Description"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to online and web conferencing meetings and, more particularly, to a means of requesting content in a live meeting from a non-meeting participant and sharing a document for presentation in the online meeting.","2. Description of the Related Art","Generally, the problem being addressed is the sharing of an electronic document in an online meeting (e.g., web conference), when the user has neither an application to share the document via an application sharing mode, or a web interface to upload the document for sharing (e.g., web enabled phone or multifunctional peripheral (MFP) scan-to-email). There are a number of well-known online meeting services that fail to adequately address this problem. These meeting services include: Cisco WebEx, Citrix GotoMeeting, Microsoft LiveMeeting, Adobe Connect, IBM Lotus Sametime, and DimDim.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"This method does not provide a solution for importing a document into an existing scheduled meeting, and does not provide a solution for importing a document into a live meeting, by either a non-participant or from a source that is not logged into the meeting service. The collaboration session is not a live simultaneous meeting. Instead, the document is stored as a shared document at an online document repository for collaboration by multiple users.","Another method for email based collaboration is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,080, System, method and computer program product for storage of a plurality of documents within a single file. In this method, a file container is constructed of a plurality of files for collaboration. An email list of collaborators is constructed, and the file container and email address list are sent to a collaboration server. The collaboration server constructs a first email message addressed to the first recipient. The message includes the file container and the recipient list minus the first recipient.","The first recipient, after receiving the email message, opens the message and edits the files in the file container. Upon completion (i.e., close message, or reply to collaboration server), the collaboration server constructs a second email message addressed to the next recipient in the recipient list. The message includes the edited file container and the recipient list minus the current recipient. The process is repeated until there are no recipients left.","This method does not provide a solution for importing a document into an existing scheduled meeting, and does not provide a solution for importing a document into a live meeting by either a non-participant or from a source that is not logged into the meeting service. The collaboration session disclosed is not a live meeting. Instead, it's an offline coordinated round-robin editing of a document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In another variation of email print, the printer supports a plurality of email addresses, where each email address is associated with a different print option. For example, booklet@myprinter.com and duplex@myprinter.com may tell the printer to print in booklet or duplex mode, respectively. These methods do not disclose a means of where to route a document in an email message, or a means for importing a document into a scheduled or live meeting.","Another method related to document collaboration via email, is scanning a document into a workflow, where the scanned document image is sent to the workflow via email. In this case, an email address is associated with a document workflow. The user scans a document on a scanner which supports sending the scanned image data via email. The user specifies the email address of the workflow as the destination for the scanned document image.","This method is limited to routing to a predetermined fixed source (i.e., named workflow). It does not disclose a means to use information in the email to find a matching source that is temporary in nature (e.g., a scheduled or live meeting). Neither does it disclose a means for importing a document into a scheduled or live meeting.","Thus, the conventional online meeting services require Internet connectivity, regardless of solution, for sharing a document in an online meeting. That is, a participating device must have web access to the Internet. However, the Internet may not be available if the device is a mobile device lacking Internet capability, or the meeting is based on an Internet service not enabled on the mobile device. Further, there may be a lack of WiFi connectivity at the user's current location, or the network transfer may be limited to email\/ftp (MFP Network Scan).","Thus, a solution is required for devices with some form of WAN\/LAN connectivity, but lacking Internet connectivity and\/or web browser access.","A closely related issue is the problem of obtaining content after a meeting has started (live) from a user\/owner that is not actively participating in the meeting. For example, a company may be having an online meeting whose participation is restricted to senior management. During the meeting, there is a need to obtain hiring data from the HR department. The participants in the meeting would therefore desire a simple way to request the HR department directly import the content into the meeting, without being a participant in the meeting.","While conventional online meeting services provide methods for the host to import content into a live meeting, they all have limitations in importing from non-host attendees, and provide no means for importing content from non-participants.","The Cisco WebEx meeting service allows a host to import content into a live meeting thought a variety of means. Presentations can be directly uploaded. For a limited number of formats (e.g., PDF or PowerPoint), the host or attendee can upload a document to the service. The service converts the document to the WebEx presentation format, which may then be rendered for display by the service. A host or attendee may also import a document from their PC by printing it to a WebEx file uploading virtual printer. This virtual printer converts the document on the host's PC to a presentation format and uploads it to the meeting service. Alternately, a host can preload a document of a limited number of formats, which will be automatically launched and optionally time presented when the meeting starts. Finally, the host and attendees may make online notes during the meeting.","The Citrix GotoMeeting does not support importing content, or online notes.","The Microsoft Live Meeting service allows a host to import content into a live meeting thought a variety of means. Direct upload for presentation\u2014for a limited number of formats (PDF or MS-Office formats), the host or attendee can upload a document to the service. The service converts the document to the Live Meeting presentation format, which may then be rendered for display by the service. Print to Share\u2014a host or attendee may import a document from their PC by printing it to a Live Meeting file uploading virtual printer. This virtual printer converts the document on the host's PC to a presentation format and uploads it to the meeting service. The host may make online notes during the meeting. The Microsoft Live Meeting service does not support preloading content.","The DimDim meeting service allows a host to import content into a live meeting thought a variety of means. Direct upload for presentation\u2014for a limited number of formats (PDF or PowerPoint), the host or attendee can upload a document to the service. The service converts the document to the WebEx presentation format, which may then be rendered for display by the service. The DimDim meeting service does not support preloading content or online notes.","The Adobe Connect meeting service allows a host to import content into a live meeting thought a variety of means. Direct upload for presentation\u2014for a limited number of formats (e.g., PDF, PowerPoint, Flash), the host or attendee can upload a document to the service. The host may make online notes during the meeting.","None of the aforementioned solutions did provide a means to request and import content during (or before) a live meeting from a non-participant.","It would be advantageous if a predetermined or impromptu request can be made in a live meeting to a non-meeting participant for the importation of content, such as: documents, status\/summaries and responses.","It would be advantageous to integrate the imported content with the meeting content, and categorize the content based on the reason for the request (e.g., action items).","It would be further be advantageous if the request and importation occur asynchronous to the meeting, such that the content can be received and imported between periods of the live meeting, when the meeting is a continuous or otherwise recurring meeting.","Disclosed herein are a system and method that expands online meeting document sharing for non-Internet browsing capable devices, such as 1G mobile phones or multifunctional peripherals (MFPs), or where Internet access to the online meeting is blocked by a firewall, who otherwise have email connectivity. In a conventional operating environment, an online meeting is scheduled with a meeting service. The online meeting service may be enterprise hosted or hosted by a third party service. When the meeting is scheduled (or thereafter), one or more attendees are requested. Each attendee has an email address associated with them. A meeting request is then sent to the email address of each attendee. Each attendee receives the email message via an email client running on a computing device, such as a PC, laptop or mobile device. The computing device from which the user operates the email client can additionally store or access documents, and send documents as attachments via email.","When scheduling a meeting, the user performs typical tasks with scheduling an Outlook meeting, including: 1) setting time and location, 2) inviting attendees, 3) selecting a room resource, and 4) sending invites to the attendees. The user may also preload content for presentation in the meeting as part of the scheduling task.","The system disclosed herein additionally permits a user to email a document into a \u201clive\u201d, scheduled, or completed multi-user\/multi-site online meeting for presentation and collaboration. The user does this by sending the document as an email attachment, to an email address associated with the live, scheduled, or completed online meeting. Upon receipt of the document, the online meeting service may: convert the document to a presentation format; store the document in a meeting repository; send the document to one or more meeting attendees; or, present the document for application sharing (either at the service or remote PC).","In one aspect, the user sends the document to a \u201ctemporary\u201d email address associated with the online meeting. For example, when the meeting is scheduled, the service assigns the meeting a meeting PIN to uniquely identify the meeting. In another embodiment, the user sends the document to a predefined email address associated with the meeting service, and identifies the meeting within the email, such as in the subject or body. In another aspect, the user sends the email attachment by replying back to the email invite message sent by the meeting service. The original email message sent by the service has coded in it a meeting identifier which the meeting service can parse out when the message is sent back as a reply.","In one aspect, a meeting host, presenter or other meeting participant with the authority makes a request for content from a non-meeting participant. For example, the participant selects a menu button from the online meeting UI (e.g., desktop or browser application) to select or enter a non-meeting participant. In one case, the user can browse and select from a predetermined list of non-meeting participants. Alternately, the participant may enter the electronic contact address (e.g., email or IM) of the non-meeting participant. Once the non-meeting participants have been selected, the participant enters additional information on what content is being requested. The online meeting service then constructs an electronic message to each selected non-meeting participant for the requested content and sends the message to each non-meeting participant's electronic contact address. The request for content may occur: prior to a meeting (content is stored in a pre-meeting repository); during a meeting (content is stored in a launch area; or, after the meeting (content is added to available meeting documents). The content request may also be specific to a category or activity within the meeting, and the content requesting email would be further augmented to indicate the category.","Accordingly, a method is presented for providing electronic documents to online meeting participants. The method schedules a first online meeting between network-connected computer devices. A meeting server establishes a repository for the first online meeting. The meeting server receives an electronically formatted document sent to a first communication address assigned to the first online meeting repository, and stores the document in the first online meeting repository. A first computer device is able to log into the meeting server and access the document from the first online meeting repository at a time prior to, during, or after the first online meeting. Likewise, the meeting server is able to store a document received prior to, during, or after the meeting.","Additional details of the above-described method and an electronic document provision system for online meetings are provided below.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d and the like are intended to refer to an automated computing system entity, such as hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, software stored on a computer-readable medium, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","304","302","308"]},"The meeting server  may be enabled with an application (e.g., a meeting service) including a sequence of software instructions stored in a computer-readable memory and executed by a processor. Since the manipulation of software instructions is well known in the art, these details are not shown in order to simply the figure. The meeting service is typically an online (Internet) or server-based (Intranet) meeting service hosted. Generally, under both scenarios, the meeting server has a web service interface and the meeting scheduler interacts with the meeting server via the web service interface. In other web-based programming models, the meeting server would implement a REST based API interface, and the meeting scheduler would interact using the REST based API interface.","The meeting server and computer devices discussed below may employ a computer system with a bus or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor coupled to the bus for processing information. The computer system may also includes a main memory, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to the bus for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor. These memories may also be referred to as a computer-readable medium. The execution of the sequences of instructions contained in a computer-readable medium may cause a processor to perform some of the steps associated with position calculation. Alternately, these functions, or some of these functions may be performed in hardware. The practical implementation of such a computer system would be well known to one with skill in the art.","As used herein, the term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks. Volatile media includes dynamic memory. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","The meeting server  may temporarily assign the first communication address, exclusively associated with the first online meeting. For example, the meeting server may assign the address first_online_meeting@meeting_server.com for a two-week prior to the actual meeting, and let the address expire two weeks after the meeting. Alternately, the meeting server may establish a permanent first communication address associated with a plurality of online meetings (e.g., meetings@meeting_server.com), and assign an identifier to the first online meeting. The identifier can be a meeting PIN, the Internet. Protocol (IP) address of a computer device participating in the first online meeting, a meeting title, a name designated as the first online meeting host, or a URL associated with the first online meeting, to name a few examples.","The meeting server stores the document in the first online meeting repository . A network-connected first computer device  is able to log into the meeting server  and access the document  from the first online meeting repository  at a time prior to, during, or after the first online meeting. Although the first online meeting is depicted as an entity separate from the network , it should be understood that such a meeting would typically be enabled using WAN and\/or LAN connections between participants. An online meeting is also enabled as a sequence of software instructions stored in a computer readable memory and executed by a processor in at least one of the meeting participant computer devices.","In one aspect, the first computer device  accesses the document  while participating in the first online meeting, and presents the document into the first online meeting. Alternately, any of the other meeting participants, such as the second computer device  or the third computer device , are able to access the document  and present it. The computer devices may be a device with Internet access capabilities, such as PCs, mobile phones, or personal digital assistants (PDAs), to name a few possible examples.","In another aspect, the second computer  receives an invitation to the first online meeting with the first communication address coded into the invitation, and sends the document  to the first communication address when accepting the invitation. By \u201ccoded\u201d it is meant that the user of the second computer device  may not be able to see the address in the presentation of the request, but the second computer device is able to detect the embedded address, with instructions to send the document to the address.","In one aspect, a fourth computer device , not participating in the first online meeting receives a document request from the first computer device , and sends the document to the first communication address. Again, the document request can be received with the first communication address coded into the request. For example, the fourth computer device  may be a 1G mobile phone or printer (MFP), or a device whose Internet access to the meeting is blocked by a firewall.","In another aspect, the meeting server  establishes a plurality of categories associated with the first online meeting, and subsequent to receiving the document, associates the document with one of the first online meeting categories. Example categories and exemplary categorization methods are presented in detail below.","The meeting server  may also accept a recurring first online meeting schedule comprising a first meeting segment and a second meeting segment, and receives the document  requested in response to a first meeting segment action item. In one aspect, the meeting server  schedules the second meeting segment, or sends a request to the meeting organizer to schedule the second meeting segment, in response to receiving the document .","In the exemplary operating environment, an online meeting is scheduled with a meeting service. The online meeting service may be enterprise hosted or hosted by a third party service. When the meeting is scheduled (or thereafter), one or more attendees are requested. Each attendee has an email address associated with them. A meeting request is then sent to the email address of each attendee. Each attendee receives the email message via an email client running on a computing device, such as a PC, laptop or mobile device. The computing device from which the user operates the email client can additionally store or access documents, and send documents as attachments via email.","The meeting request typically contains information on the meeting (title, agenda, time\/date), and a link to access the specific meeting. Note, the later is typically done as an URL hosted by the service, whereby the URL additionally identifies the meeting via a unique meeting PIN and identifies the user by a unique user PIN. Below is an example:","http:\/\/www.meetingsareus.com\/meeting.php?meeting=75647&user=78334","Each attendee receives the email message via an email client (e.g., MS Outlook) running on a computing device, such as a PC, laptop, or mobile device.","Using the system of , a document can be emailed into a \u201clive\u201d or scheduled multi-user\/multi-site online meeting for presentation and collaboration. The user does this by sending the document as an email attachment, to an email address associated with the live or scheduled online meeting. Upon receipt of the document, the online meeting service may: convert the document to a presentation format, store the document in a meeting repository, send the document to one or more meeting attendees, or present the document for application sharing (either at the service or remote PC).","In one aspect, the user sends the document to a \u201ctemporary\u201d email address associated with the online meeting. For example, when the meeting is scheduled, the service assigns the meeting a meeting PIN to uniquely identify the meeting. The service would then create an email account for this meeting PIN, such as:","<meeting_pin>@meetingservice.com.","In another aspect, the user sends the document to a predefined email address associated with the meeting service, and identifies the meeting within the email, such as in the subject or body. The meeting may be identified through a variety of means, such as a meeting PIN, the IP address of the presenter, meeting title, or meeting host.","In another aspect, the user sends the email attachment by replying back to the email invite message sent by the meeting service. The original email message sent by the service has coded in it a meeting identifier which the meeting service can parse out when the message is sent back as a reply. The system of  provides a means to share a document from a device that has limited capability, such as one that does not have web browser capabilities, but has email capability, or one that does not have access to the Internet, but does have email access. The system also provides a means to share a document transmitted from a peripheral device which does not have Internet capability, but has email capability (e.g., MFP). The system provides a means to preload documents to share in a scheduled meeting using a third party calendar program.","In another exemplary operating environment, an online meeting is scheduled with a meeting service. The online meeting service may be enterprise hosted or hosted by a third party service. When scheduling a meeting, the user performs typical tasks with scheduling an Outlook meeting, including: 1) setting time and location, 2) inviting attendees, 3) selecting a room resource, and 4) sending invites to the attendees. The user may also preload content for presentation in the meeting as part of the scheduling task.","Each invited attendee has an email address associated with them. A meeting request is then sent to the email address of each attendee. Each attendee receives the email message via an email client running on a computing device, such as a PC, laptop or mobile device. The computing device from which the user operates the email client can additionally store or access documents, and send documents as attachments via email.","The host starts the online meeting at the scheduled time. Once started, the attendee's join the meeting. Typically, the email invite to the attendee's contains an URL, which when clicked, automatically joins them to the meeting. Other methods of sending invites to the attendees could include: IM and SMS (e.g., mobile testing).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},"Alternately, the participant may enter the electronic contact address (e.g., email or IM) of the non-meeting participant. Once the non-meeting participants have been selected, the participant enters additional information on what content is being requested. The online meeting service then constructs an electronic message to each selected non-meeting participant for the requested content and sends the message to each non-meeting participant's electronic contact address.","When the non-meeting participant is ready to send the requested content to the meeting, the non-meeting participant responds to the email message and adds the content as an attachment(s). The original email request may contain an embedded identifier in the message which uniquely identifies the online meeting for which the request is made for. Upon receipt of the response, the online meeting service parses the response and extracts the content (from attachments) and the unique meeting ID (e.g., from subject or body). The content is then added to the online meeting associated with the unique meeting ID.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"In another aspect, the content request may be specific to a category or activity within the meeting. For example, the request might be specific to: summary information; status; or, statements. In this case, the content requesting email would be further augmented to indicate the category. For example, the embedded meeting ID may be appended with a textual string indicating the category associated with the content request. In another example, each content requesting email has a unique identifier which is stored in a database, along with a set of actions associated with the content request.","Upon receipt of a response to a content request, the meeting service determines both the specific meeting and specific category from the embedded identifier. The content is then routed to the identified meeting, and processed according to the category type. For example, a status category may cause the content to be added to a spreadsheet showing the status of particular staff on a project.","In another aspect, the meeting is part of a series or otherwise recurring meeting. Information from one meeting segment may be carried forward to the next or otherwise subsequent meeting segment. In preparation for the next or otherwise subsequent meeting, a request may be made for content that will be reviewed or otherwise processed during this next\/subsequent meeting. In one example, the content request is part of a cross-meeting action item list. In this example, when a meeting segment ends, the meeting participants construct an action item list of actions that need\/should occur before the next\/subsequent meeting segment. In this case, the embedded identifier in the email content request would identify the action item as well as the associated meeting. When a response is received to the content request, the content is added to the specific action item and the action item status is updated. The host or meeting organizer can then query or be informed on the completion status of the action item list prior to the next\/subsequent meeting segment. An intelligent rescheduling process may also alter the time of the next\/subsequent meeting segment based on the completion status of the action item list and attendee availability.","Thus, the system provides a means to request content during (before\/after) an online meeting from non-meeting participants. The request and response for content is asynchronous to the meeting, and does not pause or otherwise disrupt the flow of the meeting. An action item list may span across continuous meetings, where individuals (both meeting and non-meeting participants) can update between meeting segments.","As noted above, a user can email one or more documents into a \u201clive\u201d, scheduled, or completed multi-user\/multi-site online meeting for presentation and collaboration. The user does this by sending the document(s) as an email attachment, to an email address associated with the \u201clive\u201d, scheduled; or completed online meeting. The documents may be of any format which is compatible with the online meeting service. For example, the format may be one that can be imported and presented by the meeting service (e.g., MS PowerPoint and Adobe PDF formats are importable into WebEx and DimDim). The format may be one that can be loaded into a view\/edit application hosted by a designated presenter, and the application view can be shared with the attendee (e.g. Application Sharing in WebEx). The format can be that is able to distributed and loaded by each attendee into a distributed application; whereby the document presentation\/editing can be synchronized across the plural attendees by the distributed application.","Upon receipt of the document, the online meeting service may convert the document to a presentation format. For example, the document can be converted from an offline format (e.g., MS PowerPoint) into an online presentation format (e.g., Adobe Flash format) using a direct conversion process (e.g., WebEx importation of MS PowerPoint). The document can be converted from an offline format (e.g., MS Word) to a web publishing format (e.g., HTML) using a print application and associated printer driver. The document can be stored in an online document repository associated with the specific meeting (e.g., Google Docs).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"Any means may be used by the presenter\/attendee and online meeting service to determine from the email message the specific meeting into which the documents are to be loaded.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"http:\/\/www.meetingservice.com\/yourmeeting123;","or a unique meeting ID added as an URL argument:","http:\/\/www.meetingservice.com\/meetings.php?id=1234.","The identifier may be embedded in the message subject. For example:","Subject: Your invited to an online meeting\u2014ID 1234.","The identifier may be constructed as an email address. In this case, the meeting service creates a temporary unique email address specific to the meeting. Typically, the temporary email address is valid until the end of the meeting and possibly some predetermined duration afterwards, such as for retrieving summary or history information on the meeting. In some cases, the validity of the temporary email address may be extended past a first predetermined duration, such as by an authorized request or additional payment. For example, the email address may be:","Meeting1234@meetingservice.com.","In another method, the user constructs a new email message to send to the online meeting service. The user attaches the documents to share to the email message. The user then sends the email message with the document attachments to the online meeting service. The method may use any means for the user to identify the specific meeting to load the documents into and for the meeting service to recognize the meeting specific identifier in the user's email message.","In another aspect, the user specifies the meeting identifier as part of the subject line. The meeting identifier may be a meeting PIN assigned to the meeting, which may have been obtained from the email invite message or other scheduled meeting notification (e.g., online). The meeting identifier may be unique identifier assigned to the meeting's host, such as a meeting service social name, a communication address unique to the meeting's host (e.g. IP address), or the title of the meeting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Another feature of the system is that the meeting service receives the email message with the documents to share as an attachment. The meeting service may receive the email messages by any means, such as those means described above.","In one aspect, the meeting service has an email client that reads email messages from an email server (e.g., Microsoft Exchange Server) associated with the email client (e.g., POP3 client). The meeting service's email client automatically reads messages sent to the email addresses associated with the meeting service. For example, the email client polls the email server for new messages on a periodic basis (e.g., every 30 seconds).","When the email client reads a new email message, the email client parses the message to determine the unique meeting ID (such as specified in the above methods). If the meeting ID cannot be identified, the email client passes the email message to an error handler or to another meeting service related workflow. If the meeting ID is identified, the email client determines if the email message is valid for the service. This validation may include verifying that the meeting ID is associated with a valid meeting, or determining that the email sender is authorized to send a document to the meeting. Otherwise, verification determines if the meeting ID has been sent from an email address associated with the host or an attendee, or otherwise an authorized user of the meeting account. Or, a meeting-specific password can be parsed and verified.","If the request is validated, the meeting service then extracts the attached documents. Each document may additionally be verified, to determine if: the document format is supported by service; the document size does not exceed some predetermine limit to the meeting or account holder for the meeting; or, the document content does not contain data not allowed by the meeting service (e.g., illegal content, spam, etc).","If the validation tests fail, the meeting service may additionally send an email reply back to the email message indicating that the document(s) were not accepted, and the reason for non-acceptance.","One example of parsing an email message can be demonstrated by using the open source code OpenPOP, which can be configured to be a POP3 email client. The POP3 email client can be initiated as a background thread and configured to connect to (POPClient.Connect( )) an email server (e.g., MS Exchange) associated with the email account of the meeting service, and log into the email account (POPclient.Authenticate( )). The POP3 email client can then periodically query the email server for new messages (n=POPClient.GetMessageCount( ), msg=POPClient.GetMessage(<n)). The POP3 email client can then obtain the subject, body and document attachments from the message (msg.Subject, msg.MessageBody, msg.Attachments). The corresponding data can then be parsed according to its data type (e.g., string) and examine for keywords or a predetermined structure (e.g., IP address format in subject line\u2014<nnn>.<nnn>.<nnn>).","One example of identifying a scheduled, completed, or live meeting from the extracted information can be demonstrated using an API interface between the email client and then meeting scheduler, and using the extracted information as parameters for a SQL database query, where meeting information for scheduled, completed, or live meetings are stored. For example, each meeting could have a row entry in an SQL database, with a unique identifier (such as a 128 bit GUID) as a primary key. The row may contain other non-primary key fields relating to the meeting which could be used to identify the meeting, such as the organizer name, meeting title, meeting time, meeting location, IP address of the host PC when the meeting is live.","The extracted information could then be one or more of the non-primary key values, which are then passed via an API call (GetMeetingGUID(field1-value, field2-value, . . . ) to the meeting scheduler. A single API call could handle a variety of different field combinations, either by function overloading (C++\/C#) or encoding the field with the field value:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0109"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Example of function overloading"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/"]},{"entry":[{},"String guid1 = GetMeetingGUID( title );"]},{"entry":[{},"String guid2 = GetMeetingGUID( title, organizer);"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/ Example of encoding field identification"]},{"entry":[{},"\/\/"]},{"entry":[{},"String guid1 = GetMeetingGUID( \u201cTitle = \u201c.Append( title ) );"]},{"entry":[{},"String guid2 = GetMeetingGUID( \u201cTitle = \u201c.Append( title ) . \u201c,"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Organizer = \u201c.Append( organizer) );"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The meeting scheduler can then use the field=value parameters to make an SQL query to return all the rows that match the criteria.

The information may be sent by any means, such as a Web Service call when the application is an offline desktop application, or an HTTP post when the application is an online application.","The online meeting service constructs and sends the request for content message to the identified non-meeting participant. The constructed message is addressed to the non-meeting participant's electronic communication address, with a textual description of the request. An embedded identifier uniquely identifies the meeting to which content is submitted. The message also gives an indication of whom (and optionally their role) is making the request.","When the non-meeting participant receives the request, they may send the requested content by including the content in a reply to the electronic message requesting the content, as described earlier. When the meeting service receives the replied message containing the content, the meeting service extracts from the message the content and the embedded meeting identifier, as described earlier. Once the content is extracted and the meeting identified, the meeting service provides the content to the specified \u2018live\u2019 meeting, such as: storing it in a content repository specific to the meeting, where it is immediately selectable for viewing\/editing; or, informing the participant of the content arrival and asking if participant would want to immediate view\/edit the content. Otherwise, a copy of the content may be sent to some or all meeting participants.","In another aspect, a meeting participant makes a request for content from a non-meeting participant after an online meeting has completed. The meeting participant, or other authorized individual, makes the request via a meeting scheduling application. The authorized individual may make the request in the same manner as described prior to a meeting, except that the user is selecting a completed meeting.","Once the user has completed submitting the information for the requested content, the meeting service constructs and sends an electronic message to the non-meeting participant requesting the content. The request may be made in the same manner as described in making a request prior to a meeting. When the non-meeting participant receives the request, they may send the requested content by including the content in a reply to the electronic message requesting the content, as described earlier.","When the meeting service receives the replied message containing the content, the meeting service extracts from the message the content and the embedded meeting identifier, as described earlier. Once the content is extracted and the meeting identified, the meeting service adds the content to the recorded or otherwise persistent archive for the meeting. In one case, the recorded archive contains a link to a post-meeting collection of documents. A user viewing the recorded archive has the option to select viewing content in the post-meeting collection. Typically, the post-meeting content is stored on a file-system, and generally grouped under a single directory folder. The database (or stored recording) contains a link to the directory folder containing the post-meeting content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"In an alternate aspect, a request for content may be further augmented as a request to a specific category or topic. For example, the request may be related to a specific topic on the agenda, or to a general category of information, such as the participant's status on the subject being discussed. In this case, the request is specific to a topic in the agenda. The meeting service allows the meeting organizer to include separate and distinguishable topic items to the agenda. For example, the scheduling process may involve an introductory statement, an item by item entry of topics to discus, or a conclusion\u2014goal of the meeting, or what's next.","In one example, the above-mentioned function is implemented as a web page. The web page may contain a form for inputting the above.
