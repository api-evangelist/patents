title: Crystalline relaxor-ferroelectric phase transition transducer
abstract: A piezoelectric transducer includes a single crystal piezoelectric material having a phase transition from one crystalline phase to a second crystalline phase at a predetermined stress level. A pre-stress is applied to the single crystal piezoelectric material so that the material is maintained near its phase transition point. An electrical field source is joined to the material such that, in cooperation with the pre-stress, an increase or decrease in the electrical field causes a crystalline phase transition in the single crystal piezoelectric material. Crystalline phase transition induces strain larger by an order of magnitude than that caused by the non-phase transition piezoelectric effect.

These materials can produce relatively large strain in a linear region, but in order to develop high strain they must be driven by a very high electric or magnetic field. There are several other classes of materials utilizing high strain associated with martensitic phase transition (namely, shape memory alloys). However, high strain in shape memory alloys (SMA) is thermally activated, and transduction devices based on these materials have frequency band limitations. For this reason, piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials are most often used in transducer applications.","The current most promising class of transducer materials are relaxor-ferroelectric piezoelectric single crystals. These materials are single crystals of piezoelectric materials (for example, lead zinc niobate-lead titanate, known hereinafter as PZN-PT). These materials have been shown to deliver extraordinarily high strain when an external electric field is applied as compared to conventional polycrystalline piezoceramic.","In some special compositions (for example ternary lead indium niobate-lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PIN-PMN-PT)), the material will undergo a phase transformation accompanied by a very sharp hysteretic strain and a dramatic change in stiffness when subjected to external stress. This phase transformation can be invoked repeatedly at variable rates to induce large strains in the single crystal element. Known compositions exhibiting this type of phase change behavior include (1\u2212x)PZN-xPT where 0.04<x<0.11. The composition where x was 0.06 has been tested at multiple temperatures and applied direct current (DC) bias fields. Under these conditions, it has been shown to exhibit a phase transformation.","It is known to combine single crystal piezoelectric materials with mechanical stress inducing means. This is typically performed in order to avoid putting the piezoelectric material in tensile stress because of the fragility of ceramic materials in tension. In a prior art mechanically induced stress application, the stress is calculated to be that which is optimal for insuring piezoelectric material life in the operating conditions of the application. These operating conditions can include varying environmental temperatures and pressures.","It is also known to include an electrically controllable stress element in combination with a piezoelectric single crystal material. This element can be either a piezoelectric (voltage driven) element or a magnetostrictive effect (MS) element. These hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer systems are known to work effectively in a linear region.","In both mechanical and electrical stress generation means, applications avoid utilizing stress near the phase transition stress level. This is because the piezoelectric material shows a non-linear response at this level that may be triggered by environmental temperature or pressure.","It is an object of the present invention to provide transducer that has a strain response to an electric field that is much greater than heretofore known.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a transducer utilizing a crystalline phase transition as its mode of operation.","Accordingly, there is provided a piezoelectric transducer that includes a single crystal piezoelectric material having a phase transition from one crystalline phase to a second crystalline phase at a predetermined stress level. A pre-stress is applied to the single crystal piezoelectric material so that the material is maintained near its phase transition point. An electrical field source is joined to the material such that, in cooperation with the pre-stress, an increase or decrease in the electrical field causes a crystalline phase transition in the single crystal piezoelectric material.","This invention utilizes single crystal piezoelectric materials, known more specifically as relaxor-ferroelectric single crystal compositions, which operate near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). In these types of crystals, the morphotropic phase boundary is the temperature\/pressure region in which the crystalline structure changes from a rhombohedral structure to a tetragonal structure through intermediate states. In this process, energy is stored in the crystal before the phase change, and this energy is suddenly released during the phase change. Binary materials showing this transition include (1\u2212x)Pb(B\u2032Nb)O-xPbTiOwhere B\u2032 is Mg, Mn, Zn, or Sc. One known material in this range, that is useful for this purpose incorporates Zn as B\u2032, and x is in the range of 0.04<x<0.11. Ternary single crystal compositions, such as xPb(InNb)O-(1-x-y)Pb(MgNb)O-yPbTiO(PIN-PMN-PT), also show these properties. Useful crystals in this group have been found where x is in the range of 0.24-0.33 and y is in the range of 0.28-0.33. Other ranges and similar compositions of binary and ternary crystals may have beneficial properties. A particularly desirable characteristic of these materials is a sharp phase transition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","20","18","16","14","12"]},"A pronounced strain change such as that indicated at A and B is essential for the proposed transducer. This jump can be induced by any possible external driving element. For example, this driving element can be a magnetostrictive element driven by a magnetic field generated in a coil. Alternatively, this can be secondary driving piezoelectric element or the single crystal element can be preloaded to a certain critical stress. The critical stress is a characteristic of the particular material composition, and it can be determined experimentally for given temperature and electric field.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["12","12"]},"In application, the single crystal piezoelectric material begins with an initial strain (\u02dc\u22120.002) when the applied electric field is near zero and the pre-stress is about 10 MPa. When the electric field approaches about \u22121 KV\/cm induced phase transition strain is about \u22120.006 with a total strain of \u02dc0.004. The strain curve levels out once the phase transition is complete. As shown by the remainder of the electric field and strain curves, this process can be repeated periodically with essentially the same strain response.","Strain caused by crystalline ferroelectric phase change can be distinguished from that caused by ordinary piezoelectric strain by the magnitude of the strain. PZT composite ceramics have a piezoelectric coefficient of around 200 pm\/V and are capable of inducing a strain of \u02dc0.00002 (2\u00d710). Single crystal piezoelectric materials when operated in the linear mode have a piezoelectric coefficient of \u02dc2000 pm\/V. For the drive field E (max) \u02dc100,000 V\/m, the generated strain is \u02dc0.0002 (2\u00d710). In the phase change piezoelectric single crystals used in the current invention, generated strain can range from \u02dc0.001 (1\u00d710) to possibly as high as \u02dc0.008 (8\u00d710). Experimentation has shown strain values of 0.004 (4\u00d710) with an electric field of \u02dc0.1-0.2 MV\/m when the material is subjected to a pre-stress of at least 10-20 MPa.","These crystals can be driven in the \u201c32\u201d mode or in the \u201c33\u201d mode.  shows crystal orientation for driving in the \u201c32\u201d mode, and  shows crystal orientation for driving in the \u201c33\u201d mode.
