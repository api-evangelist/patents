{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/202,213, filed Jul. 23, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,859,273, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/307,243 filed Jul. 23, 2001. Both of those applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The present invention was developed with government funding under National Institutes of Health Grant No. CA68409. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to a method for operating a confocal microscope system and a system thereof.","Laser scanning confocal microscopes have the ability to penetrate beneath the surface of a specimen to obtain slices of imaging data. These slices or sections can be taken at specific depths in the specimen and then can be recombined to form a three dimensional image of the examined section. In order to be viewed by the laser scanning confocal microscope, the section of the specimen being examined must be auto-fluorescent or be stained with fluorescent dyes.","Unfortunately, control of laser scanning confocal microscopes has been fairly difficult and rigid. As a result, an operator of a laser scanning confocal microscope must spend a great deal of time and effort to modify the operation of a laser scanning confocal microscope for particular application. Additionally, there have been some deficiencies in controlling the timing of different operations within the laser scanning confocal microscope.","A method for operating a confocal microscope system in accordance with embodiments of the present invention includes deflecting a light beam on a specimen with at least one beam deflection device. The position of the light beam is stepped with at least one beam deflection device across the specimen. A sample of emitted fluorescent light from the specimen is captured in synchronization with each of the stepped positions of the light beam. An image is obtained from the captured samples of emitted fluorescent light.","A confocal microscope system in accordance with embodiments of the present invention includes one or more beam deflection devices, a positioning system, a detector, a synchronization system, and an imaging system. The one or more beam deflection devices are positioned to deflect a light beam on a specimen. The positioning system connected to each of the beam deflection devices step the position of the light beam with the one or more beam deflection devices across the specimen. The detector is positioned to capture one or more samples of emitted fluorescent light from the specimen. The synchronization system synchronizes the capture of each of the one or more samples with each of the stepped positions of the light beam. The imaging system obtains an image from the captured samples of the emitted fluorescent light.","The present invention provides a method and system for simple and flexible control of a laser scanning confocal microscope. More specifically, the present invention provides simple and effective controls over aspects of the laser scanning confocal microscope system, such as the front panel user interface, the synchronization of beam deflection device movement and photomultiplier tube data acquisition, as well the display, processing, and storage of images. With the present invention, control of the laser scanning confocal microscope can be readily and easily modified for specific applications and also for interfacing with other instruments.","A system and method for operating a laser scanning confocal microscope system  in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS.  and A\u2013C. The system  includes a laser source , a shutter , a beam splitter , mirrors () and (), stepper motor systems () and () () and (), an objective lens system , a photomultiplier tube , and scanning control system  although other types and number of components could be used. The present invention provides a number of advantages including providing simple and flexible control of a laser scanning confocal microscope .","Referring to , the laser source  generates a laser beam LB which is used in scanning a specimen SP or other sample. The laser source  is coupled to the scanning control system  which controls operations of the laser source , such as when the laser source  is engaged to generate a light beam and the type of light beam generated by the laser source . Although the laser source  with the laser beam LB is shown, other types of light source systems generating other types of light beams could be used.","The shutter  is positioned in the path of the laser beam LB or other light. The shutter  has an open position that permits the laser beam LB to pass through and a closed position that blocks the laser beam LB from passing through, although the shutter  could have other positions, such as a partially open position. Scanning control system  is coupled to and controls operations of the shutter , such as the position of shutter .","The beam splitter  is used to reflect the laser beam LB from the laser source  towards the specimen SP being examined. In this particular embodiment, the beam splitter  is a dichroic mirror, although other types of beam splitters could be used.","Mirrors () and () and stepper motor systems () and () are used to deflect the laser beam LB to permit raster scanning of the specimen SP, although other types of beam deflection devices and beam deflection device positioning systems can be used. Mirror () is coupled to the stepper motor system () which is coupled to and controlled by the scanning control system  to move the laser beam LB along the X-axis. Mirror () is coupled to the stepper motor system () which is also coupled to and controlled by the scanning control system  to move the laser beam LB along the Y-axis. This controlled movement of the laser beam LB along the X-axis and the Y-axis can be used to generate a raster scan back and forth across a section of the specimen SP. Additionally, although two mirrors () and () and two stepper motor systems () and () are shown, other numbers of mirrors and other numbers of stepper motor systems could be used to deflect the laser beam LB along the X-axis and the Y-axis, such as a single beam deflection device and\/or a single beam deflection device positioning system. Further, although in this particular embodiment the mirrors () and () are stepped, other manners of moving the mirrors () and (), such as with a continuous motion or by oscillation, can also be used.","The objective lens system  is used to focus the laser beam LB to a desired depth for analyzing a section of the specimen SP. The objective lens system  can be adjusted so that the laser beam LB is focused at other depths in the specimen SP and to magnify light passing through the objective lens system . The objective lens system  is coupled to and controlled by the scanning control system . Although an objective lens system  is shown, other types of optical systems for focusing the laser beam LB to different depths in the specimen SP can also be used.","The photomultiplier tube  is used to capture samples, such as emitted fluorescent light from the section of the specimen SP being examined. The photomultiplier tube  is coupled to the scanning control system  which controls operations of the photomultiplier tube . Although a photomultiplier tube  is shown, other types of detection systems could also be used. Additionally, although one photomultiplier tube  is shown, other numbers of photomultiplier tubes and\/or her detectors could be used to capture samples and samples in more than one color channels can be captured if color imaging is desired for a specific application.","The scanning control system  includes a central processing unit (CPU) or processor , a memory , a graphical user interface or display , a user input device , a input\/output interface device , and a clock  which are coupled together by a bus system  or other link, respectively, although the system may comprise other components, other numbers of the components, and other combinations of the components.","The processor  may execute one or more programs of stored instructions for the method for controlling a confocal microscope system  in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention as described herein and illustrated in . In this particular embodiment, these programmed instructions are stored in memory  and are executed by processor , although some or all of those programmed instructions could be stored and retrieved from and also executed at other locations. A variety of different types of memory storage devices, such as a random access memory (RAM) or a read only memory (ROM) in the system or a floppy disk, hard disk, CD ROM, or other computer readable medium which is read from and\/or written to by a magnetic, optical, or other reading and\/or writing system that is coupled to the processor , can be used for memory .","The display is used to show information to the operator, such as a captured image of a section of the specimen SP or a screen shot of a front panel user interface for operating the system  as shown in . A variety of different of devices can be used for the graphical user interface or display , such as a CRT or flat panel display.","The user input device  permits an operator to enter data into the scanning control system . A variety of different types devices can be used for user input device , such as a keyboard, a computer mouse, or an interactive display screen.","The input\/output interface device  is used to couple the scanning control system  to other components, including the laser source , the stepper motor systems () and (), the objective lens system , and the photomultiplier tube . A variety of different interface devices can be used with a variety of different communication protocols.","The clock  is used to control and synchronize operations in the system , such as the synchronizing the stepping of the laser beam LB with the acquiring data from the specimen SP with each step.","The scanning control system  may also comprise a programmed computer system with a controller board, such as the Iotech 16-bit data acquisition board, Daqboard 2000. The instructions programmed in the scanning control system  for the method for controlling a confocal microscope system  are optimized for use with the controller board which is used to control operations of the confocal microscope. More specifically, in this particular embodiment the programmed instructions for the mirror motion (digital-to-analog conversion), photomultiplier tube voltage data acquisition (analog-to-digital conversion), image display and data storage for the confocal microscope system  are done in Labview, Graphical Programming for Instrumentation code. Programs written in Labview are called virtual instruments because their appearance and operation can imitate actual instruments. In this particular embodiment, the programmed virtual instruments includes an interactive user interface or front panel as shown in . The interactive user interface is shown on the display  and simulates a panel of a physical instrument with controls and indicators, such as knobs, push buttons, and graphs. The operator enters data into this interactive user interface using a user input device, such as a computer mouse and\/or a keyboard. Other programmed virtual instrument in this particular embodiment include virtual instruments for an adjustment system for controlling the depth of the scan into the specimen SP along the Z-axis and for mirror voltage ramps for controlling the stepper motor systems () and () to step the positions of the mirrors () and () to move the laser beam LB along the X-axis and along the Y-axis. Virtual instruments for other tasks associated with the operation of the confocal microscope system  could also be programmed in, such as mirror warm-up, z-resolution analysis, independent data acquisition, setup control, image data retrieval and display with image processing capabilities, such as zoom, centering, sizing, transposing, coloring, and filtering depending on the particular application. Although one type of controller board and instructions programmed in Labview are shown in this particular embodiment, other types of components and other types of programming languages could be used.","Referring to , a method for operating a laser scanning confocal microscope is described. In step , the method starts.","In step , an operator begins by inputting motion control and data acquisition parameters into the program for the specific application with the user input device, although some or all of the parameters can be obtained in other manners, such as being retrieved from memory  in the scanning control system . A variety of different parameters may be input, such as field of view, pixels per axis, X-axis and Y-axis offset, analog-to-digital voltage range, ramp rate, number of images to average, number of slices to take, enable Z-axis, depth offset between slices along the Z-axis, enable laser shutter control, enable save data, path\/filename to save image data, and objective lens system magnification, depending on the specific application.","In step , after the parameters are input or otherwise obtained, the operator activates a \u201crun button\u201d using the user input device, although the scanning control system  could be activated or initiated with respect to this method in other manners, such as automatically. The input parameters are loaded into the scanning control system  for further processing.","In step , the input parameters are used by the scanning control system  to calculate mirror motion control and data acquisition variables, such as mirror ramp voltages for controlling the stepping movement of the mirrors () and () along the X-axis and the Y-axis which are substantially perpendicular to each other, the analog-to-digital frequency used for controlling the rate of stepping the mirrors () and () and for capturing samples with the photomultiplier tube , and the total number of samples needed for obtaining the desired image, although other variables could be calculated. In this particular embodiment, the mirror ramp voltages are generated to move the mirrors () and () with the stepper motor systems () and () in a manner that will cause a raster scan of the laser light on the specimen SP.","In step , the scanning control system  begins to process the calculated mirror motion control and data acquisition variables for operating the confocal microscope system , such as converting the digital ramp voltages used to control movement of the mirrors () and () to analog signals, synchronizing the control signals for the photomultiplier tube  with the clock  which is used in controlling the operation of the stepper motor systems () and () with the photomultiplier tube , and setting the total number of captured samples needed. In step , once the variables are processed, the scanning control system  may initialize operations, such as initializing the clock .","In step , a determination is made by the scanning control system  on whether to enable the shutter . If the shutter  is already in an open position, then the shutter  is not enabled by the scanning control system  and the No branch is taken to step . If the shutter  is closed, then the shutter  is enabled in step  and the Yes branch is taken to step . In step , shutter  is moved to an open position by the scanning control system  which allows the laser beam LB to pass by the shutter  to the beam splitter . The beam splitter  directs the laser beam LB on to the mirrors () and (). The mirrors () and () direct the laser beam LB to an objective lens system  which focuses the laser beam LB on the specimen SP.","Next in step , the scanning control system  starts the clock , the stepping of the mirrors () and (), and the capturing of samples by the photomultiplier tube . More specifically, the stepper motor systems () and () with control signals from the scanning control system , move the mirrors () and () through steps to deflect the laser beam LB in a way that turns the laser beam LB into a scanning beam on desired locations of the specimen SP. The objective lens system  is controlled by the scanning control system  to control the particular depth of focus for the laser beam LB from the mirrors () and (). A mixture of reflected light and emitted fluorescent light from the specimen SP is captured by the same objective lens system  and is focused onto the photomultiplier tube  via the beam splitter . The reflected light is deviated by the beam splitter  while the emitted fluorescent light passes through and samples of it are captured by the photomultiplier tube . The scanning control system  synchronizes the capture of samples by the photomultiplier tube  with each of the stepped positions of the mirrors () and (). Samples of emitted fluorescent light can be captured in more than one color channel and the scanning control system  can generate color images from this captured data in more than one color channel.","In step , the scanning control system  controls the system to perform n raster scans for each image slice (n=the number of images to average) which need to be obtained for the particular application.","In step , a determination is made by the scanning control system  on whether to enable the shutter . If the shutter  can remain in an open position, then the shutter  is not enabled by the scanning control system  and the No branch is taken to step . If the shutter  needs to be in the closed position, then the shutter  is enabled in step  and the Yes branch is taken to step . In step , the shutter  is moved to a closed position which prevents the laser beam LB from passing by the shutter .","In step , a determination is made by the scanning control system  on whether to average the images captured by the photomultiplier tube . If an average is not desired by the scanning control system , then the No branch is taken to step . If an average is desired by the scanning control system , then the Yes branch is taken from step  to step . In step , the scanning control system  calculates an average for the images captured by the photomultiplier tube . Scanning control system  may also perform a variety of mathematical operations on the obtained image acquired from one or more color channels, such as ratios, differences, sums, filters, and\/or interpolations. Scanning control system  may also select a region of interest in the obtained image from which confocal spectra is acquired.","In step , the obtained image is shown on the display . A variety of operations can be performed by the scanning control system  on the displayed image, such as adjusting a center of a field of view of the obtained image or varying a field of view of the obtained image.","In step , a determination is made by the scanning control system  on whether the required number of slices of the image have been obtained. If the required number of slices of the image have not been obtained, then the No branch is taken to step .","In step , a determination is made by the scanning control system  on whether to enable the microscope objective lens system . If the microscope objective lens system  is not enabled, then the No branch is taken to step . If the microscope objective lens system  is enabled, then the Yes branch is taken to step . In step , the microscope objective lens system  is controlled by the scanning control system  to adjust the focus of the laser beam LB to a different depth in the specimen SP along the Z-axis to obtain another \u201cslice\u201d image. In step , a new scan sequence at the new depth is started and the method returns to step  as described earlier.","In step , if the required number of slices of the image have been obtained, then the Yes branch is taken to step . In step , a determination is made by the scanning control system  on whether to save the image data to memory . If the image data is to be saved in step , then the Yes branch is taken to step  where the image data is saved to memory  and then in step  the method ends. If the image data is not to be saved in step , then the No branch is taken to step  where the method ends.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a method and system for simple and flexible control of a laser scanning confocal microscope, such as controlling the front panel user interface, the synchronization of beam deflection device movement and photomultiplier tube data acquisition, as well as image display, processing and data storage. Control parameters for the present invention can be readily modified for specific applications. Additionally, the present invention can be used to coordinate the acquisition of confocal images or spectra with other instruments, thereby linking the functioning of the confocal microscope to other laboratory functions by sending and\/or receiving signals to and\/or from these other instruments. For example, another instrument could control or effect the operation of a component or components in the confocal microscope system , such as the operation of the laser source , the mirrors () and () and stepper motor systems () and (), the objective lens system , and\/or the photomultiplier tube . The present invention can be used in a variety of different applications, such as obtaining high resolution images of cell structures showing the exact positions and relative concentrations of a fluorescing drug in the cell structures.","Having thus described the basic concept of the invention, it will be rather apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing detailed disclosure is intended to be presented by way of example only, and is not limiting.
