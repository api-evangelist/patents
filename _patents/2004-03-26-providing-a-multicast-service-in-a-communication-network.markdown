Any type of information may be multicast, for example, soccer match clips, news, or stock quotes. Architecture for delivering multicast services has been proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a collaboration between standards bodies for the Global System for Mobile communications\/General Packet Radio Service (GSM\/GPRS) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) wireless technologies. The proposed architecture, however, is complex and may not be easily implemented. It is generally desirable to have an architecture that may be easily implemented.","In accordance with the present invention, disadvantages and problems associated with previous techniques for providing a multicast service may be reduced or eliminated.","According to one embodiment, providing a multicast service includes maintaining multicast service information at an application server. The multicast service information describes a multicast service having at least one associated subscriber, and the multicast service is operable to deliver multicast content from a multicast source. A cell supporting a user device associated with the subscriber is determined, and creation of a bearer path for the multicast service is initiated. Delivery of the multicast content to the user device is enabled using the bearer path.","Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages. A technical advantage of one embodiment may be that multicast services may be provided with relatively few changes to existing network elements. An application server may be introduced to map the services to subscribers, and an enabler mobile may be used to enable multicast services in a specific cell.","Certain embodiments of the invention may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.","Embodiments of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to  of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","20","32","50","50","20","30","50","20","30","34","60"]},"A multicast service may refer to the delivery of content to one or more user devices  subscribing to the multicast service. According to one embodiment, a multicast service may have different multicast service levels. A multicast service level may be used, for example, to describe parameters for delivering a multicast service to a particular cell . A multicast service level may be associated with specific radio access bearer (RAB) parameters such as quality of service parameters. As an example, a multicast service level may be defined as a codec level. Example codec levels may include video at 16, 32, or 64 Kbps, data at 8 Kbps, audio at 16 Kbps, or data and audio at 32 Kbps.","According to one embodiment, the content may be distributed according to Internet Protocol (IP) multicast protocols.

User device  may be used to open a PDP context to join the server providing the subscription service through, for example, a service portal access point name (APN). User device  may communicate with the server using any suitable protocol such as, for example, HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) or extensible Markup Language (XML).","System  provides multicast services to user devices  of subscribers located in cells  covered by system , and may use any suitable IP multicast technique such as the Internet Group Management Protocol, Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) technique, Bi-Directional (PIM-BiDir), or Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) protocol. According to the illustrated embodiment, system  includes an enabler mobile , one or more base transceiver stations , a station controller , a serving support node , a gateway support node , a location base service , an application server , a multicast service gateway support node , one or more communication networks , and a multicast source  coupled as shown. System  communicates with a user device  using a radio access bearer  as shown.","System  includes a control path  and a data path  through which data packets are routed.

More enabler mobiles  may be used to increase services. Enabler mobile  establishes one or more RAB\/PDP contexts for one or more multicast services and sets up and maintains radio access bearer  in response to instructions from application server . Enabler mobile  may have an always-on PDP context with application server , and may communicate with application server  through multicast service gateway support node  associated with the cell  of enabler mobile . A static IP address may be provisioned for enabler mobile .","According to one embodiment, enabler mobile  may support capabilities such as Internet Group Management Protocol capabilities, Universal Resource Location Rendezvous Directory capabilities, or other suitable capabilities. Capabilities may include, for example, an IGMP join\/leave function to trigger an IP multicast tree set up at multicast service gateway support node .","According to one embodiment, enabler mobile  may drop any received multicast content to reduce impact on enabler mobile . According to another embodiment, enabler mobile  may receive at least some multicast content, and may provide feedback on the received multicast content to application server  or multicast source .","According to one embodiment, enabler mobile  may perform power control operations to adjust the power of the signals received by user devices . For example, the power may be adjusted so that the received signals have at least a minimum signal power. According to the embodiment, enabler mobile  may receive power control information such as a power control delta from application server . The power control information may be determined in accordance with the locations of user devices .","Enabler mobile  may adjust its power report in accordance with the power control information to adjust the signals received by user devices . For example, if application server  determines that a user device  is at the periphery of a cell , application server  may instruct enabler mobile  to subtract a delta from its measured power level before reporting the power level to station controller . Application server  may calculate the delta as a function of the relative distances of enabler mobile  and user device  from base transceiver system . According to normal power control procedures, when station controller  receives a lower reported received power level from enabler mobile , station controller  signals base transceiver system  to increase the transmit power of radio access bearer  to allow user device  to receive a minimum signal power.","Base transceiver stations  provides user devices  with access to system , and station controller  manages the operation of base transceiver stations . According to one embodiment, a base transceiver station  may comprise a 3G Node B, a 2G base transceiver station, or other suitable transceiver station.

Radio access bearer  may comprise a peer-to-peer radio access bearer, a peer-to-multicast radio access bearer, a BAMBOO MEDIACAST multicast bearer, a broadcast radio access bearer, or other suitable radio access bearer.","For transmission reliability purposes, if radio access bearer  is not able to perform replication, a forwarding equivalency class may be used at the radio layer, the application layer, or both. For example, the GPRS protocol may be used at the radio layer, or the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Reliable Multicast Transport Working Group (RMTWG) protocols such as those described in RFC 3450 may be used at the application layer. According to one embodiment, a forwarding equivalency class may be used for the radio bearer, and a negative acknowledgement (NACK) may be used up to gateway support node .","Serving support node  performs mobility management functions such as mobile subscriber attachment and detachment for user device . Serving support node  may detect user device  within its service area, obtain profile data for users from a home location register, and record the location of user device . Serving support node  may comprise, for example, a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).","Location base service  tracks information about user devices  in a particular territory, and may comprise, for example, a visitors location register. For example, location base service  may map a user device  to a particular cell  or to a particular position within a specific cell . Gateway support node  operates as an interface to communication network that allows user device  to access communication network . Gateway support node  may comprise, for example, a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN).","Application server  refers to a device that maintains multicast service information and initiates delivery of a multicast service.

The information may include the multicast services, which may include multicast service levels, available to the cells  and to the subscribers. Application server  may map subscribers to the multicast services or multicast service levels to which they are subscribing. Each multicast service or multicast service level may also be mapped to a corresponding access point name (APN). The multicast service information may be enhanced and refreshed to add, delete or otherwise modify content, subscribers, services, other information, or any combination of the preceding.","Application server  may record for each cell  a cell type corresponding to the multicast service capabilities of a cell . A capability may include, for example, a bearer capability or quality of service. According to one embodiment, the cell type may be associated with a multicast service level to associate a cell  having the cell type with multicast service level.","Application server  may record the relationships among the cells , the cell types, and the multicast services or multicast service levels in any suitable manner. For example, the cell identifier of a cell  may be mapped to the corresponding cell type, and the cell type may be mapped to a corresponding multicast service or multicast service level.

As an example, multicast service gateway support node  may perform GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) encapsulation to avoid station controller  change. The unicast IP addresses referring to the right multicast service gateway support nodes  may be provisioned at a Domain Naming System (DNS) server. According to one embodiment, the architecture of multicast service gateway support node  may be distributed, for example, most distributed, and multicast service gateway node  may be co-located with station controller .","Communication networks  allow devices to communicate with other devices.

System  may have more, fewer, or other modules. For example, system  may have fewer communication networks . Moreover, the operations of system  may be performed by more, fewer, or other modules. For example, the operations of application server  and multicast source  may be performed by one module. As another example, the operations of multicast service gateway support node  may be performed by more than one module. The operations may be performed by station controller  or may be moved further into the network, for example, towards base transceiver station . Additionally, operations of system  may be performed using any suitable logic comprising software, hardware, other logic, or any suitable combination of the preceding. As used in this document, \u201ceach\u201d refers to each member of a set or each member of a subset of a set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","20"]},"The method begins at step , where devices of system  are provisioned. According to one embodiment, enabler mobile  may be provisioned with a static IP address. Application server  may be provisioned with multicast service information such as the locations of enabler mobiles , the multicast services or multicast service levels of the cells , the types of the cells , the multicast gateway support nodes  for enabler mobiles , or any combination of the preceding. A Domain Naming System server may be provisioned with the IP addresses of multicast service gateway support nodes .","A user is registered in response to receiving a user subscription from one or more user devices  at step . According to one embodiment, application server  may register the user. A user may subscribe to one or more multicast services or one or more multicast service levels. A user may be registered by mapping the user identifier of the user device  to the services or service levels to which the user has subscribed.","The multicast service is initiated at step . According to one embodiment, multicast source  may initiate the service by announcing to application server  that content is ready to be transmitted. According to another embodiment, application server  may initiate the service by triggering multicast source  to transmit content. An operator may select whether multicast source , application server , or a combination of multicast source  and application server  initiate the service.","The enabler mobile  associated with the cell  of the user device  is determined at step . Application server  may establish the cells  of user devices  by, for example, accessing location base service . Application server  may also determine a cell type, a multicast service or multicast service level, other information, or any combination of the preceding corresponding to the cell  of enabler mobile .","Enabler mobile  is instructed to set up a bearer path at step . According to one embodiment, application server  may first associate enabler mobile  with multicast service gateway support node . Application server  may map the access point name of multicast service gateway support node  to the cell identifier corresponding to enabler mobile . Application server  may then send a notification to instruct enabler mobile  to activate radio access bearer  and the PDP context for the multicast service. The notification may include the IP address for the multicast group of the multicast service, the IP address of multicast source , the access point name of multicast service gateway support node , other suitable information, or any combination of the preceding.","A bearer path is set up at step . Station controller  sets up radio access bearer  having an RAB identifier for enabler mobile . Enabler mobile  opens a PDP context with multicast service gateway support node . Enabler mobile  sends a query to join the multicast distribution group for the multicast service group or for the multicast service level group using, for example, an Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)\/Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) query. The query may include the multicast service address, the multicast source address, multicast service level address, or any combination of the preceding.","Enabler mobile  communicates RAB parameters to application server , and application server  communicates the RAB parameters to user devices  to allow them to prepare to listen to radio access bearer . The information may be sent using a paging process for any current open PDP context, using a push proxy functionality to trigger the opening of a PDP context, or may be sent in any other suitable manner. If a user device  is subscribing during transmission, application server  may perform localization and then provide the RAB information to the user device . Multicast service gateway support node  may receive a join message or a URD request for a multicast group and joins a multicast tree using, for example, a Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) join. Multicast service gateway support node  may then create a (*, G) or (S, G) entry for the multicast tree and create a multicast output interface list with the PDP contexts of one or more enabler mobiles .","Content transmission is initiated at step . According to one embodiment, application server  may notify multicast source  that a bearer path has been set up. According to another embodiment, multicast source  may send content after a predetermined time period. Multicast source  sends content comprising data packets to multicast service gateway support node  using, for example, IP multicast forwarding.","The data packets are duplicated and distributed at step . According to one embodiment, multicast service gateway support node  may duplicate data packets for each RAB identifier. According to another embodiment, multicast service gateway support node  may duplicate data packets for each multicast service level. Multicast service gateway support node  sends the packets to station controller . Station controller  transmits the packets to the radio access bearer  that corresponds to the RAB identifier. According to one embodiment, radio access bearer  transmits the data packets to user devices . According to another the embodiment, radio access bearer  transmits the data packets to mobile enabler , and user devices  listen to radio access bearer . The method may not require any additional functionality of station controller .","Appropriate security measures may be taken in order to reduce the risk of unauthorized reception of the multicast service. According to one embodiment, multicast server , user device , multicast service gateway node , or any combination of the preceding may use one or more Reliable Transport Multicast protocols (from IETF's RTM workgroup) to reliably deliver the multicast service or multicast service level content. For example, user device  may use IETF RMT's Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC), or user device  or multicast service gateway node  may use IETF RMT's NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast Protocol (NORM), Pragmatic Generic Multicast (PGM), other mechanism implemented at the application or transport level, or any combination of the preceding to participate in reliable multicast transmission.","If user device  moves from one cell  to another cell  that may be managed by the same or another base transceiver station  at step , the method proceeds to step , where a move procedure is performed. According to one embodiment, a multicast service routing update may be used to maintain the location of user device . User device  sends a routing update, and application server  is notified of the move. Application server  may be notified of a change in location by any suitable technique such as by periodic retransmission or by using Reliable Multicast Transport Asynchronous Layered Coding (RMT ALC) protocols. According to one embodiment, all multicast service levels may be multicast to a cell  such that a user device may access its service level. The method then proceeds to step . If user device  does not move at step , the method proceeds directly to step .","If transmission is to continue at step , the method proceeds to step , where multicast source  continues to transmit data packets to multicast service gateway support node . The method then returns to step , where the packets are duplicated and distributed. If transmission is not to continue at step , the method proceeds to step .","Transmission is terminated at step . Multicast source , application server , user device , or other suitable device may initiate termination. Application server  may notify user device  that transmission is being terminated. Application server  may request that enabler mobile  leave the multicast group to free the resource, or enabler mobile  may be allowed to maintain the resource. According to one embodiment, application server  notifies enabler mobile  to terminate the PDP and RAB sessions. Enabler mobile  may send a message such as an Internet Group Management Protocol\/Multicast Listener Discovery message to leave the multicast group. Multicast service gateway node  may then update the multicast output interface list by deleting the required PDP Context from the list, and may leave the multicast distribution tree by, for example, sending a pruning message. Enabler mobile  requests a PDP deactivation, and station controller  deactivates radio access bearer .","User device  may initiate termination. According to one embodiment, user device  may stop listening to radio access bearer . According to another embodiment, user device  may contact application server  to stop transmission or to unsubscribe to the service. According to another embodiment, loss of contact with user device  may initiate termination of the multicast service. Enabler mobile  of a cell  may be requested to initiate termination if no user device  is in the cell . Application server  may record that the communication was not completed due to, for example, a loss of signal or other suitable reason, and may retransmit the content. After terminating transmission, the method terminates.","Alterations or permutations such as modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the method without departing from the scope of the invention. The method may include more, fewer, or other steps. Additionally, steps may be performed in any suitable order without departing from the scope of the invention.
