More particularly, the technology relates to a network node, a radio base station with restricted wireless access, and a user equipment, and to a method for reducing uplink interference at the radio base station with restricted wireless access, where the uplink interference is caused by the user equipment served by the network node and with a restricted wireless access to the radio base station.","The Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) is one of the third generation mobile communication technologies designed to succeed GSM. 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a project within the 3Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to improve the UMTS standard to cope with future requirements in terms of improved services such as higher data rates, improved efficiency, and lowered costs. The Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) is the radio access network of a UMTS and Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN) is the radio access network of an LTE system. In an UTRAN and an E-UTRAN, a user equipment (UE) is wirelessly connected to a radio Base Station (BS) commonly referred to as a NodeB and an evolved NodeB (eNodeB) respectively. Each BS serves one or more areas referred to as cells.","In E-UTRAN, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) technology is used in the downlink and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) in the uplink. In both uplink and downlink the data transmission is split into several sub-streams, where each sub-stream is modulated on a separate sub-carrier. Hence in OFDMA based systems, the available bandwidth is sub-divided into several resource blocks (RB). A resource block is defined in both time and frequency. According to the current assumptions in the 3GPP standard, a resource block size is 180 KHz and 0.5 ms in the frequency and time domains respectively. The overall uplink and downlink transmission bandwidth may be as large as 20 MHz per frequency carrier.","According to the 3GPP definition, a heterogeneous network comprises two or more layers, where the layers are served by different types of BSs or BS classes. In a two-layered macro-femto heterogeneous network the macro cell layer and femto cell layer typically comprise macro BS and Home BS (HBS), respectively. FIBS are radio BSs with restricted wireless access, as will be explained later. In co-channel heterogeneous networks, all layers operate on the same carrier frequency.","Hitherto, three LTE BS classes are specified: wide area or macro BS, local area or pico BS, and HBS. Nonetheless additional BS classes such as medium range BS may be introduced in the future. The BS classes differ in that they have different levels of maximum output power and associated minimum coupling loss. Some other requirements such as frequency error and receiver sensitivity may also differ for different BS classes as they are generally optimized for specific deployment scenarios. In LTE, the maximum output power of a local area BS which serves a pico cell, and a HBS which serves a femto cell, is 24 dBm and 20 dBm respectively, when Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is not applied. For E-UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN TDD, the HBS maximum output power, Pis 17 dBm per antenna port in case of two transmit antennas, or 14 dBm per antenna port in case of four transmit antennas, and so forth. A formula for the HBS maximum output power is given by a general formula according to the following:\n\n=20 dBm\u221210*log10()\n\nwhere N is the number of transmit antenna ports at the HBS. Similar scaling is also used for the maximum output power of the pico BS when MIMO is used. The maximum output power of the macro BS is declared by the manufacturer, and may typically be between 43 and 46 dBm. BS power classes or types similar to those specified for LTE are also specified in UTRAN.\n","A heterogeneous network may enhance capacity in dense traffic areas or hotspots, i.e. small geographical areas with a higher user density and\/or higher traffic intensity. Heterogeneous networks may also be used for coverage extension. However, heterogeneous network deployments and in particular the co-channel scenario also bring challenges for which the network has to be prepared to ensure efficient network operation and superior user experience.","The heterogeneous network may constitute of BS employing any one or a mix of technologies such as LTE, High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), GSM, and CDMA2000. There are several frequency bands which have been standardized for multiple technologies, e.g., band 1 at 2 GHz for LTE and HSPA, and band 3 at 1800 MHz for GSM, LTE and HSPA. Hence heterogeneous deployment may even comprise of mixture of technologies. Another example scenario comprises BS that are a mixture of single radio access technology BSs and multi-standard radio (MSR) type BSs.","A HBS, sometimes also called a femto BS, typically serves private premises or small office environments. Another main characteristic of the HBS is that it is typically owned by a private subscriber who has the liberty to install it at any location. The subscriber's operator may also own the HBS, but the location of the HBS may not be fixed. The subscriber may e.g. move the HBS from one part of the house to another. Thus strict network planning may not be possible or may be challenging in case of HBS deployment. This is different from other BS classes which are deployed by an operator according to some well defined principles.","An access control mechanism for the HBS decides if a given UE may or may not connect to that HBS. The selection of the access control mechanism has a large impact on the performance of the overall network, mainly due to its role in the definition of interference. in UTRAN and E-UTRAN, the concept of Closed Subscriber Groups (CSG) exists. According to CSG, only a subset of UEs, defined by the owner of the HBS, may wirelessly access or connect to that particular HBS. Hence wireless access for other UEs is denied by the CSG based HBS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["120","110","140","130","110","130","150","110","115","130","140","140","140","130","150","150","130","155","150","130","130"]},"Another problem is the downlink interference from the HBS  towards the MUE . The HBS may be required to lower its maximum output power, i.e. to adjust its downlink power settings, in order to protect the downlink reception quality of the MUE operating in an adjacent carrier frequency. The HBS maximum output power may also need to be adjusted in the co-channel deployment scenario, i.e. when the macro node and the HBS operate on the same carrier frequency. The adjustment of the maximum output power of the HBS to protect the MUEs downlink quality can be ensured by specifying certain requirements for the HBS in the standard. For such a co-channel scenario, i.e. a victim downlink MUE and an aggressor downlink HBS, there are currently no such requirements on HBS. However in near future these requirements are expected to be defined in the standard for LTE HBS. The HBS maximum output power adjustment techniques enable the MUE to operate close to the CSG cells, as the MUE is able to receive downlink signals from its serving macro node with a relatively reduced interference from the HBS.","The downlink maximum output power adjustment, sometimes also called a downlink maximum output power setting algorithm, is thus designed to protect MUEs, and in particular those MUEs that are not allowed to access the CSG cell. The downlink maximum output power adjustment may be used not only for reducing the transmit power, but also to expand the coverage area of a cell such as the CSG cell, or more specifically to restore the maximum HBS coverage when there are no non-CSG MUEs in close vicinity any longer. If no MUEs suffer from high downlink interference from the HBS any longer, the HBS coverage area may be restored to its maximum again.","The side effect with the HBS maximum output power adjustment, making it possible to shrink the HBS coverage and therefore increase the coverage of the macro cells, is that some UEs may change serving cell due to the adjustment. The HBS coverage shrinking results in that some of the UEs belonging to the CSG cell, hereinafter referred to as Home UEs (HUE), may have to be served by the macro node instead. The consequences of this are that:\n\n","One fundamental problem is that the CSG HBS typically does not have means to directly control or limit the uplink interference from the MUEs or from other UEs which are not under its control. Furthermore, the downlink maximum output power adjustment that is used for protecting MUEs from downlink interference from HBS, may result in bad uplink interference conditions for the HBS. If the downlink maximum output power adjustment requirements are too strict and do not take into account the potential degradation of the uplink performance, the reduction of BS downlink maximum output power may lead to constantly poor uplink performance of HUEs in a CSG cell. If the HBS maximum downlink power is for example inadequately reduced, the presence of a few MUEs which are non-CSG UEs may severely degrade or even potentially block the HBS uplink reception performance for CSG HUEs.","An object is therefore to address some of the problems and disadvantages outlined above, and to allow a macro network node to reduce an uplink interference at a victim radio base station with restricted wireless access, where the uplink interference originates from an aggressor UE that does not have access to the victim radio base station and that is served by the other macro network node. At the same time, an acceptable level of downlink interference from the victim radio base station to UEs that do not have access to it should be ensured.","In accordance with an embodiment, a method in a network node of a heterogeneous wireless communication system, for reducing uplink interference at a radio base station with restricted wireless access is provided. The uplink interference is caused by a user equipment served by the network node, wherein the user equipment has a restricted wireless access to the radio base station.

The user equipment has a restricted wireless access to the radio base station. The method comprises determining a total uplink received interference at the radio base station based on a triggering event, and transmitting information relating to the determined total uplink received interference to the user equipment, to support the reduction of uplink interference performed by the network node.","In accordance with still another embodiment, a method in a user equipment of a wireless communication system, for supporting a reduction of uplink interference caused by the user equipment at a radio base station with restricted wireless access of the wireless communication system is provided. The user equipment is served by a network node of the wireless communication system and has a restricted wireless access to the radio base station. The method comprises acquiring information relating to a total uplink received interference from the radio base station based on a triggering event, and transmitting the acquired information to the network node, to support the reduction of uplink interference performed by the network node.","In accordance with a further embodiment, a network node configured to be used in a heterogeneous wireless communication system is provided. The network node is also configured to reduce uplink interference at a radio base station with restricted wireless access, the uplink interference being caused by a user equipment served by the network node, and the user equipment having a restricted wireless access to the radio base station. The network node comprises a receiver configured to receive measurement reports from one or more user equipments served by the network node, and a processing unit configured to identify a user equipment causing uplink interference at the radio base station among said one or more user equipments, based on the received measurement reports.

The radio base station is also configured to support a reduction of uplink interference at the radio base station caused by a user equipment served by a network node of the wireless communication system, the user equipment having a restricted wireless access to the radio base station. The radio base station comprises a processing unit configured to determine a total uplink received interference at the radio base station based on a triggering event, and a transmitter for transmitting information relating to the determined total uplink received interference to the user equipment, to support the reduction of uplink interference performed by the network node.","In accordance with another embodiment, a user equipment configured to be used in a wireless communication system, and to support a reduction of uplink interference caused by the user equipment at a radio base station with restricted wireless access of the wireless communication system, is provided. The user equipment is configured to be served by a network node of the wireless communication system and to have a restricted wireless access to the radio base station. The user equipment comprises a processing unit configured to acquire information relating to a total uplink received interference from the radio base station based on a triggering event, and a transmitter configured to transmit the acquired information to the network node, to support the reduction of uplink interference performed by the network node.","An advantage of particular embodiments is that the network node may control the uplink interference in a neighboring radio base station with restricted wireless access without requiring any backhaul communication between the radio base station and the network node.","The following description sets forth specific details, such as particular embodiments for purposes of explanation and not limitation. But it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that other embodiments may be employed apart from these specific details. In some instances, detailed descriptions of well known methods, interfaces, circuits, and devices are omitted so as not obscure the description with unnecessary detail. Individual blocks are shown in the figures. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the functions of those blocks and\/or of described nodes\/functionalities may be implemented using hardware circuitry (e.g., analog and\/or discrete logic gates interconnected to perform a specialized function, or ASICs) and\/or using software programs and data in conjunction with one or more digital microprocessors or general purpose computers. Nodes that communicate using the air interface also have suitable radio communications circuitry. Moreover, the technology may additionally be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer-readable memory, such as solid-state memory, magnetic disk, or optical disk containing an appropriate set of computer instructions that would cause a processor to carry out the techniques described herein.","Embodiments are described herein by way of reference to particular example scenarios. Particular aspects are described in a non-limiting general context in relation to heterogeneous deployment in LTE and in particular to enhanced Inter Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) for LTE. In eICIC advanced techniques such as time domain sharing of resources between different heterogeneous layers, e.g., between macro BSs and pica BSs, are used to mitigate interference in a co-channel deployment scenario. However since what is disclosed may apply to any technology or mixture of technologies, the generic terms Macro network Node (MN) and HBS are used below. The term MN represents a network node which may be a macro BS or a macro controller or both. However, in the literature other terminologies such as wide area BS or general purpose BS are also interchangeably used for the macro BS. The logical entity or the node representing the macro BS is called macro or wide area eNodeB in LTE. In HSPA the corresponding term is macro or wide area NodeB. In HSPA the MN functionalities may also reside in a Radio Network Controller (RNC) controlling the NodeBs or partly in RNC and partly in Node B. In GSM, the MN may be a Base Transceiver Station (BTS), i.e. the BS in GSM, and\/or a Base Station Controller (BSC). More generally, MN may also refer to a higher-power class BS, and a pico BS may e.g. also be viewed as a general MN.","Home eNodeB, home NodeB, femto BS, home BTS, indoor relay, indoor access point, and any type of BS which is barred to ordinary subscribers are also specific examples of the HBS. The person skilled in the art may appreciate that these different terminologies refer to the same type of radio BS. Hereinafter, the terms Home UE (HUE) and Macro UE (MUE) denote UEs which are camped on, connected to, or served by the HBS and the MN, respectively.","As described earlier a CSG HBS allows access to only a subset of UEs belonging to the CSG, which are selected by an owner of the CSG HBS. The generic term HBS cell also covers hybrid HBS or hybrid CSG HBS. A hybrid CSG HBS provides all services to its member UEs but in addition also provides selected services to the UEs which are not CSG members. The non-CSG may also be offered services with lower priority compared to those offered to the CSG members. An example of a service which may be provided to the non-CSG UE is paging. This means a non-member CSG UE may receive paging message from a hybroid CSG HBS. A hybrid CSG HBS may even provide data services to non-member CSG UEs. However, the major difference between hybrid and CSG HBS cells is that CSG HBS cells provide no service to non-CSG UEs, whilst hybrid cells provide some service, though limited in at least some aspects. Regardless of the services offered, the hybrid HBS is like the HBS not likely to support an interface to the macro network nodes. in the context of LTE e.g., the X2 interface between a hybrid CSG HeNB and macro eNB is not likely to exist. Furthermore, the hybrid HBS could like the normal HBS be deployed by the owner of the HBS without proper network planning.","This disclosure relates to the reduction of the uplink interference at a HBS with restricted wireless access in a heterogeneous network deployment, while ensuring, at least in some embodiments, an acceptable level of downlink interference to UEs that are not allowed to access the HBS. There is thus also a need to relate the mechanisms of reducing the uplink interference to the downlink maximum output power adjustments performed to protect other-cell UEs in the downlink. Such mechanisms are also a part of the current invention.","In particular embodiments, the serving MN is enabled to:\n\n","In the disclosure, embodiments are described with reference to a typical example scenario for illustration purposes. In the example scenario a heterogeneous network with two cell layers is deployed. The heterogeneous network comprises a layer of radio BS or network nodes with restricted access, which in this example scenario is a layer of CSG HBS, and one layer of MN with non-restricted access, which in this example scenario is a layer of macro BS. The restricted access to the HBS means that only certain subscribers are allowed to wirelessly access the HBS. In principle this may apply to any type of BS including also macro BS. However the most common scenario is as described earlier that of the CSG based HBS.","The technology in this application applies to any type of heterogeneous network with at least one restricted network node. However the practical scenario is that of the two-layered heterogeneous network consisting of MN with unrestricted access and HBS with restricted access, although more than two layers are also possible. Furthermore, the technology in this application applies to the heterogeneous network regardless whether different layers operate on the same carrier frequency as in the co-channel case, or on different carrier frequencies, or on a combination of these two cases. However the most stringent and practical scenario is that of the co-channel deployment. Although the description focuses on a macro BS and CSG HBS network with co-channel deployment, the technology in this application is applicable to other scenarios.","In the example scenario, it is likely that the MUE  served by the macro BS  with non-restricted access may operate close to the CSG HBS , as illustrated in . Due to restricted access, the MUE  may not be served by the CSG HBS  and may thus cause excessive uplink interference at the receiver of the CSG HBS.","Thus one aspect of the technology in this application is that the serving macro BS  determines or identifies the MUE  under its control that causes significant uplink interference (arrow ) towards the neighboring CSG HBS . A second aspect is that upon determination of the dominant interfering MUE , the serving macro BS  takes specific actions, which lower the uplink interference at the HBS  emanating from such MUE .","The following three non-limiting embodiments are described in more details below in section 1-3:\n\n","The obtained information about the uplink interference at the victim CSG HBS is used by the macro BS to determine the uplink interference received at the CSG HBS and to take appropriate actions as described below in section 2 and section 3, respectively.","The uplink received interference at the neighboring HBS may be obtained by exchanging such information over network interference e.g. over X2 in LTE.","However in a two layered macro BS and CSG HBS deployment scenario, the macro BSs are not directly connected to the CSG HBS, and no interface such as the X2 may thus be used. The communication between macro BS and CSG HBS via a core network involves complexity and delay. Such a backhaul communication may also be restricted in certain network implementations.","Therefore, according to this example embodiment, information about uplink received interference at the CSG HBS is obtained by the macro BS via the MUE under its control. A method for obtaining the uplink received interference at CSG HBS comprises the following:\n\n","The signaling of a message or status flag may be done using any suitable higher layer (e.g. layer 3) or lower layer (e.g. layer 1 and layer 2) protocols. Examples of higher layer protocols are RRC or any Radio Resource Management (RRM) related protocol. Examples of lower layer protocols are Media Access Control (MAC) layer or any other Layer 1\/Layer 2 protocol, e.g. over Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) in LTE. Lower layer signaling such as PDCCH is preferably used when the signaling overheads are small, e.g., if only an indicator is signaled. Otherwise higher layer signaling such as RRC should be used.","The message or an indicator sent in the form of higher layer signaling such as RRC can be sent to the UE via UE specific signaling or via common or cell specific signaling. The UE specific signal and cell specific signaling are mapped on the UE specific physical channel and common channel respectively. Examples of UE specific and common channel (i.e. cell specific) over which such signaling can be sent are the UE specific Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and the dedicated broadcast channel which is transmitted on the PDSCH in LTE.","Sending the message or indicator transparently means that the MUE retransmits the received information to the serving macro BS without reading or extracting it. In case of non-transparent transmission, the MUE decodes the received message or indicator and may do further processing before resending it to the serving macro BS.","Section 2: Macro BS Detecting the Interfering MUE","According to one example embodiment, the method in the macro BS for detecting or identifying the aggressor MUE interfering with the victim CSG HBS comprises the steps of:\n\n","If the determined total uplink received interference at the CSG HBS is above the threshold, or if the determined uplink interference of a specific MUE to the CSG BS is above a threshold, or if a specific MUE is too close to the CSG BS and the path loss thus is small, then the macro BS lowers the interference by carrying out one or more actions as described in section 3 below.","Examples of downlink signal strength measurements are Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Common Pilot Channel Received Signal Code Power (CPICH RSCP) in LTE and HSPA respectively. Examples of signal quality measurements are Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) and CPICH Ec\/No in LTE and HSPA respectively. In general the measurements may comprise any intra-frequency measurements or any inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements or measurements on one or more component carriers in a multi-carrier system, also called a carrier aggregation (CA) system. In CA the component carriers may belong to the same RAT (intra-RAT or single RAT CA) or different RATs (inter-RAT or multi-RAT CA).","Examples of uplink interference measurements are noise Rise over Thermal (RoT) in LTE or HSPA or Received Interference Power (RIP) in LTE. The measurements may be done over a one or a group of channels, e.g., over a group of RBs in LTE.","The different thresholds used above may be pre-defined in the macro BS or may is be configurable by any other node, such as a Self Organizing Network (SON) node, an Operations Support System (OSS) node, an Operation and Maintenance node, and a network controller such as RNC or BSC. The thresholds may depend on or may be derived from one or more of the measurements acquired by the macro BS in one of the previous steps described above.","Section 3: Macro BS Reducing Uplink Interference in CSG HBS","If the uplink interference received at the neighboring victim HBS from the aggressor MUE, as determined by the macro BS based on the obtained information (see section 1) and\/or on detection (see section 2), is above a threshold, or the MUE is too close to the HBS and the path loss is below a threshold, or the uplink interference from the MUE is above a threshold, then a method in the macro BS for reducing the uplink interference in the CSG HBS is performed. The method comprises performing at least one of the following tasks for at least one MUE which reports a CGI that belongs to the CGS HBS:\n\n","DRX and\/or long DTX cycle can also be regarded as operating in lower activity state in LTE and HSPA. Examples of short DRX cycles commonly used in connected state are: 10 ms, 40 ms and 80 ms. Examples of long DRX cycles which are commonly used in connected state are 640 ms, 1.28 s and 2.56 s. If the UE has been operating in the higher activity state such as in CELL_DCH state, the UE state can be changed to a lower activity state such as CELL_FACH state. Similarly if a UE is operating in connected state using short DRX cycle (e.g. 40 ms) then the DRX cycle can be extended from short DRX (i.e. 40 ms) to long DRX such as 640 ms or 1.28 s.\n\n","Furthermore, when the uplink interference received at the neighboring CSG HBS as determined by the macro BS falls below a certain threshold, or after a specified time period (TO) the macro BS may restore the MUE parameter, the MUE activity state or the scheduling pattern to a default state or to normal level again.","In addition to the above described methods, the macro BS may further perform one or more of the following in particular embodiments:\n\n","The signaling to the CSG HBS may be implemented by using the macro BS to CSG HBS interface if available, e.g. the X2 interface in LTE, or backhaul links. Alternatively, the signaling may be performed by transmitting over the air interface in system information via a broadcast channel.","In response to the signaling by the macro BS, the CSG HBS may also perform one or more of the following actions, with the aim of efficiently dealing with and reducing the impact from the uplink received interference from the MUE:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 3","i":"a ","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0020-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021-0001","num":"0103"},"b":"310"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021-0002","num":"0104"},"b":"320"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021-0003","num":"0105"},"b":"330"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0021-0004","num":"0106"},"b":"340"}]}}}},"In one embodiment, identifying  the UE comprises identifying the UE reporting a signal measurement exceeding a first threshold, where the signal measurement is associated with a neighbour cell identifier corresponding to the radio BS.
