No. 12\/460,439, entitled POLARIZED LIGHTNING ARRESTORS, naming Roderick A. Hyde, Muriel Y. Ishikawa, Jordin T. Kare, Thomas Allan Weaver, Lowell L. Wood, Jr. and Victoria Y.H. Wood as inventors, filed on Jul. 17, 2009, which is currently co-pending, or is an application of which a currently co-pending application entitled to the benefit of the filing date.","A lightning protection system protects a structure from damage due to lightning strikes, either by safely conducting the strike to the ground, or preventing the structure from being struck. Lightning protection systems are commonly installed on structures, buildings, trees, monuments, bridges and water vessels to protect from lightning or electrical discharge damage. Lightning protection systems are also used to protect appliances, machinery, electrical systems and electronic equipment from lightning or electrical discharge damage. Most lightning protection systems are composed of a network of lightning rods and\/or lightning arrestors (surge protectors), metallic cable conductors, and ground electrodes designed to provide a low impedance path for the lightning to travel through to the ground.","A lightning rod is a metal strip or rod with a conductive cable or other low-resistance path to ground. A lightning rod, which is usually installed on a rooftop, provides a point well above the structure to be protected with a very good, earthed connection. Because of its position, shape, and conductivity, the lightning rod may draw energy (current) from a lightning discharge and diverts the energy to ground via the conductive cable to ground, thus preventing damage to the structure. , which is adapted from Tesla U.S. Pat. No. 1,266,175, shows an early lightning rod.","A lightning arrestor is a device, which is typically used for protecting electronic or electrical equipment from lightning by diverting any surges of high-voltage electricity caused by atmospheric discharges to ground. The lightning arrestor includes an \u201cactive\u201d element, which switches from a non-conductive state to a conductive state in response to a surge in voltage. The active element in its conductive state provides a short i.e. a path for the high voltage to go to ground, bypassing the electronic or electrical equipment to be protected. In other words, the active element acts as an over-voltage release valve. The active element of a lightning arrestor may, for example, be a metal oxide varistor, a transient suppression diode, a gas discharge tube, a spark gap, a crowbar (circuit) using a Zener diode driving the gate of a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) latch, or any other suitable device. For convenience in description, both lightning rods and lightning arrestors may be referred to as lightning arrestors herein.","Consideration is now being given to improving traditional lightning protection systems.","Approaches to defend a site from lightning strikes are provided. Illustrative approaches involve altering electrostatic fields above the site and\/or dynamically intervening in lightning discharge processes in the vicinity of the site.","In an exemplary approach, a system for defending a site includes a plurality of lightning arrestors. The electrostatic fields above the site are modified by the system to influence overhead electrical discharge processes. One or more voltage biasing elements are arranged to bias a first of the lightning arrestors to a different respective potential than a second of the lightning arrestors. The respective potentials to which the lightning arrestors are biased are below a corona discharge limit.","In another exemplary approach, a system for defending a site involves altering the path of an overhead lightning discharge. The illustrative system includes a sensor network arranged to detect a lightning step leader descending from an overhead atmospheric charge accumulation and\/or an upward rising earth streamer. The system includes devices (e.g., lasers, charge guns, etc.) for making ionized path segments in the atmosphere to extend or limit progress of the lightning step leader and\/or earth streamer in selected directions.","Throughout the figures, unless otherwise stated, the same reference numerals and characters are used to denote like features, elements, components, or portions of the illustrated embodiments.","In the following description of exemplary embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. It will be understood that embodiments described herein are examples, but are not meant to be limiting. Further, it will be appreciated that the solutions described herein can be practiced or implemented by other than the described embodiments. Modified embodiments or alternate embodiments may be utilized, in the sprit and scope of the solutions described herein.","In an exemplary approach for protecting a site from lightning strikes emanating from overhead charge accumulations, electrostatic fields above the site may be modified by applying external voltages to air termination networks deployed at the site. The modification of the electrostatic fields, which may be dynamic in response to changing weather conditions, may be expected to help dissipate the overhead charge accumulations and\/or relocate possible lightning strikes away from the protected site.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","210","212","220","230","200","240","200","240","200","200","250","200","250","200","212","240"]},"Air termination network  may include one or more lightning arrestors arranged to interact with or intercept an atmospheric electrical discharge or lightning stroke. The number and type of lightning arrestors in air termination network  may be selected in consideration of the type of structure or site to be protected by air termination network . When the structure to be protected is a building, air termination network  may, for example, include a plurality of vertical metal (e.g., copper or aluminum) lightning rods disposed on the roof of the building. When the structure to be protected is a high voltage power transmission line, air termination network  may, for example, include conducting ropes, cables, netting, mesh, extended surfaces and\/or rods. It will be understood that structures and sites that can be protected by air termination network  are not limited to a particular type or size of structures (e.g., a building) but may include combinations of several types of structures (e.g., buildings, power lines, transmission line towers, antennas, etc.) of any size or extent.","In system , down conductor system  connects air termination network to an earth termination network . Down conductor system  may be suitably arranged to provide a lightning stroke current a low impedance path to earth termination network . Down conductor system  may include any suitable arrangement of conducting cables and\/or wires for this purpose. Likewise, earth termination network  may include any combination of earthed rods, plates and\/or conductors arranged for safe dissipation of the stroke current into the ground or a ground equivalent.","Further, in system , voltage biasing elements  may be EMF sources, which are coupled to one or more individual lightning arrestors in air termination network . Voltage biasing elements  may, for example, include capacitors, a voltage amplifier and\/or very high impedance high-voltage (\u02dc0.1-1 MV; \u02dc10-1000 micro amp) power supplies. The power supplies may, for example, be energized by solar photovoltaic arrays deployed in outdoor locations.","Voltage biasing elements  may be disposed anywhere between ground and lighting arrestors' tips. Thus, voltage biasing elements  may be disposed in air termination network  and\/or down conductor system  as convenient or appropriate. It will be understood that voltage biasing elements  may be provided with protective active elements (not shown) configured to block or divert over-voltages and\/or over-currents, which may arise in the operation of air termination network . Voltage biasing elements  may be configured to raise or lower the potential at about an end of a lighting arrestor by an applied potential amount Vrelative to a reference potential. The reference potential may, for example, be another lighting arrestor's potential, ground potential, or other intermediate potential. Further, voltage biasing elements  may be configured to apply the potential Vcontinuously or intermittently over selected time intervals.","Raising or lowering a lighting arrestor's potential by a bias voltage Vmay provide polarizing fields above the lighting arrestor that interact with overhead atmospheric charge accumulations. The polarizing fields may allow system  to preferentially source or sink electric charge to or from overhead atmospheric charge accumulations via the biased, relative to an identical unbiased or \u2018simply grounded\u2019 lightning arrestor in the same location at the same instant-in-time. From another perspective view, biasing the lightning arrestor may provide a \u2018virtual\u2019 lightning arrestor of much greater \u201ceffective height\u201d than anything else in the vicinity. The effective height of the lightning arrestor may be selected by applying a suitable amount of bias voltage so that all proximate objects are robustly defended from the damaging effects of lightning stroke currents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"310","sub":["b ","b ","b "]},"Modification of overhead atmospheric charge accumulations by polarizing fields created by the bias voltage applied to the lightning arrestor may be expected to provide spatial and temporal control over dissipation of lightning stroke energy emanating from the overhead charge accumulations. The amount of bias voltage may, for example, be selected to break down air and provisionally or peremptorily prepare a sufficiently large conducting path between ground and the overhead charge accumulations to reduce the latter. The time interval over which the bias voltage is applied may be selected in consideration of the dynamics of overhead charge accumulations and the rates of charge dissipation by the \u201cvirtual\u201d portion of the lightning arrestor created by the bias voltage. Such consideration may include consideration of the rates of charge dissipation by the bias voltage-induced virtual portion of the lightning arrestor relative to, for example, a meteorologically maximum feasible rate of accumulation of overhead charges. It may be necessary to apply the bias voltage to the lightning arrestor only momentarily or only as a transient to prepare a conducting path for dissipating dangerous overhead charge accumulations.","The amount and application times of bias voltage applied to rod A may be selected to provide adequate provisional or preemptory conductive paths from overhead charge accumulations to ground, which make it effectively impossible for a lightning bolt to strike within a select distance in space and time from lightning rod A. Suitable theoretical or empirical models of atmospheric charge accumulations and their interactions with lightning arrestors may be developed and used to compute the amount and timing of bias voltages applications required to prevent a lightning bolt from striking within a selected distance from lightning rod A.","With renewed reference to , controller  may have any suitable mechanical or electromechanical structure. Further, controller  may optionally include or be coupled to a processor  and\/or a programmable interface . Controller  may be configured to implement suitable biasing schedules (e.g., timing, amount and sign of bias voltages Vb applied by voltage biasing elements ) for various lightning arrestors. Controller \/processor  may determine the suitable biasing schedules based, for example, on signals generated by sensor network  and\/or other external devices. Algorithms for determining the suitable biasing schedules and the responses of system \/controller  to various sensor network  signals and\/or other control signals may be set up or programmed by a user, for example, through programmable interface .","Processor  may use the algorithms to compute model lightning strike-safe distances and corresponding voltage biasing schedules for the lightning arrestors in air termination network . Processor  may be configured to obtain air termination network  conditions and weather conditions at or about air termination network  and its protected structures from sensor network  or other external sources (e.g., meteorological stations). Processor  may be further configured to develop prophylactic voltage biasing schedules to prevent imminent lightning strikes from present and\/or forecasted overhead charge accumulations. Further, controller  may be configured to dynamically implement the prophylactic voltage biasing schedules generated by the processor or other voltage biasing schedules on the lightning arrestors in air termination network .","The development of the voltage biasing schedules may also include consideration of the spatial distribution of lightning arrestors in air termination network , and consideration of a user-defined prioritization or ranking of different portions of the protected structure or site according to importance for protection from atmospheric electrical discharges. A user-defined ranking may, for example, deem a portion of a protected structure that houses computer or other sensitive electronic equipment as needing more or better protection from lightning strikes than other portions of the protected structure that do not house such equipment. Accordingly, the voltage biasing schedules may include spatial variation in the biasing of a distribution of lightning arrestors in air termination network  to provide more or better lightning strike protection for the priority portions of the protected structure.","More generally, variation in potential biasing of a spatial distribution of lightning arrestors may be used to control a location of the provisional or preemptive conducting path from overhead charge accumulations to ground.  shows, for example, an air termination network  deployed to defend site . Different lightning arrestors (e.g., rods -) in air termination network  may be charged by respective voltage biasing elements to different respective potentials to defend site  from atmospheric electrical discharges. At least one lighting arrestor may be charged to a potential in anticipation of a lightning strike. A first lightning arrestor (e.g., rod ) may be charged to a positive potential and a second lightning arrestor (e.g., rod ) may be charged to a negative potential relative to a site or reference potential. Further, air termination network  may include a sequence of alternating positively and negatively charged lightning arrestors (e.g., rods  and ).","Site  defended by deploying air termination network  may, for example, be an overhead AC transmission line from lightning or atmospheric electrical discharges. In this example, air termination network  may include a sequence of lightning arrestors that are alternating positively and negatively charged to potentials having magnitudes greater than a peak line voltage on the overhead AC transmission line. Alternatively or additionally, site  by deploying air termination network  may include an overhead DC transmission line. In this example, air termination network  may include a sequence of lightning arrestors that are respectively charged to potentials greater and less than a line voltage on the overhead DC transmission line.","It will be understood that the lightning arrestors in air termination network  are shown to have rod-like long shapes (e.g., rods -) only for example. In practice the lightning arrestors may have any geometrical shape appropriate for defending a particular site from lightning strikes. A lightning arrestor may have a long shape (e.g., rods, wires, Franklin-type lightning rods, spikes, etc.) that is conducive to directional emission of charges from an arrestor end. Alternatively or additionally, a lightning arrestor may have a rounded or planar shape having an extended surface (e.g., panels, plates, conducting shields, walls of Faraday cage-like structures, etc.) that may emit charges non-directionally or less directionally than a long-shape lightning arrestor. At least one of the plurality of lightning arrestors in an air termination network may have a rod-, rope-, cable-, wire-, mesh-, netting-, strip-, plate-, panel-, wall-, and\/or other extended surface-shape.","In another exemplary approach for protecting a site from lightning strikes from overhead charge accumulations involves a dynamic defense. In this approach, artificial man-made conducting channels of ionized air may be created in the atmosphere in a controlled manner. The artificial man-made conducting channels of ionized air may be expected to help dissipate overhead charge accumulations and to reduce damage from randomly located lightning strikes.","A lightning discharge or flash (e.g., a cloud-to-ground discharge) is a transient current of high intensity often spanning several kilometers. A cloud-to-ground discharge may be made up of a series of partial discharges separated in time by 40-50 milliseconds and lasting about 200 milliseconds for a total flash.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600"]},"System  includes a sensor network  arranged to detect lightning step leaders and\/or return strokes in the vicinity of a defended site, and a device  for preparing or creating charge conducting channels in the atmosphere.

Further, system  includes a controller\/processor , which is configured to supervise or co-ordinate operation of system components.
