Other enzyme examples are xylanases, lactase, amylase, chitinase, sucrase, maltase, and neuraminidase.","The sugar moiety of the triterpenoid saponin (example Xanifolia Y) can be removed by acid hydrolysis. The synthetic compound of ACH-Y is obtained. The ACH-Y is a triterpene with acyl groups but no sugar moiety. The acyl group of the saponin (example Xanifolia Y) can be removed by alkaline hydrolysis. A synthetic compound of AKOH-Y can be obtained. The AKOH-Y is a pentacyclic triterpene with sugar moieties. A pentacyclic triterpene can be obtained by acid and alkaline hydrolysis of saponin from natural source. A pentacyclic triterpene also can be obtained by other methods (Reference: Surendra et al., Rapid and Enantioselective Synthetic Approches to Germanicol and Other Pentacyclic Triterpenes). The pentacyclic triterpene with sugar moieties can also be obtained with synthesis (Reference: Ple et al., Synthesis of L-arabinopyranose containing hederagenin saponins). Acylation is the process of adding an acyl group to a compound. Friedel-Crafts reaction is an example of the process. An active compound can be obtained by acylating a pentacyclic triterpene. In an embodiment, acylating C21 and C22 of a pentacyclic triterpene gives an anticancer compound. In an embodiment, sugar moiety(s) at C3 can increase the activities of pentacyclic triterpene, wherein the triterpene has acyl group(s), wherein the acyl group(s) may be at C21, 22, or 28.
