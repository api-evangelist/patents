title: Method and apparatus for processing metadata
abstract: Methods and apparatuses for processing metadata are described herein. In one embodiment, when a file (e.g., a text, audio, and/or image files) having metadata is received, the metadata and optionally at least a portion of the content of the file are extracted from the file to generate a first set of metadata. An analysis is performed on the extracted metadata and the content to generate a second set of metadata, which may include metadata in addition to the first set of metadata. The second set of metadata may be stored in a database suitable to be searched to identify or locate the file. Other methods and apparatuses are also described.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/877,584, filed on Jun. 25, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,730,012. This application also claims priority to co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/643,087 filed on Jan. 7, 2005, which provisional application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; this application claims the benefit of the provisional's filing date under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e). This present application hereby claims the benefit of these earlier filing dates under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","The present invention relates generally to data processing. More particularly, this invention relates to processing metadata.","Modern data processing systems, such as general purpose computer systems, allow the users of such systems to create a variety of different types of data files. For example, a typical user of a data processing system may create text files with a word processing program such as Microsoft Word or may create an image file with an image processing program such as Adobe's PhotoShop. Numerous other types of files are capable of being created or modified, edited, and otherwise used by one or more users for a typical data processing system. The large number of the different types of files that can be created or modified can present a challenge to a typical user who is seeking to find a particular file which has been created.","Modern data processing systems often include a file management system which allows a user to place files in various directories or subdirectories (e.g. folders) and allows a user to give the file a name. Further, these file management systems often allow a user to find a file by searching for the file's name, or the date of creation, or the date of modification, or the type of file. An example of such a file management system is the Finder program which operates on Macintosh computers from Apple Computer, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. Another example of a file management system program is the Windows Explorer program which operates on the Windows operating system from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Both the Finder program and the Windows Explorer program include a find command which allows a user to search for files by various criteria including a file name or a date of creation or a date of modification or the type of file. However, this search capability searches through information which is the same for each file, regardless of the type of file. Thus, for example, the searchable data for a Microsoft Word file is the same as the searchable data for an Adobe PhotoShop file, and this data typically includes the file name, the type of file, the date of creation, the date of last modification, the size of the file and certain other parameters which may be maintained for the file by the file management system.","Certain presently existing application programs allow a user to maintain data about a particular file. This data about a particular file may be considered metadata because it is data about other data. This metadata for a particular file may include information about the author of a file, a summary of the document, and various other types of information. A program such as Microsoft Word may automatically create some of this data when a user creates a file and the user may add additional data or edit the data by selecting the \u201cproperty sheet\u201d from a menu selection in Microsoft Word. The property sheets in Microsoft Word allow a user to create metadata for a particular file or document. However, in existing systems, a user is not able to search for metadata across a variety of different applications using one search request from the user. Furthermore, existing systems can perform one search for data files, but this search does not also include searching through metadata for those files. Further, the metadata associated with a file is typically limited to those standardized metadata or content of the file.","Methods and apparatuses for processing metadata are described herein. In one embodiment, when a file (e.g., a text, audio, and\/or image files) having metadata is received, the metadata and optionally at least a portion of the content of the file are extracted from the file to generate a first set of metadata. An analysis is performed on the extracted metadata and the content to generate a second set of metadata, which may include metadata in addition to the first set of metadata. The second set of metadata may be stored in a database suitable to be searched to identify or locate the file.","According to certain embodiments of the invention, the metadata that can be searched, for example, to locate or identify a file, may include additional metadata generated based on the original metadata associated with the file and\/or at least a portion of content of the file, which may not exist in the original metadata and\/or content of the file. In one embodiment, the additional metadata may be generated via an analysis performed on the original metadata and\/or at least a portion of the content of the file. The additional metadata may capture a higher level concept or broader scope information regarding the content of the file.","Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","Methods and apparatuses for processing metadata are described herein. In the following description, numerous details are set forth to provide a more thorough explanation of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"As shown in , the computer system , which is a form of a data processing system, includes a bus  which is coupled to a microprocessor(s)  and a ROM (Read Only Memory)  and volatile RAM  and a non-volatile memory . The microprocessor  may be a G3 or G4 microprocessor from Motorola, Inc. or one or more G5 microprocessors from IBM. The bus  interconnects these various components together and also interconnects these components , , , and  to a display controller and display device  and to peripheral devices such as input\/output (I\/O) devices which may be mice, keyboards, modems, network interfaces, printers and other devices which are well known in the art. Typically, the input\/output devices  are coupled to the system through input\/output controllers . The volatile RAM (Random Access Memory)  is typically implemented as dynamic RAM (DRAM) which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. The mass storage  is typically a magnetic hard drive or a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive or a DVD RAM or other types of memory systems which maintain data (e.g. large amounts of data) even after power is removed from the system. Typically, the mass storage  will also be a random access memory although this is not required. While  shows that the mass storage  is a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system, it will be appreciated that the present invention may utilize a non-volatile memory which is remote from the system, such as a network storage device which is coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface. The bus  may include one or more buses connected to each other through various bridges, controllers and\/or adapters as is well known in the art. In one embodiment the I\/O controller  includes a USB (Universal Serial Bus) adapter for controlling USB peripherals and an IEEE 1394 controller for IEEE 1394 compliant peripherals.","It will be apparent from this description that aspects of the present invention may be embodied, at least in part, in software. That is, the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor, such as a microprocessor, executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory, such as ROM , RAM , mass storage  or a remote storage device. In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the present invention. Thus, the techniques are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system. In addition, throughout this description, various functions and operations are described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However, those skilled in the art will recognize what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code by a processor, such as the microprocessor .","Capturing and Use of Metadata Across a Variety of Application Programs",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["201","203","205","207","207"]},"The method of  may be implemented for programs which do not store or provide metadata. In this circumstance, a portion of the operating system provides for the capture of the metadata from the variety of different programs even though the programs have not been designed to provide or capture metadata. For those programs which do allow a user to create metadata for a particular document, certain embodiments of the present invention may allow the exporting back of captured metadata back into data files for applications which maintain metadata about their data files.","The method of  allows information about a variety of different files created by a variety of different application programs to be accessible by a system wide searching facility, which is similar to the way in which prior art versions of the Finder or Windows Explorer can search for file names, dates of creation, etc. across a variety of different application programs. Thus, the metadata for a variety of different files created by a variety of different application programs can be accessed through an extension of an operating system, and an example of such an extension is shown in  as a metadata processing software which interacts with other components of the system and will be described further below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["301","331"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"11"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"11","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"Copied",{}]},{"entry":["Item","Parent in",{},{},{},"Multi-",{},"User",{},"with","App"]},{"entry":["name","hierarchy","Attribute name","Description\/Notes","CFType","value","Localized","settable","Gettable","copy","viewable"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"11","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Item","n\/a","Authors","Who created or","CFString","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Address"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"contributed to the",{},{},{},{},{},{},"Book"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"contents of this item"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Comment","A free form text","CFString","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"comment"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ContentType","This is the type that is","CFString","No","?","No","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"determined by UTI"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ContentTypes","This is the inheritance of","CFString","Yes","?","No","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"the UTI system"]},{"entry":[{},{},"CreatedDate","When was this item","CFDate","No","No","No","Yes","Yes"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"created"]},{"entry":[{},{},"DisplayName","The name of the item as","CFString","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Finder (or"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"the user would like to",{},{},{},{},{},{},"Launch"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"read it.

formats would be a field which includes an identifier of a plug in or other software element which may be used to capture metadata from a data file and\/or export metadata back to the creator application.","Various different software architectures may be used to implement the functions and operations described herein. The following discussion provides one example of such an architecture, but it will be understood that alternative architectures may also be employed to achieve the same or similar results. The software architecture shown in  is an example which is based upon the Macintosh operating system. The architecture  includes a metadata processing software  and an operating system (OS) kernel  which is operatively coupled to the metadata processing software  for a notification mechanism which is described below. The metadata processing software  is also coupled to other software programs such as a file system graphical user interface software  (which may be the Finder), an email software , and other applications . These applications are coupled to the metadata processing software  through client application program interface  which provide a method for transferring data and commands between the metadata processing software  and the software , , and . These commands and data may include search parameters specified by a user as well as commands to perform searches from the user, which parameters and commands are passed to the metadata processing software  through the interface . The metadata processing software  is also coupled to a collection of importers  which extract data from various applications. In particular, in one exemplary embodiment, a text importer is used to extract text and other information from word processing or text processing files created by word processing programs such as Microsoft Word, etc. This extracted information is the metadata for a particular file. Other types of importers extract metadata from other types of files, such as image files or music files. In this particular embodiment, a particular importer is selected based upon the type of file which has been created and modified by an application program. For example, if the data file was created by PhotoShop, then an image importer for PhotoShop may be used to input the metadata from a PhotoShop data file into the metadata database  through the metadata processing software . On the other hand, if the data file is a word processing document, then an importer designed to extract metadata from a word processing document is called upon to extract the metadata from the word processing data file and place it into the metadata database  through the metadata processing software . Typically, a plurality of different importers may be required in order to handle the plurality of different application programs which are used in a typical computer system. The importers  may optionally include a plurality of exporters which are capable of exporting the extracted metadata for particular types of data files back to property sheets or other data components maintained by certain application programs. For example, certain application programs may maintain some metadata for each data file created by the program, but this metadata is only a subset of the metadata extracted by an importer from this type of data file. In this instance, the exporter may export back additional metadata or may simply insert metadata into blank fields of metadata maintained by the application program.","The software architecture  also includes a file system directory  for the metadata. This file system directory keeps track of the relationship between the data files and their metadata and keeps track of the location of the metadata object (e.g. a metadata file which corresponds to the data file from which it was extracted) created by each importer. In one exemplary embodiment, the metadata database is maintained as a flat file format as described below, and the file system directory  maintains this flat file format. One advantage of a flat file format is that the data is laid out on a storage device as a string of data without references between fields from one metadata file (corresponding to a particular data file) to another metadata file (corresponding to another data file). This arrangement of data will often result in faster retrieval of information from the metadata database .","The software architecture  of  also includes find by content software  which is operatively coupled to a database  which includes an index of files. The index of files represents at least a subset of the data files in a storage device and may include all of the data files in a particular storage device (or several storage devices), such as the main hard drive of a computer system. The index of files may be a conventional indexed representation of the content of each document. The find by content software  searches for words in that content by searching through the database  to see if a particular word exists in any of the data files which have been indexed. The find by content software functionality is available through the metadata processing software  which provides the advantage to the user that the user can search concurrently both the index of files in the database  (for the content within a file) as well as the metadata for the various data files being searched. The software architecture shown in  may be used to perform the method shown in  or alternative architectures may be used to perform the method of .","The method of  may begin in operation  in which a notification of a change for a file is received. This notification may come from the OS kernel  which notifies the metadata processing software  that a file has been changed. This notification may come from sniffer software elements which detect new or modified files and deletion of files. This change may be the creation of a new file or the modification of an existing file or the deletion of an existing file. The deletion of an existing file causes a special case of the processing method of  and is not shown in . In the case of a deletion, the metadata processing software , through the use of the file system directory , deletes the metadata file in the metadata database  which corresponds to the deleted file. The other types of operations, such as the creation of a new file or the modification of an existing file, causes the processing to proceed from operation  to operation  in which the type of file which is the subject of the notification is determined. The file may be an Acrobat PDF file or an RTF word processing file or a JPEG image file, etc. In any case, the type of the file is determined in operation . This may be performed by receiving from the OS kernel  the type of file along with the notification or the metadata processing software  may request an identification of the type of file from the file system graphical user interface software  or similar software which maintains information about the data file, such as the creator application or parent application of the data file. It will be understood that in one exemplary embodiment, the file system graphical user interface software  is the Finder program which operates on the Macintosh operating system. In alternative embodiments, the file system graphical user interface system may be Windows Explorer which operates on Microsoft's Windows operating system. After the type of file has been determined in operation , the appropriate capture software (e.g. one of the importers ) is activated for the determined file type. The importers may be a plug-in for the particular application which created the type of file about which notification is received in operation . Once activated, the importer or capture software imports the appropriate metadata (for the particular file type) into the metadata database, such as metadata database  as shown in operation . Then in operation , the metadata is stored in the database. In one exemplary embodiment, it may be stored in a flat file format. Then in operation , the metadata processing software  receives search parameter inputs and performs a search of the metadata database (and optionally also causes a search of non-metadata sources such as the index of files ) and causes the results of the search to be displayed in a user interface. This may be performed by exchanging information between one of the applications, such as the software  or the software  or the other applications  and the metadata processing software  through the interface . For example, the file system software  may present a graphical user interface, allowing a user to input search parameters and allowing the user to cause a search to be performed. This information is conveyed through the interface  to the metadata processing software  which causes a search through the metadata database  and also may cause a search through the database  of the indexed files in order to search for content within each data file which has been indexed. The results from these searches are provided by the metadata processing software  to the requesting application which, in the example given here, was the software , but it will be appreciated that other components of software, such as the email software , may be used to receive the search inputs and to provide a display of the search results. Various examples of the user interface for inputting search requests and for displaying search results are described herein and shown in the accompanying drawings.","It will be appreciated that the notification, if done through the OS kernel, is a global, system wide notification process such that changes to any file will cause a notification to be sent to the metadata processing software. It will also be appreciated that in alternative embodiments, each application program may itself generate the necessary metadata and provide the metadata directly to a metadata database without the requirement of a notification from an operating system kernel or from the intervention of importers, such as the importers . Alternatively, rather than using OS kernel notifications, an embodiment may use software calls from each application to a metadata processing software which receives these calls and then imports the metadata from each file in response to the call.","As noted above, the metadata database  may be stored in a flat file format in order to improve the speed of retrieval of information in most circumstances. The flat file format may be considered to be a non-B tree, non-hash tree format in which data is not attempted to be organized but is rather stored as a stream of data. Each metadata object or metadata file will itself contain fields, such as the fields shown in the examples of . However, there will typically be no relationship or reference or pointer from one field in one metadata file to the corresponding field (or another field) in the next metadata file or in another metadata file of the same file type.  shows an example of the layout in a flat file format of metadata. The format  includes a plurality of metadata files for a corresponding plurality of data files. As shown in , metadata file  is metadata from file  of application A and may be referred to as metadata file A. Similarly, metadata file  is metadata from file  of application B and may be referred to as metadata file B. Each of these metadata files typically would include fields which are not linked to other fields and which do not contain references or pointers to other fields in other metadata files. It can be seen from  that the metadata database of  includes metadata files from a plurality of different applications (applications A, B, and C) and different files created by each of those applications. Metadata files , , , and  are additional metadata files created by applications A, B, and C as shown in .","A flexible query language may be used to search the metadata database in the same way that such query languages are used to search other databases. The data within each metadata file may be packed or even compressed if desirable. As noted above, each metadata file, in certain embodiments, will include a persistent identifier which uniquely identifies its corresponding data file. This identifier remains the same even if the name of the file is changed or the file is modified. This allows for the persistent association between the particular data file and its metadata.","User Interface Aspects","Various different examples of user interfaces for inputting search parameters and for displaying search results are provided herein. It will be understood that some features from certain embodiments may be mixed with other embodiments such that hybrid embodiments may result from these combinations. It will be appreciated that certain features may be removed from each of these embodiments and still provide adequate functionality in many instances.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["701","703","703","701","705","701","707","713","715","717","701","709","711","701","729","701","734","735","736","701","731","701","732","733","701","705","705","721","722","723","701","721","721"]},"The combination of text entry region  and the search parameter menu bar allow a user to specify a search query or search parameters. Each of the configurable pull down menus presents a user with a list of options to select from when the user activates the pull down menu. As shown in , the user has already made a selection from the configurable pull down menu  to specify the location of the search, which in this case specifies that the search will occur on the local disks of the computer systems. Configurable pull down menu  has also been used by the user to specify the kind of document which is to be searched for, which in this case is an image document as indicated by the configurable pull down menu  which indicates \u201cimages\u201d as the selected configuration of this menu and hence the search parameter which it specifies. The configurable pull down menu , as shown in , represents an add search parameter pull down menu. This add search parameter pull down menu allows the user to add additional criteria to the search query to further limit the search results. In the embodiment shown in , each of the search parameters is logically ANDed in a Boolean manner. Thus the current search parameter specified by the user in the state shown in  searches all local disks for all images, and the user is in the middle of the process of selecting another search criteria by having selected the add search criteria pull down menu , resulting in the display of the pull down menu , which has a plurality of options which may be selected by the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":["701","719","719","719"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 7C","FIG. 7D","FIG. 7D","FIG. 7D","FIG. 7E","FIG. 7A-7E","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A-7E","FIG. 7D"],"b":["701","719","718","718","718","717","718","717","707","718","718","718","701","717","719","713","713","707","718","717"]},"It will also be appreciated that the various options in the pull down menus may depend upon the fields within a particular type of metadata file. For example, the selection of \u201cimages\u201d to be searched may cause the various fields present in the metadata for an image type file to appear in one or more pull down menus, allowing the user to search within one or more of those fields for that particular type of file. Other fields which do not apply to \u201cimages\u201d types of files may not appear in these menus in order reduce the complexity of the menus and to prevent user confusion.","Another feature of the present invention is shown in . In particular, the side bar region A, which is the user-configurable portion of the side bar, includes a representation of a folder  which represents the search results obtained from a particular search, which search results may be static or they may be dynamic in that, in certain instances, the search can be performed again to obtain results based on the current files in the system. The folder  in the example shown in  represents a search on a local disk for all images done on December 10. By selecting this folder in the side bar region A, the user may cause the display in the display region  of the results of that search. In this way, a user may retrieve a search result automatically by saving the search result into the side bar region A. One mechanism for causing a search result or a search query to be saved into the side bar region A is to select the add folder button  which appears in the bottom portion of the window . By selecting this button, the current search result or search query is saved as a list of files and other objects retrieved in the current search result. In the case where the search query is saved for later use rather than the saving of a search result, then the current search query is saved for re-use at a later time in order to find files which match the search query at that later time.

Each file may be individually marked using a specific command (e.g. pressing the right button on a mouse and selecting a command from a menu which appears on the screen, which command may be \u201cadd selection to current group\u201d) or similar such commands. By individually selecting such files or by selecting a group of files at once, the user may associate this group of files into a selected group or a \u201cmarked\u201d group and this association may be used to perform a common action on all of the files in the group (e.g. print each file or view each file in a viewer window or move each file to a new or existing folder, etc.). A representation of this marked group appears as a folder in the user-configurable portion A. An example of such a folder is the folder  shown in the user-configurable portion A. By selecting this folder (e.g. by positioning a cursor over the folder  and pressing and releasing a mouse button or by pressing another button) the user, as a result of this selection, will cause the display within the display region  of the files which have been grouped together or marked. Alternatively, a separate window may appear showing only the items which have been marked or grouped. This association or grouping may be merely temporary or it may be made permanent by retaining a list of all the files which have been grouped and by keeping a folder  or other representations of the grouping within the user-configurable side bar, such as the side bar A. Certain embodiments may allow multiple, different groupings to exist at the same time, and each of these groupings or associations may be merely temporary (e.g. they exist only while the search results window is displayed), or they may be made permanent by retaining a list of all the files which have been grouped within each separate group. It will be appreciated that the files within each group may have been created from different applications.

In one embodiment, the additional metadata may be generated via an analysis performed on the original metadata and\/or at least a portion of the content of the file. The additional metadata may capture a higher level concept or broader scope information regarding the content of the file.","For example, according to one embodiment, if a text file or a word document contains first metadata or content of \u201cNike\u201d (e.g., a shoe designer), \u201cCallaway\u201d (e.g., a golf club designer), and \u201cTiger Woods\u201d (e.g., a professional golf player), based on an analysis on these terms, additional metadata (e.g., second metadata) generated may include \u201cGolf\u201d and\/or \u201cPGA Tournament\u201d, etc., although the additional metadata may not exist in the file's content of metadata. Subsequently, when a search is conducted on a term such as \u201cgolf\u201d, the file may be identified since the file contains the first metadata (e.g., \u201cNike\u201d, \u201cCallaway\u201d, and \u201cTiger Woods\u201d) likely related to the term being searched (e.g., golf). As a result, although a user searches a term that is not contained in the file, the file may still be identified as a part of a search result because the file contains certain terms that are considered related to the term being searched based on an analysis.","In at least certain embodiments, a file is analyzed algorithmically in order to derive or generate metadata for the file and this metadata is added to a metadata database, such as metadata database  of .

Metadata importer  may be a third party application or driver that is dedicated to import the metadata from a particular file format produced by the third party application or drives. For example, metadata importer  may be a PDF metadata importer that is dedicated to import metadata from a PDF file and the metadata importer  may be designed and\/or provided by a PDF file designer (e.g., Adobe System) or its partners. The metadata importer  may be communicatively coupled to the metadata analysis module via an API (application programming interface) such as, for example, as a plug-in application or driver.","In response to the first metadata set , according to one embodiment, the metadata analysis module  performs an analysis (e.g., a semantic analysis) on the first metadata set  and generates additional metadata, a second metadata set . At least a portion of the first and\/or second metadata sets may then be stored in the metadata database  in a manner suitable to be searched to identify or locate the file subsequently, using one of the techniques described above. In addition to generating a second metadata set, or as an alternative to generating the second metadata set, a content analyzer may analyze the content of a file and generate metadata which is added to metadata database .","In one embodiment, the metadata analysis module  may perform the analysis using a variety of analytical techniques including, but not limited to, the following techniques:","Latent semantic analysis (LSA)","Tokenization","Stemming","Concept extraction","Spectrum analysis and\/or filtering","Optical character recognition (OCR)","Voice recognition (also referred to as speech-to-text operations)","Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a statistical model of words usage that permits comparisons of the semantic similarity between pieces of textual information. LSA was originally designed to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval (IR) methods by performing retrieval based on the derived \u201csemantic\u201d content of words in a query as opposed to performing direct word matching. This approach avoids some of the problem of synonymy, in which different words can be used to describe the same semantic concept.","The primary assumption of LSA is that there is some underlying or \u201clatent\u201d structure in the pattern of word usage across documents, and that statistical techniques can be used to estimate this latent structure. The term \u201cdocument\u201d in this case, can be thought of as contexts in which words occur and also could be smaller text segments such as individual paragraphs or sentences. Through an analysis of the associations among words and documents, the method produces a representation in which words that are used in similar contexts will be more semantically associated.","Typically, in order to analyze a text, LSA first generates a matrix of occurrences of each word in each document (e.g., sentences or paragraphs). LSA then uses singular-value decomposition (SVD), a technique closely related to eigenvector decomposition and factor analysis. The SVD scaling decomposes the word-by-document matrix into a set of k, typically ranging from 100 to 300, orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Instead of representing documents and terms directly as vectors of independent words, LSA represents them as continuous values on each of the k orthogonal indexing dimensions derived from the SVD analysis. Since the number of factors or dimensions is much smaller than the number of unique terms, words will not be independent. For example, if two terms are used in similar contexts (documents), they will have similar vectors in the reduced-dimensional LSA representation. One advantage of this approach is that matching can be done between two pieces of textual information, even if they have no words in common.","For example, to illustrate this, if the LSA was trained on a large number of documents, including the following two:","1) The U.S.S. Nashville arrived in Colon harbor with 42 marines","2) With the warship in Colon harbor, the Colombian troops withdrew.","The vector for the word \u201cwarship\u201d would be similar to that of the word \u201cNashville\u201d because both words occur in the same context of other words such as \u201cColon\u201d and \u201charbor\u201d. Thus, the LSA technique automatically captures deeper associative structure than simple term-term correlations and clusters. One can interpret the analysis performed by SVD geometrically. The result of the SVD is a k-dimensional vector space containing a vector for each term and each document. The location of term vectors reflects the correlations in their usage across documents. Similarly, the location of document vectors reflects correlations in the terms used in the documents. In this space the cosine or dot product between vectors corresponds to their estimated semantic similarity. Thus, by determining the vectors of two pieces of textual information, the semantic similarity between them can be determined.","Tokenization is a process of converting a string of characters into a list of words and other significant elements. However, in most cases, morphological variants of words have similar semantic interpretations and can be considered as equivalent for the purpose of IR applications. For this reason, a number of so-called stemming algorithms, or stemmers, have been developed, which attempt to reduce a word to its stem or root form. Thus, the key terms of a query or document are represented by stems rather than by the original words. This not only means that different variants of a term can be conflated to a single representative form, it also reduces the dictionary size (e.g., the number of distinct terms needed for representing a set of documents). A smaller dictionary size results in a saving of storage space and processing time.","At least for certain embodiments, it does not usually matter whether the stems generated are genuine words or not. Thus, \u201ccomputation\u201d might be stemmed to \u201ccomput\u201d, provided that (a) different words with the same base meaning are conflated to the same form, and (b) words with distinct meanings are kept separately. An algorithm, which attempts to convert a word to its linguistically correct root (\u201ccompute\u201d in this case), is sometimes called a lemmatiser. Examples of stemming algorithms may include, but are not limited to, Paice\/Husk, Porter, Lovins, Dawson, and Krovetz stemming algorithms. Typically, once the sentences of a document have been processed into a list of words, LSA may be applied to the words.","Concept extraction is a technique used for mining textual information based on finding common \u201cthemes\u201d or \u201cconcept\u201d in a given document. Concept extraction technique may also be used to extract some semantic features from raw text which are then linked together in a structure which represents the text's thematic content. Content extraction technique may be combined with LSA to analyze the first metadata set and generate the second metadata set, according to one embodiment.","A spectrum is normally referred to as a range of color or a function of frequency or wavelength, which may represent electromagnetic energy. The word spectrum also takes on the obvious analogous meaning in reference to other sorts of waves, such as sound wave, or other sorts of decomposition into frequency components. Thus, a spectrum is a usually a two-dimensional plot of a compound signal, depicting the components by another measure. For example, frequency spectrum is a result of Fourier-related transform of a mathematical function into a frequency domain.","According to one embodiment, spectrum analysis\/filtering may be used to analyze an image and\/or an audio in the frequency domain, in order to separate certain components from the image and\/or audio sound. For example, spectrum analysis\/filtering may be used to separate different colors from the image or different tunes of an audio, etc. The spectrum analysis may be used to determine the type of music or sound for an audio file or the type of picture.","In addition to spectrum analysis\/filtering performed on an image, according to one embodiment, OCR (optical character recognition) may be used to recognize any text within the image. OCR is the recognition of printed or written text or characters by a computer. This involves photo scanning of the text character-by-character, analysis of the scanned-in image, and then translation of the character image into character codes, such as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), commonly used in data processing. During OCR processing, the scanned-in image or bitmap is analyzed for light and dark areas in order to identify each alphabetic letter or numeric digit. When a character is recognized, it is converted into an ASCII code. Special circuit boards and computer chips (e.g., digital signal processing or DSP chip) designed expressly for OCR may be used to speed up the recognition process.","Similarly, in addition to the spectrum analysis\/filtering performed on an audio, voice recognition (also referred to as speech-to-text) may be performed to recognize any text within the audio (e.g., words used in a song). Voice recognition is the field of computer science that deals with designing computer systems that can recognize spoken words and translate them into text. Once the text within an image and an audio has been extracted (e.g., via OCR and\/or voice recognition), other text related analysis techniques such as LSA, etc. may be applied. Note that, throughout this application, the above techniques are described by way of examples. They are not shown by way of limitations. Other techniques apparent to one with ordinary skill in the art may also be applied.","Referring back to , the operations involved in some or all of the above techniques may be handled by some or all of the modules -, individually or in combination. The operations may be performed sequentially or substantially concurrently. Modules - may be implemented as software, hardware, or a combination of both. Some or all of the modules - may be implemented locally or alternatively, they may be implemented remotely over a network (e.g., similar to external resources .). Note that exemplary system is shown for illustration purposes only, more or less of modules - may be implemented dependent upon a specification configuration. For example, some or all of the modules -, may be implemented separately. Alternatively, they may be implemented as a single module. Further, some or all of the functionality of modules - may be implemented within the metadata importer .","In addition, certain external resources  may be invoked to assist the analysis to obtain additional metadata. Some examples of the external resources  may include GPS (global positioning system) services, Web services, and\/or database services, etc. For example, in response to the first metadata as the example described above having the terms of \u201cNike\u201d, \u201cCallaway\u201d, and \u201cTiger Woods\u201d, the metadata analysis module  may access certain external resources, such as databases or Web sites over a network, to obtain additional information about the companies of Nike and\/or Callaway (e.g., company's press release or product announcements, etc.), as well as information regarding Tiger Woods (e.g., biography or world PGA ranking, etc.) At least a portion of the obtained information may be used as a part of the second metadata set , which may in turn be stored in the metadata database  in a manner suitable to be searched subsequently to identify or locate the file.

In response to the image file, the metadata associated with the file and\/or at least a portion of the content of the file may be extracted to generate a first metadata set (e.g., first metadata set  of ). In one embodiment, the first metadata set may be generated via an image metadata importer associated with the image file. For example, if the file is a JPEG file, a JPEG metadata importer that is able to decode the JPEG file format (e.g., JPEG 2000 compatible encoding, etc.) may be invoked to extract the metadata associated with the JPEG file such as, for example, those shown in .

The audio file may be received via a file system operation such as a write operation or alternatively, the audio file may be received over a network. In response to the audio file, the metadata associated with the file and at least a portion of the content of the file may be extracted to generate a first metadata set (e.g., first metadata set  of ). In one embodiment, the first metadata set may be generated via an audio metadata importer associated with the audio file.

According to one embodiment, the metadata importer  may invoke one or more of the modules - to generate the first metadata set . According to a further embodiment, the external resources  may be invoked by the metadata importer . In certain embodiments, the metadata importer may analyze, based on an algorithm, the audio file to derive additional metadata. For example, the metadata importer can keep track of when a song was last played and determine a pattern (e.g. the song is normally played within an hour of noon) and based upon this pattern, time related metadata or other metadata can be created. This time related metadata can be used to find songs played at a certain time or be used to create a time based favorites list. It will be appreciated that metadata can be exported by a software program which creates or modifies a file rather than by a separate, specific importer which is designed to extract the metadata from the file. In either case, the metadata can be considered to be imported into a metadata database, and thus the term \u201cmetadata importer\u201d is intended to encompass either mechanism of introducing metadata into a metadata database.","According to one embodiment, a metadata analysis may then be performed on the first metadata set and\/or at least a portion of the file content to generate a second metadata set (e.g., second metadata set ) in addition to the first metadata set.

For example, according to one embodiment, at block , a frequency analysis (e.g., using spectrum analysis\/filtering techniques) may be performed to determine the type of the music (e.g., Jazz or classical), and other audio related information.","Furthermore, according to one embodiment, at block , one or more external resources may be invoked to determine additional information regarding the audio. For example, external Web or database services may be invoked to determine biography information of the artist, and GPS services may be invoked to determine location and date when the audio was recorded (e.g., the location and date of the concert).","At block , any text (if there is any) existed in the audio, such as, for example, words used in a song, may be recognized, for example, using OCR techniques. Thereafter, any text metadata processing techniques, such as those described above (e.g., similar to operations of ) may be applied to obtain additional information.","At block , some or all of the first and second metadata sets may be stored in one or more databases (e.g., metadata database ) in a manner (e.g., category configuration examples shown in ) suitable to be searched subsequently to identify or locate the file. Other operations may also be performed.","Note that although a text file, an image file, and an audio file have been described above, they are illustrated by way of examples rather than by way of limitations. In fact, any of the above examples may be performed individually or in combination. For example, a word document may include text and an image. Some or all of the operations involved in  may be performed individually or in combination. For another example, a video clip may include a sequence of images and audio clips. As result, some or all of the operations involved in  may be performed individually or in combination. Other types of metadata may also be processed.","Thus, methods and apparatuses for processing metadata have been described herein. Some portions of the preceding detailed descriptions have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the ways used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. The operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the above discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing\u201d or \u201ccomputing\u201d or \u201ccalculating\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d or \u201cdisplaying\u201d or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","Embodiments of the present invention also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may include a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), erasable programmable ROMs (EPROMs), electrically erasable programmable ROMs (EEPROMs), magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, and each coupled to a computer system bus.","The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general-purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method operations. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.","A machine-readable medium may include any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable medium includes read only memory (\u201cROM\u201d); random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.); etc.","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.
