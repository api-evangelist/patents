title: Monolithic diode pumped solid-state laser for high shock environments
abstract: A diode pumped solid-state laser for high shock, high vibration environments such as those found in laser ignition systems for artillery systems which internally integrate into the breech of an artillery system such as a 155 mm howitzer. The diode pumped solid-state laser employs a unique gain medium mounting which permits its use in such high shock/high vibration environments. Contributing further to robustness is a monolithic design based on diode arrays mounted in a linear configuration along with an advanced polycrystalline gain medium laser rod. Advantageously, and in sharp contrast to laser ignition systems incorporating flash lamps, the diode pumped solid-state laser of the present invention permits a seamless integration into a howitzer artillery weapons system without other complex mounting provisions or shock isolation system(s). Of further advantage, the diode pumped solid-state laser of the present invention facilitates integration into existing breech hardware with relatively only minor modification. This simplifies design of allied such breech and laser assemblies, their integration requirements, and further results in a reduced total system weight.

However as might be appreciated, positioning a laser ignition system in the breech of such an artillery device presents numerous mechanical challenges in making the laser ignition system sufficiently robust to endure the extreme vibrations and shock produced in firing the artillery device. Further challenges include extreme environmental conditions such as heat, cold, wet or dry conditions also experienced with artillery systems as well as to withstand unfavorable electrostatic and electromagnetic environments.","This invention relates generally to the field of solid-state lasers and in particular is directed to a ruggedized solid-state laser for high shock and high vibration environments such as those found in artillery weapons.","The above problems are solved and an advance is made in the art according to the principles of the present invention directed to a diode pumped solid-state laser employing a unique gain medium mounting which permits its use in high shock\/high vibration environments such as those found in the breech of an artillery system. Contributing further to robustness is a monolithic design based on diode arrays mounted in a linear configuration along with an advanced polycrystalline gain medium laser rod. Advantageously, and in sharp contrast to prototype prior-art laser ignition systems incorporating flash lamps, the diode pumped solid-state laser of the present invention permits this seamless integration into a howitzer artillery weapons system without complex mounting provisions or shock isolation systems. Of further advantage the diode pumped solid-state laser of the present invention facilitates integration into existing breech hardware with only minor modification to existing breech hardware thereby simplifying the breech and laser assemblies and integration requirements while reducing total system weight.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide means for integrating a solid state laser ignition device into the breech mechanism of a large caliber Howitzer artillery weapon.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a solid state laser ignition device which can function dependably despite work environments of extreme shock, extreme vibration, extreme temperature ranges, electrostatic and electromagnetic environments, as well as extreme damp and dry environments.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solid state laser ignition device which has a monolithic design based on diode arrays mounted in a linear configuration along with an advanced polycrystalline gain medium laser rod.","These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in view of the within detailed descriptions of the invention, the claims, and in light of the following drawings wherein reference numerals may be reused where appropriate to indicate a correspondence between the referenced items. It should be understood that the sizes and shapes of the different components in the figures may not be in exact proportion and are shown here for visual clarity and for purposes of explanation. It is also to be understood that the specific embodiments of the present invention that have been described herein are merely illustrative of certain applications of the principles of the present invention. It should further be understood that the geometry, compositions, values, and dimensions of the components described herein can be modified within the scope of the invention and are not generally intended to be exclusive. Numerous other modifications can be made when implementing the invention for a particular environment, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","In accordance with one preferred embodiment of this invention reference is made to . B, which show an external view of a diode pumped solid-state laser according to the present invention. More particularly, one may observe laser body , generally a hollow tube structure, connecting two end caps  and  that are positioned at opposite ends of the body tube .","The front end cap  is cut to accept a standard \u215c\u2033 socket drive to allow easy assembly into the spindle. This is necessary as the laser tailstock is keyed to allow installation in only one orientation.","Shown further in  and  are electrical pins  and output aperture which are part of input end cap  and output end cap  respectively.","By way of additional background, those skilled in the laser arts will quickly recall that lasers generally comprise three essential components: an active gain medium, a pumping mechanism, and a cavity.","Turning now to , there is shown a sectional view of the diode pumped solid-state laser of  and  with the body tube  removed. In this sectional view of  it may be seen that the laser assembly comprises of four segments  interposed between the input and output end caps  and , respectively (another possibility, a two segment type, is not shown here).","In particular, each segment  contains a stack of pump diodes . Each segment is positioned to hold and support the laser rod or gain medium over its full length.","The stacked diodes  form a pumping mechanism for the diode pumped solid-state laser of the instant application. Specifically shown in  is a four segment design, where each of the linear segments  has an array of light emitting pump diode bars . These diodes are positioned around an inner perimeter of the gain medium. The diodes can be arranged longitudinal (shown) or (not shown) laterally along the gain medium. As mentioned, here the diode bars  are stacked along a gain medium rod, which in a preferred embodiment is Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG) or another suitable material. When configured in this manner, the gain medium rod can be fully illuminated over its entire length with no dark or shadowed regions.","Electrical connections (not shown) are made between each pump diode stack through either direct solder traces located on each linear segment or through soldered buss bars. Accordingly, electrical power which is applied to electrical contacts  () will energize each of the diode segments comprising the stack. As a result, when power is applied to the electrical contacts , the diode segments are energized and thereby will pump the active gain medium rod sufficiently to produce a laser action and laser output at an output aperture in end cap .","Electrical cross connections between diode segments (not shown) are accomplished within both end cap regions. Turning now to , there is shown a cross sectional view of the diode pumped solid-state laser according to the present invention. Of particular interest is the linear segment  concept allowing for mounting of the pump laser diode arrays . The linear segment  concept supports the gain medium  over its entire length using eight Teflon cushions  which eliminate stress points, and an overhead member  with each array . The end caps  and  may include a compliant compression mechanism or ferrule at one or both ends of the rod  to prevent axial movement. In this manner, the rod can be retained at both ends.","Due to the extreme shock and vibration experienced by the laser system, an advanced medium is here used for the active gain medium rod. In particular, and as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, most conventional laser systems employ a single crystalline laser rod. For this high stress, high vibration system however, it is preferred that a polycrystalline (ceramic) laser rod be employed to thereby provide additional strength. Of further advantage, such materials generally offer higher laser efficiencies by increasing the ND doping concentration.","The use of a sintered ceramic rod allows further flexibility as a passive support glass  can be added over the active gain region . In this manner the shape of the gain medium can be adapted to form a square. This square is the basis for the monolithic structure.","The monolithic concept will allow for no dark sections or shadowed sections of the gain medium, which also provides for application of future gain medium.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that conventional laser pumping applications of laser diode emitters which comprise the diode array segments have their output energy limited to maintain acceptable output. Thermal effects may cause changes to the output wavelength of diode emitters to a point that a diode driven device is not operational. In such circumstances, the diode temperature increases as the device is switched on.","A further aspect of the present invention is that the diode array is balanced along the length of the rod to sufficiently manage the output wavelength of the diodes within the required input wavelength of the active medium over an extended electrical pulse and temperature range, i.e., \u221250 C to +50 C without the need for ancillary components for temperature control.","Additionally, the voltage drop across the diode array provides information about the health of the pump diodes. When diodes fail, they fail in a shorted condition. The difference between the initial electrical resistance and the electrical resistance over the life of the laser can provide qualitative data about the health of the pump diodes.","The resistance of the pump diodes changes with respect to temperature. A laser itself is its own highly accurate thermometer. This feature can provide adaptive energy input to the laser head thereby compensating energy output of the laser to adjust for age and temperature affects.","The monolithic design allows for closer tolerances and is not prone to stack up tolerances or compaction. This allows for the ability to create a hermetically sealed package.","A hermetically sealed package allows for the use of Galden\u2122 as well as other passive thermal conduction fluids which not only reduce the internal bar temperatures, but also act to passively protect the facets of the diodes from atmospheric moisture and contaminants.","Finally,  shows a cut away view of a large caliber artillery gun spindle  with a laser igniter  disposed therein. In addition, shown is the laser to tailstock adapter  and the front pressure breech window . Operationally, the laser igniter is activated such that it produces laser light which in turn initiates an ignition train of an artillery propellant within the gun.","While the invention may have been described with reference to certain embodiments, numerous changes, alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims, and equivalents thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Further features and advantages of the present invention may be understood from the drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
