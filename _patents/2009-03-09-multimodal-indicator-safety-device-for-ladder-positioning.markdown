{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","The present invention relates to a safety device for detecting the inclination of a ladder and to indicate to a user when the ladder is positioned at a safe inclination.","The improper positioning of a ladder is one of the major causes of ladder-related accidents, which could result in injury to a ladder user. Mechanical ladder levels such as spirit\/bubble levels or weighted pendulums can be attached to the ladder rail to measure the longitudinal inclination of the ladder; however, this requires a conscious effort by a user that is omitted on occasions. The position of a mechanical level is usually the outward face of the ladder. Therefore, the mechanical level cannot be observed by a user who is in a position to begin ascending the ladder, which is also the easiest position for a user to reposition a ladder. Further, as mechanical levels provide only passive indication as to the inclination of the ladder, even if a mechanical level is attached to the ladder it can be easily ignored by the user.","The passive indication afforded by mechanical levels ultimately results in a series of checks and corrections of the ladder position every time the ladder is moved. The series of check and correct cycles can be a factor in the degradation of work productivity or safety. If proper ladder positioning procedures are followed, the numerous check and correct cycles can prematurely fatigue the user resulting in a decrease in productivity. However, if the proper ladder positioning procedures are ignored the risk of ladder related accidents increases.","In addition, as the mechanical level must be positioned on the exterior of the ladder to be visible the level is exposed to the rugged conditions surrounding most ladder use and is subject to being damaged or broken.","Thus, there exists a need for a safety device which can actively indicate the inclination of the ladder to a user positioned to begin ascending the ladder without compromising work productivity or safety, and which is protected against being damaged or destroyed.","The present invention provides a multimodal indicator safety device for ladder positioning which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the previously known ladder positioning indicators.","In brief, a multimodal indicator safety device for ladder positioning indicates the longitudinal inclination and\/or the lateral tilt of a ladder to a user in a position to begin ascending the ladder and is protected from external impacts. The ladder has a pair of elongated ladder rails, with rungs extending between the ladder rails. The safety device has a power supply, and a housing dimensioned to be inserted into one of the rungs of the ladder. The housing contains a controller and an electronic sensor in electronic communication with a controller. The electronic sensor measures the inclination of the ladder to produce a measured inclination, and communicates the measured inclination to the controller. The controller compares the measured inclination to a predetermined level value stored in the controller, to produce a comparison signal.","The safety device further includes at least one indicator, such as a visual or audio alarm, or a vibration pad, which indicates to the user the comparison signal. The indicated comparison signal indicates to a user whether or not the inclination of the ladder is within a predetermined range relative to the predetermined level value. In this manner, the inclination of the ladder is actively indicated to a user.","The present invention has utility as a multimodal indicator safety device for ladder positioning which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages. By using an electronic sensor to measure the inclination of the ladder the safety device can be inserted into the interior core of one of the rungs of the ladder to protect the sensor against impact associated with the external environment. Further, through the use of an electronic sensor the safety device not only indicates to a user when the ladder is properly inclined but also actively indicates to the user in which direction the ladder must be moved in order to properly incline the ladder. The inventive indicator is also operative even if the user is in a position to begin ascending the ladder. The directional indication is accomplished through the use of a number of different indicators, such as an audio or visual alarm or a vibration pad.","With reference to , , and , an inventive multimodal safety device is illustrated generally at . The safety device  is configured to be used with a ladder L which includes a pair of spaced apart parallel ladder rails R and R with rungs T extending between the ladder rails R and R. The ladder L depicted in the figures is of the type known as an extension ladder having a top ladder section which is slidably engageable with a bottom ladder section so as to extend the overall length of the ladder L. However, it is appreciated that the safety device  is not limited in use to the ladder depicted in the figures or described in the specification and is operative in any ladder or similar tool, illustratively including scaffolding, and A-frame ladders.","The safety device  has an elongated housing  having a distal end , and a proximate end . The housing  is dimensioned to insert into one of the rungs T of the ladder L, with the distal end  being inserted into the rung T first, and the proximate end  being adjacent to one of the ladder rails R and R when inserted. Ladder rungs T are hollow and typically have a semi-circular cross section with a flattened portion so as to provide a stable footing surface. The flattened portion is parallel to the horizontal ground surface when the ladder L is properly inclined. The housing  is dimensioned to be complementary in shape to the hollow rung T in which it is inserted. As such, the housing  is inserted at a specific angle relative to the elongated ladder rails R and R. Therefore, the housing  is provided with a relative orientation from which to measure the inclination of the ladder L.","The safety device  optionally includes an orientation tab  which engages a complementary orientation groove . As depicted, the orientation tab  is located on the housing  and the orientation groove  is located on the hollow rung T. However, the tab  and groove  are not limited to those locations, and may be of any type or design known to those of ordinary skill in the art for aligning one object with respect to another object. When the orientation tab  is engaged with the orientation groove , the safety device  is provided with a relative orientation from which to measure the inclination of the ladder L.","The housing  further includes an electronic sensor  for measuring the longitudinal inclination of the ladder L. The electronic sensor  detects and communicates inclination based on a liquid movement switch, inclinometers, or accelerometers. Preferably, the sensor  is based on solid state electronics. The electronic sensor  optionally measures both the longitudinal inclination and the lateral tilt of the ladder L from the relative orientation provided by the orientation tab  and the orientation groove . In the alternative, the housing  contains a second electronic sensor with the first electronic sensor  measuring the longitudinal inclination of the ladder L and the second electronic sensor measuring the lateral tilt of the ladder L. It is appreciated that the two-dimensional inclination of the two sensors affords correct planar positioning as to both inclination and tilt of a ladder in a way not previously performed by the prior art.","Further included in housing  is a controller unit  Which compares the measured longitudinal inclination and the measured lateral tilt with a predetermined level value which is stored in the controller unit . The controller unit  is provided with a predetermined level value for both the longitudinal inclination of the ladder and the lateral tilt of the ladder. Preferably, the values represent the recommended inclinations of a ladder governed by the OSHA and\/or ANSI standards. The controller unit  receives an input from the electronic sensor , and\/or second electronic sensor, and compares the longitudinal inclination input to the predetermined longitudinal inclination value and the lateral tilt input to the predetermined lateral tilt value. Controller unit  determines whether the present inclination and tilt of the ladder is within an acceptable range of the predetermined level values. Preferably, an acceptable inclination or tilt is within .+\u2212.2.degree. of the predetermined level values.","The safety device  further includes a power supply  for supplying power to the safety device . The power supply  illustratively is a battery disposed within the housing  of the safety device , a solar cell attached to the exterior of the ladder L, or a combination thereof.","As seen in  safety device  includes at least one of a visual indicator , such as a light emitting diode (LED), an audio indicator , such as a loudspeaker, and a vibration pad , for indicating to the user the inclination and\/or the tilt of the ladder L. While in the FIGS. the audio indicator , if present, is depicted as located at the distal end  of the housing  and the vibrator pad , if present, is located at the proximate end  of the housing , it is appreciated that other configurations are operative and intended to be encompassed by the present invention. The visual indicator , if present, is located along the longitudinal direction of the housing  between the two ends  and . Preferably, the indicators ,  and  are all present.","It will be appreciated from  that the hollow rung T in which the safety device  is inserted includes an aperture  which corresponds to the location of the visual indicator  when inserted into the hollow rung T. The aperture  faces the front face of the ladder L so that the visual indicator  is visible to a user when the user is facing the front face of the ladder L. As such, it is preferable that the housing  is inserted into a hollow rung T which is at or near eye level for an adult male of average height. The housing  also includes a power switch  for turning the safety device  on and off, located at the proximate end . The power switch  optionally includes an auto switch which turns the safety device  on in response to the ladder being positioned in the vertical direction or movement of the ladder. The housing  optionally includes a mode switch  which allows a user to select the mode of operation for the safety device .","Two optional modes of operation selected with the switch  are a power saving setup mode and a continuous monitoring warning mode. In the setup mode the safety device  provides the user with varying indications, through the use of the indicators ,  and  or any combination thereof, as to the inclination, and optionally the tilt, of the ladder L until the inclination, and optionally the tilt, equals the predetermined level value, preferably, for a predetermined period of time. Maintaining level for the predetermined period of time accounts for setting and user weighting mass induced level changes. The varying indications allow the user to get continuous feedback as to the inclination and optionally tilt of the ladder L until the ladder L is correctly positioned for a predetermined period of time, at which point the safety device  will automatically shut off.","In the continuous warning mode, the safety device  initially operates in the same manner as the setup mode, however, the safety device  does not automatically turn off after the measured inclination, and optionally the tilt, of the ladder L is within the predetermined level value range for a predetermined period of time. Rather, in the warning mode the safety device  continuously monitors the inclination and optionally the tilt of the ladder L and will warn the user if The inclination or the tilt of the ladder L shifts to no longer be within a predetermined range of the predetermined level value.","As the safety device  lacks the conventional exposed inclination sensor, such as a spirit\/bubble level, operational lifetime is increased and misalignment indication is enhanced in optionally communicating the direction the ladder L must be moved to achieve a safe inclination and\/or tilt. Through the use of an indicator ,  and\/or . The safety device  is able to indicate to the user in which direction the ladder L is moved in to be properly inclined and\/or tilted.","To accomplish corrective movement towards safe ladder alignment, at least one of the indicators ,  and  are configured to provide a number of different indications to the user depending upon whether the inclination of the ladder L is below the predetermined level value range, within the predetermined level value range, or above the predetermined level value range. The indicators ,  and  receive a signal from the controller  instructing at least one of the indicators ,  or  when and what type of indication should be indicated to the user. Examples of such are as follows.","The visual indicator  is optionally a different color emission depending upon the inclination of ladder L, such as, \u201cgreen\u201d when the inclination of the ladder L is within the predetermined level value range, \u201cred\u201d when the inclination of the ladder L is above the predetermined level value range, and \u201cyellow\u201d when the inclination of the ladder L is below the predetermined level value range.","In addition to changing color, the visual indicator  also optionally blinks to indicate to the user the amount in which ladder must be moved to be properly inclined, such as a proportional blink rate to the degrees of movement needed. The frequency of the blinks is alternatively inversely proportional to the amount of change of inclination and\/or tilt that is required to properly level the ladder L, such that the closer the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is to the predetermined level value range the faster the visual indicator  blinks.","The audio indicator  optionally has a synthesized voice which states the direction of movement required in order to properly incline the ladder L. In the alternative, the audio indicator  emits different sounds depending upon the inclination and\/or tilt of ladder L, such as a first sound when the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is within the predetermined level value range, a second sound when the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is above the predetermined level value range, and a third sound when the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is below the predetermined level value range.","In addition to emitting different sounds, the audio indicator  also optionally varies the loudness or frequency of the sound to indicate to the user the amount or direction in which the ladder L must be moved to be properly leveled. The frequency of the emitted sounds is alternatively inversely related to the amount of change that must be made to properly level the ladder L, such that the closer the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is to the predetermined level value range, the faster the audio indicator  emits the sound. The loudness of the emitted sound is also optionally directly related to the amount of change of inclination and\/or tilt that must be made to properly level the ladder L, such that the closer the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is to the predetermined level value range the quieter the audio indicator  emits the sound.","The vibrator pad , if present, uses different types of vibrations depending upon the inclination and\/or tilt of ladder L, such as a first vibration type when the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is within the predetermined level value range, a second vibration type when the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is above the predetermined level value range, and a third vibration type when the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is below the predetermined level value range.","In addition to emitting a different vibration type, the vibrator pad  could also vary the intensity or frequency of the vibration to indicate to the user the amount in which ladder L must be moved to be properly leveled. The frequency of the vibration could be directly related to the amount of change of inclination and\/or tilt that must be made to properly level the ladder L, such that the closer the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is to the predetermined level value range the slower the vibrator pad  vibrates. The intensity of the vibration is also optionally directly related to the amount of change of inclination and\/or tilt that must be made to properly level the ladder L, such that the closer the inclination and\/or tilt of the ladder L is to the predetermined level value range the weaker the vibrator pad  vibrates.","It will be appreciated that the above described examples are for the purpose of illustration and shall not be considered limiting in any way. It is also appreciated that the indicators are not limited to the type of indicators described above. Further, the locations of the indicators are not limited to the housing , and can be wirelessly connected to the controller unit . One of the indicators, optionally, is located in a handle  attached to the exterior of ladder rail R. The handle  provides a user with a secure grip while adjusting the ladder L to a proper level. In the alternative, one of the indicators is, optionally, disposed in an article , illustratively including a bracelet or a pager, which is attached to the user. The article  includes a receiver such that the indicator is in wireless communication with the safety device . A user having an article  with an indicator is capable of receiving an indication of the level of the ladder L regardless of the position of the user relative to the ladder L.","The indicators are also optionally formed integral with the ladder L, such as a multiple of LED lights  extending along the longitudinal direction of ladder rails R and R so as to provide the user with a visual indication of the inclination of the ladder L regardless of how far up the user has scaled the ladder L.","The safety device  is optionally interfaced as an interrupt switch for various electronic devices, such as a radio, MP3 player, or other digital recording players. As an example, the safety device  has an interrupter switch  and a power plug  that would prevent power from activating a radio or other device plugged in thereto until the inclination of ladder L is within the predetermined level value range for a predetermined amount of time. In this way, a user will not hear a sound program until the ladder L is safely positioned.","The safety device  optionally includes a second housing  which houses the second electronic sensor  and includes a second visual indicator , a second audio indicator , a second vibrator pad , a second controller unit , a second power supply , a second power switch  and a second mode switch , as seen in . The first housing  and the second housing  are separate and independent from each other. The first housing  measures and indicates to the user, using first indicators ,  and  or any combination thereof, the longitudinal inclination of the ladder L in the above described manner and the second housing  is used to measure and indicate to the user, using second indicators ,  and  or any combination thereof, the lateral tilt of the ladder L in the above described manner. In the alternative, the first housing  and the second housing  are operably connected to each other such that the longitudinal inclination and the lateral tilt of the ladder L can be indicated to the user through a combination of the first indicators , , and , and the second indicators , , and , in the above described manner.","Referencing , an alternative configuration of the safety device  is illustrated. A housing  in the shape of an ergonomic handle is secured to the exterior of elongated ladder rail R through the use of a pair of clips  positioned at each end of the housing . It will be appreciated that the term clips encompasses any of the various devices that are capable of gripping, clasping or hooking either fixedly or releasably. Each of the pair of clips , optionally, includes an elongated portion  in order to space the housing  apart from the elongated ladder rail R to facilitate in the gripping of the handle shaped housing  by a user.","The safety device  differs only from the above described safety device  in the configuration of the housings. The remaining components of the safety device  and its operation are identically to the above described safety device .","Referring to  another alternative configuration of the safety device is generally illustrated at . The safety device  is a portable version of previously described safety devices and is capable of a wide range of applications requiring the positioning of objects at varying angles. Such applications illustratively include construction, masonry building\/repair or any other situations which requires the alignment of an object at a specific angle or in which the angles of several objects are required to be identical.","The safety device  includes a housing  which is dimensioned to be held either one hand or both hands of an average adult male. At least one side of the housing  has a smooth flat surface so as to provide a solid contact between the safety device  and the surface of the object which angle is to be measured.","The safety device  includes all of the components of the previously described safety devices which operate in a similar manner, including an electronic sensor, a controller unit, a power supply, a mode switch  and at least one of a visual indicator , an audio indicator , and a vibration pad . The main difference between the previously described safety devices and the safety device  is that the predetermined inclination is not fixed. Rather, the predetermined inclination is variable by the user to produce a selected inclination.","An angle selector  allows the user to operatively select the selected inclination which is to be compared to the measured inclination as described above. In , the angle selector  includes an angle gauge  having a plurality of indicia representing angles ranging from 0 degrees to \u00b190 degrees, although the scale and range of the angles may be varied according to the particular application. A pointer  controlled by a dial , operated by the user, is aligned with the indicia of gauge  representing the desired inclination which is used as the selected inclination.","The angle selector  is in electronic communication with the controller such that the angle selected by the user with the pointer  is received by the controller. The selected inclination is converted into a selected inclination range and then compared to the measured inclination, as in the previously described safety devices, to produce a comparison signal that is indicated to the user by at least one of a visual indicator , an audio indicator  and\/or a vibration pad .","The safety device  optionally includes a range selector  which allows the user to select an acceptable range relative to said control inclination. The controller converts the selected inclination into the selected inclination range based upon input from the range selector . The range selector  may be of similar construction as the angle selector , with a range gauge  having a plurality of indicia representing different acceptable ranges, and a range pointer  which is operated by a range dial . In such a configuration, the controller converts the selected inclination into the selected inclination range based upon input from the range selector.","Referring now to , an alternative configuration of the safety device  of  is illustrated at . The angle selector  of safety device  of  has a digital display  rather than a dial and gauge configuration. The user can enter either the selected inclination and\/or the selected range through angle control buttons , range control buttons , or keypad . It is appreciated that that the device  can be configured as a personal digital assistant inclusive of the aforementioned indicators and inclinometer and\/or an accelerometer.","The digital display  is capable displaying the measured inclination, the selected inclination, the range, and the selected inclination range. Further, the digital display  is capable of acting as the visual indicator by indicating the comparison signal in any of the above identified manners.","In the alternative, the safety device  and  are capable of selecting the selected inclination by measuring the actual inclination of the safety device through the use of the electronic sensor. The user would align the safety device with a surface or angle to be measured, and then by actuating the angle selector the electronic sensor would measure the inclination. The measured inclination would be stored in the controller as the selected inclination. After storing the measured inclination as the selected inclination in the controller unit, the selected inclination can be recalled and used at a later time. Further, several selected inclinations could be stored in the controller for later use, thus allowing for the user to have a multitude of user measured inclinations available for use as the selected inclination.","It will be appreciated that the angle selector is not limited to the above described selectors. Rather, the angle selector may encompasse any device or configuration known to those of ordinary skill in the art which would allow a user to select a specific angle to be compared to the measured inclination.","In addition, the safety devices illustrated in  are capable of measuring more than one angle. The safety devices may include one or two additional electronic sensor, for measuring two or three angles respectively, or one electronic sensor capable of measuring one or two additional angles. In such a configuration the safety devices include an angle selector for each measured inclination or an angle selector capable of selecting a selected inclination for each measured inclination. This allows the user to select a three dimensional angle in space and have the safety device measure and indicated the position of the safety device relative to the selected three dimensional angle.","The housings , , , , and  are made of any conventional material such as metal, plastics, fiberglass, or the like. The housings , , , , and  can be constructed to be shockproof so as to protect the housings , , , , and , and their contents from being damaged. In addition, the housings , , , , and  can be made watertight so as to protect the components of the housings , , , , and  from the elements and other hazards associated with the use of the ladder L.","From the foregoing, it can be seen that the present invention provides a multimodal ladder safety device that can guide a user to incline the ladder at a proper inclination, indicate to the user when the ladder is inclined at the proper inclination and could warn a user when the ladder is no longer inclined at the proper inclination. Having described my invention, however, many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
