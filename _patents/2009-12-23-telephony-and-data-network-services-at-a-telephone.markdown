title: Telephony and data network services at a telephone
abstract: A packetised data network includes IP telephones (ITs) and a network intelligence (NI). All of the keys of each IT are “soft” keys (i.e., they have no fixed function). The NI associates a configuration data structure with the IT which correlates the keys with functions, and, based on this, may control the display of the IT to indicate the current function of certain of the soft keys. Some of the functions are requests for data services at the telephone (e.g., video or programmed audio over the internet). When a user requests such a service with a key press, the NI sets up the service between the data source and the telephone. This may require associating a new configuration data structure with the keys of the IT. The IT user may activate multiple data services through the NI.

No. 11\/300,997 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,660,295 filed Dec. 15, 2005, which is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 09\/564,561 filed on May 4, 2000, now abandoned which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09\/307,356 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,068,641 filed May 7, 1999 and entitled TELEPHONY AND DATA NETWORK SERVICES AT A TELEPHONE.","This invention relates to the provision of telephony and corporate and public data network services at a telephone. The system has application to internet protocol (IP) based telephony.","Traditionally, a private branch exchange (PBX) has been used to provide telephone services to a network of local telephones. The PBX may exist in parallel with a local area network (LAN) which provides data services to a network of local computers. It has been contemplated to provision a LAN not only with computers but also with special telephones so that the network can provide telephony services in addition to data services thereby avoiding the need for parallel networks. In a known system, IP telephones connect to the LAN backbone as does a call manager (which is a server configured with call management software) and a gateway to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The IP telephones include a vocoder so that audio signals may be converted between analog and IP packets. The call manager has a configuration file for each telephone on the LAN assigning call functions to certain of the buttons on the phone, which call functions will be handled by the call manager. Other call functions (e.g., \u201cmute\u201d) are handled by the telephone itself. When the call manager receives keypad digits from a calling phone on the LAN indicative of a called station, it sets up a call by instructing the calling phone to set up a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) audio stream to either the called telephone, if the called telephone is on the LAN, or to the gateway, if the called telephone is on the PSTN. Once the call is set up, the call manager is out of the loop unless the call manager receives a key press indication indicative of a call control function handled by the call manager, such as a call transfer, call hold, call forward, call park, multiple line appearance, or disconnect.","According to one aspect, the present invention provides an EP telephone (IT) where preferably all of the keys are \u201csoft\u201d keys (i.e., they have no fixed function). The network intelligence (NT) associates a configuration data structure with the IT which correlates the keys with functions, and, based on this, may control the display of the IT to indicate the current function of certain of the soft keys. Some of the functions may be requests for data services at the telephone (e.g., video or programmed audio over the internet). When a user requests such a service with a key press, the NI sets up the service between the data source and the telephone. This may require associating a new configuration data structure with the keys of the IT. The IT user may activate multiple data services through the NX If none of the keys of the IT has a fixed function, the NI can more easily arrange for the provision of the services without conflicting with any telephony calls at the telephone.","According to the present invention, there is provided a network intelligence for a data network, comprising: a call service provider for, when connected to a plurality of data network telephones, facilitating provision of telephony services for said plurality of telephones; and at least one service proxy for, when connected to at least one data source, setting up at least one data service between said at least one data source and said plurality of telephones.","According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a telephony system, comprising: a plurality of telephones connected to a data network; a network intelligence connected to said network for facilitating provision of telephony services to said plurality of telephones and, where said network is also connected to a data source, for providing a data service between said plurality of telephones and said data source.","According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of remotely managing a telephone over a data network, comprising: receiving indications from said telephone over said data network; based on said indications, activating a plurality of data services on said data network; determining an active one of said plurality of data services and sending control messages to said telephone over said data network so that said telephone can provide said active data services; and based on further indications received from said telephone over said data network, sending control messages to said telephone to establish a voice call.","According to yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of co-ordinating a telephone and personal computer (PC) at a workstation which are both connected to a data network, comprising: setting up a data service at said PC from a data source; and setting up a co-ordinated data service between said telephone and said data source over said data network.","According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of managing a telephone connected to a data network, comprising: based on user input messages from said telephone, establishing a voice call; before or after establishment of said voice call, establishing at least one non-telephony data service between said telephone and at least one data source such that said at least one non-telephone data service remains established during pendency of said voice call, at least where said at least one data service does not conflict with said voice call.","Referring to , a telephony system  comprises a private IP network  connected to an NI , ITs , , , a data service , a telephone service , a public switched telephone network (PSTN) gateway , and a public IP network . PSTN gateway  connects to a PSTN . The public IP network  may include an IT a data service  and a telephony service  and an internet protocol telephone  connected to the public IP network  through a gateway . The NI  may also connect to a non-IP network  through a gateway . The private IP network could be in the nature of a local area network (LAN), such as an ethernet, or a wide area network (WAN). The public IP network could be an internet. The non-IP network could be an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a wireless network, or a proprietary network.","The NI is software which executes on a processing entity  comprising a central processing unit, memory and a network interface. The processing entity may be a personal computer (PC), network server, or other general computer resource which may or may not be dedicated to running the NI. The processing entity may be loaded with the NI from any computer readable medium, such as disk , a tape, or a memory chip. Also, the NI may be down loaded from a remote source on the private or public IP network. Optionally, the processing entity  may be a dedicated processor, memory, and network interface into which the NI is embedded.","The IT reacts to events generated by a user (e.g., key presses, hook switch transitions) and reports these to the NI by sending IP messages over the private IP network in accordance with an elemental control protocol described hereinafter. The IP messages are transported using the EP protocol suite (specifically, messages are transported over a reliable user datagram protocol\u2014UDP\u2014layer). The NI, which implements the functional model of the IT, reacts to these events and controls the function of the terminal (user interface, visual\/audio feedback, audio hardware control etc.) by sending elemental control messages to the IT. Using this approach, the IT software design can be static but the functional model of the IT may change, as new features and services become available, by simply changing the functional IT emulator software in the NI. This removes design complexity in the IT. Because the IT does not execute industry evolving functional protocol stacks locally (e.g. H.323), the IT does not become obsolete as new versions of the protocols evolve. All evolving protocol dependant software is maintained in the NI where software updates are handled easily. In this model, the NI acts as a proxy agent for the IT by converting messages received from the IT to appropriate standard protocol. All of the keys of the IT are \u201csoft keys\u201d, that is, the keys can be assigned a function within the NI. This facilitates the provision of, along with telephony services, services not usually associated with a telephony device, such as access to live or archival audio programming available over the IP network (e.g., REAL AUDIO\u2122), stock quotation updates, and web browsing.","The architecture for each IT is illustrated in . Turning to , the hardware of an IT  comprises a digital signal processor (DSP) , a text display , a set of keys (and a hookswitch) , and an ethernet controller  (which includes a port to the private IP network). These devices interface with a processor  which maintains, for each of the devices, a software driver , , , and , respectively. An event originating at any of these devices passes to a software event interface , , , and  for the respective devices. The processor  may also establish a connection between the ethernet controller  and any of the other devices through an EP protocol stack . An event queue  receives inputs from the event interfaces and from a window manager  and outputs to an event dispatcher . The event dispatcher  outputs to functional element managers  and any associated stream handlers  created by the functional element managers. The stream handlers of the functional element managers are interconnected with the IP protocol stack  and they, through their functional element managers , output to the device drivers. The functional element managers also output to the window manager . Communication with the device drivers is through a real time operating system (RTOS) . The RTOS maintains the IP protocol stack  as well as software sockets  in the stack.","The DSP  is connected to speaker  and microphone  of handset  through a codec  (which is an analog-to-digital (A\/D) and digital-to-analog (D\/A) converter) and to handsfree speaker  and handsfree microphone  through codec .","Each functional element manager  is designed to control a particular hardware device, group of hardware devices, or a specific set of book keeping tasks. These managers interact directly with the NI via elemental control messages to provide a control entry point to the IT. The managers provide two major capabilities:\n\n","The specific functional element managers are as follows: a broadcast manager; network manager; basic manager; key\/indicator manager; audio manager; and display manager. The broadcast manager is used to broadcast commands to all of the hardware devices of the IT. The network manager provides terminal initialisation, network maintenance and encryption. The basic manager provides an interface to query the status and operating parameters of the IT (e.g., the NI may query a hardware identifier). The key\/indicator manager is responsible for managing all of the keys, indicators and associated commands within the IT. Key press events, hook switch events, key\/indicator status, icon states and LED cadencing are all governed by this manager. The audio manager is responsible for all aspects of the audio including path setup, audio stream setup, and path maintenance. The display manager controls the display of the IT.","The elemental control messages sent by the NI to the functional element managers and from the functional element managers to the NI follow IP and are, therefore, packetised messages. The protocol for the messages contemplated for each of the functional element managers  is set out in Appendix A.","The managers sit on top of the RTOS , which provides the hardware abstraction layer. In particular, the RTOS provides priority based scheduling of system tasks; consistent application programming interfaces (APIs) for low level driver abstraction; inter-task communications primitives and data memory management control; and a tightly integrated transport control protocol\/internet protocol (TCP\/IP) stack, through which the ethernet driver  is controlled. While not preferred, optionally, the RTOS may be replaced by a simple task manager. In such case, the functional element managers would require greater sophistication in order to handle the different APIs of the various device drivers.","Below the RTOS sits the physical hardware drivers. If a piece of hardware changes, only the driver for that hardware and the respective event interface will need to change. Hardware can therefore be added or removed without impacting the rest of the software. The drivers are generally designed to be aware of two types of data\u2014signalling events and media streams\u2014and provide a separate API for each.","While all drivers except the ethernet driver  are controlled by the functional element managers, the ethernet driver  is controlled by the RTOS through the DP protocol stack . All functional element manager communication with the ethernet driver  is therefore done indirectly by opening a socket  at one of the IP protocol layers  (e.g., a simple IP socket or a datagram-based UDP socket). Data from the functional element managers thus passes through an opened socket, down the IP protocol stack to the ethernet driver; conversely, the ethernet driver  passes received data to the IP stack, up to the socket API layer such that the element manager that had opened the socket will receive the data.","There is only one event queue  and all internal and external events (elemental control messages) are placed in that event queue. This ensures that all events acted upon by the IT will be processed based on order of arrival. Media streams, on the other hand, bypass the event queue, as described hereinafter.","The window manager  intercepts all incoming elemental control messages. The purpose of the window manager is to allow the IT to be responsive to commands from more than one NI (and, as described hereinafter, in some instances to facilitate start-up). However, at any point in time, only one NI's commands are directed to the hardware resources. While a particular NI is controlling the IT resources, it has complete control of the IT (no resource sharing with other NIs). To gain access to a different NI, the user must activate that NI via the window manager. This forces the IT to switch the hardware resources to the newly activated NI providing a window to the IT.","As the user switches from NI \u2018A\u2019 to NI \u2018B\u2019, NI \u2018A\u2019 no longer has control of the IT resources and must be informed of this condition. The IT uses the \u201csuspend Connection with Server\u201d command from the elemental control message protocol for this purpose. Similarly, the IT uses \u201cResume Connection with Server\u201d message to \u2018start\u2019 or \u2018resume\u2019 the session with NI \u2018B\\ NI \u2018B\u2019 uses this message as a signal to refresh the display and other IT hardware components as required.","As stated above, only one NI has access to the IT resources at a given time. There may be situations, however, when it is necessary for one of the \u201csuspended\u201d NTs to inform the IT of a special event. An example would be the reception of an incoming call on a suspended server. To allow the disconnected NI to inform the IT, and hence the user, of an important event, thereby allowing the user to decide how to handle the event, the elemental control message protocol provides the \u201cServer Alarm\u201d message. The \u201cServer Alarm\u201d message allows a disconnected NI to signal an event and a text string to the IT. The IT decodes the event, and informs the user of the pending event. The user may then decide to accept or reject the event. Upon reception of the event, the IT would suspend the current NI and switch to the new NI via \u201cSuspend Connection with Server\u201d and \u201cResume Connection with Server\u201d messages as described above. If the user elects to reject the event, then the terminal sends a \u201cResume Connection with Server\u201d message to the current NI to inform it that it needs to refresh the display.","One final capability of the elemental control message protocol, related to the handling of multiple NIs, is the ability to reserve a \u2018block\u2019 of UDP port numbers. In the IP domain, the media streams associated with voice and or video are typically transported using UDP. The setup of the media streaming with the far end device is performed by the NI on the ITs behalf However, the IP stack is operated locally by the IT. As different NIs are added to the IT's list of supported NIs, there is no guarantee that a given UDP port number is available for a call setup session. To allow a given NI to guarantee that the negotiated UDP port is available on the IT, the NI must have previously reserved the UDP port via the \u201cReserve UDP Port Block\u201d message. The IT responds with the \u201cReserve UDP Port Block Report\u201d message. Once a successful message exchange has taken place, the IT will guarantee that the reserved port numbers are not given out to other NIs.","The architecture for the NI is illustrated in . Turning to , NI comprises an elemental control message event router  which receives inputs from ITs , , over the private IP network  and outputs to terminal emulators , , . A terminal boot server  and an associated operations, administration, and maintenance (OA&M) manager  are connected for two-way communication with the private DP network  and with a terminal emulator manager . The terminal emulator manager manages the terminal emulators. The terminal emulators are connected for two-way communication with the private EP network  on lines  and also output to the network through elemental control message formatter . The NI also includes configuration data structures . Each configuration data structure correlates key codes with functions and, optionally, with text (or graphics) which explain the functions. Each configuration data structure also includes information sufficient to allow the launching of a service proxy for each of the functions.","A terminal emulator  is detailed in . Turning to , emulator  comprises a number of service proxies , , . Each service proxy comprises a service plug-in  which is connected for two-way communication with the private IP network on a line . The service proxies output to a context manager . The context manager is connected with an elemental control message driver . Elemental control message driver  receives inputs from the elemental control message router  and outputs to the elemental control message formatter .","The context manager includes a state memory  which stores current state data for the IT emulated by the terminal emulator. The \u201cstate\u201d of the IT is the current status of elements of an IT, for example: \u201con hook\u201d; \u201coff hook\u201d; \u201ccall on handset\u201d; \u201ccall muted on handset\u201d; \u201chandsfree speaker connected\u201d. The context manager also has a memory  for a current configuration data structure.","When an emulator  is first launched, it will have no service proxies. However, as further explained hereinafter, service proxies are launched as required based on information in the current configuration data structure in memory . The service proxies may be proxies for providing telephony or data services available at processing entity , over the private IP network  (such as services  and ), or over the public IP network  (such as services  and ). For example, service proxies may provide basic telephony call services, a call messaging service, a directory number locating service (such as an LDAP\u2014light weight Directory Access Protocol\u2014service, which is described in IETF publications 1777, 1778, and 1823), a direction finding service (such as MAPQUEST\u2122), a stock market quotation service, an audio program service, and a personalized service.","Referencing , when an IT is first plugged into the private IP network , the network manager of the IT (which is one of the functional element managers ), using the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) tries to find an NI. An appropriate message is therefore sent by IT to the NI. The terminal boot server  of the NI recognises this message and prompts the terminal emulator manager  to launch a terminal emulator for IT . When terminal emulator is launched, it looks to the configuration data structures  for an initial configuration data structure to associate with IT . The configuration data structure is copied to memory  of the context manager  for the terminal emulator and will correlate each of the keys of IT with a function and may also correlate keys with text (or a graphic) describing one of the functions. The NI then constructs elemental control reply messages to the IT which include commands to control elements of the IT. For example, the display of the IT could be written with text (or graphics) from the configuration data structure for the function of keys of the IT.","If the DHCP is not available then, when an IT is first plugged in, it defaults to a temporary user input state where the window manager  is responsive to input from the keypad . Thus, a user may, via keypad , input an IP address for the IT and an IP address for an NI (as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the user may also be required to input an IP address of a gateway and a sub-net mask). Once this has been keyed in, the IT sends a \u201cnew IT\u201d message to the NI IP address which was keyed in. This prompts the addressed NI to launch a terminal emulator, retrieve an initial configuration data structure for the new IT, and construct a reply message. When the IT receives the reply message, the window manager switches out of its temporary user input state.","All hardware devices generate events. In operation, if, say, a key is pressed on the key pad  of IT , this key event is sensed by key pad driver . The key pad driver, recognising this as a signalling event, signals the key event interface . Only one event interface is supported per driver and the output of all of these processes is sent to the centralised event queue . Once the key event propagates through the event queue to the event dispatcher , the event dispatcher dispatches it to the key\/indicator functional element manager . This functional element manager then formulates an elemental control message, opens a socket  on the IP protocol stack  and passes the elemental control message to the socket where it is passed down to the ethernet controller  for transmission to the NI.","Similarly, if an elemental control message is received from the NI by the ethernet controller, it is passed up to the event queue  where it propagates through to the event dispatcher . The event dispatcher then dispatches the elemental control message to the appropriate functional element manager  for action.","To ensure that the audio media streams incur the minimal amount of delay while propagating through the system, the driver APIs are designed to allow the media to bypass the event queue and event dispatcher and instead communicate directly with a stream handler  registered with the driver. The handling of a media stream begins with the NI sending appropriate elemental control messages to request processing of a new media stream. The audio functional element manager would then start a new process, a stream handler , to perform the stream processing task. If, for example, the elemental control message from the NT requested processing of an audio stream from a voice call, the functional element manager for the DSP  would open two stream handlers : one for receive stream processing and one for transmit stream processing. The receive stream handler would open a socket for the incoming stream of audio packets and the transmit stream handler would open a socket for an outgoing stream of audio packets. Both stream handlers would register the process identifier with the DSP driver. The audio stream arriving at the socket opened by the receive stream handler would pass directly to the receive stream handler where it would be sent on to the DSP driver  with the appropriate stream identifier. The driver would pass the audio stream to the DSP  which decompresses it; the stream is then converted to analog audio at codec  or  and passed to a speaker  or  of the IT. The DSP  also compresses audio received from a microphone  or  of the phone after the audio is digitised by codec  or . The DSP driver, upon reception of this audio data corresponding to a given stream identifier, signals the registered transmit stream handler matching the stream identifier; the transmit stream handler then reads the data from the DSP driver. Thus, more than one stream handler per driver can register for media streams.","When a media stream is originated from the IT to the outside world, the stream handler responsible for managing the media stream opens, maintains and closes the required socket and hence writes the media packets directly to the socket.","The flexibility of the system described is illustrated in the following examples.","Referencing , assume on power-up of IT , in response to the DHCP message from the IT, the NI  launched a terminal emulator for IT that retrieved an initial configuration data structure for the IT which, amongst other designations, designates (i) one key of IT as a mute key to mute a transmit path, as is standard in telephony for a mute button, (ii) another key to request specialised call services, (iii) a further key to request telephone directory information, (iv) another key to request (street) directions, (v) another key to request stock market quotations, (vi) a key to request a specific audio program (such as a radio station), (vii) a key as a \u201cquit\u201d key for use in quitting a service, and (viii) keys to designate digits. The mute button and digit keys are typically permanently so identified on IT . The \u201cquit\u201d key may also be permanently marked. For the other noted soft keys, the configuration data structure includes data which the NI uses to control the text display  of the IT to indicate the function of these keys.","Now referencing  along with , if a user of IT wished to place a call to IT , she may first lift the handset of the IT . This results in the key\/indicator manager of IT sending an \u201cOff hook\u201d elemental control message to the NI (S). The elemental control message event router  of the NI receives this message then passes a request to the appropriate terminal emulator, here emulator . The request passes up through elemental control message driver  and context manager  of emulator to a service proxy, say , for handling basic call service (the proxy being launched, if necessary). The service proxy sends commands back down through the context manager and elemental control message driver so that the elemental control message formatter  is driven to generate a \u201cStream Based Tone On\u201d message with appropriate parameters (S) to cause the audio manager of the IT to turn on a dial tone. At this point, the NI considers the IT to be in an \u201coff hook\u201d state.","Next the user may press a digit key on the key pad. This results in a \u201ckey event\u201d message to the NI which includes the key code for the key which was pressed (S). The NI collects the digit, echoes the digit back to the IT for display in a \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d message (S) and sends a \u201cStream Based Tone Off message to turn off the dial tone (S). Next the user may dial a series of digits, resulting in a like series of \u201cKey Event\u201d messages to the NI (S, S) and a like series of \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d messages from the NI (S, S) to cause the IT to display these digits. Once the basic call service proxy of the NI has collected a series of digits representing a called station on the private IP network, it obtains the IP address of the called station, here IT . The service proxy of the NI then queries the state memory  of emulator for IT to determine the state of IT . If IT is in an on hook state, the NI may then initiate the call with IT by sending a \u201cTransducer Based Tone On\u201d message to IT (S) with appropriate parameters to cause the audio manager of IT to generate a ring cadence. The NI also sends such a message to IT (S) causing IT to generate a ring back tone. If the user of IT takes the phone off-hook, then IT sends an \u201cOff Hook\u201d message to the NI (S) causing the NT to send a \u201cStream Based Tone Off message to IT (S) so that the ringing tone at IT ceases and also sends a \u201cStream Based Tone Off message to IT (S) so that the ringing cadence at IT ceases. The NI then sends (i) a \u201cConnect Transducer\u201d message (S, ) and (ii) an \u201cOpen Audio Stream\u201d message to each of IT and IT (S, S) so that (i) either the handset  or the handsfree speaker  and microphone  are connected at each IT and (ii) a voice session is set up between the phones. Thereafter each IT will send an \u201cOpen Audio Stream Report\u201d message to the NI (S, ) and IP media stream packets will flow directly between the two phones (S).","Say, during the course of the call, the conversation turned to stock prices. The user of IT could press the key designated to provide stock market quotations. This would result in a \u201ckey event\u201d message being sent to the NI (S) which is routed by router  to terminal emulator . Emulator refers to the current configuration data structure in memory  to access a service proxy application corresponding with the key code in the received \u201ckey event\u201d message, in the current example, this is a stock quote service proxy application. The emulator then launches this service proxy as, say, service proxy . Proxy then negotiates a connection with the server (i.e., the data source) providing this stock quote service, which server may be located on public data network . The remote server then addresses packets of characters to the NI . Emulator of the NI then sends a \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d message to IT (S) to pass the characters to the IT for display. Thus, while continuing the voice call with IT , the user of IT may receive stock quotation information (which may occupy a portion of the display of the phone).","When the user of IT requests connection to a stock quotation source, this could prompt the context manager  of emulator to look up a new configuration data structure for IT which would assign a different function to certain of the keys of the IT. For example, the star and pound keys on either side of the 0 key could be re-assigned to a \u201cscroll up\u201d and \u201cscroll down\u201d function, respectively. The NI could then send a \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d message to the IT so that the phone display indicates this new function of these keys. Then, when the user pressed either of these keys, the NI, on receiving a \u201ckey event\u201d message, would send an appropriate IP message to the remote server to request the next, or previous, page of information. In response, the remote server would send new packets of characters causing the NI to re-write the display of the IT with the new characters using a Display Data Write message.","To end the voice call, IT may be placed on hook. This results in an \u201cOn Hook\u201d message being sent to the NI (S). This prompts the NI to send a \u201cClose Audio Stream\u201d message to each of IT and (S, S). Thereafter, an \u201cOn Hook\u201d message may be received from IT (S). To end the stock market quotation service, the user may press the \u201cquit key\u201d resulting in a \u201cKey Event\u201d message to the NI (S). The NI responds with a \u201cClear Field\u201d message to IT (S) to cause the portion of the display used for the stock quotation information to be cleared. Internally, emulator of the NI would either suspend or terminate the stock market quotation proxy ","Turning to  along with , with IT idle, the user of IT may now decide she wishes to listen to the radio station indicated on the display as associated with a soft key. The user therefore presses this key resulting in a \u201cKey Event\u201d message being sent to the NI (S). In response, the emulator of NI launches an audio program service proxy, say , which negotiates a connection between a remote server which is the source for the appropriate audio program and IT . Meanwhile, the emulator sends a \u201cConnect Transducer\u201d message to IT (S) indicating the new media stream should be directed to the handsfree speaker  and an \u201cOpen Audio Stream\u201d message (S) to launch a receive stream handler which opens a socket for the incoming audio program packets from the remote server and directs them to the DSP driver. Additionally, the pressing of the audio program key causes the emulator to retrieve a new configuration data structure for IT which re-assigns the function of the mute button on the IT so that its function is to mute the receive path of the handsfree audio transducers rather than the transmit path. Thus, if someone enters the office of the user of IT , the user may press the mute button to send a \u201cKey Event\u201d message to the NI (S); the NI responds with a \u201cMute\/Unmute\u201d message with a parameter causing the IT to mute the receive path (S). The user of the IT may then conduct a conversation with the visitor and, thereafter, again press the mute key, so that the NI send a \u201cMute\/Unmute\u201d message with appropriate parameters such that the receive path for the audio program is again unmuted (S, S).","When the user wishes to stop listening to the audio program, she may end the service by pressing the \u201cquit\u201d key on the IT resulting in an \u201cKey Event\u201d message to the NI (S). The NI responds with a \u201cConnect Transducer\u201d message which disconnects the handsfree speaker of the phone (S) and a \u201cClose Audio Path\u201d message to shut down the stream handler and associated socket for the audio program (S). Thereafter, the NT retrieves the previous configuration data structure for IT so that the function of the mute button is internally reassigned whereby it can be used to change the state of the IT to mute the transmit path.","If, while the user is listening to an audio program a call for IT reached the NI, the NI would send one or more Display Data Write messages to the IT to emulate a pop up window announcing the call (preferably with caller information) and asking the user to press a certain key to indicate that she wishes to take the call. This may be accompanied with a message which would result in a brief alerting tone at the IT. The NI retrieves a new configuration data structure for the IT which includes an assignment of one of the keys to an indication that the call is to be taken. If the user did not press this key, once the caller hung up, the NI would clear the pop up window and restore the previous display contents. If the user did press the key, then the NI may suspend or terminate the audio program session and connect through the call, as afore described. Optionally, a second key could indicate that the call was to be taken and the audio program continued. If the user pressed this key, the NI sets up the voice call on the handset , keeping the audio program on the handsfree speaker . By deciding upon whether to interrupt the user, the NI may provide for a prioritisation of services.","If, while the IT was busy with a voice call on, say, the handset , the user pressed the telephone key which is associated with a display message indicating an audio program (e.g., radio station), a \u201cKey Event\u201d message would be sent to the NI. Recognising the current state of the phone as busy with a voice call, the NI would recognise providing the new audio stream would potentially conflict with the voice call. Consequently, the NI sends a notification to the user. For example, the NI could highlight the usage conflict in a Display Data Write message. Also, the NI retrieves a new configuration data structure for the IT which re-assigns one key of the phone as a \u201cwarning override\u201d key. The user could override the warning with the appropriate key press in which case the audio stream for the audio program is set up over the handsfree speaker , as described in conjunction with the example of . However, in this instance, the NI may assign a special key for the function of muting the handsfree speaker , leaving a mute key to mute the voice call in the standard fashion.","From the foregoing, it will be apparent that the IT may simultaneously deal with audio streams from different sources. Indeed, the user could even take two separate voice calls at the IT: one on the handset and one on the handsfree speaker and microphone. In such instance, should a key be pressed requesting an audio program, the NI could either ignore the key event message as there is no way to provide this service without conflicting with the existing voice calls or could display options to the user for dealing with the conflict.","As previously mentioned, another exemplary proxy which may be run on the terminal emulator is a directory number locator proxy which may be used to find telephone numbers over the public IP network. If a user of IT requested a search for a directory number (by pressing the appropriate key), the NI would launch a directory number locator proxy in terminal emulator . Possibly, this would also cause the NI to retrieve a new configuration data structure for the IT and send a \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d message to the IT to display new functions for certain of the keys of the phone which would facilitate a user's use of the directory finding service. For example, the digit keys could be re-assigned to represent letters so that the user could key in a name. If the user entered a last name, the NI could respond with a list of \u201chits\u201d through \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d messages and retrieve another configuration data structure for the IT which assigns new functions to certain keys to allow handling of the list. One of these new functions could be a \u201ccopy\u201d function which may be used to copy information from one data service to another. Thus, in this instance, a user could copy a name from the list of \u201chits\u201d to, say, a personal address book in a call messaging service. Each configuration data structure tailored to a particular service will normally still provide keys by way of which the user could request other services. If the user pressed a key to request stock market quotations, this would cause the NI to launch a stock market quotation proxy in emulator and, possibly, retrieve another new configuration data structure for the phone and overwrite portions of the display to indicate new key functions according to this new configuration data structure. In this way, the last function key which is pressed sets the current configuration data structure for the phone, and a user could \u201ctoggle\u201d amongst services. Thus, a number of proxies may run on the terminal service emulator simultaneously but only the proxy most recently requested by a key press is the active proxy, the other proxies are in the background. From this it will be apparent that the NT provides an aggregation of services for the ITs, including many services not normally associated with a telephone.","The described text-based services were assumed to provide packets of characters to the NI. Some services, such as web pages on the world wide web, forward a file written in hypertext mark-up language (HTML) which file typically prompts down loading of further files to allow construction of a web page. To accommodate such services, the IT  may be provisioned with a graphics display along with an associated graphics driver and graphics event interface. Additionally, the ITs are provisioned with a graphics manager and the elemental message protocol is enhanced by the provision of graphics manager elemental control messages. This manager and the new messages will be very similar to the display manager and the display manager elemental control messages. Thus, the protocol will include a \u201cGraphics Data Write\u201d message similar to the \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d message.","When a user requests a graphical service which uses the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), the NI will receive the HTML file and download necessary additional files to construct the web page. The NI will then encapsulate web page information in \u201cGraphics Display Write\u201d messages to cause the web page to be written to the graphical display of the IT. In so doing, the NI may also retrieve a new configuration data structure for the IT which will assign keys different functions, such as functions to navigate through the web page or request a hyperlink. If, for example, the NI receives \u201cKey Event\u201d messages indicating a hyperlink has been requested, the NI down loads information from the appropriate source(s) and updates the graphical display of the IT with new information received.","With a graphics capable display, if the IT also included a new functional element manager  for the display, namely, a video manager, then the NI could control the display in the same manner as it controls the audio transducers, provided the elemental control protocol were enhanced with suitable additional commands. More particularly, the configuration data structure for an IT could assign one key to a request for a video program (such as a close captioned news program). Were this key on IT pressed, the NI would launch an appropriate proxy in emulator which would negotiate a connection between a remote server providing this video service and IT . The NI would also send an appropriate elemental control message to IT which results in the video manager of IT opening a receive stream handler, registering it with the display driver and opening a socket  on the IP stack . Thereafter, when the video stream reaches the ethernet controller  and is passed up to the socket, it is received by the receive video stream handler and passed down to the display driver. It will therefore be apparent that the user of IT could, while continuing with a voice call, view, for example, a close captioned news service.","The various proxies which may be launched in the terminal service emulator are written so as to be compatible with the protocol of the service provided on the remote server. These different protocols are therefore transparent to the ITs. A few exemplary data services which may be provided at an IT by the NI have been mentioned hereinbefore, such as a directory number locating service (e.g., using LDAP), a map\/navigation service (e.g., MAPQUEST\u2033), a stock quotation service (e.g., QUOTE.COM\u2122), and an audio streaming service (e.g., REAL AUDIO\u2033, MPEG3). Additional exemplary services include a weather information service (e.g., EARTHWATCH\u2122) and a Short Messaging service (e.g., AIRTOUCH\u2122).","Another exemplary data service which may be provided at an IT by the NI is an event notification service. With this type of service, a user of a data terminal inputs certain criteria to the service; when these criteria are met, the service typically sends an e-mail to the data terminal. For instance, a user may ask to be notified if the price of certain merchandise falls below a specified price level, or if merchandise is re-stocked. If an IT requests this service, the NI emulates a data terminal to the event notification service such that the service presents its user interface (UI) to the NI. The NI then sends appropriate messages to the IT to reflect the UI at the IT. Based on keypad input from a user of the IT in reply, the NI sends appropriate messages to the service in order to specify criteria desired by the user. When the criteria are met, the NI is notified from the service (typically by e-mail and\/or through the UI of the service) and the NI may, in response, control the IT to provide a notification. This notification at the IT is not restricted to a text-based display, but could, for example, constitute a distinctive ringing signal and\/or a graphical display.","User interfaces for data services on an IP network are typically based on hypertext mark-up language (HTML). Thus, NI  need only be provisioned with HTML capability in order to interface with such services.","Data services typically require text based queries. However, the NI may allow a user of an IT to request voice input for a given service (by an appropriate \u201cKey Event\u201d message). On receiving such a request, the NI launches a service proxy for a speech recognition service (e.g., OPENSPEECH\u2033) and then establishes a media channel between the IT and itself. Speech received by the NI over this media channel is then passed to the speech recognition service which returns text based equivalents to the NI. The NI may then pass the text based equivalents to the given service.","Alternatively, the telephony system  may be configured so that when an IT is first plugged in, its NI launches a service proxy for a speech server and opens a microphone of the IT and a media channel from the IT to the speech server. With such a configuration, voice input for a data service may be requested by way of a distinctive utterance by the IT user.","A high security service might require voice recognition before the service is unlocked. In such instance, through a service proxy, the NI may direct establishment of a media channel between the IT and the high security service.","An NI may also readily provide an e-mail service to an IT. E-mail sent over the public network  addressed to an IT will be received and stored by an e-mail server and accessible by the NI, as enabled by an e-mail client service proxy. As e-mail is received by the e-mail server, the NI resident e-mail client data is updated. The NI may then send a \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d message to the appropriate IT which indicates the new mail item. Notification of new e-mail may alternatively, or additionally, take the form of a distinctive ringing signal and\/or a graphical display preferably when e-mail with a specific originator and\/or specific subject heading and\/or specific body text is received. To implement this requires that the e-mail client in the NI compare portions of incoming e-mail with stored search targets. The NI will choose a configuration data structure for the IT such that a key of the IT may be used to request e-mail messages. If a \u201cKey Event\u201d message is received by the NT indicating a request for e-mail messages, the NI will cause the IT display to display summaries of e-mail messages and will load a new configuration data structure for the IT such that keys of the IT may be used to handle the e-mail messages. Thus, for example, with an appropriate subsequent key press, the NI will cause the IT display to display the text of a selected e-mail message.","As aforementioned, call services are handled in the same fashion as data services: the NE launches a service proxy to access a server which provides the desired service. For example, it is possible to deliver voice mail in an identical fashion to that described for e-mail, with speech being the payload rather than text (CALL PILOT\u2122 is an exemplary voice mail service which operates in this fashion).","Since all of the keys of the IT are soft keys, the IT may display text in association with each of its keys which includes function information provided by the NI. Alternatively, certain keys found on the IT, such as hold, mute, handsfree, volume control, screen navigation, and headset on\/off keys, maybe permanently labelled as such. Notwithstanding, these permanently labelled keys are soft keys since their function is assigned at the NI. Thus, their function may be re-assigned where necessary (such as described in conjunction with the foregoing example in respect of the mute key). The ability to control all of the keys on the telephone ensures that the","NI may provision the ITs with a variety of services, without conflicts amongst the services and without conflicting with voice calls.","While it is preferred that all of the keys of each IT are soft keys, the system of this invention could function even if some keys of an IT were \u201chard wired\u201d. For example, the mute key of an IT could be hard wired to mute the transmit path of the phone. In such instance, were a user to request an audio program service, the NI could still allow muting of the receive path through assigning this function to a soft key on the phone.","While the user input elements of the telephone have been described as keys (and the hook switch), it will be appreciated that the telephone could equally have other user input elements, such as a touch screen (i.e., a screen where x and y co-ordinates are obtained from a touch sensitive matrix) and proximity or motion detectors. If so, appropriate protocol messages would log signalling \u201cevents\u201d from these devices. Also, while the functions have been described as associated with single keys, it could be that the NI requires a series of key presses on the part of a user to request a function.","The DSP in each IT provides data compression. If the bandwidth of the network is sufficiently great, or if compression is accomplished in some other manner (such as with a network transcoder), the DSPs may be omitted.","The configuration data structures  () may be different for each IT. Thus, the configuration data structures may be based on user profiles. In this way, different phones on the private IP network may request services from a different set of services.","The NI may also provide the functional emulation for IT on public IP network . Also, the NI could be directly connected to the public IP network  instead of to a private IP network and may provide the functional emulation for any ITs connected directly or indirectly to the public IP network. The NI acts as a proxy agent for the IT by converting messages received from the IT to appropriate standard or proprietary protocol. Thus, for example, referencing , an Internet Protocol (IP) telephone  on the public IP network  may utilize H.323 protocol in the establishment of telephone calls. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the H.323 protocol has been established by Study Group  of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and is detailed in overview in http:\/\/www.webproforum.com\/trillium\/index.html, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. If a user of one of the ITs controlled by NT , say IT , dialled a number for such an IP telephone, the NI would receive \u201cKey Event\u201d messages from IT . The user may also send \u201cKey Event\u201d messages to specify the protocol to use. Based on these received messages, the NI would send appropriate H. protocol messages to the IP telephone  and its gatekeeper  to establish the call. To do so, the NI would need to be provisioned with software for implementing the H.323 protocol. This software would typically be configured as a Service Proxy, say in , through system administration, and may be dynamically loaded when a connection is requested to an IP telephone utilizing the H.323 protocol. A user of IT could directly specify a call protocol or after dialling a number or specifying a name using IT , a directory reference by the NI (using LDAP protocol for example) would return a field specifying the call service(s) (and associated tariffs) through which a Directory Number (DN) could be reached, and hence, the appropriate protocol(s) (e.g. H.323).","An IP telephone on public network  could also use a different protocol for the establishment of a voice call, such as Session Internet Protocol (SIP) which has been established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and is detailed in IETF RFC 2543 dated March, 1999 (available at http:\/\/www.sunsite.auc.dk\/RFC\/rfc\/rfc2543.htmD, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The NI could allow establishment of calls between such IP telephones and ITs which it controls provided the NI is provisioned with software to implement the SIP protocol through a service proxy.","Of course, as these standards-based call initiation protocols evolve, the software in the NI may be updated to reflect the latest version of the standard.","While the multi-service telephony system has been described in the context of an IP data network, the system could be adapted to function in the context of data networks following other data protocols. For example, rather than sending packetised data, the data network could employ a synchronous transfer mode for data.","The NI could also allow an IT to communicate with a telephone on a non-IP network , such as an integrated services digital network (ISDN). To do so, the NI  would need to have a connection to the ISDN through a gateway  and be provisioned with software allowing it to emulate an ISDN terminal. The gateway converts between ISDN signalling and media streams, on the one hand, and packet data on the other. If an ISDN signalling stream arrives at the NI from the gateway, the NI launches a service proxy to handle the ISDN messaging with the ISDN terminal in order to establish a call with a desired IT. Thereafter, the ISDN media stream is directed to the IT (through the gateway) while the NI continues to receive any messaging via a signalling stream.","In a similar fashion, if the NI, through an appropriate gateway, had a connection to a wireless network operating under any standard wireless protocol, such as GSM, TDMA, CDMA, or G3, and was properly provisioned to emulate a wireless telephone terminal operating under the wireless protocol, the NI could permit the establishment of a voice call between a telephone on the wireless network and any of the ITs.","The NI could also permit an IT to establish a call over a proprietary network if the NI had a connection to such network and the NI were provisioned with the proprietary protocol for establishing a call over the proprietary network. Thus, for example, the NI, if properly provisioned and connected, could allow calls between an IT and a telephone on a MERIDIAN network or a NORSTAR network (MERIDIAN and NORSTAR are trademarks of Nortel Networks Corporation).","If properly provisioned, the NI may emulate any type of terminal supported on a network. Thus, for example, the NI may emulate a pager on a wireless network if provisioned with proper interface software (e.g., Wireless Application Protocol\u2014WAP, Wireless Markup Language\/Handheld Device Markup Language\u2014WML\/HDML) which is utilised by a service proxy. In providing pager emulation, the NI could receive a pager message destined for one of the ITs and construct appropriate \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d elemental control messages to cause display of the text of the pager message at the appropriate IT.","The NI may also emulate proprietary services if enabled by an appropriate Service proxy. For example, text messages may be dispatched to an IT from a COMPANION server via an appropriately configured NI. (COMPANION is a trademark of Nortel Networks Corporation).","There are situations where it is desired to have a server control telephones and also a personal computer (PC) adjacent each telephone. For such situations, a computer telephony interface (CTI) protocol is needed. Microsoft's TAPI provides a common application programming interface (API) for service providers, and those writing telephony applications for servers or PCS running the WINDOWS\u2033 operating system. In known call centers, for example, the telephone at each workstation is connected to a private branch exchange (PBX) and a server is connected to the PBX and to the client PC at each workstation. Software resident on the server co-ordinates phone activity with information displayed on the client PC's screen. Many systems use Novel\/ATT TSAPI to enable control of a PBX by a server.","Telephone and PC control may be achieved with the teachings of the subject invention without the need for a line between the telephones and a telephone switch (e.g., PBX). Turning to , a system  comprises an IP network  connected to a telephony service , a processing entity  including an NI , ITs , and PCS , of workstations , , a PSTN gateway , and a co-ordination server . The PSTN gateway  is connected to a PSTN .","The co-ordination server  controls the PCS directly over the IP network . The coordination server  controls the ITs through the NI , which launches a suitable service proxy for each telephone. For example, if the co-ordination server  used the TAPI protocol, the NI would proxy a TAPI client on behalf of each IT. It would also be possible to architect system  such that the co-ordination server generates elemental control messages. These would then flow to the NI where they would be aggregated and prioritised with respect to other services.","When the NI  launches a service proxy in respect of an IT for the co-ordination server , the NI  may upload a new configuration data structure for the IT which associates an \u201cexpand\u201d operation with one of the keys of the IT. A suitable \u201cDisplay Data Write\u201d message to the IT will result in this key being suitably identified at the IT. In response to a \u201cKey Event\u2019 message from this \u201cexpand\u201d key, the NI sends a message to the co-ordination server  such that server  controls the PC at the same workstation to display information viewed in short form on the smaller IT display in an appropriate expanded format on the PC.","With the architecture of system , it is also possible for PC at workstation to run an application which communicates with the IT at the workstation through the NI. The application may communicate with the IT via the NI either in a CTI protocol, such as TAPI, or utilising the elemental control protocol. Thus, for example, the PC could run a scheduling program with a scheduling summary appearing on the IT display. This could be useful where the PC was running a parallel application that occupied the screen of the PC. (In this situation, an \u201cexpand\u201d key on the IT could be used to pop the background scheduler application on the PC to the foreground.) Note that the PC control of the IT occurs without any direct connection between the PC and IT. Although, typically, a PC would control on the IT adjacent to it at a workstation, the system  could allow a PC to control remote ITs as well.","Conveniently, the service proxies may be implemented in the JAVA programming language, as this facilitates their portability across NIs implemented in different software languages, hardware platforms, and operating system environments.","In the described systems, the intelligence for the operation of the IT is located in the NI. The functional model for the IT resides in the NI and the user interface is projected onto the IT using the elemental control protocol. This model results in a slight delay at the IT whenever a key is pressed as a key event message must pass up to the NI and a response message must return from the NI to the IT before the IT takes action consequent on the key press. In most instances, this slight delay is entirely acceptable. In the case of receive volume adjustments, this delay is not preferred. Consequently, the elemental control message protocol allows the NI server to configure the terminal for local, receive volume control. This is accomplished using several messages.","A two-mode operation scheme allows the NI to specify whether the terminal has direct control over active-path volume adjustment or if the NI will assume control over the adjustments. The two modes are defined as follows:\n\n","The NI can instruct the terminal to operate in either mode, by setting the \u201cAdjust Volume\u201d and \u201cAutomatic Adjustable Rx Volume Report\u201d options of the \u201cAudio Manager Options \u201d elemental control message. If the \u201cAdjustable Rx Volume Report\u201d option of the \u201cAudio Manager Options\u201d message is enabled, the terminal will send an \u201cAdjustable Rx Volume Report\u201d message each time after a volume key is pressed by the user. This report informs the NI that the volume has been adjusted and indicates whether one of the rails (min.\/max. volume) has been reached. This provides a clean interface for NI visual feedback of user volume adjustments when the IT handles the volume control locally.","The NI uses the \u201cChange Adjustable Rx Volume\u201d message to adjust an active path receive volume when local volume control handling has been disabled. The NI uses the \u201cAdjust Default Rx Volume\u201d message to change the default receive volume levels when a user is adjusting default volume levels from, for example, an options list. As will be noted from the protocol, the NI may set audio parameters for the handset or handsfree transducers (headset, where extant) in an audio parameter bank (APB) download message. The \u201cSelect Adjustable Rx Volume\u201d message can be used by the NI to set or change the active APB volume register. This is useful when multi-path calls are configured and the user wishes to adjust the volume of a specific register (i.e. receive volume register associated with a specific APB).","There is also a situation where maintaining the functional model for the IT solely in the NI would be unnecessarily burdensome, namely, in implementing timers. There are many user interface features that require a time-out function to expire if no user activity is detected for a certain period of time. An example of such a feature is the viewing of a caller's list. When the user enters the list, as each new item is viewed, a timer is started. If the timer expires before the next list item is viewed, or the list is exited (signalled by a \u2018Quit\u2019 key press), the system will automatically exit the list and revert back to the \u2018Idle\u2019 display screen. The concept of a \u2018time-out if no key press\u2019 feature is very simple. This, along with the undesirability of maintaining possibly thousands of timers in the NI, one per each terminal, lead to a elegant solution: Perform the timer feature in the terminal and send back time-out notifications to the NI to ensure that the NI is in-sync and in control of the user interface.","The \u201cUser Activity Timer\u201d message is used to rum on or to turn off a timer, which reloads when any key is pressed. If the timer expires, meaning no keys were pressed, then the terminal sends the \u201cUser Activity Timer Expired\u201d message. The \u201cUser Activity Timer Download\u201d command allows the NI to specify the time-out value.","Another timer which may be present in the IT is a local call duration timer. Also, an IT may have a local time and date display (set by the NI) and will locally manage the current NI to which it responds (through the window manager). There are text strings displayed in conjunction with each of these functions. In order to maintain language independence with this local functionality, the NI downloads text strings in the appropriate language, as follows.","The Call Duration Timer uses the time & date fields to display its information. The date field is used for displaying the Call Duration Timer label (i.e., a text string) that can be defined by the NI using the \u201cCall Timer Label Download\u201d command. By allowing the NI to download a separate label for this feature, the locally implemented feature remains language independent as the downloaded label may be implemented in any language.","The IT is configured to track the month field digitally, i.e. 1=January, 2=February, etc. However, to allow a text label to be used, while at the same time ensuring language independence, the terminal allows two month labels to be downloaded via the NT. These labels are applied to \u201cthis\u201d month and \u201cnext\u201d month. The terminal tracks the number of days per month and automatically switches to the next month at the appropriate time. The NT downloads the month labels via the \u201cMonth Labels Download\u201d message.","The elemental control message protocol provides a message which allows the NI to download a text string (or optionally an icon\/bit map etc. as graphical display capabilities are deployed) to be used as the server identification tag in the local user interface. The NI uses the \u201cServer Identification Tag\u201d message for this purpose.","An advantage of the elemental control message protocol is the control it provides the NI over the characteristics of audio at an IT. As discussed previously, the NI may control an IT to connect audio streams to a selected transducer pair (e.g., handset, headset or handsfree microphones and speakers). In addition, the NI may control parameters of an audio stream by assigning an Audio Parameter Bank (APB). The APB is a grouping of parameters that describes the characteristics of the audio stream. The IT provides several APBs. Each APB can be configured by the NI. When setting up an audio stream, the NI controls where the audio stream terminates (i.e. which transducer pair to use), and which APB to associate with the audio stream. An APB contains the following parameters:\n\n","The NI configures these APB parameters using the following elemental control message commands:\n\n","The elemental control message protocol allows the IT to implement handset detection algorithms and report the findings back to the NI via the \u201cHandset Connected\u201d and \u201cHandset Disconnected\u201d messages. This flexibility allows the terminal to detect specially designed handsets, for example extended frequency response handsets, and report this to the NI. The NI, upon receiving this message, could activate enhanced audio capabilities within the terminal to exploit the capabilities of the special handset. These enhanced audio capabilities could be used as a product differentiater in the market.","The elemental control message protocol allows the IT to be configured to switch to a new control protocol. Upon receipt of the \u201cProtocol Switch\u201d message from the NI, the terminal could be directed to start communicating using the newly specified protocol instead of the elemental control message protocol of Appendix A. This would allow one terminal to be built that could be compatible with several distinct control protocols.","The elemental control message protocol allows the NI to query the IT for a \u2018copyright\u2019 identification string. The NI queries the IT using the \u201cCopyright\u201d option of the \u201cQuery Network Manager\u201d command. The IT responds with the \u201cCopyright Report\u201d message.","The amount of information to be presented to a user may exceed the visible area of the display for the IT. This may typically occur when viewing e-mail, directories, or incoming callers logs. To accommodate such situations, the elemental control message protocol provides for page scrolling. The NI may send a \u201cpage\u201d of information via a \u201cPage Download\u201d message. The IT saves this \u201cpage\u201d of information locally and presents the first portion of the page on the display. If a user uses a page scrolling key (such as a key on a navigation cluster, or another key assigned to this purpose by the NI), on receiving the resulting \u201cKey Event\u201d message, the NI responds with a \u201cPage Scroll\u201d message, causing the IT to scroll to another portion of the \u201cpage\u201d.","The elemental control message protocol allows the NI the disable specific portions of the display via the \u201cDisable Display Field\u201d message.
