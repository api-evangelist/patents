title: System and method for query temporality analysis
abstract: A new approach is proposed that contemplates systems and methods to determine temporality of a query in order to generate a search result including a list of objects that are not only based on matching of the objects to the query but also based on temporality analysis of the query. Here, the temporality of the query can be defined as the distribution over time of the objects matching the query, i.e., the chronology histogram of the query. Such distribution can be analyzed to provide a classification of the intent of the query. Classification of the intent of the query can result either in discrete classification of the query into categories, or in continuous classification of the query which may be a scalar or vector value resulting from transformations of the chronology histogram.

This application is a continuation-in-part of prior U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/895,593 filed Sep. 30, 2010 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,991,725). This application is also a continuation-in-part of current U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/628,791 filed Dec. 1, 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,688,701 and a continuation-in-part of current U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/628,801 filed Dec. 1, 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,244,664.","Knowledge is increasingly more germane to our exponentially expanding information-based society. Perfect knowledge is the ideal that participants seek to assist in decision making and for determining preferences, affinities, and dislikes. Practically, perfect knowledge about a given topic is virtually impossible to obtain unless the inquirer is the source of all of information about such topic (e.g., autobiographer). Armed with more information, decision makers are generally best positioned to select a choice that will lead to a desired outcome\/result (e.g., which restaurant to go to for dinner). However, as more information is becoming readily available through various electronic communications modalities (e.g., the Internet), one is left to sift through what is amounting to a myriad of data to obtain relevant and, more importantly, trust worthy information to assist in decision making activities. Although there are various tools (e.g., search engines, community boards with various ratings), there lacks any indicia of personal trustworthiness (e.g., measure of the source's reputation and\/or influence) with located data.","Currently, a person seeking to locate information to assist in a decision, to determine an affinity, and\/or identify a dislike can leverage traditional non-electronic data sources (e.g., personal recommendations\u2014which can be few and can be biased) and\/or electronic data sources such as web sites, bulletin boards, blogs, and other sources to locate (sometimes rated) data about a particular topic\/subject (e.g., where to stay when visiting San Francisco). Such an approach is time consuming and often unreliable as with most of the electronic data there lacks an indicia of trustworthiness of the source of the information. Failing to find a plethora (or spot on) information from immediate non-electronic and\/or electronic data source(s), the person making the inquiry is left to make the decision using limited information, which can lead to less than perfect predictions of outcomes, results, and can lead to low levels of satisfaction undertaking one or more activities for which information was sought.","Current practices also do not leverage trustworthiness of information or, stated differently, attribute a value to the influence of the source of data (e.g., referral). With current practices, the entity seeking the data must make a value judgment on the influence of the data source. Such value judgment is generally based on previous experiences with the data source (e.g., rely on Mike's restaurant recommendations as he is a chef and Laura's hotel recommendations in Europe as she lived and worked in Europe for 5 years). Unless the person making the inquiry has an extensive network of references from which to rely to obtain desired data needed to make a decision, most often, the person making the decision is left to take a risk or \u201croll the dice\u201d based on best available non-attributed (non-reputed) data. Such a prospect often leads certain participants from not engaging in a contemplated activity. Influence accrued by persons in such a network of references is subjective. In other words, influence accrued by persons in such a network of references appear differently to each other person in the network, as each person's opinion is formed by their own individual networks of trust.","Real world trust networks follow a small-world pattern, that is, where everyone is not connected to everyone else directly, but most people are connected to most other people through a relatively small number of intermediaries or \u201cconnectors\u201d. Accordingly, this means that some individuals within the network may disproportionately influence the opinion held by other individuals. In other words, some people's opinions may be more influential than other people's opinions.","As referred to herein, influence is provided for augmenting reputation, which may be subjective. In some embodiments, influence is provided as an objective measure. For example, influence can be useful in filtering opinions, information, and data. It will be appreciated that reputation and influence provide unique advantages in accordance with some embodiments for the ranking of individuals or products or services of any type in any means or form.","One issue facing an online user is the difficulty to search for content that actually addresses his\/her problem from his\/her own perspective or from someone whose opinion the user values highly. Even when the user is able to find the content that is relevant to address his\/her problem, such content is most likely to be of \u201ctime neutral\u201d type that does not categorize the search results based on their timing.","The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent upon a reading of the specification and a study of the drawings.","The approach is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to \u201can\u201d or \u201cone\u201d or \u201csome\u201d embodiment(s) in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.","A new approach is proposed that contemplates systems and methods to determine temporality of a query in order to generate a search result including a list of objects that are not only based on matching of the objects to the query but also based on temporality analysis of the query. Here, the temporality of the query can be defined as the distribution over time of the objects matching the query, i.e., the chronology histogram of the query. Such distribution can be analyzed to provide a classification of the intent of the query. For non-limiting examples, a query with constant\/even distribution of objects over time is most likely intended for knowledge or canonical, while a query with distribution of objects concentrated at particular points is most likely focused on a specific event, and a query with distribution of objects increased over time mainly reflects the recent interest of a user. Classification of the intent of the query can result either in discrete classification of the query into categories as shown by the non-limiting examples above, or in continuous classification of the query which may be a scalar or vector value resulting from transformations of the chronology histogram. Such classification of the query can be directly communicated to the user or be utilized to perform further operations, which include but are not limited to, choosing different forms of displaying the search result to the user, choosing different methods to determine the search result, and as an input to the search result computation.","Citation Graph","An illustrative implementation of systems and methods described herein in accordance with some embodiments includes a citation graph  as shown in . In the example of , the citation graph  comprises a plurality of citations , each describing an opinion of the object by a source\/subject . The nodes\/entities in the citation graph  are characterized into two categories, 1) subjects  capable of having an opinion or creating\/making citations , in which expression of such opinion is explicit, expressed, implicit, or imputed through any other technique; and 2) objects  cited by citations , about which subjects  have opinions or make citations. Each subject  or object  in graph  represents an influential entity, once an influence score for that node has been determined or estimated. More specifically, each subject  may have an influence score indicating the degree to which the subject's opinion influences other subjects and\/or a community of subjects, and each object  may have an influence score indicating the collective opinions of the plurality of subjects  citing the object.","In some embodiments, subjects  representing any entities or sources that make citations may correspond to one or more of the following:\n\n","In some embodiments, some subjects\/authors  who create the citations  can be related to each other, for a non-limiting example, via an influence network or community and influence scores can be assigned to the subjects  based on their authorities in the influence network.","In some embodiments, objects  cited by the citations  may correspond to one or more of the following: Internet web sites, blogs, videos, books, films, music, image, video, documents, data files, objects for sale, objects that are reviewed or recommended or cited, subjects\/authors, natural or legal persons, citations, or any entities that are or may be associated with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), or any form of product or service or information of any means or form for which a representation has been made.","In some embodiments, the links or edges  of the citation graph  represent different forms of association between the subject nodes  and the object nodes , such as citations  of objects  by subjects . For non-limiting examples, citations  can be created by authors citing targets at some point of time and can be one of link, description, keyword or phrase by a source\/subject  pointing to a target (subject  or object ). Here, citations may include one or more of the expression of opinions on objects, expressions of authors in the form of Tweets, blog posts, reviews of objects on Internet web sites Wikipedia entries, postings to social media such as Twitter or Jaiku, postings to websites, postings in the form of reviews, recommendations, or any other form of citation made to mailing lists, newsgroups, discussion forums, comments to websites or any other form of Internet publication.","In some embodiments, citations  can be made by one subject  regarding an object , such as a recommendation of a website, or a restaurant review, and can be treated as representation an expression of opinion or description. In some embodiments, citations  can be made by one subject  regarding another subject , such as a recommendation of one author by another, and can be treated as representing an expression of trustworthiness. In some embodiments, citations  can be made by certain object  regarding other objects, wherein the object  is also a subject.","In some embodiments, citation  can be described in the format of (subject, citation description, object, timestamp, type). Citations  can be categorized into various types based on the characteristics of subjects\/authors , objects\/targets  and citations  themselves. Citations  can also reference other citations. The reference relationship among citations is one of the data sources for discovering influence network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In the example of , the system  includes at least search engine , influence evaluation engine , and object selection engine . As used herein, the term engine refers to software, firmware, hardware, or other component that is used to effectuate a purpose. The engine will typically include software instructions that are stored in non-volatile memory (also referred to as secondary memory). When the software instructions are executed, at least a subset of the software instructions is loaded into memory (also referred to as primary memory) by a processor. The processor then executes the software instructions in memory. The processor may be a shared processor, a dedicated processor, or a combination of shared or dedicated processors. A typical program will include calls to hardware components (such as I\/O devices), which typically requires the execution of drivers. The drivers may or may not be considered part of the engine, but the distinction is not critical.","In the example of , each of the engines can run on one or more hosting devices (hosts). Here, a host can be a computing device, a communication device, a storage device, or any electronic device capable of running a software component. For non-limiting examples, a computing device can be but is not limited to a laptop PC, a desktop PC, a tablet PC, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad, Google's Android device, a PDA, or a server machine. A storage device can be but is not limited to a hard disk drive, a flash memory drive, or any portable storage device. A communication device can be but is not limited to a mobile phone.","In the example of , search engine , influence evaluation engine , and object selection engine  each has a communication interface (not shown), which is a software component that enables the engines to communicate with each other following certain communication protocols, such as TCP\/IP protocol, over one or more communication networks (not shown). Here, the communication networks can be but are not limited to, internet, intranet, wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN), wireless network, Bluetooth, WiFi, and mobile communication network. The physical connections of the network and the communication protocols are well known to those of skill in the art.","Temporality Analysis","In the example of , search engine  accepts a search request in the form of a query from a user and determines temporality of a query in order to generate a search result including a plurality of objects  that are not only based on matching of the objects to the query but also based on temporality analysis of the query.  depicts an example of a flowchart of a process to support query temporality analysis. Although this figure depicts functional steps in a particular order for purposes of illustration, the process is not limited to any particular order or arrangement of steps. One skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the various steps portrayed in this figure could be omitted, rearranged, combined and\/or adapted in various ways.","In the example of , the flowchart  starts at block  where a query is accepted from a user as part of a search request. The flowchart  continues to block  where a plurality of objects that match the query are retrieved. The flowchart  continues to block  where distribution over time of the objects (known as a chronology histogram) matching the query is determined for temporality analysis of the query based on timestamp metadata associated with the objects. The flowchart  continues to block  where the distribution over time of the objects is analyzed to provide a classification of the intent of the query. The flowchart  ends at block  where a search result including the objects is generated that is not only based on matching of the objects to the query but also based on the classification of the intent of the query.","In some embodiments, the search engine  provides a discrete classification of the intent of the query into various categories, wherein a query with constant\/even distribution of objects over time is most likely intended for knowledge\/canonical and may be classified by the search engine  as such, while the query with distribution of the objects concentrated at particular points is most likely focused on a specific event, and a query with distribution of the objects increased over time mainly reflects the recent interest of a user. Alternatively, the search engine  provides a continuous classification of the intent of the query, which can be but is not limited to a scalar or vector value resulting from transformations of a chronology histogram of the query, which represents the distribution over time of the objects matching the query.","In some embodiments, the search engine  may utilize the temporality analysis of the query, among other criteria and\/or factors, to select a \u201ctime window\u201d that provides the best search result for a specific query. Here, the time window can be but is not limited to one of: hour (the preceding\/past 60 minutes), day (the preceding 24 hours), week (the preceding 7 days), month (the preceding 30 days), or all (results from as far back as they have been collected). However, if only one of these windows can be pre-selected and displayed on the results page as the search result at a given time, the purpose of the time window selection is to choose the proper time window (H, D, W, M, or A) to be displayed. In some embodiments, the search engine  may select a combination of multiple time windows so that the search result may include, for a non-limiting example, mostly canonical objects with a few recent objects.","In some embodiments, among a given set of time windows, such as the past hour, day, week, month and \u201call-time\u201d, the search engine  may select the best time window based on the time distribution of the objects matching the query, i.e., the ratio of the actual count of objects (object count) during that time window to the expected object count for that time window for that specific query so that the temporality of the search result best matches that of the query. Here, the search engine  may compute the expected object count for a time window based on actual object counts for the preceding and succeeding time windows, including place-holder time windows that may never be selected but are used for computation purposes only. The expected object count for a time window can be based on the actual time (including the time of day, or time of week) in which the query takes place. The search engine  may weight the ratio of expected to actual object count may be weighted to provide a bias for certain time windows (e.g. day preferred to month). Such time window selection process is based on the assumption that a time window is likely to be of most interest to the user if there are more objects from that window in the search result than would otherwise be expected proportionately from the number of objects in the preceding (next earliest) or following (next latest) windows. For a non-limiting example, a term currently having 835 matching objects in the week window should have a proportionate number of 835\/7=119 in the day window. If in fact the day window has 472 objects, far in excess of the number 119 that would have been expected based on the week window, the day window is likely to be of most interest to the user and that is the window whose matching objects should be displayed as the search result.","Citation Search","In some embodiments, search engine  enables a citation search process, which unlike the \u201cclassical web search\u201d approaches that is object\/target-centric and focuses only on the relevance of the objects  to the searching criteria, the search process adopted by search engine  is \u201ccitation\u201d centric, retrieving a plurality of citations composed by a plurality of subjects citing a plurality of objects. In addition, the classical web search retrieves and ranks objects  based on attributes of the objects, while the proposed search approach adds citation  and subject\/author  dimensions. The extra metadata associated with subjects , citations , and objects  provide better ranking capability, richer functionality and higher efficiency for the searches.","In some embodiments, the search engine  may accept and enforce various criteria\/terms on citation searching, retrieving and ranking, each of which can either be explicitly described by a user or best guessed by the system based on internal statistical data. Such criteria include but are not limited to,","a) Constraints for the citations, including but are not limited to,","Description: usually the text search query;","Time range of the citations;","Author: such as from particular author or sub set of authors;","Type: types of citations;","b) Types of the cited objects: the output can be objects, authors or citations of the types including but are not limited to,","Target types: such as web pages, images, videos, people","Author types: such as expert for certain topic","Citation types: such as tweets, comments, blog entries","c) Ranking bias of the cited objects: which can be smartly guessed by the system or specified by user including but are not limited to,","Time bias: recent; point of time; event; general knowledge; auto","View point bias: such as general view or perspective of certain people.","Type bias: topic type, target type.","In the example of , object selection engine  determines temporalities and classifications of one or more of citing subjects\/sources and cited objects\/targets of the citations in addition to temporality and classification of the query in order to provide a list of selected objects based on one or more of these temporalities. More specifically, the object selection engine  may select and rank the objects in part according to one or more of:\n\n","Similar to temporality analysis of a query, the object selection engine  may determine the temporality of a subject based on its chronology histogram. Here, the chronology histogram of the subject can either be query-dependent\u2014time distribution of citations from the subject that matches a query, e.g. when the source \u201creuters\u201d makes citations including the query term \u201cnuclear\u201d, or query independent\u2014time distribution of all of the citations from the subject, e.g., every time \u201creuters\u201d makes a citation in any context.","In some embodiments, the object selection engine  may utilize the temporality analysis to identify whether the subjects of the citations (possibly about a particular topic or query term) are either evenly or concentratedly distributed over time. The object selection engine  may also utilize such temporality analysis to classify the subjects, where classification can result either in discrete classification of the subjects into categories, such as, for non-limiting examples, \u201cregular sources\u201d or \u201csporadic sources\u201d, or in continuous classification which may be a scalar or vector value resulting from transformations of the chronology histogram.","Similar to temporality analysis of a query, the object selection engine  may determine the temporality of an object on the basis of its chronology histogram. Here, the chronology histogram of the object can either be query-dependent\u2014time distribution of citations for the object that matches a query, e.g. when the object \u201cperl.org\u201d is cited along with the query term \u201cperl\u201d, or query independent\u2014time distribution of all of the citations for the object, e.g., every time \u201cperl.org\u201d is cited in any context. For a non-limiting example, the object selection engine  may utilize such temporality analysis to identify whether the objects of the citations (possibly about a particular topic or query term) are either evenly or concentratedly distributed over time. The object selection engine  may also utilize such temporality analysis to classify the objects, where classification of the intent of the query can result in discrete classification of the objects into categories, such as, in non-limiting examples, \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cevent\u201d, or in continuous classification which may be a scalar or vector value resulting from transformations of the chronology histogram.","In some embodiments, the object selection engine  may limit the chronology histogram to:\n\n","In the approaches outlined above, the object selection engine  may weigh the chronology histogram of a query, a subject or an object based on attributes associated with each citation, or attributes associated with the subject or object of each citation. Here, the attributes include but are not limited to language, location, source, and time (recency) of the citation or the subject or object of the citation. The attributes may be generated, computed, acquired or may be ascribed as metadata to the citation or the subject or object.","In some embodiments, the classifications of the query, the subject, and\/or the object can be directly communicated to the user and the object selection engine  may utilize such classification to perform further operations that include but are not limited to, choosing different forms of displaying the search result to the user (e.g. highlighting \u201cevents\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d), choosing different methods to determine the search result, and as an input to the search result computation.","Influence Evaluation","In the example of , influence evaluation engine  calculates influence scores of entities (subjects  and\/or objects ), wherein such influence scores can be used to determine at least in part, in combination with other methods and systems, the ranking of any subset of objects  obtained from a plurality of citations  from citation search results.","In some embodiments, influence evaluation engine  measures influence and reputation of subjects  that compose the plurality of citations  citing the plurality of objects  on dimensions that are related to, for non-limiting examples, one or more of the specific topic or objects (e.g., automobiles or restaurants) cited by the subjects, or form of citations (e.g., a weblog or Wikipedia entry or news article or Twitter feed), or search terms (e.g., key words or phrases specified in order to define a subset of all entities that match the search term(s)), in which a subset of the ranked entities are made available based on selection criteria, such as the rank, date or time, or geography\/location associated with the entity, and\/or any other selection criteria.","In some embodiments, influence evaluation engine  determines an influence score for a first subject or source at least partly based on how often a first subject is cited or referenced by a (another) second subject(s). Here, each of the first or the second subject can be but is not limited to an internet author or user of social media services, while each citation describes reference by the second subject to a citation of an object by the first subject. The number of the citations or the citation score of the first subject by the second subjects is computed and the influence of the second subjects citing the first subject can also be optionally taken into account in the citation score. For a non-limiting example, the influence score of the first subject is computed as a function of some or all of: the number of citations of the first subject by second subjects, a score for each such citation, and the influence score of the second subjects. Once computed, the influence of the first subject as reflected by the count of citations or citation score of the first subject or subject can be displayed to the user at a location associated with the first subject, such as the \u201cprofile page\u201d of the first subject, together with a list of the second subjects citing the first subjects, which can be optionally ranked by the influences of the second subject.","In some embodiments, influence evaluation engine  allows for the attribution of influence on subjects  to data sources (e.g., sources of opinions, data, or referrals) to be estimated and distributed\/propagated based on the citation graph . More specifically, an entity can be directly linked to any number of other entities on any number of dimensions in the citation graph , with each link possibly having an associated score. For a non-limiting example, a path on a given dimension between two entities, such as a subject  and an object , includes a directed or an undirected link from the source to an intermediate entity, prefixed to a directed or undirected path from the intermediate entity to the object  in the same or possibly a different dimension.","In some embodiments, influence evaluation engine  estimates the influence of each entity as the count of actual requests for data, opinion, or searches relating to or originating from other entities, entities with direct links to the entity or with a path in the citation graph, possibly with a predefined maximum length, to the entity; such actual requests being counted if they occur within a predefined period of time and result in the use of the paths originating from the entity (e.g., representing opinions, reviews, citations or other forms of expression) with or without the count being adjusted by the possible weights on each link, the length of each path, and the level of each entity on each path.","In some embodiments, influence evaluation engine  adjusts the influence of each entity by metrics relating to the citation graph comprising all entities or a subset of all linked entities. For a non-limiting example, such metrics can include the density of the graph, defined as the ratio of the number of links to the number of linked entities in the graph; such metrics are transformed by mathematical functions optimal to the topology of the graph, such as where it is known that the distribution of links among entities in a given graph may be non-linear. An example of such an adjustment would be the operation of estimating the influence of an entity as the number of directed links connecting to the entity, divided by the logarithm of the density of the citation graph comprising all linked entities. For example, such an operation can provide an optimal method of estimating influence rapidly with a limited degree of computational complexity.","In some embodiments, influence evaluation engine  optimizes the estimation of influence for different contexts and requirements of performance, memory, graph topology, number of entities, and\/or any other context and\/or requirement, by any combination of the operations described above in paragraphs above, and any similar operations involving metrics including but not limited to values comprising: the number of potential source entities to the entity for which influence is to be estimated, the number of potential target entities, the number of potential directed paths between any one entity and any other entity on any or all given dimensions, the number of potential directed paths that include the entity, the number of times within a defined period that a directed link from the entity is used for a scoring, search or other operation(s).","In some embodiments, object selection engine  utilizes influence scores of the citing subjects  and the number of their citations  to determine the selection and ranking of objects  cited by the citations, wherein the objects include but are not limited to documents on the Internet, products, services, data files, legal or natural persons, or any entities in any form or means that can be searched or cited over a network. Here, object selection engine  selects and ranks the cited objects based on ranking criteria that include but are not limited to, influence scores of the citing subjects, date or time, geographical location associated with the objects, and\/or any other selection criteria.","In some embodiments, object selection engine  calculates and ranks the influence scores of the cited objects based on attributes of one or more of the following scoring components in combination with other attributes of objects including semantic or descriptive data regarding the objects:\n\n","For a non-limiting example, in the example depicted in , citing subject Author One has an influence score of 10, which composes Citation 1.1 and Citation 1.2, wherein Citation 1.1 cites Target One once while Citation 1.2 cites Target Two twice; citing subject Author Two has an influence score of 5, which composes Citation 2.1, which cites Target One three times; citing subject Author Three has an influence score of 4, which composes Citation 3.2, which cites Target Two four times. Based on the influence scores of the authors alone, object selection engine  calculates the influence score of Target One as 10*1+3*5=25, while the influence score of Target Two is calculated as 10*2+4*4=36. Since Target Two has a higher influence score than Target One, it should be ranked higher than Target One in the final search result.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"In the example of , the flowchart  starts at block  where citation searching, retrieving and ranking criteria and mechanisms are set and adjusted based on user specification and\/or internal statistical data. The flowchart  continues to block  where a plurality of citations of objects that fit the search criteria, such as text match, time filter, author filter, type filter, are retrieved. The flowchart  continues to block  where influence scores of a plurality of subjects that compose the plurality of citations of objects are calculated. The flowchart  continues to block  where influence scores of objects in the citations from the search are calculated based on the influence scores of the plurality of subjects and the ranking criteria. The flowchart  ends at block  where objects are selected as the search result based on the matching of the objects with the searching criteria as well as influence scores of the objects.","In some embodiments, object selection engine  determines the qualities of the cited objects by examining the distribution of influence scores of subjects citing the objects in the search results. For a non-limiting example, one measure of the influence distribution is the ratio of the number of citations from the \u201cinfluential\u201d and the \u201cnon-influential\u201d subjects, where \u201cinfluential\u201d subjects may, for a non-limiting example, have an influence score higher than a threshold determined by the percentile distribution of all influence scores. Object selection engine  accepts only those objects that show up in the citation search results if their citation ratios from \u201cinfluential\u201d and \u201cnon-influential\u201d subjects are above a certain threshold while others can be marked as spam if the ratio of their citation ratios from \u201cinfluential\u201d and \u201cnon-influential\u201d subjects fall below the certain threshold, indicating that they are most likely cited from spam subjects.","In some embodiments, object selection engine  calculates and ranks cited objects by treating citations of the objects as connections having positive or negative weights in a weighted citation graph. A citation with implicit positive weight can include, for a non-limiting example, a retweet or a link between individual blog posts or web cites, while a citation with negative weight can include, for a non-limiting example, a statement by one subject  that another source is a spammer.","In some embodiments, object selection engine  uses citations with negative weights in a citation graph-based rank\/influence calculation approach to propagate negative citation scores through the citation graph. Assigning and propagating citations of negative weights makes it possible to identify clusters of spammers in the citation graph without having each spammer individually identified. Furthermore, identifying subjects\/sources  with high influence and propagating a few negative citations from such subjects is enough to mark an entire cluster of spammers negatively, thus reducing their influence on the search result.","In some embodiments, object selection engine  presents the generated search results of cited objects to a user who issues the search request or provides the generated search results to a third party for further processing. In some embodiments, object selection engine  presents to the user a score computed from a function combining the count of citations and the influence of the subjects of the citations along with the search result of the objects. In some embodiments, object selection engine  displays multiple scores computed from functions combining the counts of subsets of citations and the influence of the source of each citation along with the search result, where each subset may be determined by criteria such as the influence of the subjects, or attributes of the subjects or the citations. For non limiting-examples, the following may be displayed to the user\u2014\u201c5 citations from Twitter; 7 citations from people in Japan; and 8 citations in English from influential users.\u201d The subsets above may be selected and\/or filtered either by the object selection engine  or by users.","In some embodiments, object selection engine  selects for display of every object in the search result, one or more citations and the subjects of the citations on the basis of criteria such as the recency or the influence of their citing subjects relative to the other citations in the search result. Object selection engine  then displays the selected citations and\/or subjects in such a way that the relationship between the search result, the citations and the subjects of the citations are made transparent to a user.","One embodiment may be implemented using a conventional general purpose or a specialized digital computer or microprocessor(s) programmed according to the teachings of the present disclosure, as will be apparent to those skilled in the computer art.
