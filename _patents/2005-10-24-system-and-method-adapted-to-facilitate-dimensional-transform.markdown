title: System and method adapted to facilitate dimensional transform
abstract: Systems and methods that facilitate dimensional transformations of data points are disclosed. In particular, the subject invention provides for a system and methodology that simplifies dimensional transformations while mitigating variations of a distance property between pairs of points. A set of n data points in d dimensional space is represented as an n×d input matrix, where d also corresponds to the number of attributes per data point. A transformed matrix represents the n data points in a lower dimensionality k after being mapped. The transformed matrix is an n×k matrix, where k is the number of attributes per data point and is less than d. The transformed matrix is obtained by multiplying the input matrix by a suitable projection matrix. The projection matrix is generated by randomly populating the entries of the matrix with binary or ternary values according to a probability distribution. Unlike previous methods, the projection matrix is formed without obtaining an independent sample from a Gaussian distribution for each entry in the projection matrix, without applying a linear algebraic technique to generate the projection matrix and without employing arbitrary floating point numbers. Processes and/or algorithms can utilize the reduced transformed matrix instead of the larger input matrix to facilitate computational efficiency and data compression.

No. 10\/086,309, filed Mar. 1, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,043,514, and entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD ADAPTED TO FACILITATE DIMENSIONAL TRANSFORM.\u201d The entirety of the aforementioned application is incorporated by reference.

No. 7,318,078, and entitled, \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD ADAPTED TO FACILITATE DIMENSIONAL TRANSFORM.\u201d","The present invention relates generally to data manipulation and, and more particularly to a system and method adapted to facilitate dimensional transformations of data pointsets in Euclidean space.","The amount of information available via computers has dramatically increased with the wide spread proliferation of computer networks, the Internet and digital storage means. With the increased amount of information has come the need to manage, sort-through and selectively access data to facilitate efficient utilization and manipulation of information.","Much of the information generated today can be organized into matrices or data tables. By way of example, online consumer transactions can be organized into a matrix, where rows of the matrix correspond to individual consumers and columns of the matrix correspond to consumers or transactional attributes (e.g., points of purchase, zip codes). Often, such information can be represented as a pointset in Euclidean space, where the dimensionality of the pointset corresponds to a number of coordinates (e.g., attributes) that identifies or locates the points in the space.","Euclidean space is a type of metric space that can have an arbitrary number of dimensions. For example, common everyday space has three dimensions. On the other hand, Euclidean spaces, such as that which may be representative of one or more data processing applications, can have hundreds of thousands of dimensions and many millions of corresponding data points. In such situations, it is often desirable to map the original set of points into a new set of equally many points, residing in a lower dimensional Euclidean space. By mapping the original points to a lower dimensional space, a benefit of data compression is obtained since fewer attributes are required to represent each point. As such, storage requirements and processing capabilities can be significantly reduced. At the same time, though, it is understood that, in general, the new representation cannot perfectly capture all information present in the original, high-dimensional representation.","As an example, one common technique for mapping data to a lower dimensional space is to project the original data on the hyperplane spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the k largest singular values of the original data. While such projections have a number of useful properties, they may fail to preserve distances between data points, referred to as a pairwise distance property. That is, pairs of points represented in the lower dimensionality may have distances significantly different from their distances in the original dimensional space. Therefore, algorithms that look to pairwise distances properties as input data can not benefit from this type of mapping as inconsistent results may occur.","As such, it may be desirable to maintain pairwise distance properties so that, for every pair of points, their distance in low dimensional space substantially approximates their distance in high dimensional space. The reason that such a property may be important is that many data processing algorithms are not concerned with other structural properties of the data beyond interpoint distances. As a result, by applying a distance-preserving dimensionality reduction before applying such algorithms a benefit of compression is obtained while the produced results are consistent with the results that the algorithms would give if they were applied to the original high-dimensional data. Besides the compression benefit, by running at a lower dimensional space, many algorithms perform significantly faster than if executed in the original higher dimensional space.","By way of example, such embeddings are useful in solving an \u03b5-approximate nearest neighbor problem, where (after some preprocessing of a pointset P) an answer is given to queries such as, given an arbitrary point x, find a point y\u2208P, such that for every point z\u2208P,||x\u2212z||\u2267(1\u2212\u03b5)||x\u2212||. Additionally, such embeddings are useful as part of an approximation algorithm for a version of clustering where it is sought to minimize sum of squares of intra cluster distances. Such embeddings can also be useful in data-stream\u201d computations, where there is limited memory and only a single pass over the data (stream) is allowed.","One approach to performing a transformation that preserves the pairwise distance property is to represent the original data points as an input matrix and to multiply that matrix with a projection matrix R in order to generate a transformed matrix T representative of the transformed or mapped set of data points. The input matrix can be thought of as a set of n points in d dimensional Euclidean space represented as an n\u00d7d matrix A where each data point is represented as a row (vector) having d attributes (coordinates). The transformed matrix has the same number of n data points as the input matrix, but has a reduced number of attributes (e.g., k attributes) and thus can be represented as an n\u00d7k matrix. Processes and\/or algorithms can utilize the transformed matrix instead of the input matrix, thereby increasing computational efficiency.","However, establishing a suitable projection matrix R and multiplying it by the input matrix A can be non-trivial, particularly in many practical computational environments where a very large number of data points and corresponding attributes may exist. For instance, developing the projection matrix R typically includes generating a random number for each entry in the matrix (e.g., Gaussian mean of zero and variance of one), truncating the entries to about five to ten digits, and applying a linear algebraic transformation to the entries to make the columns of the projection matrix orthonormal. This is often an arduous task since the projection matrix can be very large. Then, to perform the matrix multiplication of A by R, substantial computations have to be performed. For example, to transform a million data points in ten thousand dimensional space into a smaller dimensional space (e.g., one thousand dimensional space), a million rows, each having ten thousand columns, have to be multiplied by a matrix having ten thousand rows and one thousand columns.","Although the aforementioned approach preserves a pairwise distance property, such approach has deficiencies (e.g., a sample of the Gaussian distribution is needed for each entry in R; linear algebra techniques are required to obtain the projection matrix R, the resulting projection matrix R is a dense matrix composed of arbitrary floating point numbers, very few of which are 0, making computations numerous and complicated). Accordingly, a more elegant solution to generating a suitable projection matrix in a computationally efficient manner is desired.","The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The present invention relates generally to a system and method that facilitates mapping or transforming data point sets from a high dimensionality to a lower dimensionality while mitigating variations in, and preserving a pairwise distance property. The present invention accomplishes such mappings in manners that are simpler and faster than conventional techniques, while providing comparable results. In particular, a projection matrix is produced more efficiently and is utilized to effect such transformation in a computationally efficient and less complex manner than conventional techniques.","Generally, a set of n data points is represented as an n\u00d7d input matrix, where d is a number of attributes per data point and is also the number of columns. A transformed matrix T represents the n data points, in a lower dimension than the input matrix, after being mapped or transformed from the input matrix. It is appreciated that this transformation maintains a pairwise distance property between any two of the set of data points. The transformed matrix is obtained by multiplying the input matrix by a projection matrix. This multiplication projects the data points from a higher dimensional representation (the input matrix) into a lower dimensional representation (the transformed matrix). The projection matrix is randomly populated with binary, {\u22121,+1}, or ternary {\u22121,0,+1} values, in each case according to a simple probability distribution. After this population is completed the matrix can be used immediately, without any further linear algebraic manipulations. The projection matrix is thus generated without obtaining an independent sample from a Gaussian distribution for each entry in the projection matrix, without applying a linear algebraic technique and without employing arbitrary floating point numbers. The transformed matrix is represented as an n\u00d7k matrix, where n is the number of data points and k is the number of attributes per data point, and where k is less than the number of attributes in the original dimensionality d.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a probability distribution for the randomly generated entries populating the projection matrix utilized to reduce dimensionality of a data set is: \u22121 with probability 1\/6; 0 with probability 2\/3; and +1 with probability 1\/6. In another embodiment, the probability distribution is: \u22121 with probability 1\/2 and +1 with probability 1\/2.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a system that dimensionally transforms a pointset includes a receive matrix component that receives a high dimensional point set, an R matrix generator that receives an input matrix from the receive matrix component and generates a projection matrix based thereon. In particular, the R matrix generator utilizes the dimensions of the input matrix to produce the projection matrix, not the data itself. The projection matrix entries of at least one of +1, 0, \u22121. The system also includes a transformation engine that reduces the dimensionality of the pointset via employment of the projection matrix while maintaining integrity of a pairwise distance property.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, a transformation engine simplifies matrix multiplication to effect reduced dimensional transformation. The transformation engine produces a transformed matrix and further includes a partition component that, for respective entries in the transformed matrix, discards calculations wherein attributes are to be multiplied by zero, forms a first set of attributes that are to be multiplied by +1, and forms a second set of attributes that are to be multiplied by \u22121. The transformation engine also includes a first set summer that produces a first sum from the first set of attributes for entries in the transformed matrix, a second set summer that produces a second sum from the first set of attributes for respective entries in the transformed matrix, and a difference component that subtracts the first and second sums to produce the respective entries for the transformed matrix","According to still another aspect of the present invention, a method for transforming n points in d dimensionality, represented as an n\u00d7d input matrix, to k dimensionality is disclosed, where k is less than d. An n\u00d7k transformed matrix is produced thereby while variations in a distance property between pairs of the points are mitigated. The method includes multiplying the n\u00d7d input matrix by a d\u00d7k projection matrix having entries randomly populated from the group comprising +1, 0, \u22121. Then, for respective entries in the transformed matrix, calculations wherein multiplication would be by 0 are discarded, a first sum is produced wherein multiplication would be by +1 and a second sum is produced wherein multiplication would be by \u22121. Finally, respective first and second sums are subtracted to obtain each entry in the transformed matrix.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed and the present invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features of the invention may become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","Appendix A illustrates a proof establishing that a pairwise distance is maintained during transformations in accordance with the present invention, and this Appendix is to be considered part of this specification.","The present invention is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It may be evident, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the present invention.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent\u201d and \u201csystem\u201d are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","It is to be appreciated that, for purposes of the present invention, any or all of the functionality associated with modules, systems and\/or components discussed herein can be achieved in any of a variety of ways (e.g. combination or individual implementations of active server pages (ASPs), common gateway interfaces (CGIs), application programming interfaces (API's), structured query language (SQL), component object model (COM), distributed COM (DCOM), system object model (SOM), distributed SOM (DSOM), ActiveX, common object request broker architecture (CORBA), database management systems (DBMSs), relational database management systems (RDBMSs), object-oriented database management system (ODBMSs), object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS), remote method invocation (RMI), C, C++, practical extraction and reporting language (PERL), applets, HTML, dynamic HTML, server side includes (SSIs), extensible markup language (XML), portable document format (PDF), wireless markup language (WML), standard generalized markup language (SGML), handheld device markup language (HDML), graphics interchange format (GIF), joint photographic experts group (JPEG), binary large object (BLOB), other script or executable components).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","100"]},"The receive matrix component  sends or transfers an input matrix to the transformation engine . The receive matrix component  can generate the input matrix from high dimensional data. Additionally, the receive matrix component  can receive the input matrix from a data store (not shown) storing high dimensional data. The input matrix is an n\u00d7d matrix representative of n points in d dimensional Euclidean space (), where n can be a large number of data points, such as a million data points, and d can be a high dimensional space, such as a space having around ten thousand dimensions. Each row of the input matrix n represents a vector of d attributes. The transformed matrix T is an n\u00d7k matrix representative of the n points embedded into k dimensional Euclidean space (), where k<d. Likewise, respective rows of the transformed matrix n, represent a vector of k attributes. The n points are transformed into the lower dimensional space while mitigating variations in the distance between pairs of data points. It is to be appreciated that any desired accuracy can be achieved with a corresponding increase in k. For instance, if this pairwise distance property is maintained within 0.05% of its original value for all point pairs at particular k, it may be maintained within 0.01% of its original value for all point pairs by increasing k.","The transformation engine  dimensionally transforms the input matrix A into the transformed matrix T while maintaining the pairwise distance within an acceptable degree of error. The pairwise distance is preserved according to the guarantee defined by Eq. 1, shown below, such that Eq. 1 is met for a given acceptable degree of error \u03b5. The acceptable degree of error \u03b5 is selectable and can vary.","Let f be a function that transforms (maps) points from d dimensional Euclidean space () into k dimensional Euclidean space (). That is, provided a point u in d-dimensional Euclidean space, f(u) denotes its k-dimensional counterpart as prescribed by f. Similarly, for a point v in d-dimensional Euclidean space, f(v) denotes its k-dimensional counterpart as prescribed by f. To express mathematically that f is a transformation that indeed preserves pairwise distances for the acceptable degree of error \u03b5, the following formula is used:","Given \u03b5>0 (where the parameter \u03b5 controls accuracy in terms of pairwise distance preservation) and an integer n, let k be a positive integer such that k\u2267k=10(\u03b5log n). For a set P of n points in there exists f: \u2192such that for all u,v\u2208P\n\n(1\u2212\u03b5)||()\u2212()||\u2266(1+\u03b5)||\u2003\u2003Eq. 1\n","To effect the transformed matrix, the transformation engine  generates a projection matrix R. The projection matrix is generated with d\u00d7k dimensions so that the multiplication of the n\u00d7d input matrix A and the d\u00d7k projection matrix R produces the n\u00d7k transformed matrix T. It is to be appreciated that the transformation engine  only looks to the dimensions (e.g., n points and d attributes) of the input matrix A to produce the projection matrix R, and not to the contents of the input matrix. According to one or more aspects of the present invention, the entries in the projection matrix can be binary or ternary values, such as (\u22121, +1) or (\u22121, 0, +1). In accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention, the entries are randomly assigned to the projection matrix according to a probability distribution. Two such possible probability distributions are shown below in association with Eqs. 2 and 3:","For integer k\u2267k, let R be a d\u00d7k projection matrix with R(i,j)=r, where {r} are independent random variables from either one of the following two probability distributions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","ij"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":"{","mrow":{"mtable":[{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"+","mn":"1"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}]},{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mn":["1","2"],"mo":"\/"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mn":["1","2"],"mo":"\/"}}}]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["with","probability"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","ij"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msqrt":{"mrow":{"mn":"3","mo":"\u00d7"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mrow":{"mn":["1","6"],"mo":"\/"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mrow":{"mi":["with","probability"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mn":["2","3"],"mo":"\/"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},{"mrow":{"mn":["1","6"],"mo":"\/"}}]}]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"3"}}]}]}}},"br":{},"sub":"o "},"Let P be an arbitrary set of n points in , represented as an n\u00d7d matrix A.

Additionally, Eq. 4 can be used to find the minimum k that yields an acceptable transformation of the input matrix to the transformed matrix. The \u03b2 is also selectable and can vary according to aspects of the invention. The \u03b5 used in Eq. 4 is the same value as used in Eq. 1. It is appreciated that entries of projection matrix can be multiplied by a scaler, such as is illustrated in Eq. 3 (where entries are multiplied by a scaler of \u221a{square root over (3)}). However, this scaling is generally not required because, typically, only relative distances are desired, not absolute distances. Additionally, the entries in the projection matrix R (\u22121, +1) or (+1, 0, \u22121) simplify the matrix computations needed to perform the projection of the points from the d-dimensional Euclidean space to the k-dimensional Euclidean space.","The transformation engine, after generating the projection matrix, multiplies the input matrix by the projection matrix to generate the transformed matrix.

The n rows, respectively contain d attributes. For respective rows of the transformed matrix, perform the following:","Randomly discard 2\/3 of the attributes from a row of the input matrix at . Alternate aspects of the invention can randomly discard other amounts of the attributes, such as, none, 1\/4, 1\/2 and the like. The remaining attributes from the row are referred to as end points. The remaining attributes are partitioned into a first set of attributes and a second set of attributes at . Usually, the attributes are partitioned evenly such that the number of attributes in the first set of attributes is equal to the number of attributes in the second set of attributes. The first set of attributes is summed to a positive attribute at . The second set of attributes is summed to a negative attribute at . The negative attribute (sum of the second set of attributes) is subtracted from the positive attribute (sum of the first set of attributes) at . This difference is a coordinate of the transformed matrix. The method is repeated k times for each row of the input matrix. Then, a next row of the input matrix is processed according to , , ,  and  at . After the rows have been processed, a transformed matrix is provided at . The transformed matrix has n data points where each row contains k attributes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"],"b":["1204","1206","1208","1210","1212","1206","1208","1210","1212","1214","1216"]},"In order to provide additional context for various aspects of the present invention,  and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of one possible suitable computing environment  in which the various aspects of the present invention may be implemented.
