{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/118,825 filed Dec. 1, 2008, and entitled \u201cStable Power Devices On Low-Angle Off-Cut Silicon Carbide Crystals,\u201d the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under contract no. W911NF-04-2-0022 awarded by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to electronic devices, and more particularly to electronic devices including semiconductor mesa structures and related methods.","High voltage silicon carbide (SiC) devices can handle voltages above about 600V or more. Such devices may handle as much as about 100 amps or more of current, depending on their active area. High voltage SiC devices have a number of important applications, particularly in the field of power conditioning, distribution and control. High voltage semiconductor devices, such as Schottky diodes, MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors), GTOs (gate turn-off thyristors), IGBTs (insulated gate bipolar transistors), BJTs (bipolar junction transistors), etc., have been fabricated using silicon carbide.","A conventional SiC power device, such as a SiC Schottky diode structure, has an n-type SiC substrate on which an n\u2212 epitaxial layer, which functions as a drift region, is formed. The device typically includes a Schottky contact formed directly on the n\u2212 layer. Surrounding the Schottky contact is a p-type JTE (junction termination extension) region that is typically formed by ion implantation. The implants may be aluminum, boron, or any other suitable p-type dopant. The purpose of the JTE region is to reduce electric field crowding at the edges of the junction, and to reduce or prevent the depletion region from interacting with the surface of the device. Surface effects may cause the depletion region to spread unevenly, which may adversely affect the breakdown voltage of the device. Other termination techniques include guard rings and floating field rings that may be more strongly influenced by surface effects. A channel stop region may also be formed by implantation of n-type dopants, such as nitrogen or phosphorus, in order to reduce extension of the depletion region toward the edge of the device.","In addition to junction termination extension (JTE), multiple floating guard rings (MFGR) and field plates (FP) are commonly used termination schemes in high voltage silicon carbide devices. Another conventional edge termination technique is a mesa edge termination. However, the presence of a mesa termination may cause a high electric field to occur at the mesa corner, even if a junction termination extension or guard ring is present. Over-etching of the mesa can exacerbate the problem of electric field crowding at the mesa corner. A high electric field at the mesa corner may result in a much lower breakdown voltage than would otherwise be expected for a given drift layer thickness and doping.","A conventional mesa-terminated PIN diode is illustrated in . As shown therein, a PIN diode  includes an n\u2212 drift layer  between a p+ layer  and an n+ substrate .  illustrates one half of a PIN-structure; the structure may include mirror image portions (not shown). An anode contact  is on the p+ layer , and a cathode contact  is on the n+ substrate . The p+ layer  is formed as a mesa on the n\u2212 drift layer . A junction termination extension (JTE) region  including a plurality of JTE zones A, B, C is provided in the n\u2212 drift layer  adjacent the p+ mesa . The JTE zones A, B, C are p-type regions that may have levels of charge that decrease outwardly with distance from the PN junction between the p+ mesa  and the n\u2212 drift layer . Although three JTE zones A, B, C are illustrated, more or fewer JTE zones may be provided.","As shown in , the n\u2212 drift layer  adjacent the p+ mesa  may be slightly over-etched due, for example, to difficulties in etch process control, so that a sidewall A of the n-drift layer  beneath the p+ mesa  may be exposed. Over-etching of up to about 3000 \u212b (Angstroms) may occur in some cases. To protect the exposed sidewall A, a sidewall implant may be performed in which p-type impurities are implanted into the sidewall A to form a sidewall implant region .","In conventional mesa-terminated structures, such as the PIN diode structure  illustrated in , field crowding may occur at or near the mesa corners , resulting in high electric field strengths at the corners . These high field strengths can reduce the breakdown voltage of the device. For example, a conventional mesa-terminated PIN diode structure that has a theoretical breakdown voltage of 12 kV, based on thickness and doping of the drift layer and the JTE design, may have an effective breakdown voltage of only 8 kV.","In addition to field crowding, another challenge in the development of SiC power bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) is the phenomenon of current gain degradation, that is, a reduction in current gain over time in the device. Current gain degradation is typically attributed to material defects such as basal plane dislocations (BPDs) and to surface recombination, especially along the emitter sidewall and surface of the base of the device. A slight reduction of current gain degradation on SiC BJTs fabricated on BPD-free wafers has been observed. In addition, the emitter fingers of SiC BJTs are typically formed by reactive ion etching (RIE). The non-uniformity of RIE etching rate can partially or completely etch away the base material around the wafer periphery, which can cause a large reduction in yields.","According to some embodiments of the present invention, a bipolar semiconductor device may include a semiconductor buffer layer having a first conductivity type and a semiconductor mesa having the first conductivity type on a surface of the buffer layer. A current shifting region having a second conductivity type may be provided adjacent a corner between the semiconductor mesa and the semiconductor buffer layer. Moreover, the first and second conductivity types may be different conductivity types, and the current shifting region may be between portions of the semiconductor buffer layer and the semiconductor mesa having the first conductivity type.","In addition, a metal electrode may be provided on a surface of the semiconductor mesa so that the semiconductor mesa is between the metal electrode and the semiconductor buffer layer. Central portions of the semiconductor mesa adjacent the semiconductor buffer layer may be free of the current shifting region to provide an electrical current path of the first conductivity type from the metal electrode to a surface of the semiconductor buffer layer opposite the semiconductor mesa and\/or to provide an electrical current path of the first conductivity type from the surface of the semiconductor buffer layer opposite the semiconductor mesa to the metal electrode. The current shifting region may extend to portions of the semiconductor buffer layer that are free of the semiconductor mesa.","A semiconductor step may be provided adjacent the semiconductor mesa and a thickness of the semiconductor step may be less than a thickness of the semiconductor mesa. Moreover, a depth of the current shifting region into the buffer layer adjacent the semiconductor step may be less than a depth of the current shifting region into a portion of the buffer layer that is free of the semiconductor step.","A semiconductor control layer having the second conductivity type may be provided on the semiconductor buffer layer so that the semiconductor buffer layer is between the semiconductor control layer and the semiconductor mesa and so that semiconductor buffer layer is between the current shifting region and the semiconductor control layer. In addition, a control contact region having the second conductivity type may extend through the semiconductor buffer layer to provide electrical coupling with the semiconductor control layer, and the control contact region may be spaced apart from the current shifting region.","A semiconductor drift layer having the first conductivity type may be provided so that the semiconductor control layer is between the semiconductor drift layer and the semiconductor buffer layer. A first metal electrode may be provided on the semiconductor mesa so that the semiconductor mesa is between the first metal electrode and the semiconductor buffer layer. A second metal electrode may be provided on the control contact region so that the control contact region is between the second metal electrode and the semiconductor control layer. A third metal electrode may be provided so that the semiconductor drift layer is between the third metal electrode and the semiconductor control layer.","A semiconductor anode\/cathode layer having the second conductivity type may be provided between the semiconductor drift layer and the third metal electrode.","The semiconductor control, drift, and\/or anode\/cathode layers may be provided on a silicon carbide substrate so that the semiconductor control, drift, and\/or anode\/cathode layers is\/are between the silicon carbide substrate and the semiconductor buffer layer. In addition, the silicon carbide substrate may define a surface that is cut off axis at an angle of no more than about 4 degrees or that is cut on axis. Moreover, crystalline structures of the semiconductor control layer, the semiconductor buffer layer, and the semiconductor mesa may be aligned with respect to a crystalline structure of the silicon carbide substrate.","According to other embodiments of the present invention, a method of forming a bipolar semiconductor device may include forming a semiconductor buffer layer having a first conductivity type, and forming a semiconductor mesa having the first conductivity type on a surface of the buffer layer. A current shifting region having a second conductivity type may be formed adjacent a corner between the semiconductor mesa and the semiconductor buffer layer. Moreover, the first and second conductivity types may be different conductivity types, and the current shifting region may be between portions of the semiconductor buffer layer and the semiconductor mesa having the first conductivity type.","Forming the current shifting region may include doping (e.g., implanting) an exposed portion of the semiconductor buffer layer adjacent the semiconductor mesa with a dopant having the second conductivity type after forming the semiconductor mesa. The semiconductor buffer layer and the semiconductor mesa may be thermally treated so that portions of the dopant diffuse between the semiconductor mesa and the semiconductor buffer layer.","Forming the semiconductor mesa may include epitaxially forming a semiconductor mesa layer on an entirety of the semiconductor buffer layer. Portions of the semiconductor mesa layer may be selectively removed (e.g., using reactive ion etching or RIE) to define the semiconductor mesa and to expose portions of the semiconductor buffer layer.","A metal electrode may be formed on a surface of the semiconductor mesa so that the semiconductor mesa is between the metal electrode and the semiconductor buffer layer. Central portions of the semiconductor mesa adjacent the semiconductor buffer layer may be free of the current shifting region to provide an electrical current path of the first conductivity type from the metal electrode to a surface of the semiconductor buffer layer opposite the semiconductor mesa and\/or to provide an electrical current path of the first conductivity type from the surface of the semiconductor buffer layer opposite the semiconductor mesa to the metal electrode.","The current shifting region may extend to portions of the semiconductor buffer layer that are free of the semiconductor mesa.","Before forming the current shifting region, a semiconductor step may be formed adjacent the semiconductor mesa wherein a thickness of the semiconductor step is less than a thickness of the semiconductor mesa. A depth of the current shifting region into the buffer layer adjacent the semiconductor step may be less than a depth of the current shifting region into a portion of the buffer layer that is free of the semiconductor step. Forming the semiconductor step may include selectively removing (e.g., using reactive ion etching or ME) portions of the semiconductor buffer layer spaced apart from the semiconductor mesa to define the semiconductor step adjacent the semiconductor mesa after forming the semiconductor mesa.","Forming the current shifting region may include doping (e.g., using ion implantation) portions of the semiconductor buffer layer adjacent the semiconductor step with a dopant having the second conductivity type after forming the semiconductor mesa and after forming the semiconductor step. The semiconductor buffer layer and the semiconductor mesa may be thermally treated so that portions of the dopant diffuse between the semiconductor mesa and the semiconductor buffer layer.","Before forming the semiconductor buffer layer, a semiconductor control layer having the second conductivity type may be formed, and forming the semiconductor buffer layer may include forming the semiconductor buffer layer on the semiconductor control layer. Accordingly, the semiconductor buffer layer may be between the semiconductor control layer and the semiconductor mesa so that the semiconductor buffer layer is between the current shifting region and the semiconductor control layer. After forming the semiconductor mesa, a control contact region having the second conductivity type may be formed, and the control contact region may extend through the semiconductor buffer layer to provide electrical coupling with the semiconductor control layer. The control contact region may be spaced apart from the current shifting region.","Before forming the semiconductor control layer, a semiconductor drift layer having the first conductivity type may be formed, and forming the semiconductor control layer may include forming the semiconductor control layer on the semiconductor drift layer. Accordingly, the semiconductor control layer may be between the semiconductor drift layer and the semiconductor buffer layer. A first metal electrode may be formed on the semiconductor mesa so that the semiconductor mesa is between the first metal electrode and the semiconductor buffer layer. A second metal electrode may be formed on the control contact region so that the control contact region is between the second metal electrode and the semiconductor control layer. A third metal electrode may be formed on the semiconductor drift layer so that the semiconductor drift layer is between the third metal electrode and the semiconductor control layer.","Before forming the semiconductor drift layer, a semiconductor anode\/cathode layer may be formed, and forming the semiconductor drift layer may include forming the semiconductor drift layer on the semiconductor anode\/cathode layer so that the semiconductor anode\/cathode layer is between the semiconductor drift layer and the third metal electrode.","Forming the semiconductor control, drift, and\/or anode\/cathode layers may include forming the semiconductor control, drift, and\/or anode\/cathode layers on a silicon carbide substrate so that the semiconductor control, drift, and\/or anode\/cathode layers is\/are between the silicon carbide substrate and the semiconductor buffer layer. The silicon carbide substrate may define a surface that is cut off axis at an angle of no more than about 4 degrees or that is cut on axis, and crystalline structures of the semiconductor control layer, the semiconductor buffer layer, and the semiconductor mesa may be aligned with respect to a crystalline structure of the silicon carbide substrate. Stated in other words, the semiconductor mesa, buffer, control, drift, and\/or anode\/cathode layers may be epitaxially formed on the silicon carbide substrate.","Embodiments of the present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown.

Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.

It will be further understood that terms used herein should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of this specification and the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or extending \u201conto\u201d another element, it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present.

It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.","Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the invention. The thickness of layers and regions in the drawings may be exaggerated for clarity. Additionally, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and\/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and\/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a discrete change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","Some embodiments of the invention are described with reference to semiconductor layers and\/or regions which are characterized as having a conductivity type such as n-type or p-type, which refers to the majority carrier concentration in the layer and\/or region. Thus, n-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of negatively charged electrons, while p-type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of positively charged holes. Some material may be designated with a \u201c+\u201d or \u201c\u2212\u201d (as in n+, n\u2212, p+, p\u2212, n++, n\u2212\u2212, p++, p\u2212\u2212, or the like), to indicate a relatively larger (\u201c+\u201d) or smaller (\u201c\u2212\u201d) concentration of majority carriers compared to another layer or region. However, such notation does not imply the existence of a particular concentration of majority or minority carriers in a layer or region.","Semiconductor power devices may include bipolar power devices such as merged PiN-Schottky diodes (MPSs), PiN diodes (PNs), Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), Gate Turn-Off Thyristors (GTOs), MOS-controlled thyristors (MCTs), etc., and unipolar power devices (which may incorporate conductivity modulation to achieve surge capability) such as Schottky diodes with a highly doped P+ region, and heterojunction diodes with other materials such as polysilicon. When fabricated on 8 degree off oriented silicon carbide (SiC), such semiconductor power devices may suffer from performance degradation such as increased forward voltage drop (Vdrift), current gain reduction, reverse leakage current increase, etc.","Performance degradation in devices fabricated on 8 degree off oriented SiC may be due to extended growth of basal plane dislocation (BPDs) to stacking faults (SFs) within the active area when forward biasing the junction, via carrier recombination between electrons and holes. These recombinations may enhance the glide of the partial dislocations bounding the stacking fault in the basal planes. The presence of the SFs may locally reduce carrier lifetimes, create excess interface defects, etc. within the SiC crystal and any interface.","Improved thick epitaxial layer growth conditions have been developed to enable high-quality and low defect density (including low BPD density) growth on SiC substrates that are oriented 2 degrees to 6 degrees off axis from the (0001) basal plane. Epitaxial layers grown in this fashion have exhibited reduced BPD densities and therefore reduction in Vdrift and improvement in other performance characteristics without using multi-step etching operations discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat.

SiC substrates with low angle cuts are discussed for example, in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/118,825, filed Dec. 1, 2008, and entitled \u201cStable Power Devices On Low-Angle Off-Cut Silicon Carbide Crystals\u201d, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In a SiC BJT, for example, current gain degradation may be attributed to generation of defects such as stacking faults (SFs) due to carrier recombination and\/or surface recombination, especially in emitter mesa corners. According to embodiments of the present invention, surface recombination at emitter mesa corners may be reduced by shifting current crowding away from the mesa corner and toward the SiC bulk. By shifting current crowding away from the mesa corner, current gain degradation may be reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C"],"b":["201","203","205","207","203","209","211","209","203","211","203","209","203","211","211","207","209","203","203","215","215"]},"The structure illustrated in the plan view of  may be used for different types of semiconductor power devices as discussed in greater detail below.
