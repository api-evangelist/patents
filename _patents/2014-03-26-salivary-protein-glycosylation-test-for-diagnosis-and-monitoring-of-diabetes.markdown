title: Salivary protein glycosylation test for diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes
abstract: Disclosed herein are methods and tests for diagnosing and/or monitoring a metabolic condition such as diabetes in a subject, wherein the methods and tests measure salivary glycoproteins. Some of the methods are based on the oxidation of glycoproteins in a sample from the subject, such as saliva or urine, for example using sodium metaperiodate, and then detecting the aldehydes generated during oxidation using a chemical detection method. Also disclosed are kits and lateral flow devices for detecting glycoproteins in a saliva sample.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments herein relate to the field of diabetes, and more specifically to the diagnosis and monitoring of subjects who have pre-diabetes, diabetes, or diabetic complications.","The elevated glucose levels seen in pre-diabetes, gestational diabetes, and established diabetes can affect protein biomarkers found in biological fluids. For example, glycemic control may affect direct, non-enzymatic protein glycation in which glucose becomes covalently linked to target proteins through the formation of a Schiff base between the aldehyde group of the glucose molecule and the amino group of a lysine residue in a protein. The Schiff base then undergoes an Amadori rearrangement and oxidation to form an advanced glycation end product. One example of an advanced glycation end product is hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The blood levels of HbA1c represent the average blood glucose (BG) level over the previous 3 months, reflecting the lifespan of the red blood cells that carry hemoglobin.","There are a number of issues that arise with using HbA1c to monitor glucose homeostasis, including its inability to reflect shorter-term variations in BG, significant genetic and non-glycemic effects on HbA1c levels, and significant age-dependent and ethnic variations in the relationship between HbA1c levels and average BG levels. The use of glycated albumin or fructosamine as an alternative offers the advantage of reflecting a shorter response time (e.g., representing the average BG level over the previous 2-4 weeks), but the effects of the various factors that hamper the utility of HbA1c on the relationship between these glycated proteins and previous BG levels remain problematic.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration embodiments in which the disclosure may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Therefore, the following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Various operations may be described as multiple discrete operations in turn, in a manner that may be helpful in understanding embodiments of the present disclosure; however, the order of description should not be construed to imply that these operations are order dependent.","The description may use perspective-based descriptions such as up\/down, back\/front, and top\/bottom. Such descriptions are merely used to facilitate the discussion and are not intended to restrict the application of embodiments of the present disclosure.","For the purposes of the present disclosure, the phrase \u201cA\/B\u201d means A or B. For the purposes of the present disclosure, the phrase \u201cA and\/or B\u201d means \u201c(A), (B), or (A and B)\u201d. For the purposes of the present disclosure, the phrase \u201cat least one of A, B, and C\u201d means \u201c(A), (B), (C), (A and B), (A and C), (B and C), or (A, B and C)\u201d. For the purposes of the present disclosure, the phrase \u201c(A)B\u201d means \u201c(B) or (AB)\u201d that is, A is an optional element.","The description may use the phrases \u201cin an embodiment,\u201d or \u201cin embodiments,\u201d which may each refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments. Furthermore, the terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d and the like, as used with respect to embodiments of the present invention, are synonymous.","In order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of this disclosure, the following explanations of specific terms are provided:","As used herein, the term \u201canalyte\u201d refers to an atom, molecule, group of molecules, or compound of natural or synthetic origin (e.g., aldehydes, glycolipids, or glycoproteins) sought to be detected or measured. Analytes may include, but are not limited to aldehydes, antibodies, drugs, hormones, antigens, haptens, glycoproteins, glycolipids, carbohydrates, apoproteins, and cofactors.","As used herein, the term \u201cbiological sample\u201d refers to any sample obtained from a plant or animal subject. As used herein, biological samples include all clinical samples useful for detection of glycosylation profile, protein amount, or glycosylation pattern of proteins in subjects, including, but not limited to, cells, tissues, and bodily fluids, such as: blood; derivatives and fractions of blood, such as serum; extracted galls; biopsied or surgically removed tissue, including tissues that are, for example, unfixed, frozen, fixed in formalin and\/or embedded in paraffin; tears; mucus; saliva; milk; skin scrapes; surface washings; urine; sputum; sweat; semen; vaginal secretion; fluid from ulcers and\/or other surface eruptions, blisters, abscesses, and\/or extracts of tissues; cells or organs; cerebrospinal fluid; prostate fluid; pus; or bone marrow aspirates. The biological sample may also be a laboratory research sample such as a cell culture supernatant. In particular examples, the sample is urine or saliva. The sample may be collected or obtained using methods well known to those skilled in the art.","As used herein, the term \u201cchemically oxidizing\u201d refers to a process that involves deliberately contacting a biological sample, such as a saliva sample, with a chemical oxidizing reagent. As used herein, the term \u201cchemically oxidizing\u201d excludes naturally occurring oxidizing processes, such as those that occur when biological samples are exposed to oxygen, such as may be present in ambient air. Rather, the term encompasses chemical oxidizing processes resulting from deliberate contact with a solid or liquid oxidizing agent. Generally, such chemical oxidation results in all or most of the sialic acid and\/or fucose in the sample becoming oxidized, such as at least 50%, at least 70%, at least 90%, or even more of the sialic acid and\/or fucose present in the sample becoming oxidized.","As used herein, the term \u201cdetecting\u201d refers to quantitatively or qualitatively determining the presence of the analyte(s) under investigation, such as a glycoprotein or an aldehyde.","As used herein, the term \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d refers to a disease caused by a relative or absolute lack of insulin leading to uncontrolled carbohydrate metabolism, commonly simplified to \u201cdiabetes,\u201d though diabetes mellitus should not be confused with diabetes insipidus. As used herein, \u201cdiabetes\u201d refers to diabetes mellitus, unless otherwise indicated. A \u201cdiabetic condition\u201d includes pre-diabetes and diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (sometimes referred to as \u201cinsulin-dependent diabetes\u201d or \u201cjuvenile-onset diabetes\u201d) is an auto-immune disease characterized by destruction of the pancreatic \u03b2 cells that leads to a total or near total lack of insulin. In type 2 diabetes (T2DM; sometimes referred to as \u201cnon-insulin-dependent diabetes\u201d or \u201cadult-onset diabetes\u201d), the body does not respond to insulin, though it is present. As used herein, the term \u201cmetabolic condition\u201d is used to refer to type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, and diabetes complications.","Symptoms of diabetes include: excessive thirst (polydipsia); frequent urination (polyuria); extreme hunger or constant eating (polyphagia); unexplained weight loss; presence of glucose in the urine (glycosuria); tiredness or fatigue; changes in vision; numbness or tingling in the extremities (hands, feet); slow-healing wounds or sores; and abnormally high frequency of infection. Diabetes may be clinically diagnosed by a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of greater than or equal to 7.0 mmol\/L (126 mg\/dL), or a plasma glucose concentration of greater than or equal to 11.1 mmol\/L (200 mg\/dL) at about two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 75 g load. A more detailed description of diabetes may be found in , J. B. Wyngaarden, et al., eds. (W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, 1992, 19ed.).","As used herein, the term \u201cglycosylation\u201d refers to covalent modification of a biomolecule (such as a protein or lipid) with one or more oligosaccharide chains. Proteins having at least one oligosaccharide modification are referred to as \u201cglycoproteins\u201d or \u201cglycosylated proteins.\u201d In the case of proteins, glycosylation is usually N-linked or O-linked. N-linked glycosylation refers to linkage of an oligosaccharide to the side chain amino group of an asparagine residue in a protein. O-linked glycosylation refers to linkage of an oligosaccharide to the hydroxyl side chain of a serine, threonine, or hydroxylysine amino acid in a protein.","The oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins are enormously varied, due to the combination of various sugars (for example, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetyllactosamine, mannose, galactose, glucose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, or fucose) and the presence of branched structures (such as biantennary, triantennary, or tetra-antennary structures).","As used herein, the term \u201clateral flow device\u201d refers to a device that absorbs or adsorbs a liquid sample, routes that liquid sample to a detection zone, and uses a detection method to generate a detectable signal in response to the presence or absence of a specific analyte (such as a glycoprotein, glycolipid, or aldehyde). The device may be a test strip used in lateral flow chromatography, in which a test sample fluid, suspected of containing an analyte, flows (for example by capillary action) through the strip (which is frequently made of bibulous materials such as paper, nitrocellulose, and cellulose). The test fluid and any suspended analyte may flow along the strip to a detection zone in which the analyte (if present) interacts with a detection agent to indicate a presence, absence and\/or quantity of the analyte. A lateral flow device may produce a test result that is qualitative or quantitative.","Numerous lateral flow analytical devices have been disclosed, and include those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,313,734; 4,435,504; 4,775,636; 4,703,017; 4,740,468; 4,806,311; 4,806,312; 4,861,711; 4,855,240; 4,857,453; 4,943,522; 4,945,042; 4,496,654; 5,001,049; 5,075,078; 5,126,241; 5,451,504; 5,424,193; 5,712,172; 6,258,548; 6,555,390; 6,699,722; and 6,368,876; EP 0810436; and WO 92\/12428; WO 94\/01775; WO 95\/16207; and WO 97\/06439, each of which is incorporated by reference.","Many lateral flow devices are one-step lateral flow assays in which a biological fluid is placed in a sample area on a bibulous strip (though, non-bibulous materials may be used, and rendered bibulous by applying a surfactant to the material), and allowed to migrate along the strip until the liquid comes into contact with a chemical reagent or specific binding partner that interacts with an analyte (such as an aldehyde, glycoprotein, or glycolipid) in the liquid. Once the analyte interacts with the chemical reagent or specific binding partner, a signal (such as a fluorescent or otherwise visible dye) indicates that the interaction has occurred. Multiple discrete chemical reagents or specific binding partners may be placed on the strip (for example in parallel lines) to detect multiple analytes in the liquid. The test strips may also incorporate control indicators, which provide a signal that the test has adequately been performed, even if a positive signal indicating the presence (or absence) of an analyte is not seen on the strip.","As used herein, two solid components are in \u201coperable contact\u201d or \u201ccontiguous contact\u201d when they are in contact, either directly or indirectly, in such a manner that an aqueous liquid may flow from one of the two components to the other substantially uninterruptedly, by capillarity or otherwise. Direct or contiguous contact means that the two elements are in physical contact, such as edge-to-edge or front-to-back. When two components are in direct contact, they may overlap with an overlap of about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm. However, the components may be placed with abutting edges. \u201cIndirect contact\u201d means that the two elements are not in physical contact, but are bridged by one or more conductors. Operable contact may also be referred to as \u201cfluid transmitting\u201d or \u201cfluid continuous\u201d contact.","As used herein, the term \u201csample application area\u201d refers to an area where a fluid sample is introduced to a chromatographic test strip, such as a chromatographic test strip present in a lateral flow device. In one example, the sample may be introduced to the sample application area by external application, as with a dropper or other applicator. In another example, the sample application area may be directly immersed in the sample, such as when a test strip is dipped into a container holding a sample. In yet another example, the sample may be poured or expressed onto the sample application area.","As used herein, the terms \u201csolid support\u201d and \u201csubstrate\u201d refer to any material which is insoluble, or may be made insoluble by a subsequent reaction. Numerous and varied solid supports are known to those in the art and include, without limitation, nitrocellulose, the walls of wells of a reaction tray, multi-well plates, test tubes, polystyrene beads, magnetic beads, membranes, and microparticles (such as latex particles). Any suitable porous material with sufficient porosity to allow access by detector reagents and a suitable surface affinity to immobilize capture reagents (e.g., antibodies) is contemplated by this term. For example, the porous structure of nitrocellulose has excellent absorption and adsorption qualities for a wide variety of reagents, for instance, capture reagents. Nylon possesses similar characteristics and is also suitable. Microporous structures are useful, as are materials with gel structure in the hydrated state.","Further examples of useful solid supports include: natural polymeric carbohydrates and their synthetically modified, cross-linked or substituted derivatives, such as agar, agarose, cross-linked alginic acid, substituted and cross-linked guar gums, cellulose esters, especially with nitric acid and carboxylic acids, mixed cellulose esters, and cellulose ethers; natural polymers containing nitrogen, such as proteins and derivatives, including cross-linked or modified gelatins; natural hydrocarbon polymers, such as latex and rubber; synthetic polymers which may be prepared with suitably porous structures, such as vinyl polymers, including polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylacetate and its partially hydrolyzed derivatives, polyacrylamides, polymethacrylates, copolymers and terpolymers of the above polycondensates, such as polyesters, polyamides, and other polymers, such as polyurethanes or polyepoxides; porous inorganic materials such as sulfates or carbonates of alkaline earth metals and magnesium, including barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, silicates of alkali and alkaline earth metals, aluminum and magnesium; and aluminum or silicon oxides or hydrates, such as clays, alumina, talc, kaolin, zeolite, silica gel, glass or glass fibers (in some examples, these materials may be used as filters with the above polymeric materials); and mixtures or copolymers of the above classes, such as graft copolymers obtained by initializing polymerization of synthetic polymers on a pre-existing natural polymer.","The surface of a solid support may be activated by chemical processes that cause covalent linkage of an agent (e.g., a chemical reagent) to the support. However, any other suitable method may be used for immobilizing an agent (e.g., a chemical reagent) to a solid support including, without limitation, ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, covalent interactions and the like. A solid phase may be chosen for its intrinsic ability to attract and immobilize an agent, such as a chemical reagent. The factor may include a charged substance that is oppositely charged with respect to, for example, the chemical reagent. Except as otherwise physically constrained, a solid support may be used in any suitable shapes, such as films, sheets, strips, or plates, or it may be coated onto or bonded or laminated to appropriate inert carriers, such as paper, glass, plastic films, or fabrics. As used herein a \u201clateral flow substrate\u201d is any solid support or substrate that is useful in a lateral flow device.","As used herein, the term \u201csubject\u201d refers to a living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes human and non-human mammals (such as laboratory or veterinary subjects).","Embodiments herein provide methods and tests for diagnosing and\/or monitoring a metabolic condition such as diabetes in a subject, wherein the methods and tests measure salivary glycoproteins. In various embodiments, the methods are based on the oxidation of glycoproteins in a sample from the subject, such as saliva or urine, for example using sodium metaperiodate, and then detecting the aldehydes generated during oxidation using a chemical detection method. In various embodiments, the method is based on the finding that the specific glycoproteins oxidized in the sample, primarily sialic acid and fucose, provide an accurate measure of glycemic control when compared to traditional monitoring tools such as HbA1c and fructosamine.","This finding is unexpected because previous studies with lectin binding demonstrated that a five-member panel of lectins (e.g., lectin, Concanavalin A, agglutinin, lectin, and lectin) was needed for the most accurate prediction of glycemic status. These lectins bind to sialic acid and fucose, but also mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine. By contrast, the methods disclosed herein only require detection of the oxidation products of sialic acid and fucose. An additional advantage of the method is that as a purely chemical detection method, it does not rely on lectins or antibodies to bind carbohydrate moieties present on glycoproteins.","HbA1c and fructosamine tests measure direct, non-enzymatic protein glycation. The presently disclosed methods instead measure proteins that are modified by intracellular glycosylation as opposed to non-enzymatic glycation, thus avoiding the problems associated with glycation-based tests. Hyperglycemia increases the flux of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which provides the UDP-GlcNAc and GalNAc precursors for the addition of various carbohydrate moieties to proteins through both \u03b2-linked O-glycosylation of intracellular proteins as well as \u03b1-linked mucin-type O- and \u03b2-linked N-glycosylation of cell-surface and secreted proteins. O-glycosylation of intracellular proteins modulates the ability of various cells to respond to insulin, and without being bound by theory, the levels of secreted mucin-type O- and N-glycosylated proteins may reflect altered cellular metabolism due to hyperglycemia. Additionally, without being bound by theory, hyperlipidemia may regulate hexosamine biosynthetic pathway activity. Thus, the determination of glycoprotein levels in biological fluid represents a more rapid, sensitive, and inherently physiological response to metabolic control when compared to conventional glycated protein biomarkers.","While virtually all assessments of glycemic status currently employ blood samples, there are many instances in which this is not ideal, either because of patient age or attitude toward fingersticks or venipuncture, or hygiene issues in rural or underdeveloped areas. By contrast, saliva has a number of distinct advantages as a diagnostic fluid, including being non-invasive and being obtainable without special training or equipment, and it may be especially advantageous for pediatric or elderly populations and amenable to large-scale population studies. Thus, the methods disclosed herein employ salivary (and in some cases urinary) glycoprotein analysis for short-term assessment of glycemic control.","Also disclosed in various embodiments are plate assays, dipstick tests, and lateral flow devices for detecting salivary glycoproteins. In some embodiments, the tests may include a two-membrane dipstick test for detecting and\/or quantifying glycosylated salivary proteins in pre-oxidized saliva samples. Other embodiments are three-membrane lateral flow devices that oxidize the glycoproteins in a salivary sample and then detect the resulting aldehydes.","A total of ten subjects were recruited from a pool of 70 type-2 diabetes patients under care at Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India.

Subjects' course of treatment for diabetes was not altered based on CGM results. The average number of BG measures obtained during the study follow-up was 6909\u00b1436 (mean\u00b1SD) per subject. Subjects were asked not to eat or smoke for at least 8 hours prior to study visits occurring between 8 AM and 9 AM on 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days following the baseline visit. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected at every study visit and standard blood-draws were performed at baseline and at day 28. In addition, clinical parameters, including height, weight, and blood pressure, were obtained at baseline and at the final study visit.","Saliva samples were diluted 1:5 in 2% acetic acid, pH 4.5. Duplicate 50-\u03bcL aliquots of diluted sample were added per well of a 96-well Reacti-Bind polystyrene plate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) followed by 25 \u03bcL of 10 mM sodium metaperiodate (made immediately before use in 2% acetic acid, pH 4.5). The plate was agitated on a rotary shaker for 30 seconds and then covered and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, 150 \u03bcl of AHMT solution (175 mg 4-Amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole in 35 ml 1N NaOH; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was added. The plate was agitated on a rotary shaker for 30 seconds, then covered and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The absorbance at 550 nm was determined using an ELx800 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, Vt.). Results were normalized by total protein concentration and reported in arbitrary units (AU). Blood samples were processed using an AU400e chemical analyzer (Olympus, Center Valley, Pa.) for fructosamine quantification and an HLC-723 G8 high-performance liquid chromatograph (Tosoh Bioscience, King of Prussia, Pa.) for HbA1c measurements.","Baseline characteristics of the subject population were tabulated as well as the 28-day change in relevant clinical parameters. One subject was missing CGM data for days 20-28 and was excluded from all CGM analyses for those days. To quantify glycemic control from the CGM data, average BG, standard deviation (SD) of BG, and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE; 30) were calculated and matched to 7, 14, 21, and 28-day study visits. Due to the small sample size, analyses were primarily descriptive and included plots of salivary glycosylation measures across time with HbA1c, fructosamine, average BG, BG SD, and average MAGE. Pearson's correlation coefficients were computed and plotted for all measures at baseline and days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28. An exploratory longitudinal, repeated-measures analysis was conducted to assess the ability of measured salivary glycosylation to predict average BG, BG SD, and MAGE at 7, 14, 21, and 28-day intervals and to determine the interval for which salivary glycosylation is most predictive. A secondary analysis on the effect of blood glucose variability on the relationship between average BG with fructosamine and salivary glycosylation was conducted by creating groups of high and low BG variability (according to BG SD) and correlating average BG with fructosamine and salivary glycosylation separately for each variability group. To maximize the difference in variability between the groups, the high and low BG variability groups included four subjects with the highest and lowest variability, respectively. Reported p values are two-sided. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software, Version 9.3 of the SAS System for Windows.","An analysis of salivary glycosylation was undertaken using the methods described above in Examples 1-4 in a series of 10 subjects with type-2 diabetes who had undergone 28 days of CGM in order to ascertain if salivary glycoprotein levels were correlated with relative glycemia. As shown in , baseline salivary glycosylation measures were strongly correlated with baseline fructosamine values (; r=0.65, p=0.06), and moderately correlated with HbA1c (; r=0.30, p=0.40).

For subjects in the low-variability group, fructosamine was a strong predictor (r=0.98) of average blood glucose; however, for the high-variability group, increases in fructosamine strongly predicted decreases in average BG, directly opposite of what would be clinically expected.

Glycemic variability has emerged as a potentially important aspect of monitoring glycemic control that may be more associated with the development of complications such as cardiovascular disease than average BG levels. Although the clinical utility of assessing glycemic variability in routine screening or monitoring remains controversial, the effect of glycemic variability on the performance of assays for average BG is important, as discussed below. The existing assays for long and short-term average glycemia have several disadvantages, notably the inability of HbA1c to reflect intrinsic variability in glucose levels in individual patients and discrepancies in the average glucose levels derived from different measurements (the so-called glycation gap).","Described herein is an alternative parameter of glycemia (total protein glycosylation) that is driven by cellular metabolism and that is discernible in saliva. Specifically, baseline salivary glycosylation measures are strongly correlated with fructosamine (r=0.65), a measure of 2 to 4-week glycemic control. Additionally, compared to HbA1c and fructosamine, salivary glycosylation measures were better predictors of average BG and SD BG over a 21-day interval. Furthermore, salivary glycosylation measures exhibited a stronger correlation with measures of glycemic control than fructosamine or HbA1c, and in terms of predicting hyperglycemia, the accuracy of fructosamine was affected by BG variability, while the accuracy of salivary glycosylation was not.","Thus, salivary glycosylation is a powerful alternative biomarker for recent hyperglycemia, as it has better ability to predict 21-day blood glucose measures than HbA1c or fructosamine. Additionally, the ability to use saliva rather than blood constitutes a separate, significant advantage for salivary glycosylation. An important use for a non-invasive indicator of short-term glycemia would be to allow patients on therapy to more conveniently monitor their glycemic control. This may increase the currently low rate of adherence to diabetes medications, an increase in which would have the potential for significant healthcare cost savings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"]},"In one specific, non-limiting example, the plate assay may be carried out as follows:","1.
