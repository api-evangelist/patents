{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to social graphs.","A social-networking system, such as a social-networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. The social-networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interests. The social-networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users in the social-networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, event organization, messaging, games, or advertisements) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social-networking system. The social-networking system may transmit contents and messages related to its services to a user's client device over a network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","101","101","101","120","120","122","120","122","121","121","122","122","122","122","120"]},"In particular embodiments, users of a social-networking system may access other websites or third-party websites (e.g., ESPN.com, www.youtube.com). As an example and not by way of limitation, a user using client device  may connect to and communicate with third-party website  through network cloud . Third-party website  may comprise web server  operatively connected to one or more data stores  storing user data and webpage information. User data may include, for example, user name, user profile picture, and user profile information (e.g., location, affiliation, interest). Webpage information may include, for example, page-layout information, scripts, webpage content such as text (e.g., ASCII or HTML), media data (e.g., graphics, photos, video clips), and executable code objects (e.g., a game executable within a browser window or frame). In particular embodiments, a user may use a web browser or special-purpose client application hosted on client device  to access their party website  by sending an HTTP request to web server , causing web server  to access the one or more data stores  and construct one or more webpages or frames displayed in the web browser or the special-purpose client application.","A social-networking system may communicate and access third-party website , and vise versa, through network cloud . As an example and not by way of limitation, a webpage constructed by third-party website  for a user of a social-networking system may contain information from the social-networking system, such as a frame displaying profile pictures of the user's first-degree friends who are currently active on third-party website . As an example and not by way of limitation, a user's user-profile page of a social-networking system may contain an embedded video clip that the user posted on third-party website . In particular embodiments, a webpage constructed by a first website may include one or more inline references that cause the client device  to access and display content from a second website by incorporating in the webpage's HTML document Uniform Resource Locations (URLs) and\/or script code (e.g., JavaScript, PHP, AJAX) that causes a client application hosted on the client device  to access the second website to dynamically provide content specified by the script code (e.g., profile pictures). In particular embodiments, a browser cookie installed by a second website on client device  may be used to facilitate accessing the second website. As an example and not by way of limitation, requests transmitted to the social-networking system for a particular user may include a browser cookie or other token to enable authentication and access to the social-networking system for the particular user (such as, for example, to access and display profile pictures of the particular user's first-degree friends), without the particular user having to manually enter user identification (ID) and password information of the social-networking system.","A social-networking system may store records of users and relationships between users in one or more social graphs.  illustrates an example social graph . In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may store social graph  in data stores . In particular embodiments, social graph  may comprise a plurality of user nodes , a plurality of location nodes , and a plurality of edges  between nodes.","In particular embodiments, each user node  may correspond to a user of the social-networking system. As an example and not by way of limitation, when a user registers for an account with the social-networking system, the social-networking system may create a user node  corresponding to the user, and store the user node  in one or more data stores . In particular embodiments, the user node  may comprise information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social-networking system. As an example and not by way of limitation, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date, gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, or other demographical information to be included in the user node . In particular embodiments, each user node  may comprise one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments, each user node  may correspond to one or more webpages or one or more user profile pages. As an example and not by way of limitation, in response to a request including a user identifier of a particular user, system front end  may access a corresponding user node based on the user identifier, and construct a user-profile page comprising a name, a profile picture, and interests of the particular user.","In particular embodiments, each location node  may correspond to a location. As an example and not by way of limitation, a location may correspond to a real-world entity, such as a movie theater, a restaurant, a landmark, a city, or another suitable place. An administrative user of a location (such as, for example, the owner\/proprietor of the location) may create a location nodes by providing information of the location (e.g., by filling out an online form), causing the social-networking system to create a corresponding location node, and store the location node in one or more of data stores . A location node  may comprise information of a location provided by an administrative user of the location and information gathered by various systems, including the social-networking system. As an example and not by way of limitation, information of a location may include as a name or a title, one or more images (e.g., an image of cover page of a book), a location (e.g., an address, a geographical location), a website (e.g., an URL address), contact information (e.g., a phone number, an email address), a location capacity, operating hours, other suitable location information, or any combination of such information. In particular embodiments, each location node  may comprise one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with the location node . In particular embodiments, each location node  may correspond to a webpage. As an example and not by way of limitation, in response to a request including a name (or an URL address), system front end  may access a corresponding location node (stored in one or more of data stores ) based on the name, and construct a webpage comprising the name, one or more images, and contact information of the location.","In particular embodiments, an edge  connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments, each edge  may comprise one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may indicate that a second user is a \u201cfriend\u201d of the first user. In response to this indication, the social-networking system may transmit a \u201cfriend request\u201d to the second user. If the second user confirms the \u201cfriend request,\u201d the social-networking system may create an edge connecting the first user and the second user in social graph , and store the edge in one or more of data stores . In the example of , social graph  includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user \u201cA\u201d and user \u201cB\u201d, and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user \u201cC\u201d and user \u201cB.\u201d Although this disclosure describes and  illustrates edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes, this disclosure contemplates edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge may represent a friendship, a business relationship, a fan relationship, a follower relationship, a visitor relationship, a subscriber relationship, a superior\/subordinate relationship, a reciprocal relationship, a non-reciprocal relationship, another suitable type of relationship, or two or more such relationships.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may create an edge between a user node and a location node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may construct a webpage  corresponding to the location node for the \u201cOld Pro,\u201d a sports bar in Palo Alto, California, as illustrated in . The webpage  may include a selectable \u201cLike\u201d icon . A user viewing the webpage  (such as, for example, by using a web browser or a special-purpose application hosted by the user's client device ) may indicate that he likes the location represented by the location node by selecting \u201cLike\u201d icon  (such as, for example, by clicking on the icon), which may cause client device  to transmit to the social-networking system a message indicating the user's liking of the sports bar. In response to the message, the social-networking system may create an edge between the user and the location node, as illustrated by the \u201clike\u201d edge  between the user node of user \u201cB\u201d and the location node of sports bar \u201cOld Pro\u201d in . In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may store the edge in one or more of data stores . Although this disclosure describes forming edges in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates forming edges in any suitable manner. As an example and not by way of limitation, rather than visiting webpage  and clicking an icon, a user may use a mobile application or another suitable application that is operable to form an edge between the user's user node and a location node. Moreover, although this disclosure describes particular types of edges, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of edges.","Social graph  may comprise other types of edges between a user node and a location node. In particular embodiments, an edge between a user node and a location node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user of the user node toward a location of the location node. As an example and not by way of limitation, in addition to a user (user \u201cB\u201d) liking a sports bar (\u201cOld Pro\u201d), a user (user \u201cB\u201d) may check-in to a place (\u201cUnion Square\u201d), as illustrated in . The webpage  corresponding to a location node may include, for example, a selectable \u201ccheck in\u201d icon  or a selectable \u201cadd to favorites\u201d icon . Similarly, by clicking on these icons, the social-networking system may create a \u201cfavorite\u201d edge or a \u201ccheck in\u201d edge (as illustrated in ) in response to a user's action corresponding to a respective action. Although this disclosure describes edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and location nodes, this disclosure contemplates edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and location nodes. Moreover, although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a location node representing a single relationship, this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a location node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation, an edge may represent both that a user likes and has checked in at a particular location. Alternatively, a separate edge could be generated to represent each type of relationship (or multiples of a single relationship) between a user node and a location node.","In particular embodiments, social graph  may be used to determine which locations (corresponding to particular location nodes) are relevant to particular users (corresponding to particular user nodes). Location nodes that are connected to a particular user node, either directly by an edge or via one or more nodes, may be considered relevant to the user node. As an example and not by way of limitation, a location node directly connected by an edge to a first user node may be considered relevant to the first user node. As another example and not by way of limitation, a location node connected to second user node may be considered relevant to a first user node if the second user node is an Nth-degree friend of the first user node. Furthermore, in particular embodiments, the closer a second user node is to the first user node, the more relevant the location nodes connected to the second node may be considered to the first user node. That is, the fewer edges separating the first user node from a particular location node, the more relevant that location node may be considered to the first user node. As an example and not by way of limitation, as illustrated in , the location node \u201cUnion Square\u201d is directly connected to the user node for User \u201cB,\u201d and thus the location \u201cUnion Square\u201d may be considered relevant to User \u201cB.\u201d As another example and not by way of limitation, the location node \u201cPhilz Coffee\u201d is connected to the user node for User \u201cB\u201d via the intermediated user node for User \u201cC,\u201d and thus the location \u201cPhilz Coffee\u201d may be considered relevant to User \u201cB,\u201d but because the location node is not directly connected to the user node for User \u201cB,\u201d it may be considered less relevant than a location node that is directly connected to the user node for User \u201cB.\u201d As yet another example and not by way of limitation, the location node for \u201cCafe Venetia\u201d is not connected to the user node for User \u201cB\u201d by any pathway in social graph , and thus the location \u201cCafe Venetia\u201d may not be considered relevant to User \u201cB.\u201d Although this disclosure describes determining whether particular location nodes are relevant to particular user nodes in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates determining whether any suitable location nodes are relevant to any suitable user nodes in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, a particular location may correspond to one or more location nodes . A social graph may comprise a plurality of location nodes corresponding to a same location (e.g., a same real-world entity). That is, each location node of the several location nodes may correspond to a different webpage that is about the same location. As an example and not by way of limitation, a popular restaurant may have several webpages, such as, for example, a \u201cfan page,\u201d an \u201cofficial page,\u201d or a \u201creview page,\u201d authored by various users.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may identify a set of location nodes based on a search query.  illustrates an example webpage with a list of location nodes. In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may then identify one or more location nodes that substantially match the search query with respect to one or more of their attributes. As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may receive a search query of \u201cPalo Alto\u201d and \u201cCoffee Shop,\u201d which may be entered by a user into search query fields  and , respectively. Although fields  and  are illustrated in  and described as particular types of search query fields, this disclosure contemplates any suitable search query fields. The social-networking system may then analyze the location nodes in the social graph  to identify one or more location nodes that substantially match the search query. As an example and not by way of limitation, when identifying location nodes that substantially match the search query, the social-networking system may analyze, for example, information associated with the location node (e.g., geographic location, contact information, location capacity, operating hours, etc.), information associated with the social graph (e.g., the number and type of nodes connected to the location node), other suitable information, or any combination of such information. The social-networking system may then transmit the search results to the user who generated the search query. The search results may be displayed to the user, for example, on a webpage such as that displayed in . The particular search results for the search query of \u201cPalo Alto\u201d and \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d are displayed in field , which include coffee shops, cafes, a restaurant, and a local business. These search results may also display social-graph information associated with each location node. As an example and not by way of limitation, the search results may display the number and type of edges connected to each location node, such as, for example, the number of \u201cfriend\u201d edges, \u201ccheck in\u201d edges, or \u201clike\u201d edges. Although this disclosure describes identifying particular location nodes based on particular search queries, this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable location nodes based on any suitable search queries. Moreover, although this disclosure describes particular types of search queries, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of search queries. Furthermore, although this disclosure describes conducting search queries in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates conducting search queries in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for one or more location nodes based on edges connected to the location node. The social-networking system may determine values for the location nodes identified based on a search query, as described above. The determined value for a location node may be based on a variety of factors, such as, for example, the number of edges connected to the location node, the type of edges connected to the location node, whether the location node and the first user are connected by an edge, whether the location node and user nodes of friends of the first user (or user nodes within a threshold degree of separation of the first user) are connected by edges, when the edges connected to the location node were created, the time of day and the operating hours of the location corresponding to the location node, other suitable information, or any combination of such information. The determined value may be any suitable value on any suitable scale. For illustration purposes, this disclosure discusses values in generic \u201cunit\u201d terms (e.g., 1.0 units, 2.4 units, etc.), this disclosure contemplates values with any suitable type of units. Moreover, for illustration purposes, this disclosure discusses values for location nodes such that larger values are considered more relevant, such as, for example, when ranking search results for display. Although this disclosure describes determining values for particular location nodes, this disclosure contemplates determining values for any suitable location node. Moreover, although this disclosure describes determining particular values for location nodes, this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable values for location nodes. Furthermore, although this disclosure describes determining a value for a location node based on edge connections in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates determining a value for a location node based on edge connections in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on the social relevancy of the location node to a first user. A location node that is directly connected to a first user, or connected to friends of the first user, may be considered socially relevant to the first user. A location node that is connected to a more distant friend of the first user (e.g., 2nd-degree friends, 3rd-degree friends, and so on) may be considered less socially relevant to the first user. Finally, a location node that is not connected to the first user node by any path in the social graph may be considered minimally or not socially relevant to the first user. In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may identify a set of edges between a location node and a first user node and then determine a value for the node based on the set of edges. Location nodes that are directly connected to the first user node may be valued more highly than location nodes that are not connected to the first user node. As an example and not by way of limitation, referencing , if User \u201cF\u201d is searching for \u201cCoffee Shops,\u201d the location node for \u201cCafe Venetia\u201d may be given a value of 1.0 units because it is directly connected to the user node for User \u201cF,\u201d while the location node for \u201cPhilz Coffee\u201d may be given a value of zero because it is not connected to the user node for User \u201cF.\u201d In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may identify a set of edges between a location node and one or more second user nodes and then determine a value for the node based on the set of edges. Location nodes with more edges, regardless of which user nodes they are connected to (e.g., the first user, friends of the first user, or other miscellaneous users), may be valued more highly than location nodes with fewer edges. As an example and not by way of limitation, referencing , if User \u201cB\u201d is searching for \u201cCoffee Shops,\u201d the location nodes for \u201cCafe Venetia,\u201d \u201cCoupa Cafe,\u201d and \u201cPhilz Coffee\u201d may be valued highly (and thus ranked highly in the search results in field ) because each location node has over 1000 \u201cchecked in\u201d edges and several hundred \u201clike\u201d edges. In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on a number of edges between the location node and one or more first user's social contacts. That is, the social-networking system may look at how user nodes within the social graph of a first user are connected to a particular location node, for example, by looking at the number and type of edges connecting a user's friends to the particular location node. As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may determine a value of 2.0 units for a location node directly connected by an edge to the first user, a value of 1.0 units for a location node if the location node has 10 or more edges connecting it to st-degree friends of the first user (i.e., user nodes directly connected by an edge to the first user), a value of 0.7 units if the location node has  or more edges connecting it to 2nd-degree friends of the first user, and so on. These values may be cumulative, such that a location node with 10 or more 1st-degree edges and 10 or more 2nd-degree edges would have a value of 1.7 units. In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may only value edges from user nodes that are within a threshold degree of separation of the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation, if the threshold degree of separation is one degree, the social-networking system may determine a value of 1.0 units for a location node if the location node has 10 or more edges connecting it to 1lst-degree friends of the first user and a value of zero for a location node with edges from 2nd-degree and higher friends of the first user. In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on the types of edges connecting the location node to a user's friends. Edges with particular attributes may be given more value than other types of edges. As an example and not by way of limitation, for a location node associated with the location \u201cPhilz Coffee,\u201d the social-networking system may give more weighting to edges of \u201clike\u201d than edges of \u201cchecked in.\u201d While counting a number of edges between a location node and user nodes that are friends of a first user, the social-networking system may determine a value for a \u201clike\u201d edge as 2.0 units, while determining a value for a \u201cchecked in\u201d edge as 1.2 units. Although this disclosure describes determining values for location nodes based on social relevancy in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates determining values for location nodes based on social relevancy in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on the based on the number and types of edges connected to the location node. A particular location node may be connected to one or more other nodes by one or more edges, and each edge may have particular attributes. In particular embodiments, the social-networking may determine a value for a location node based on the number of edges connected to the location node. Location nodes may be connected to other nodes by one or more edges, and the number of edges connected to a location node may be considered when determining a value for the location node. That is, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on a level of engagement by users, as measured by a number of edges (i.e., actions) between the location node and user nodes. Location nodes with more edges may be given a greater value. As an example and not by way of limitation, a location node with 50 edges may be given a value of 5.0 units, while a location node with 30 edges may be given a value of 2.4 units. As another example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may assign a score of 1.0 units to a location node if the location node has more than 100 edges connecting to user nodes, a score of 0.7 units if the location node has more than 50 edges connecting to user nodes, or a score of 0.5 units if the location node has 50 edges or less connecting to user nodes. In particular embodiments, the value given based on the number of edges may be normalized. As an example and not by way of limitation, the value for a location node may be normalized based on capacity of the location associated with the location node. For example, a first location node with 100 edges and a capacity of 100 people may be given the same value as a second location node with 10 edges and a capacity of 10 people. In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on the attributes of the edges connected to the location node. As discussed above, edges may have various attributes, and edges with particular attributes may be given more value than other types of edges. The social-networking system may identify the edges connected to a particular location node and the attributes of those edges and then determine a value based on the attributes of the edges. As an example and not by way of limitation, for a location node associated with the location \u201cUnion Square,\u201d the social-networking system may give more weighting to edges of \u201cchecked in\u201d than edges of \u201clike.\u201d While counting a number of edges between a location node and user nodes, the social-networking system may determine a value for a \u201cchecked in\u201d edge as 1.5 units, while determining a value for a \u201clike\u201d edge as 1.0 units. Although this disclosure describes determine values for a location node based on edge information in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates determining values for a location nodes based on edge information in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on advertising sponsorship associated with the location node. An advertiser (such as, for example, the owner or propriety of a location corresponding to a location node) may sponsor a particular location node such that the location node is given a higher value and\/or ranked better by the social networking system. As an example and not by way of limitation, a location node with advertising sponsorship may automatically be given a value to ensure that it is transmitted or displayed to a user (such as, for example, being on the first page of search results, or near the top of search results). As another example and not by way of limitation, a first location node and a second location node may be given the same value based on edges connected to the location node alone, but if the value is further determined based on advertising sponsorship, whichever node has advertising sponsorship may be given an increased value, thus allowing it to be ranked higher. Although this disclosure describes determining a value for a location node based on advertising sponsorship in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates determining a value for a location node based on advertising sponsorship in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on time stamps associated with the edges connected to the location node. Edges that were generated more recently may be weighted more heavily when determining a value than edges that were generated in the past. As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may assign a score of 1.0 to a location node if 100 edges were connected to that location node in the past week, while the social-networking system may assign a score of 0.5 to a location node if 100 edges were connected to that location node in the past month. As another example and not by way of limitation, a location node may be given a score of 1.0 for having 1000 edges connected to it in the past week, a score of 0.8 for having 1000 edges connected to it in the past two weeks, a score of 0.6 for having 1000 edges connected to it in the past month, and so on. Although this disclosure describes determining a value for a location node based on time stamps associated with edges in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplated determining a value for a location node based on time stamps associated with edges in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on the operating hours for the location corresponding to the location node. The social-networking system may analyze whether a location corresponding to the location node is currently open, will be open at a particular time (such as, for example, based on particular search criteria), or closed, by referencing any operating hours information available (such as, for example, from location information associated with the location node). As an example and not by way of limitation, a location node for a location that is currently open may be given a greater value than a location node for a location that is currently closed. As another example and not by way of limitation, if a first user is searching on a Friday for a location that is open on Sunday, the social-networking system may increase the value for all location nodes with operating hours indicating the locations corresponding to nodes are open on Sunday while decreasing the value for all location nodes that are not open on Sunday. Although this disclosure describes determining a value for a location node based on operating hours in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates determining a value for a location node based on operating hours in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on traffic data of the location node's corresponding webpage. As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may detect a visit to a location node's corresponding webpage, such as the webpage illustrated in , when the social-networking system receives a request to serve the corresponding webpage. As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may detect a visit to a location node's corresponding webpage when the social-networking system receives a request to serve content of a selectable icon incorporated in the location node's corresponding webpage. The social-networking system may accumulate and store in one or more of data stores  a number of visits to a webpage corresponding to a location node. The social-networking system may access one or more of data stores  for a number of visits for each of the second location nodes, and assign a score to each of the second location nodes based on the numbers of visits. As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may assign a score of 1.0 units to a location node if the location node's corresponding webpage has been visited for over 10,000 times, a score of 0.8 if the corresponding webpage has been visited for over 5,000 times, a score of 0.6 if the corresponding webpage has been visited for over 1,000 times, or a score of 0.4 if the corresponding webpage has been visited for 1,000 times or less. Although this disclosure describes determining a value for a location node based on traffic data in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates determining a value for a location node based on traffic data in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may determine a value for a location node based on one or more factors, as described above, including social-graph information, user information, location information, etc. These determined values may be cumulative with each other. The determined value for each factor may be additive, multiplicative, etc., with determined values for other factors. As an example and not by way of limitation, a social-networking system may give a value of 1.0 to a location node having 10 or more edges connected to it, and may give a value of 0.8 to a location node corresponding to a location that is currently open.

As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may rank higher-valued nodes higher than lower-valued nodes, such that the node with the highest value is ranked first, and so on. In particular embodiments, the social-networking system may transmit information of a particular set of location nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may present to the first user information of the location nodes with a respective score greater than a pre-determined value (e.g., 0.5). As another example and not by way of limitation, the social-networking system may rank the location nodes based on respective scores, and present to the first user information of top-ranked location nodes (e.g., top 9). Information of particular location nodes presented to the first user may comprise one or more images and website names of the particular location nodes. Information of particular location nodes presented to the first user may also comprise user profile pictures of the first user's social contacts whose corresponding user nodes having one or more edges (e.g., \u201clike,\u201d \u201ccheck in,\u201d etc.) connected to one or more of the location nodes. Information of the particular location nodes presented to the first user may be included in the webpage corresponding to the first location node.  illustrates an example webpage with a list of location nodes in field  that are ranked based on their determined value.
